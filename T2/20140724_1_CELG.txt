Robert J. Hugin
Thanks Patrick, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to update you on the
excellent results of the quarter and the significant progress achieved advancing strategic corporate initiatives.
Operational excellence is the foundation of our business model. Outstanding results produce the resources that allow us
to invest in the discovery and development of tomorrow's transformational therapies, and our teams across the globe
are delivering. Our businesses across functions and geographies have outstanding momentum. The strong revenue and
earnings growth reported this morning reflect the excellent operating performance of our teams. Increased REVLIMID
duration of therapy and accelerating global launches of pomalidomide and ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer fueled
substantial volume and revenue growth. This strong performance supports raising our full-year financial guidance.
Jackie and Mark will discuss the results and our outlook in greater depth in a few minutes.
Capturing the full value of our franchise is a highest order corporate priority. We're making exceptional progress in
building for the future. During the quarter, we strengthened our hematology product portfolio with important new
clinical data in MDS, AML and mantle cell lymphoma. The future of our hematology franchise was further enhanced
through meaningful progress on strategic collaborations including ACE-011 and ACE-536 and beta-thalassemia, and
exciting data in targeted relapsed refractory AML with AG-221. We're aggressively moving these programs forward
with our partners, Acceleron and Agios.
During the first half of the year, our oncology programs were advanced by the initiation of Phase III studies testing
ABRAXANE as an adjuvant treatment in patients with surgically resected pancreatic cancer, and as maintenance
therapy in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In the second half of the year, collaborations are
positioned to evaluate ABRAXANE, REVLIMID, CC-486 and other pipeline assets in combination regimens with
emerging immuno-oncology therapies. Mark will outline some of the key studies that are accelerating our impact in the
hematology oncology field. Over the next few quarters, we expect significant increased visibility on our next
generation of registration track studies.
Building a market-leading inflammation and immunology franchise is also a key corporate initiative. Our U.S. team
launched OTEZLA for psoriatic arthritis in April and are making outstanding progress in building the foundation of a
first-class launch. Scott will detail many of the metrics that give us the confidence that our team is fully capitalizing on
the opportunity of building a new market for this innovative oral compound. We look forward to launching the
psoriasis indication later this quarter following FDA action. We could not be more excited about the progress and
potential of OTEZLA.
Expanding and accelerating the development of our pipeline is essential to sustaining long-term growth. We're making
outstanding progress in building and advancing one of the highest potential pipelines in the industry. During the quarter
we expanded our late stage pipeline with the acquisition of GED-0301, a potentially transformational product for the
treatment of Crohn's disease. Scott will outline the significant second half milestones in this promising program.
We also accelerated our internal early and mid-stage research programs. Among the four novel development candidates
named last year, we expect to advance at least two to IND by year end, including our novel anti-CD47 antibody from
Inhibrx targeting innate immunity. Our CC-122 IMiD program is advancing in novel combination trials in CLL and
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, showing activity in settings of high unmet medical need. And we're also initiating

clinical programs with our next generation JNK inhibitor in fibrotic disease, and in scleroderma with our I&I IMiD,
CC-220. And our research teams have identified novel biologic targets providing new insights that advance our existing
and emerging programs in protein homeostasis.
Dynamic companies proactively evolve to best capitalize on market opportunities and to maximize the potential of their
assets. During the quarter, we announced organizational changes designed to position us for maximum success in the
years ahead. These changes provide Mark and Jackie, outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have any even greater
impact on our organization. In Mark's new role as President and Chief Operating Officer, he will work with our
franchise leaders to drive operational excellence across our functions and franchises. Jackie was promoted to President
Hematology/Oncology to leverage her strong leadership, outstanding business expertise and strategic perspective. We
also significantly enhanced our leadership team with the addition of Peter Kellogg. Peter is now on board and is in fact
in the room with us today and will become our Chief Financial Officer on August 1. Peter brings a wealth of industry
knowledge and expertise to our leadership team. Welcome, Peter.
The energy generated by these leadership changes is already positively impacting the organization. This morning we
announced another important leadership addition with Dr. Rob Hershberg joining Tom Daniel's team to lead our
immuno-oncology research and early development initiatives and to establish our Immuno-oncology Center of
Excellence in Seattle, Washington. Dr. Hershberg joins us from one of our collaboration partners, VentiRx, where he
serves as CEO. We welcome Rob to the Celgene team.
Midway through the year we've achieved a number of important objectives. Our exceptional operating momentum has
us well positioned to deliver on key milestones in the second half of the year. It's a very exciting time at Celgene.
Let me now turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter call. We are extremely pleased
with our second quarter performance and the momentum we have in the business across all of our major drivers as we
move into the second half of the year. The underlying trends we built coming out Q1 drove our Q2 results and we feel
great about the start we see already for Q3. Our teams are delivering strong execution today while strategically we also
continue to add to our investments in the future. You saw examples of this in Q2 with our acquisition of GED-0301 and
our opt-in to the Agios AG-221 program.
Our total net product sales growth reached 18% and accelerated in Q2 for the year-over-year comparison versus the
prior two years. We are very close to reaching the $2 billion per quarter level for our global product sales and I look
forward to celebrating that milestone with you and our team. Of the 18% product sales growth, 14 percentage points, or
about 80%, was volume driven. Price in quarter contributed 3 percentage points. We expect the full-year global net
impact of price across our portfolio to be close to neutral.
Our P&L performance remains robust and adjusted earnings per share grew 18%, slightly faster than total revenue
growth of 17%. Our team produced earnings growth that exceeded revenue growth even while we invested in our
inflammation and immunology franchise and important launches across the hematology/oncology business and while
we absorbed the impact of generic azacitidine in the U.S.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.02 lower in the quarter than it otherwise would have been as a result of our $2.5
billion May bond offering and expensing the premium we paid on the addition equity stake we bought in Acceleron.
This 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share came entirely from operating income growth. The net impact of all
financial drivers together was neutral.
REVLIMID sequential growth in the U.S. in Q2 was impressive at 12%. The demand trends we saw at the end of Q1
produced the strong quarterly result. Growth and demand trends outside the U.S. were also very solid with about 2%
sequential growth in Europe off of a very strong Q1 for that region. And the rest of the world is in good shape, though
we saw some impact from distributor buying patterns in places like Latin America.

Branded VIDAZA's solid growth continues outside the U.S. at 6% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. The U.S.
continues to be impacted by the entry of generic azacitidine that began at the beginning of Q4 last year.
ABRAXANE's momentum is strong, fueled by the ongoing rollout of the pancreatic indication in the U.S., as well as
the launch of that indication in Europe. The product grew globally 17% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. The
product's performance in both lung and breast is also quite solid and contributing nicely to overall sales.
POMALYST/IMNOVID's growth trajectory has been and remains outstanding. The product delivered 19% sequential
and 143% year-over-year growth globally. The same positive drivers we saw with the U.S. launch are now playing out
across Europe and contributing to an excellent launch there.
As Scott will discuss in a moment, the commercial metrics we are seeing around OTEZLA's launch are very positive
and will drive strong growth in the second half of the year. Q2 revenues of $5 million reflect the impact of the sample
product in titration packs and additional non-revenue generating products from bridging packs provided to patients
while they waited for script authorizations to come through. We are highly confident in our forecast for OTEZLA sales
for the second half of this year and beyond.
Our P&L dynamic is excellent. Our revenue growth and attention to operational excellence drove our adjusted
operating profit margin to 50.3% for the quarter and 50.4% year-to-date. All key P&L line items are within our range
of expectations. SG&A expense year-to-date reflects the ongoing impact of investments in our I&I franchise, as well as
launched within the hematology/oncology global franchise. This number should trend downward as a percentage of
revenue over the second half of the year.
R&D expense year-to-date reflects the mix of a large portfolio of evolving clinical trials, some leverage of fixed costs
and the impact of our business development activities, including milestones that can be unpredictable quarter-to-quarter
and year-to-year.
Our cash from operations generation remains strong and growing, in line with our earnings growth. We continued our
share repurchase program in Q2, albeit at a slower rate than Q1, as we try to be opportunistic on the timing of our
purchases within our clear ongoing strategy for repurchases being our preferred way of returning funds to shareholders.
We further supported our capital structure management strategy with a $2.5 billion bond offering during Q2.
Our return on invested capital performance and trends are robust. We are focused on generating improved ROIC over
time while investing appropriately for the long-term health of the business. The way we have chosen to show ROIC on
this chart is conservative as the earnings base reflects U.S. GAAP earnings and we show you both gross ROIC
including cash balances which are now just over $6 billion, and net ROIC where the invested capital base excludes cash
and investments. As a reminder, the 2014 ROIC calculation is done on a trailing 12-month basis in this slide.
Completing our Q2 financial picture, I am pleased to update our guidance by raising product revenues to over $7.5
billion for the full year, up from a range of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion. We are also raising total revenues to
approximately $7.6 billion from $7.5 billion. We are raising the lower end of the REVLIMID sales guidance and
tightening the number to about $4.95 billion from a previous range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion.
The revenue increase drives an increase in our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a new and tighter range of $3.60
to $3.65 post the stock split. This EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted weighted average share count for the year of
$835 million. The other specifics of our guidance remain the same.
To summarize my last quarterly earnings call as Celgene's CFO, I'm extremely happy with and proud of the
performance and results that our teams around the world and across all functions have delivered in the past and this
quarter, and what I expect they will deliver in the future. We are strong across all of our major metrics and are investing
in the future in a way that is positioning us with a unique profile to generate strong top and bottom-line growth for a
very long time into the future. The best is yet to come.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Mark.

Mark J. Alles
Thanks, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. As you heard already from Bob and Jackie, our global commercial group
produced outstanding quarterly sales results and our clinical and regulatory teams made significant progress on a
number of high value development programs. Let me briefly share what we've achieved and where we are headed.
In the second quarter, hematology and oncology product sales growth was impressive. Sale were up 18% year-on-year
and 8% quarter-on-quarter to $1.84 billion. Driven by increased treatment duration and sustained leadership of the
global multiple myeloma market, REVLIMID continued to demonstrate very positive demand growth.
POMALYST/IMNOVID is rapidly becoming global standard of care for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma
who have received two prior lines of therapy. And ABRAXANE's second quarter results benefited from greater U.S.
demand in pancreatic cancer and lung cancer and the rapid and significant uptake for metastatic pancreatic cancer in
those European markets in which local reimbursement has been achieved.
During the second quarter, a total of more than 200 abstracts, posters and presentations featuring new and clinically
meaningful data were presented at ASCO, EHA and the ESMO 16th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer. This
concentration of clinical information provided additional evidence supporting our cornerstone therapies, REVLIMID,
POMALYST/IMNOVID and VIDAZA in hematological malignancies and ABRAXANE in pancreatic, breast and lung
cancers. Also during the quarter, we advanced key programs that could lead to one of our next new therapies in
hematology.
We are excited about the data from the ongoing Phase I study of AG-221, a small molecule oral inhibitor of the muted
form of IDH2 discovered by our partner Agios Pharmaceuticals that was presented at EHA. These results summarize
the activity and safety of AG-221 in 35 patients homogeneously defined with the IDH2 mutation-positive relapsed and
refractory AML. Treatment with AG-221 demonstrated a very high objective response rate with a very manageable
safety profile. Given these early but promising Phase I data, we exercised our option to an exclusive worldwide license
to AG-221 in June. This is now a high priority program and we are rapidly advancing plans to conduct global
registration trials.
Investigators at EHA also presented important and encouraging data from two Phase II trials of Sotatercept and
ACE-536 in patients with transfusion dependent and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia. In conjunction with
our partner Acceleron, we are on track to select one of these agents to enter a pivotal Phase III study in
beta-thalassemia by the end of this year.
I think we are just now beginning to realize the full clinical and commercial potential of REVLIMID. In the second
quarter, our global commercial teams generated record quarterly sales of $1.214 billion, growth of 15% year-on-year
and 6% quarter-on-quarter. And we are preparing for the future. We are making significant progress advancing our
global newly diagnosed multiple myeloma strategy. Our marketing application is under active review in Europe, and in
the U.S. the PDUFA date is February 22, 2015.
We now have the final positive results of two important REVLIMID randomized studies in MDS and mantle cell
lymphoma. Let me briefly review the top line results with you. As you know, MDS-005 is a randomized Phase III
study testing REVLIMID in patients with low risk red blood cell transfusion dependent, non-deletion 5q MDS. This
placebo-controlled study met its primary endpoint. REVLIMID demonstrated a statically significant improvement in
red blood cell transfusion in dependents. Treatment with REVLIMID was also generally well tolerated. These data
have the potential to establish the value proposition for REVLIMID in all classifications of transfusion dependent lower
risk MDS. We are preparing to review the MDS-005 study results with global regulatory authorities.
The MDS-005 results have the potential to further strengthen our leadership position in MDS and AML. As you know,
REVLIMID and VIDAZA are already established global standards of care for well identified subsets of patients with
MDS and AML. We are now seeing the encouraging but still emerging profile of AG-221 in AML. We intend to use
the results of VIDAZA Phase III AML-001 study to pursue regulatory Approval in AML for VIDAZA outside of the
United States and we are advancing two Phase III placebo-controlled studies evaluating CC-486 oral azacitidine in low
risk MDS and as maintenance therapy in AML. We believe that this important disease franchise is very well positioned

for significant future growth.
Beyond myeloma and MDS, we are working diligently to validate the potential for REVLIMID to become a standard
of care in lymphoma. We are pleased that patient enrollment is complete in the REMARK study of REVLIMID
maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. By the end of this year, we expect to complete
enrollment in the Phase III RELEVANCE study testing REVLIMID plus rituximab in first line follicular lymphoma.
Other important studies of REVLIMID in combination with rituximab, particularly a Phase III registration study in
patients with newly diagnosed activated B-cell type diffused large B-cell lymphoma will be initiated over the next
several months.
At the same time, we are preparing to engage with regulatory authorities to review the results of MCL-002. You will
recall that MCL-002 is a large randomized Phase II study testing REVLIMID in a broad population of patients with
relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Relative to an active control arm consisting of investigators' choice of
therapy, treatment with REVLIMID demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of
progression-free survival and the safety data were consistent with the known profile of REVLIMID in this population.
The global POMALYST/IMNOVID launch continues to exceed our expectations. Second quarter sales were $161
million, representing year-on-year growth of 143% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 19%. In the United States, sales
were up 17% quarter-on-quarter, driven by increasing duration gains and third line market share trending above 30%.
In Q2, international sales grew 21%, driven almost exclusively by Europe. The IMNOVID launch in Europe is now
supported by early access in Germany and the United Kingdom and positive reimbursement decisions and market
access in key countries including France and Spain. We expect sales to accelerate further as other major markets gain
reimbursement during the second half of 2014 and in 2015.
Turning to ABRAXANE. Year-on-year sales increased 39% to $215 million. In the United States, the ongoing launch
of ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer and steady growth in non-small cell lung cancer
combined to grow quarter-on-quarter sales 13%. Market share of metastatic pancreatic cancer is approaching 40%, and
we continue to expect peak share to reach approximately 55%. Led by Europe, quarter-on-quarter international sales of
ABRAXANE grew by 28%. We expect to receive additional reimbursement decisions in key markets including Spain
and Italy throughout the second half of this year and in 2015, and we continue to receive global marketing approvals.
The latest approval was in Canada just last week.
For more than 15 years, we have been focused on deeply understanding and modulating the immune system. This
expertise and the scientific advances we have made present Celgene with unique opportunities to develop new
immuno-oncology clinical development strategies. For example, REVLIMID is currently being studied for the
treatment of various hematological malignancies in combination with the anti-CS1 antibody elotuzumab, the anti-CD20
antibody rituximab, anti-CD38 antibodies and anti-PD1 antibodies. Each of these combinations represents the potential
to significantly improve disease outcomes and to achieve blockbuster commercial status.
Our internal and alliance-based research and development programs are advancing a number of innovative agents
targeting high unmet medical needs. Some of our top priorities include the development of the anti-DLL4 humanized
monoclonal antibody demcizumab in multiple solid tumors with our partner OncoMed, CC-122 and other next
generation small molecule immunomodulatory agents, our oral macrophage checkpoint inhibitor anti-CD47, AG-221
for AML, our CAR T program in selected malignancies with our partners Bluebird Bio and Baylor College of
Medicine. And there are many others. We think each of these early stage products has the potential to disrupt existing
treatment paradigms. At the same time, we are rapidly advancing multiple complementary and potentially synergistic
development strategies with our inline and pipeline agents in combination with the various T-cell checkpoint inhibitors.
Our second quarter results and the significant operating momentum generated by a number of high-value growth
drivers make us extremely confident in our outlook for the rest of 2014. The success of our ongoing global commercial
launches, the multiple catalysts for REVLIMID growth and the promise of our innovative pipeline make us equally
confident in our longer term outlook.
Thanks very much, and I'm pleased to welcome Scott Smith to the call.

Scott Smith
Thank you very much, Mark, and good morning to everybody on the call. Q2 was a transformational quarter for
Celgene I&I, highlighted by a series of major milestones including the encouraging commercial launch of OTEZLA for
the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in the United States, significant advancements in moving OTEZLA forward in a
number of important indications including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Behçet's disease, ulcerative colitis and possibly
AS, as well as the acquisition of potentially transformational assets for the treatment of Crohn's disease, GED-0301.
First, I would like to talk about the OTEZLA launch. Critical to any launch is the ability for patients to access
medication when prescribed. To date, our formulary coverage is better than expected with 80% of patients being able to
start OTEZLA without having to fail a biologic. Additionally, a number of plans are allowing access to OTEZLA
without requirement to fail methotrexate or other DMARDs during this early launch period. We are pleased with the
reception OTEZLA has received thus far within the payer community and we will work to continue to improve our
access footprint over the course of this year.
We are very encouraged by the launch trajectory of OTEZLA over the first 15 weeks. There are already over 4,000
patients on OTEZLA, and the IMS data shows the strongest initial prescription performance of any recent single
indication launch in this therapeutic space. Additionally, sales are accelerating and we expect revenues in July to meet
or exceed total revenues from Q2.
Initial sales force execution has been excellent. Over 8,000 unique physicians have received OTEZLA presentations
and to date over 1,000 physicians have prescribed OTEZLA with the majority of those prescribers generated multiple
prescriptions. OTEZLA brand recognition has jumped to 96% amongst dermatologists in just the first few months.
Looking specifically at the PsA market, based on syndicated market research of high prescribers completed in June,
OTEZLA tied Humira for the number one branded product for the new treatment starts in PSA, ahead of all other
brands after only three months. I believe this shows the potential of OTEZLA to transform the PsA treatment paradigm.
When we look at product switches within this category, OTEZLA was the number one product switched to when
patients are discounting current therapy. Being the number one in both new patient initiations and patient switches
bodes well for future growth.
And while we're pleased with the initial uptake trends for OTEZLA in PSA, we're also working diligently to prepare
for the anticipated launch of OTEZLA in psoriasis. The PDUFA date is September 23, but we will have the
dermatology sales force hired, trained and operational by August 1. We believe there's a tremendous opportunity for an
oral product with the profile we see from OTEZLA in this large, important and under-served market.
We will have lots of impactful data being presented at medical meetings in the second half of 2014. These data include
nine abstracts and two oral presentations of the ESTEEM psoriasis pivotal data, focusing mainly on the 52-week data at
EADV in October. EADV is the largest European dermatology meeting. We have submitted 19 abstracts to ACR, the
American College of Rheumatology meeting in November. These abstracts again focus on the longer-term data,
including a 104-week update of the PALACE-1 trial. We're very excited about the potential presentation of this
two-year data as we continue to see improvements in efficacy beyond the strong observed data seen previously at week
52, with no new safety findings during this period. It has also been confirmed that GED-0301 Phase II data will have an
oral presentation at the next major GI meeting, UEGW, in Vienna on October 21. Additionally we anticipate
publication of the Phase II data in a leading medical journal by the end of the year.
Q2 was a transformational quarter, full of significant milestones for Celgene I&I, and there will continue to be
important events and milestones throughout the remainder of 2014. The early launch metrics for OTEZLA were strong
with a solid base of access and demand being built. We are moving forward to expand the OTEZLA opportunity on
many fronts, including anticipated approvals in psoriasis in the U.S. and PsA and psoriasis in the EU in coming
months, and we are looking to expand our footprint into other geographies in 2015 and beyond. We are also actively
investigating OTEZLA in four other new indications. At the same time, we are expanding the overall footprint for the
I&I franchise with the acquisition of GED-0301 and the advancement of important molecules from the internal pipeline
focused on areas of high unmet medical need. These certainly are exciting times for Celgene I&I.

I'd like to turn the call back over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Scott. As I hope you can tell, we are extremely energized by the momentum generated in the first half of
the year and the prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond. We have significant milestones supporting key
corporate priorities over the coming months. We are committed to capitalizing on the progress achieved to date and
capturing the full potential of our extensive product portfolio and pipeline.
Thank you everyone for joining this morning, and Operator, we'll now open the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer of Piper Jaffray. Your line
is now open.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious, as you've given us guidance through 2017,
but beyond 2017, how do we think about which of these products, which of these indications, either from the currently
approved offering or those in the pipeline, are going to be the key drivers of growth towards the end of the decade?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Josh. It's Jackie. Thanks for the question. So I mean generally, and I think you've heard
us talk about this a little bit before, when we think about most of the contribution that could come to REVLIMID's
future growth from the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma indications or others beyond multiple myeloma particularly, all of
that growth would be coming beyond 2017. So as we have a little bit more visibility over time, to timelines to how
those trials are going, we've had a track record in the past of giving you updates on the long-term guidance, and when
we see inflection points in the business, so that's one area.
Obviously, the Crohn's asset that is now in the I&I portfolio is a product that has a significant revenue potential and
that would come into the mix after 2017 as well, and those are only two. Mark spoke in a fair amount of detail about all
of the things going on in the combined AML/MDS platform indications there, and that is a franchise within the
hematology franchise that has significant growth potential to go from the roughly $1 billion base that it has today,
growing nicely over the next few years, and then you get beyond 2017 and that one is even stronger as well.
So those are just a few things that I would highlight, and there's a lot of other things in the pipeline that would come in
as well. So again, I would say that as we have more visibility to those things, we will try to build those into a model
that we could talk about where it would be clear for investors in terms of how to evaluate the risk/reward profile of
those things in the model at their appropriate inflection points.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: I think just to add to that, I do think over the next few quarters, there we will be increasing
visibility to the late stage pipeline in terms of registration timelines and availability to patient time lines. And that
clarity over the next couple of quarters will give you and us the ability to really articulate more clearly what is the
incredible opportunity for us that we see say in 2020, et cetera.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much. And I appreciate you taking the question. Jackie, just a quick
question on AG-221 and GED-0301, could you clarify for us what payments were made during the quarter for those?
Or if not during the quarter, what future payments are due to be made and how they will be accounted for in your P&L

– and also in your ROIC calculation? Because they seem to be pretty big swing factors. And then could you also just
give us a little bit of an update on the REVLIMID duration trends in the U.S. and in Europe. Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So just with respect to the impact on the quarter from
those two things, for AG-221, there's nothing specifically associated with the opt-in on the program. Now that the
product comes into Celgene's hands, the development costs will start to shift to us as well. That's always been built into
the projections. This will happen with essentially all of our partnered projects as we take them on over time and that is
the case already for example with Acceleron, and some others we have cost sharing as well.
For the GED-0301 asset, we made the up-front payment of $710 million. That was a cash payment. The accounting for
that is purchase accounting, so acquisition accounting that you'll see highlighted in the 10-Q filing where we will have
amounts going into the in-process research and development, that then will be in the balance sheet and then some of the
contingent liabilities associated with the future milestones as well. So you will see all of those highlighted in the Q.
So with respect to the ROIC calculation, we like to show it on a U.S. GAAP basis, because that's the most conservative
way of showing it. And then those of you who want to think about different things in other ways, make adjustments if
you like. That's okay. So everything would be included in the earnings numbers that are assumed in that calculation.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: On duration, Geoff, hi. It's Mark.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Hi Mark.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Just a quick comment. Recall that we typically talk about the intent to treat to progression and
how we measure physicians' intent. Historically, that's been right about half of the market in U.S. and Europe that
prescribers said we will treat to progression in myeloma, MDS, et cetera. What we have seen in the last six months is a
very sharp increase in the proportion of physicians who say they want to and are treating to progression, which is a very
nice change after a pretty stable period. So we see that flowing through with accelerating duration now.
As you know, we don't comment specifically on what duration months are, but we have seen some acceleration
recently. I think that's going to continue in large part because when we get to ASH, and we get into the first half of next
year, as you know there are multiple Phase III read-outs with combination therapy from triplets with carfilzomib
Rev/Dex, especially elotuzumab Rev/Dex. And I think these will be additional sets of data supporting the
treat-to-progression paradigm and then a flow through to duration.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Right. Thanks very much, Mark and Jackie.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two pipeline ones from me. First on, I noticed on
slide 23 you highlighted a number of PD-1 combos that you are planning on running. Just wondering who you are
planning to partner with on those. And then on your CD38 program for multiple myeloma, I was wondering if it's
possible for you to narrow the lead maybe in any way that the competitors have over you guys here? Thank you.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. On the PD-1 side, I appreciate the question. We are very, very
collaborative across the landscape. A lot of interest is coming from the other companies with respect to different
combinations, different subsets of patients and the collaborations are extremely broad and I think compelling. So more
to come on that. But a very open, strong collaboration across the landscape.
With respect to CD38 in the myeloma space, the answer is yes. There are so many subsets, as you well know, of
multiple myeloma that are being defined and redefined. So the view we have is that as we advance our CD38 antibody,
MOR202, we should be able to find an appropriate category and subset of patients such that our ability to run research
in multiple myeloma would close gaps. And mostly it would be in a subset of patients to be defined.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya of Nomura. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Sure. Just a question maybe on 2015. You have highlighted many catalysts, upcoming
catalysts as they relate to REVLIMID, and I was just hoping to get your thoughts on how we should think about the, I
guess finally getting European approval for REVLIMID front line. And then beyond that, the potential impact of the
non 5q minus MDS data and the diffusion large B-cell lymphoma data.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Ian. Thanks for the question. So you see now the PDUFA date in the U.S. for the
newly diagnosed filing and things are moving along as we would have expected in Europe with that process. So we've
got those included in our model for 2015. Essentially in the U.S., assuming a launch that basically for all practical
purposes would start toward the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2. And then in Europe, we have assumed a Q2 approval,
and then obviously the normal process of going for the reimbursement country by country. So it will as with all things
in Europe, be a staggered situation there. So the contribution to growth really starts to kick in even more in 2016 and
2017, that we expect quite positive momentum for REVLIMID because of all of that in 2015. But that's just how we've
modeled it.
In terms of the non-del 5q, that's what you hear us express some excitement about. The potential there is that would
open REVLIMID up more broadly in that indication, and that and the other things that we see going on we think give
us reason to believe that MDS/AML together will grow significantly faster in the future than what we had built into the
base case scenario. So with that, I'll let Mark.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I agree with Jackie. Maybe, Ian, just to add a little bit of color. I think the expansion of
REVLIMID, assuming we get positive regulatory review of 05 and MCL-002 is incremental several hundred million
dollars. Now that said, we are evaluating the data. We're going through right now regulatory strategies and I think the
more important near-term view is this confidence that REVLIMID lenalidomide is not niched for example in the del 5q
subset. And in fact, when we can talk about what the MCL-002 data represent, recall these are active controls. So we
set up a market basket of drugs for the investigators to choose from in the study and we are quite, quite confident that
the single-agent profile of REVLIMID in lymphoma will get a boost because people will realize it was superior to
some very well-established salvage drugs in the treatment of lymphoma. So more to come, but there's a sort of am
early, mid, and later-stage view of how this would play out for our lymphoma franchise and then our MDS franchise,
so stay tuned.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Mark, I just wanted to – Mark, I was really hoping you'd comment on maybe the REMARK
study and how we should think about the impact of that study if it's positive.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Well this is your second question, so I guess I will comment anyway. No Ian, it's event driven.
So I think what I think about when we have positive data, and of course we intend for these results to be presented later
this year at ASH, we'll see but that's our intent. I think studies that are ongoing that are still accruing, we mentioned
RELEVANCE for example, this profile does help investigators realize there's a lot of value, and the studies should in
fact accrue faster. We should see some other effects of the positive profile. So I think all these things are
considerations, but remember on interim for any of our ongoing Phase III trials with REVLIMID, they're event-driven.
There is an interim analysis built into the stats plan, but unless or if we get those events, we don't know.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: But I do think it's very important to recognize that until we have the data, we have to be
conservative and cautious about estimating what we think the impact's going to be. On the other hand, should we get
positive data in REMARK or RELEVANCE, it is very, very different from the incremental data we have in MDS and
other things which are very important to us and give us great growth prospects. But this would really provide a
transformational boost to REVLIMID in the coming years if we were to get positive data [ph] tomorrow (44:54).
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Absolutely, and that peak is either early depending on the results earlier versus as Jackie talked
about on the previous question, our base case which has most of that improved outlook beyond 2017.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Jackie, is this your last CFO call? If so, I'm
getting kind of sentimental. I just wanted to ask about actually OTEZLA. So I know it's really early days of launch and
you said that 80% of current plans have no step edits through biologics. And how far along are you in the formulary
coverage conversations so we can put it into context? And have you had any discussions about step edits in place for
you ahead of biologics, and you still think that that's a 2015 event?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Robyn, I'll pass it over to Scott. I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes since it's my last as
call as a CFO. I'll be back.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: No, it may be her last call as CFO, but it won't be her last call, so you can still hold her
accountable right here.
<A - Scott Smith>: So I would say, proportion of discussions that we've had, probably 60% of the total plans but
representing more like 70% or 80% of the lives out there. As you can see from the footprint, a lot of those discussions
have been very positive. We're pleased with the access footprint we have. We are getting plans right now that are
adjudicating patients even without failing methotrexate and other DMARDs, so it's a very nice position for us to be in.
Preferred positions over biologics and things like that is something for the longer term. We're interested in making sure
we don't have a disadvantaged position when we come to market initially and that patients have what we would call
relatively open access to our drug. Generally, you see that. I think it's very positive when you see that 80% don't require
a step-through biologic because it doesn't emphasize that pre-biologic positioning and the fact that there's an
opportunity and need in that space.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: I think just as a company, our strategy, philosophy and principles working with insurance
companies that we do encourage access and to give the choice to physicians and patients as much as possible to make
the best choice for that patient. And so we do encourage that kind of transparency and openness and that's something
that I think is very important for all of us in the industry to ensure that we encourage all partners in the industry to
ensure that we provide that kind of open and access and let physicians and patients dictate what's best for the patient.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks so much. So Scott I got a – actually I'm sorry, it's for Mark. I have a question
about MDS-005. Is the data in line with the Phase II and the impact you think on ACE-536 about how you develop
ACE-536? And sort of related, Bob, it's really not related, but M&A question. I'm just trying to get a sense, I mean you
bought GED-5701 (sic) [GED-0301], exciting compound but obviously it's got some risk to it. You have plenty of cash
and you're strategically, you have a lot of early stuff. I'm just trying to get a sense of your appetite for late-stage
acquisitions. Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Want to go first? I'm sorry.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yaron, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. So recall that we're talking about segmentation of
MDS when we think about our assets. So of course REVLIMID approved for deletion 5q transfusion dependent
patients, a highly, highly well-identified patient population, but it's only about 6% of the overall treatable low risk MDS
population, maybe 10% if you think about the high end of the model. That said, the vast majority of patients we're
talking about cycle through transfusions and/or EPO as a way to deal with their bone marrow failure and chronic
anemia. So we think that this is a complementary approach where either ACE-011, ACE-536, to be determined, would

drop into all classifications of transfusion dependent MDS and that's for the future. So I think there is a
complementarity but there's certainly segmentation that would have to be thought of. For us it's pretty clear. The unmet
medical need of transfusion dependent and then EPO resistant or refractory patients is our target market for our
portfolio.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And just to go, Yaron, to the question on M&A. Certainly been an active and exciting time in
the industry and as people reposition their strategies. I think we feel first of all very comfortable with our strategy for
the long term, where we've been, where we are and where we're headed. Certainly the 0301 acquisition is in our mind a
very late-stage asset and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate, to answering the questions, to prove that
this is the kind of asset that is going to transform the treatment of Crohn's. So we look at that as a very important part of
addition as a late-stage asset. And I do think over the coming quarters, there will clearly be much more increased
visibility on what the next phase, group of Phase III registration track studies so there's clarity into the growth
trajectory of the company.
That being said, our business model has always been designed as one to have tremendous leverage capabilities both
from a cash flow point of view, an operational leverage point of view, a financial leverage point of view. So adding
late-stage assets or approved assets does give leverage to the model. But we don't see a need to change our strategy in
any way, shape, or form. We're very comfortable with where we are. We think we have an incredibly exciting, high
promising pipeline. If something opportunistic were to come along, we would certainly be assertive and aggressive and
go for it, but that's not something we're out there thinking we need to do. So really no change at all. We keep a close
eye on what's happening. We feel very good about the future, where we are today. And we want that strategic, financial
and operating flexibility so that if something does come along, we'll be ready to go. But again no change to our strategy
as we see the future.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for the question. Got a couple I&I
questions for Scott. Now that you closed the 0301 deal, just want to get your sense of the size and scope of the Phase III
and if there are any gating factors to start? And then on OTEZLA, maybe a little bit bigger picture. You guys have had
some good long-term data in PsA. I just wanted to get a sense from you as to what you think the tipping point is for
adoption in PsA, whether it's things like long-term data or doc experience or reimbursement, et cetera. Thanks.
<A - Scott Smith>: So just on the first question, GED-0301, I mean the first thing we need to do, and everything I
would say here is caveated by the fact that we need to have regulatory discussions to talk about the development
program and get agreement and alignment on that. I think it is sort of a perfect molecule for looking at alternate
approaches as opposed to the standard induction maintenance. But all that stuff needs to be worked through and
discussed with regulatory authorities, which are happening in the second half of this year.
Relative to OTEZLA, I think adoption is not – I don't think there's one single thing. For me what's really important for
adoption is one, you get the right kind of access footprint and that the data that you have supports the use early and
whether it's a significant market opportunity. So the access footprint's critical. Obviously you need to drive new
demand and get new patients on there. There needs to be good persistency of those patients. I think certainly the
long-term data has brought a very nice aura to the asset because when you take a look at either one year – I don't want
to get into the specifics of the week 104 or two year data for PALACE-1 – but again for me it's very striking, a
significant advancement in terms of what that efficacy looks like from week 52 to week 104, and so – with no new
safety findings during that period.
So the profile that's emerging is one that can be used long-term without increased risk of some of the things that you
see with other therapies in the space. And we're looking to get that data out. But there's no one factor that drives
adoption. I think initially it's a good footprint, making sure you've got a good core group of prescribers who are
prescribing multiples and then making sure patients are staying on longer term. All the data we generate and other

things helps support those fundamental propositions.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And when is there more clarity on the PALACE-1?
<A - Scott Smith>: PALACE-1, the PALACE-1 104-week two-year data will be available at ACR. We submitted it to
ACR. Hopefully it will be accepted and presented there. But that abstract has been presented.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. No new deals announced today, has George G. been on
holiday? And more seriously, another question on 0301, notwithstanding your comments just made about you're still in
the design phase. Could you just give us any color on the possible dosing duration within that trial and remind us of the
science that could explain what looks like a very prolonged duration of action on very short treatment protocols seen in
previous studies? Thank you.
<A - Scott Smith>: Yes. So the things that you hit on, I think are really what needs to be considered, how do you take
the molecule [indiscernible] (54:58), what's the appropriate duration. Certainly in Phase III, you would test a couple of
different dosing regimens in terms of that maintenance. What we see arising out of this when we take a look at the data,
when we take a look at the possible avenues for development, is just what a tremendous market opportunity it is to have
a product in our hands which not only is showing really significant induction, but also the potential to have really long
duration remissions.
And so, how you work out the dosing schedules and things like that, is we need to again design some alternate designs,
talk to regulatory authorities. But there really is a tremendous opportunity for a product which has good duration of
remissions here. You don't see it, 50% of patients on TNF lose the remission over the course of the year, even with
continued therapy. So I think we have a really nice opportunity on this duration gain to really change the length of time
patients can be treated and change the treatment paradigm for Crohn's disease.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I actually had some Biogen and Merck
questions if Peter is still there. Just kidding. Can I ask about, another question on Crohn's. So I think most folks, based
on the money you guys spent, expect the data to be pretty good that you present in October. And maybe Scott, just
maybe just address how you guys got comfortable that what we're going to be looking at in the Phase II isn't false
positives. There have been some false positives in Crohn's in Phase II. And then second quick question is, maybe for
Mark perhaps. Can you clarify what your expectation is at this point for the European front-line REVLIMID label? Do
you expect an indication for the transplant eligible patients as well as the non-eligible, or just one of the above? Thanks
a lot.
<A - Scott Smith>: So, first of all, just to talk about Crohn's and GED-0301 and the data that we see. As I said on the
last call, we saw really striking efficacy, not only in terms of what you see from clinical response, but also what you see
in terms of patient remissions. I don't want to get into the specifics of the data, but the placebo rates were low in this
trial and there was an appropriate dose response. And we did very significant diligence on all 166 patients who were in
the study and looked at the data in very different ways. And we think it is very, very compelling and provides a
tremendous opportunity for an asset to take into Phase III. And obviously given what we paid, the competitive nature of
it, a lot of other companies did too, but I think once you see the data and that again is going to be UEGW, which is the
next major GI meeting October 21. When you see the full data and the dose response and the durability response, and

some of those things, then I think you will understand exactly why we think what we do.
We also looked at all the, opened all the data, looked at the patient case report forms as appropriate, looked at data from
every patient in the study and really think it is a strong, robust data. So we're very excited. We're very excited about the
opportunity to get that data out. And so we don't have to talk so much in code about what's in that data because it is
very striking and compelling and it's interesting to talk about.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Mark, thanks for the question. It's Mark here. On the ongoing discussions in Europe about our
newly diagnosed label for REVLIMID, we are in fact continuing to push for the broadest possible label for myeloma.
That said, you will recall that our base case has been that we would be approved around the world for elderly transplant
ineligible patients, but that label then would include continuous treatment. And because of the way the market is
evolving, we think that upwards of 70% of the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma market, even with somewhat of a
limited label, would be candidates for REVLIMID/dexamethasone as a consequence of our regulatory approvals not
just in Europe but around the world. So we're at the front end of the process. We continue to and will continue to
support the broadest possible label at the end. But our base case has been elderly non-transplant eligible patients as a
label.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yes and just, and that's exactly how we built the financial model. And then we don't have
anything in there for the stem cell transplant population until at least 18 to 24 months later. So when you think about
the model 2015 to 2017, that's how those layer in there.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thanks for taking the question. Sorry for the poor joke.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Well it is going to be an exciting time here with George and Peter and Jackie is going to be,
you have to keep everybody moving.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk more
specifically about the strategy underlining the new immuno-oncology center. I'm curious. What are some of the areas of
most interest initially? And do you foresee building out a portfolio with early R&D efforts in licensing or partnering,
external assets? Or is it more along the lines of expanding out combinations, that is, to ensure that existing Celgene
products are paired with other folks' cancer immuno therapies?
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Yes, no, I think you've outlined it in the sense that it's really all of the above. And I think, you
know as a company that has been focused on immunology from its beginnings as a pharmaceutical company , the
impact of the core products that we have is in this space. And we've been very intent on it. We have programs internal,
in different geographies and in different groups and we have external programs that are coordinated with our internal
programs. And so I think because of the magnitude and potential impact of what we have today and the ability to even
further leverage it, we think it's great that we can bring a guy on like Rob to really help us coordinate it and have a
center of excellence, is consistent with how we're building our research philosophy of centers of excellence.
And so that I think it's we feel very good about what we've built. We now want to make sure it's most effectively
executed and coordinated and leveraged as we go forward. So we feel very good about where we are. But the field is
continuing to merge. There are going to be next-generation technologies that we're very focused on to ensure that we're
positioned today, but also for the long-term impact of the field. So this is still in the early innings. We feel good where
we are and we intend to even be a more significant player over time.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden, Ph.D.>: Great. Thanks for taking my question as well and, Peter, welcome back to biotech.
I admire your willingness to take on the tough comps of following Jackie as CFO. On OTEZLA Scott, just trying to
reconcile the sales, reported sales versus the volume implied from the script. So we've seen a really nice script trend
here as you pointed out. I guess the titration packs are not included in those scripts, but it also sounds like you guys are
giving away a little bit more free drug from those who are converting over to commercial coverage. So can you just
walk us through the math of how we get there? Is it just a increase gross to net here, and should that improve as you get
a bigger base of patients? And then lastly, just related, is there anything you can say on early persistency trends,
discontinuation rate on OTEZLA, and maybe conversion rate from the titration packs to the scripts? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Matt. Thanks for the compliment. Peter's getting a little nervous now, but he'll be fine.
So I just wanted to jump here real quickly and then I will pass it to Scott. So just to make sure that everybody is clear
on this, the titration packs are like samples, non-revenue generating. As you know, that's two weeks worth of drug. And
then we had been prepared from the beginning in order to support the patients' stay on therapy to have these bridging
packs available which are also non-revenue generating so that if there were, if there was time waiting to get the
authorizations, that the patients would stay on product. And I think that's what we saw over the course of the early
stages of the launch. And I think Scott will talk a little bit about the trends that we expect in that because it would be
sort of natural for that to taper down over time as you grow your patient base, so.
<A - Scott Smith>: And thanks for the question, Matt. And like you, I'm very encouraged by the Rx trends which are
very strong, good growth week to week. Now I think what you see affecting, as Jackie has talked about, is titration. The
average time to adjudication in the first two months after launch was 22 days, which is normal in a highly managed
category with a new product. And so patients with a titration and then a bridge pack to help them get to commercial
supply. The good news there is that from the latest data that I've seen, over 95% of the patients had that adjudicated
positively. So there's really good access. It just takes a little time, and titration and adjudication can just push off a little
bit.
And I would again go back to my comment that we see in July revenues which we expect to meet or exceed all what we
saw in the first quarter. So you do get a little bit when you're giving out free titrations and samples to help with that,
you do get a little bit of dampening in the initial weeks. But that goes away as you go forward and we can already see
significant acceleration in revenues in line with what we're generating in terms of prescriptions. So it's a very positive
picture.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden, Ph.D.>: Thanks. And the persistency?
<A - Scott Smith>: Oh persistency, it's too early for me to give actual persistency numbers. The numbers of patients
who have discontinued therapy is very low. Less than 1% of patients that I can see have discontinued, but it's too early
to really tell because you have a lot of patients very new. What we're hearing anecdotally is very similar to what we've
seen in the clinical programs. And there was 3,000 parents in the PALACE clinical program in total. What we're seeing
is relatively low, very low rates of discontinuation, 1%, 2%, that kind of thing, like we saw in the clinical program. So
too early to get a really good number on it. Usually we like to get 6 to 8 months to really get a good view on
persistency, but so far it seems in line with what we've seen in the clinical program, which was low discontinuations.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden, Ph.D.>: Great. Thank you.

think you're going to fit in or play here as competition heats up. And then secondly, dividend has been mentioned, but
you know really not something that seems to be near term. Is there something that you would like to see play out? How
important is that at the board level for you, and do you need to see stuff play out, for example litigation and all that kind
of stuff really get visibility on that before that happens? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Michael. Let me jump in on the dividend question. So it does come up from time to
time and what we've said in the past is it's not something that we see for the near term but it's something that we're
going to keep on the radar screen and just think about. One of the key things that would drive our decision on that
though, would be the diversification in the revenue stream that we would like to see take place over a period of time
and be a meaningful diversification. Because as much as we love REVLIMID and the growth of REVLIMID and we
expect for it to be very good for a long, long period of time, we would also love to have some other products in there
that are growing at very fast rates too. And you've seen some of the projections that we've given where we expect
REVLIMID to come down from kind of two-thirds or so percent of the total revenue pie to closer to 50%, and
hopefully over time even maybe go a little bit below that. But for the right reasons, while everything is growing. So it's
not something we forget about, but it's a ways out.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: On, Mike, thanks for the question about CLL. On CLL, recall that we are continuing to accrue
and manage our CLL-002 CONTINUUM trial. And you're right, there are so many good things happening for patients
right now with respect to novel therapy for the treatment of upfront CLL. What is not different in our strategy is that
maintenance therapy remains the real potential to extend the benefit of some of the very powerful drugs that have been
approved. So we're continuing to believe that we have an advantaged position with REVLIMID if and when CLL-002
would read out as a positive way to maintain the benefit of prior treatment.
In addition, you may remember we talked about CCL CC-122, one of our next generation small-molecule drugs. I think
that this comes along at just the right time, because what will happen over time is that large groups of relapsed patients
off of drugs like ibrutinib, et cetera, will need different treatments to salvage their resistant disease. So we think that the
market shifts obviously, but then there will be newly defined, homogeneously defined, patients based on failure of prior
therapy and we're excited about coming in with our next-generation molecules.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: There are four of you remaining in the queue and we're trying to get to you. So operator,
please keep going.
Operator
Thank you. Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald, your line is now open.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Very much for taking the question. Just quickly then, I guess on OTEZLA, maybe you can just
share with us if there are any plans to expand out the pharmacy distribution once the psoriasis indication is granted,
assuming that occurs in September as expected? And then the second, really on ABRAXANE, can you just remind us
of the markets that are still outstanding for reimbursement?
<A - Scott Smith>: Just on the OTEZLA question, at first when launching into a specialty area in a highly managed
category, you want to keep your distribution very tight so that you can help with reimbursement and get the kind of
managed care footprint and acceptance that we have. As we get into and get through those adjudications, get into the
launch of psoriasis, probably not right after the launch but sometime next year, we will take a look at expanding that
network once it's clear from a reimbursement perspective, patients are accessing the product in a reasonable way with
no time delays and things. I think there's an opportunity with this product to expand beyond the specialty networks and
that will be an initiative for us next year.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay. Thank you on that.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: The reimbursement for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer is going well as we have described.
High priority markets for us include Spain and Italy, again as we have already described. But markets like Australia
and Canada are still in the mix also. So we have several remaining high value markets to secure reimbursement access

over the next six months, year. And I think that continues to bode well for our opportunity to really create a blockbuster
in pancreatic cancer.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Hi. Thanks. I had a question on the longer term model that you've constructed and how we
should think about broad populations versus targeting subgroups in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and then triplet
therapy in myeloma. So REMARK, I don't think it's designed to look at that question of GCB versus non-GCB. But
when you think about REMARK, do you think about it being used in a particular subtype? And then for triplets in
myeloma, some of the commentary that you made earlier on the call sounds like you think the benefit is going to be
specific to calling out specific subpopulations, maybe like poor set of genetics, or do you think of it as being broadly
applicable across the myeloma population?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Thomas. Thanks for the question. So generally, just with respect to the financial
model, as you may imagine, we tend to be probably on the conservative side with our assumptions around how we start
with certain patient groups and then move forward over time. So, I'm going to let Mark jump in, in a little bit more in
just a minute. Specifically to the question around the triplet regimens, we have not yet built into the model specific
forecasts for what the benefits could be to REVLIMID's position in some of the different patient segments associated
with, or on duration for that matter, associated with the emergence of positive results for these triplet regimens. We've
talked about that on multiple occasions as a potential upside to the model and certainly not downside to the model, if
depending on how those things go. It would either be neutral or upside. So, we will see how those play out and give
more color on those over time. With respect to maybe the other sort of aspect of your question, I'll let Mark jump in.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks. Thanks for the question. So with respect to REMARK, specifically we are testing
REVLIMID maintenance in a front line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma population that is at high risk of relapse based
on an index of scoring. That's not the same thing, as you know, as activated B-cell as part of the non-germinal cell
subtype. So what we're doing now is participating in the lymphoma market as it has been defined and we think
REVLIMID maintenance therapy in this higher risk group of newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a great
place for the product to be. Over time, the combination with rituximab we think will really enhance the value
proposition of REVLIMID and rituximab for that matter in a number of subsets. As we described today, the activated
B-cell type as a brand new subtype, it's very important that we create the kind of homogeneity with molecular markers
and companion diagnostics going forward to really optimize that. So we're participating in the market as it is and we're
shaping the market for future value.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thank you. Operator, we've got last one question I believe.
Operator
Yes. Our last question comes from the line of Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. How much off-label is there for REVLIMID in lower risk MDS? And if
that's a simple answer, can I also ask a question about your immuno-oncology? When do you expect these pre-clinical
assets such as CD47, CAR T, to move into the clinic?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. Today, there is very little, very, very little use of REVLIMID in the
non-deletion 5q, or as you described, off-label market. So just it's very clear, the role of the product is very well defined
on label for deletion 5q, not transfusion dependent disease. With respect to CD47 and CAR T, we believe that as we
enter 2015, we can accelerate the clinical development of both of these programs. So this year is still a little bit more
getting organized, understanding the profile, INDs, et cetera, and then 2015 would be I would hope a year we could
