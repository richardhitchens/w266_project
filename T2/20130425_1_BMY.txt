MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to today's First Quarter Earnings, 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. This call is being
recorded.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Public
Affairs. Please go ahead, Mr. Elicker.
John E. Elicker
Thank you, Kayla, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us to review our first quarter results.
Unfortunately, Lamberto Andreotti, our CEO, is not able to join us this morning. He's attending to an urgent family
health matter. With me this morning are Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer -- Charlie will have prepared
remarks -- and then joining him for Q&A are Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer; Francis Cuss, our incoming
Chief Scientific Officer; Giovanni Caforio, President of the U.S. Business; and Béatrice Cazala, Executive Vice
President-Commercial Operations.
So before we get started, let me just take care of some of the legal requirements. During the call we will make
statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of
the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially
from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those

Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We have just completed a good start to an important year, one in which
our focus is on commercial execution, as well as the continued delivery of our diverse and sustainable pipeline. Before
going into a deeper dive on our financial performance, I would like to highlight three important areas, Eliquis, diabetes
and R&D. We are off to a very good start with Eliquis. Eliquis' differentiated clinical profile is being recognized and
valued by physicians, payers and patients. In the U.S., we are on track with our expectations. Trends are consistent with
where we thought they would be, and access is actually a little ahead of expectations.
We expect to see continued progress in the second quarter with Commercial, Medicare Part D and Hospital plans. We
expect the impact of this will start to be reflected in the prescription trends over the course of this year. Outside the
U.S. we are in the early stages, but we have made progress on the access front in Europe with a positive
recommendation from the U.K. and a positive guidance from Germany.
In other markets the process is ongoing with multiple negotiations taking place. With our partner Pfizer, we are very
focused on executing the global launch of Eliquis with its AFib indication. We continue to believe that Eliquis will be
the leading new agent over time.
With respect to our diabetes portfolio, we continue to make good progress in this area as well. In the U.S. we have fully
aligned with AstraZeneca, having finalized our sales and marketing teams. The combined organization is now focused
solely on serving the needs of diabetes patients.
We completed the international commercial integration of Amylin on April 1, in nearly 90 markets, a complex process
that impacted all aspects of our business. This is a significant accomplishment for the BMS-AZ alliance. With the
integration work nearly done, we can now redouble our efforts in diabetes to ensure we are focused and able to
capitalize on the opportunities we have, including plans to file Forxiga for regulatory review in the U.S. in the middle
of the year.
With respect to R&D, 2013 is another important year for the presentation of key clinical data that will lay the
foundation for our company's future growth. We plan to present new PD-1 data at ASCO. PD-1 has received fast-track
status from the FDA for lung, renal cell and melanoma. The top line results for SAVOR, our CV outcomes trial for
Onglyza, should be available in June.
And in hep-C, you may have seen the important data on our triple regimen, presented at EASL this week and we expect
to initiate Phase III in a fixed-dose combination by the end of the year. As mentioned in our press release this morning
we have received breakthrough status from the FDA for this program. Also, by the end of the year, we plan to file our
all-dual oral regimen for regulatory review in Japan.
Now, let me discuss our first quarter financial performance. We delivered net sales of $3.8 billion, down 27%
compared to the first quarter of last year, due to the loss of exclusivity of Plavix and Avapro. We will continue to see
the impact of these exclusivity losses on our financial results for one more quarter.
Excluding Plavix and Avapro, global sales grew 10%, led by Yervoy, Orencia, our diabetes portfolio, Baraclude and
Sprycel. I will touch on some key product highlights. Yervoy global sales increased 49% to $229 million. This includes
the positive impact from a $25 million, one-time reversal of deferred revenues in the U.S. You will recall that we

established this sales deferral in the third quarter of 2011.
Excluding this adjustment for Yervoy, U.S. sales increased 15% versus last year. We are seeing good growth across all
segments including community hospitals and practices as physicians increasingly understand the potential for
long-term survival. We expect continued growth in both the U.S. and Europe, where we now have reimbursement in
essentially all markets.
Orencia global sales increased 26% to $320 million. Orencia continues to perform well globally, with growing demand
in the U.S. and Europe, as we expand access, reimbursement and promotion for the sub-Q formulation. U.S. sales
increased 25% compared to last year, driven by strong demand for sub-Q, with recorded sales of $70 million in the
quarter. Several months into the sub-Q launch in Europe we are seeing strong uptake in Germany and the rest of
Northern Europe and we continue to secure access and reimbursement in other parts of Europe. Orencia also continues
to perform well in Japan, up 31% versus last year, and we are waiting for a regulatory decision on sub-Q.
In diabetes, global sales for the Onglyza franchise increased 25% to $202 million. Although Onglyza's new prescription
trend in the U.S. flattened somewhat this past quarter we saw strong volume growth for the Onglyza franchise versus
the prior year. U.S. sales for our exenatide franchise were $136 million. Bydureon sales volume and market share
continued to grow during the quarter, fueled primarily by primary care physicians as we broadened Bydureon's
prescriber base. For Byetta we are focused on opportunities to combine with short-acting insulin.
We launched Forxiga in Germany, the U.K. and Denmark during the quarter, and as I mentioned, we hope to file for
U.S. regulatory approval by mid-year. Sprycel global sales increased 24% to $287 million. In a very competitive
market Sprycel continues to gain market share, particularly in the first line setting. Also included in our total sales
figure is a positive $36 million impact from prior year Medicaid accrual adjustments.
Now let me highlight a few items from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. As John
mentioned, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margin was
74.5% during the quarter, down 70 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease is primarily due to
the change in terms for Abilify and product mix, particularly the exenatide franchise.
R&D expense was $930 million, which is up 9% compared to last year. The increase in spend was largely due to the
Amylin acquisition and increased portfolio spend, including PD-1 and hep-C. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 11% during
the quarter. This is lower than our full year guidance, largely due to booking the entire 2012 R&D tax credit in the
quarter.
Moving to guidance. We are confirming our full year 2013 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance range. In addition,
our line item guidance remains unchanged. Our guidance assumes current exchange rates. As you know, foreign
currencies have weakened against the dollar since we originally gave 2013 guidance in January, particularly the yen.
While we saw no net impact from exchange in the first quarter compared to last year, at current rates we would expect
to see some pressure through the remainder of the year.
So taken together, this is an important time for Bristol-Myers Squibb. We are in full transition to the portfolio of the
future, a transition that is moving forward on two parallel tracks: executing our near-term commercial opportunities;
and at the same time, developing a pipeline to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Before we turn it over to your questions, I want to take a moment to offer my personal congratulations to Elliott and
wish him well in his retirement. I have had the privilege of working with Elliott for a long time and truly value his
many contributions to our company. I'd also like to congratulate Francis on his appointment to Chief Scientific Officer.
Francis and I have also worked together for quite some time. Francis is a respected leader with broad experience in
both research and development. I look forward to continued collaboration with Francis to help our company deliver an
innovative and diverse pipeline of medicine.
At this time, we'd be happy to answer your questions.

Thanks. Kayla, I think we're ready to go to questions and I'll just remind everybody in addition to Charlie, we have
Elliott and Francis on the R&D side as well as Giovanni and Béatrice here to answer any commercial questions that
you might have. Kayla?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: This is for Elliott and Francis. Can you comment on your PD-1 program in the context of Fast
Track status versus breakthrough designation? There seems to be some confusion in the marketplace. And then to that
end, you did receive breakthrough status for your triple DAA hep-C therapy, which is interesting, because I note that
Gilead did not receive breakthrough status. So what do you think this all means? And then secondarily, we did see
some early data on Roche's PDL-1, just interested in your take and how you see that comparing to your PD-1? Thanks.
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: Thank you, Jami. This is Elliott. I will start and Francis will chime in. I agree that
people are trying to figure out the exact implications of the new designation of breakthrough therapy. It's a new tool
that we all welcome. For the FDA, it's implications are going to evolve. And it's added to a host of other existing tools.
My impression is that it is an opportunity for early programs to receive regular interaction with the FDA and to gain
input on the development of the registrational program.
So to that end, we certainly welcome the breakthrough designation on our triple regimen in hepatitis C. This is a Phase
II program. I can only speculate that the FDA was attracted to this because it is a non-nuke based regimen. It has no
Ribavirin potentially, and has no ritonavir. But again, the implications are not clear.
The FDA Oncology Division, has historically identified programs and used all the tools, including Fast Track and other
tools, to their advantage to advance programs that can benefit patients in the areas of unmet need. Fast Track is what
we took advantage of in three tumor types and over the last year or so we have had, in my opinion, very high quality,
frequent interactions, great input and have moved from a standing start, as I call it, from a Phase I into six registrational
trials, including five randomized Phase III programs.
So I'm very pleased with where we are. I acknowledge that the field is competitive. We were attracted to this field back
in 2004 and have been developing the science that is leading the way. But it is a competitive field. Our program is
broad comprehensive, in multiple tumor types, and has multiple opportunities for acceleration and early approvals.
Francis, would you like to add to that?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Certainly. Well, I am certainly very excited talking, moving to the HCV program with the
recent data that was presented at EASL. As you are well aware, this is a non-interferon, non-Riba, non-ritonavir triple.
And we showed very impressive efficacy data in a well-tolerated regimen. And I think we've had numerous and very
good interactions with the FDA. And I think it reflects the potential importance they see in this regimen, because of its
profile. We also have the advantage here of being able to move quickly. We've accelerated the Phase III into the fourth
quarter of this year and are confident we will have a fixed dose combination to take into Phase III, which will be,
presumably, a simple, one tablet, twice a day regimen for 12 weeks.
Just moving to PD-1, PD-L1 as you know, we published in the New England Journal last year our experience both with
PD-1 and PD-L1. We have the advantage of being the only company that's been able to look at both of these regimens.
And based on the data we saw of both efficacy and safety, we are moving forward with PD-1, with an opportunity to
accelerate that forward. I think it's important to note that we also talked about biomarkers in those publications and we
will be looking at biomarkers, but we've left ourselves open with the option of a program that doesn't necessarily rely
on a biomarker if the data doesn't support it.

<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thank you, Jami. And, Kayla, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Again on PD-1, my understanding is that you can get both Fast Track and breakthrough
and my question is did you ask for breakthrough designation and is that request still pending or have you been denied?
I don't think it really means that much, but it is a little bit unusual that Merck got that designation, because your
compound is the one that's been in the press a lot.
Then a question on dosing in Phase III. If I understand the dosing right it's 3 mg/kg. I think in Phase II you went all the
way up to 10 mg/kg. Is there a dose limiting toxicity with the drug, and if so, what is it? Or maybe asked differently,
are there any dose dependent side effects with the product? And then just on your comment about L1 versus PD-1, are
you saying you saw worse safety with your PD-L1?
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: Okay, Tim. This is Elliott, and Francis will follow. I will deal with the different
classifications that you talked about and Francis will address the fact that we are selecting a dose, with regard to the
dose side effects, the choice of PD-1 versus PD-L1, and the different ligands. It is true that these different designations,
including Fast Track and breakthrough are not mutually exclusive. And, I think, however, the way I'm viewing this, I'm
very pleased with the interactions we've had when our program was at an earlier stage, and now has a well-designed,
broad set of possibilities for indications, early approval, acceleration. These designations don't convey any guarantee
for downstream action like early approval, priority review, et cetera. But our program is designed to take advantage of
the full array of opportunities here.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Tim, thank you. Just on the dose of Nivolumab, we obviously tested comprehensively
different doses and as always, we make an analysis of the best therapeutic index. So our analysis of this, taken together
with the dosing regimen, came out that 3 mg/kg was the optimal dose. As far as PD-L1 versus PD-1 is concerned, you
can certainly read the data we presented last year in the New England Journal. I will tell you as an overview, we have
seen similar toxicities, for both PD-1 and PD-L1, of similar degree. So our analysis was, we were somewhat ahead on
PD-1, there was a suggestion perhaps of greater efficacy, but of course, it's very early studies and we were able to
accelerate PD-1 forward. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thank you, Tim. Can we go to the next question, please, Kayla?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Thanks. So I guess maybe just to have a temporary break from PD-1, but I will get back to
it. The Eliquis launch, can we talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about the potential for an acceleration?
We have seen a really material acceleration in Xarelto scripts, roughly about 12 months into the launch. So just
wondering if, again, given your statements earlier, if we can anticipate a similar type acceleration?
And then separately, on PD-1, just a couple of questions there. Can you talk a little bit about the, what could be a
potential issue, if any, with utilizing a modified IgG1, so again, the immunoglobulin that's attached to Roche's PD-L1
versus the choice of an IgG4? There are suggestions that perhaps that may be an important difference, although I think
there may be some limitations there.
And then lastly, have you seen any responses in colorectal cancer with either your PD-1 or PD-L1? It looks like there
may be some responses in colorectal cancer with Roche's drug and I didn't know if you saw certain ways or potential
ways to open up that very large tumor type with immuno-therapy. Thank you.

<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Thanks, Seamus. This is Charlie. Let me talk a little bit, a brief overview on Eliquis and
then I'll pass it over to Giovanni. He can talk more specifically about the U.S. Feedback has been universally positive
on Eliquis' clinical profile. And although we are still at the early stages of our launch, we continue to believe Eliquis
will be the leading new agent in this market over time. We also have some near-term lifecycle plans for Eliquis. We
plan to file for a potential VTE prevention indication with the FDA this summer. And in addition, we expect to present
the data from the AMPLIFY study at ISPH and will potentially file for a VPE treatment indication by the end of the
year, obviously pending the results of the study. Giovanni?
<A - Giovanni Caforio, M.D.>: Yes, good morning, Seamus. This is Giovanni. Just to follow-up on what Charlie said,
as you know we've been working with Pfizer and promoting Eliquis in the U.S. since the beginning of February. And
so far, although it's early, clearly, the launch has been going very well and very much in line with our expectations. We
have positive feedback from our customers on the differentiated profile of Eliquis, and let me give you a couple of
comments about early indicators. When we started our focus on the launch, we focused on access, we focused on
hospital formulary listing and stocking. That's important, as you know, because over 50% of initiations are in the
hospital. And also, we started promoting with cardiologists and with a group of the early adopter PCPs.
From an access perspective, as Charlie mentioned in the introductory remarks, we are doing as well, and maybe a bit
better, than we had planned. Right now we have coverage in approximately 90% of commercial lives and in
approximately 60% of Medicare lives. Interest -- importantly, we have covered status with all five top Medicare Part D
plans, and with three of those five we've actually achieved preferred status. So that is going in line with our plans and
obviously we're continuing to work on that.
From a hospital perspective we are continuing to make progress. We had a very large number of P&T Committee
reviews in April. There are many more planned for the month of May. That is going well and will continue to improve
over time.
In terms of our promotion to physicians, the efficacy and safety profile of Eliquis is really resonating very well. The top
[indiscernible] (23:24) recalled messages are really around efficacy and safety and the three end-points, which is
different from other agents which are being prescribed primarily because of convenience, on the contrary. So, we see
that all of the leading indicators are in line with our expectations. They are very positive and that clearly reinforces our
belief that Eliquis will become, over time, the leading agent in the indication. And that clearly will result in growth
over the course of the year and into next year.
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: Seamus, this is Elliott. With regard to your question of applicability of the PD-1
pathway in other tumors, early on we began exploring the possibility and the likelihood that this could be very
broad-based and we feel that's going to turn out to be true. We have a program where we are exploring other tumor
types. And we will be presenting that data down the line. Right now, as you know the focus is on kidney, lung and
melanoma, with about six or seven registrational trials and a broad-based program.
Your second question dealt with the isotype of the antibody, and our research scientists in California that originally
came from Medarex have done perhaps the most work on the relevance of the isotype in selecting these immune
modulators, with positive and negative features sometimes chosen. And they are very confident that we have chosen an
optimal isotype for PD-1. I will let Francis add his comments to that work that has been ongoing under him.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Elliott. So a couple of things to mention, as you know our monoclonal antibody
comes from the XenoMouse model developed by Nils Lonberg and his colleagues at, formerly at Medarex. And so we
have a fully human antibody, it's an IgG4 antibody and the mutation in the hinge region to make a consensus for IgG-1.
There has been some suggestions by others that there may be some ADC. There's absolutely none in our in-vitro, and
we have not seen anything in the clinic.
I think it's important to also always to look at the immunogenicity of these antibodies and ours being a fully human
antibody, we see very low immunogenicity in the nearly 1,000 patients we've treated now. I think you mentioned the
Genentech antibody; that's of course a CDR grafted antibody, and I think it's, again important to tell the different target
on immune cells and so one should look carefully at the immunogenicity. And one measure of that, of course, is what

your dose is. And we have, as we just mentioned in the previous question, a low dose, which reflects the low
immunogenicity. So let me stop there.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Seamus. Can we go to the next one, Kayla, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple questions just to shift gears a bit to diabetes. For
Onglyza, it looks like we've seen a little bit of share loss. I guess, how are you thinking about that and addressing that
share dynamic? Second question, on Bydureon. We are seeing some gradual uptake, but given the additional resources
you've put on the product, are you where you want to be at this point with that launch or re-launch profile? And then
maybe finally, just when we look at the mid-stage pipeline, beyond PD-1, would love just to hear, in terms of what you
are kind of most excited about with the rest of the portfolio. Maybe, Elliott, since this is I guess one of the last earnings
calls we'll have you on, so any comments there would be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio, M.D.>: Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me comment on the diabetes portfolio performance in the
U.S. So first, going back to the comments made by Charlie at the beginning of the call, over the last two quarters in the
U.S., we've fundamentally transformed our commercial organization. We've integrated the AZ and Bristol-Myers
Squibb teams. We have realigned, restructured and increased the sales of our -- the size of our sales organizations. And
that transition has been completed at the end of the first quarter. And we acknowledge that during this period of
transition, in a very competitive market, we have seen some disruption to our commercial effort. Now on Q2 and
beyond, that transition is behind us. Our teams are fully staffed. We have the right level of resourcing and our teams are
back in the market promoting the full portfolio of products.
With respect to Onglyza, you will remember that Onglyza grew very rapidly, increased its market share and had very
strong performance in 2012. In the first quarter of 2013 we've seen flattening of our TRx share and some loss of our
NBRX share which is really related to the factors I described before but also to the fact that the DPP-4 market growth
slowed down considerably and clearly the competitive pressure in this segment increased. We've seen a flattening of
our share in March and April and I think that is a positive indicator and we are really focused on returning to growth
during the remainder of 2013.
With respect to Bydureon, when we started promoting Bydureon we had set three objectives for us as we started
promoting this franchise. The first one was to improve access for Bydureon, the second one was to broaden the
prescriber base particularly in primary care and the third one clearly was to accelerate the development of the dual
chamber pen and bring that to market. So we've made progress in all of those areas. Access for Bydureon has improved
in both the commercial and the Medicare space.
We have actually grown significantly the prescriber base, particularly in primary care, and we are on track to launch the
dual chamber pen, which is an important driver of incremental growth, at the beginning of 2014. As a result of that we
have seen growth for Bydureon in terms of TRx, as we grew 18% in Q1 versus the last quarter of 2012. We also
increased two share points in the market and as a leading indicator our NBRX growth has been stronger than that. So
we clearly believe Bydureon can grow more and faster and as I said at the beginning we have the right teams and
resources in place to continue to drive that growth.
I should also say, thinking about the exenatide franchise, that we believe there continues to be good opportunities for
Byetta and as of the beginning of Q2 we have actually increased the resourcing behind promoting Byetta in
combination with short acting insulin.
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: Chris, this is Elliott. As I've said before I've been privileged to lead this R&D
organization through a very important transformation and my last act has been focused on a very efficient transition, so

excited about the timing here because not only the leadership but the timing of me leaving coincides with a great deal
of momentum and catalysts, not only in the late stage, but moving from discovery into the mid-stage, and Francis has
been the leader in charge of that and should comment on some of the exciting things that we both see.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thanks, Elliott. So we talked just a moment ago about our excitement around Nivolumab, but
I think it's important to realize that we have an immuno-oncology platform and I find it incredibly exciting that we
actually have seven immuno-oncology assets now between early and full development. We've got more than a dozen
back in discovery and we've put together an integrated hypothesis-driven kind of combination strategy.
You'll see the first fruits of that at ASCO when we present some preliminary data on the Ipilimumab-Nivolumab
combination. But there's a number of other combination trials ongoing in early clinical research and we have a global
translational immuno-oncology network where we're partnering with academics around the world to help us develop
models and develop clinical data to help us bring forward what we believe will be the flowering of I/O which is in
combination therapy which will allow us to continue providing transformative clinical benefit to patients. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. First for Elliott and Francis, I'm not sure if you answered whether you asked for
breakthrough status or not. My real question though is on SGLT2. Given your knowledge of your program and having
seen an Ad Com as well as a label approved for another drug in the class, is it fair to say that there can be some
meaningful differentiation among the players in this class? And then for Charlie, I was curious if you're considering
any deals that are larger than the typical string-of-pearls kind of deals you've done in the past. And what would a larger
deal have to bring to the table to be seriously considered? Thanks.
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: Yes, Gregg, this is Elliott. I'll just repeat what we are saying is that we have
breakthrough therapy in HCV. We do not have breakthrough therapy on PD-1. We utilized a different mechanism that
provides, we think, the same kind of advantage to get to the advanced stage we are at.
With regard to Forxiga, we believe that it's good for the SGLT-2 field to have not only our first-in-class molecule
approved in Europe and things progressing well there, but the U.S. FDA division recognizing the mechanism by the
approval of a competitor. We will be submitting mid-year our submission with even stronger data on the benefit side
and, I believe, all the questions of safety addressed. And I do believe these will be important members of the
armamentarium and that we see differentiation.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Let me just quickly talk on business development. We've always said that it's an important
component of our balanced approach to capital allocation and it has to pass three hurdles. It has to pass strategically.
Does it make sense for Bristol-Myers Squibb? Does the science hold up? And does it make financial sense for us?
We've said all along we are agnostic around deal size but if you look back retrospectively around our string of pearls
you can see the type of deals that we've done.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Gregg. Can we go to the next question, please, Kayla?

<Q - Mark Schoenebaum, MD>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Elliott, maybe I can ask you
something. This has been brought up before but I'd really love to get just your updated and complete thoughts on this
and I know all the dialog on this at ASCO as well, but why shouldn't it be our base case expectation as investors that

PD-L1 expression, given the fact I think there have been zero recessed responses at least in those patients? Thank you
very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: It's Francis. Let me take that one, Mark. So it's just not true actually that we haven't seen
responses in patients without PD-L1. There may be several reasons for this; one may be we just don't understand the
mechanism well enough. It's true, and you can look back at our data last year, that there was a higher response rate in
the PD-L1 patients but it wasn't exclusively so and it's continued to be the case here.
One of the particular issues I think with melanoma is that sampling of the tumors might be very heterogeneous, so you
always run the risk of having a tumor which is apparently negative but other tumors are positive. So we are taking the
view that we're doing a very comprehensive phase III where we'll be looking at patients with and without PD-L1, we'll
collect the data, we'll be able to make a submission either based on a biomarker or not on a biomarker. But of course,
our principle is we want to make this medicine, all medicine available to as many patients as possible.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great, thank you, Mark. Can we go to the next question, please?

We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. Is SAVOR already complete and is the data in-house? I think you said that you will
have the data in June but will we get the data in June? And is the full data still expected at ESC? This is a bit confusing
because I think clinical trials.gov says the trial ends in July and in the past I don't recall your prepared remarks
highlighting SAVOR to the extent that you did today, so I find this whole thing very interesting. One other question on
Eliquis, was there any pipeline still in the sales number? Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Steve. This is John, real quick. In terms of whether or not – what the disclosure on
SAVOR will be, I don't think it's really – we're ready to comment on that. We'll have to work through that once we see
the data with AstraZeneca. Elliott, do you want – anything else?
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: Yeah, well, Steve always asks me this and it's the last time I can answer. No, I have
not seen the data and we expect to be looking at it sometime in the summer. I'm not exactly sure when the events will
be completed. Maybe there was confusion because we can't say exactly what meeting we'll be able to present at, but we
certainly want to present towards the end of the year and the meeting that you mentioned would be the likely target.
<A - Giovanni Caforio, M.D.>: And on Eliquis, Steve, the best way again to look at performance is to look at the
development of TRxs. In the U.S., obviously, with the launch of any product in the U.S., there is a distribution to the
channel and that was the case with Eliquis as well at the beginning.
<A - Elliott Sigal, M.D., Ph.D.>: And, Steve, it was approximately $11 million in the U.S., although in Japan, we were
expecting in the broader sort of GP arena to have a little bit more stock [indiscernible] (39:19) give and take there.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please?

<Q - David R. Risinger>: With respect to the DPP-4s and GLP-1s, can you comment on the upcoming cancer
workshop and how you see that and what you think of the FDA's scrutiny of potential association with cancer risk?
And then second, with respect to dapagliflozin, and I guess this is more of a commercial question, but the way that
AstraZeneca characterized the ramp in Germany was that the infection risk associated with dapa isn't limiting uptake at
all, that dapa had ramped in the first 10 weeks in Germany at a rate that was very similar to JANUVIA's launch. And so
I guess my simple question is do you think that the investment community is overly concerned about infection risk
limiting the commercial uptake of dapagliflozin? Thank you.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: Well, I will answer first about Forxiga in Germany and actually in Europe, where we are
very pleased about what we are currently seeing. We are off to a very good start in the markets where we have
launched. If we look at Germany specifically, the feedback we get from the physician and from the patient are
extremely encouraging, so what you hear from AstraZeneca we will concur with.
When we talk about the possible side effects what we hear from our physician and the patient is that they're
manageable. So we haven't seen any issues with the uptake linked to the side effect profile. On the contrary, what we
are hearing, and again, it's very early and anecdotally, is that the patient and the physician are satisfied with the profile
both in terms of A1C reduction, but also with the additional benefit of weight loss and blood pressure. And actually, the
weight loss, the comments we hear is that it happen. It's a fast onset. So within the first month, the patients are coming
back and making comments to their physicians.
So a very strong first customer experience, which we understand is the base for the relatively rapid uptake. Now, again,
it's early days. We also know that the diabetologists are particularly happy with the mode of action, which is
differentiated, and offer a new alternative in addition, in monotherapy as well as in combination where we see the
source of business as a non-insulin-dependent mechanism.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you very much, David, and thank you for your best wishes. Let me say a word about
this whole area. So there is pancreatitis of course, and pancreatic carcinoma. And as you well know, ever since the
GLP-1s and the DPP-4 inhibitors came out, there have been reports to the FDA of patients who developed pancreatitis.
While treatable, these patients, of course, these patients are at risk anyway of pancreatitis, and of course all the agents
that are both GLP-1 and DPP-4 actually carry the warning about pancreatitis, which of course is a reflection of these
reports.
Now I think it's always important to say these reports are regarded as hypothesis-generating because of the way they're
collected, and they're not hypothesis confirming. And I must say we have no evidence from either our non-clinical or
our clinical sources to support a causal relationship between the treatment with these medicines and pancreatitis. And
of course we've done exhaustive [indiscernible] (43:27) with toxicology, using the standard techniques and we have
seen nothing either with Onglyza or Byetta or Bydureon.
In particular, there's no increase of pancreatitis observed in randomized clinical trials. And a number of observation
studies in healthcare databases have also demonstrated no effect. So, taken together, based on all of this, we together
with our partner, AZ of course, are very confident that -- of the positive risk benefit profile of the drug. And I think we
are interested to hear what the science, when it is reviewed, because we know that other sponsors of these medicines
have the same that results we have, that we can find no causal link.
So we are looking forward to that scientific discussion. Just a comment on pancreatic carcinoma, it's very similar
there's -- we find no link, either in our animal studies, and of course we've done carcinogenicity studies in rodents for
two years. We see nothing there or in the clinical studies. And I will comment on a recent paper which of course stirred
up some discussion on this from Butler and colleagues. We find this actually quite difficult to interpret and there are
significant limitations around their, both their link with the animal studies, and of course, with the way they've used
their patient groups. So we are going to be presenting some data I believe at this FDA meeting and, as I say, we look
forward to seeing the science review. Thanks very much.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, David. Kayla, can we go to the next question, please?

<Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Hi. A couple questions. First, Lilly yesterday mentioned that there was some extra cost in their
business due to the doughnut hole and I was curious whether that was looking like it was going to be more of a hit this
year than you thought it was going to be when you started the year. Second, on Orencia, can you talk about whether
that product has been impacted at all by the new launch of Xeljanz, and if there was any stocking or whatever? I know
you mentioned something in your prepared remarks but I missed it, of $36 million? I did not hear exactly what that
was. And then third, you talked about the DPP-4 class, we've all seen it slow down. I was curious if you had a
hypothesis towards why. Is it just the law of big numbers? Thanks.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Okay. Mark, thanks for your questions. In regards to the doughnut hole, the doughnut
hole costs are really a reflection of the portfolio. It depends upon the products and which ones are taken by Medicare
patients. So we haven't really seen anything different from our original plans. So I can't comment beyond that. In regard
to the Medicaid reversal of the $36 million, that relates to, as states continue to provide us with the billing, we review
that vis-à-vis our accruals and assumptions that we made when we originally established them. So it's just a, basically a
true-up of some of our prior year accruals.
<A - Giovanni Caforio, M.D.>: Let me -- this is Giovanni. Let me make a couple of comments, first on the
performance of Orencia. We had very strong performance of Orencia in the U.S. in Q1, with a significant growth of
25% over prior year. That was driven by the successful launch of sub-Q which generated significant growth in 2012.
It's early to fully assess the impact of the launch of Xeljanz. We have seen some increase in share, primarily in the
switch market, which has had sort of an impact on all players in the subcutaneous market, but the impact on us,
specifically, has been very modest and we are very pleased that we've become the third most prescribed sub-Q agent in
the U.S. market.
With respect to your comment on the growth of DPP-4s slowing down, there may actually be a number of different
factors impacting that. As a reminder, the only comment I would make is part of the accelerated growth that we had
seen in 2012 was linked to the significant decrease in the TZD market with the entry of generics in that area. So there
has been a transition of prescriptions from one class to the other. The growth has slowed down, but it continues to be
healthy.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Mark. Kayla, I think we have time for two more questions.

We'll take our last question with Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Following up on your comments regarding the
growth of Bydureon and your SGLT2s, I was wondering how you see this market evolving. Specifically do you see the
SGLT2s being used ahead of the GLP-1s, on par with DPP-4s? If you could talk about how you plan to position your
diabetes products, And a follow-up, if I may. My understanding is that you've closed the Amylin site in San Diego and

there have been significant head count reductions regarding the revised agreement for Abilify. Are there any major
opportunities for cost savings as the Eliquis launch ramps up? Thank you.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, let me just comment on Amylin. When we initially purchased Amylin, we assumed
in the deal terms and in our guidance that we gave that there would be certain synergies related to that acquisition. So
the San Diego – the overall cost opportunity was already sort of reflected in the guidance that we had provided.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: So you were asking a question about how to think about SGLT2 and GLP-1. I think we –
what we are looking at the global markets and then we may want to comment about the U.S. is that depending also on
the final labels and the access obtained by those class of products, we may end up having very different [ph] usage
(50:20). So that's one. However, from the scientific standpoint, we clearly believe that with the GLP-1 provide a good
alternative for patients that have a need of a product that will combine a good benefit of A1C as well as benefit on
blood pressure and weight loss.
So clearly in that space, physician and patient that will agree on a normal treatment for the long-term the GLP-1
[indiscernible] (50:46). Now when you look at the benefit of the GLP-1, especially when they can be used on a weekly
basis and potentially later on, on a monthly basis, that creates a very different set of opportunities. And when we look at
behaviors of patient, you'll find clearly a space prior to insulin, but you also find a space in a number of patients that do
not want treatment every day. So there are different patient profiles. We think that we will be able, having the chance of
the broad portfolio, to combine the optimal benefit for the company and for the patient, having the possibility to play in
those two arenas.
<A - Giovanni Caforio, M.D.>: Yeah, just add something on GLP-1s in the U.S. market, we see significant
opportunity for continued growth of GLP-1s. They are currently prescribed to less than 10% of diabetes patients in the
U.S. and they have been prescribed at the beginning primarily by endocrinologists. In fact, the prescribers base at this
point is much more narrow than you see with classes like DPP-4s. The class is growing very rapidly. We believe that
will continue because with the availability of Bydureon as a weekly agent, a good efficacy and the very good
tolerability profile of Bydureon, there clearly is room for increased penetration in primary care. That's exactly what we
are focusing on and that is what we are beginning to see happen. So we see continued potential for growth with
GLP-1s.
John E. Elicker
Great. Thanks very much, Alex. I think that's all the time we have. I appreciate everybody's joining us for the call this
morning, and before we close, I'd like to turn it back to Charlie for any closing comments.
