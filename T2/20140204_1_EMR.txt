at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for
the next three months.
I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Sales
increased 1% in the quarter to $5.6 billion with underlying sales up 3% as the economic environment reflected slowly
improving market conditions. Demand among industries and geographies was mixed but favorable overall, with a
better business climate in Europe and emerging markets growth of 7%. Gross profit and business segment margin
reflected solid improvement. One-time corporate items related to accelerated charitable contributions and acquisition
costs increased expenses by about $50 million. Earnings per share of $0.65 increased 5%, or up 8% to $0.67 excluding
the acquisition costs. Cash generation was strong with operating cash flow up 8% supporting the repurchase of 4.6
million shares. It was a solid start to 2014 with execution on several strategic priorities. Next slide, P&L summary.
As I noted, reported sales increased 1% and underlying sales increased 3%. Gross profit margin expanded 20 basis
points or 60 basis points excluding one-time acquisition costs related to the previously announced Virgo and Enardo
transactions. Higher SG&A expense reflects a $30 million accelerated charitable contribution that was offset by related
tax benefits such that earnings per share was essentially neutral. Acquisition costs and charitable contributions
impacted EBIT margin about 90 basis points. The tax rate was lower from the contribution benefit and final items from
the embedded computing and power transaction. EPS of $0.65, up 5%, reflects the repurchase of 4.6 million shares for
about $300 million.
Next slide, sales by geography. The underlying sales increase of 3% was led by 10% growth in Asia, which includes a
14% increase in China. In other geographies, the U.S. was up 3%, Europe was flat, Latin America declined 1%, Canada
declined 5%, and Middle East and Africa grew 9%. Emerging markets were strong across the business segment, up 7%.
Moving to slide 5, segment earnings and cash flow. Profitability remained strong across the business segments with 40
basis points of margin improvement. Corporate expense was elevated due to the previously mentioned accelerated
charitable contributions of $30 million and acquisition costs of $21 million. Operating cash flow grew 8%, reflecting
earnings growth and lower working capital investment. Trade working capital as a percent of sales improved 90 basis
points, led by strong inventory performance.
Moving to slide 6, Process Management. Process Management underlying sales increased 5%, with North America up
4%, Asia up 14%, Europe up 3%, Latin America down 10%, and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Acquisitions
contributed 3%, resulting in net sales up 8%. Sustained strength in the oil, gas, power, and chemical industries continue
to drive growth. It was led by a near double-digit increase in the systems and solutions business, which was particularly
strong in China. North America accelerated with the U.S. up 6%, while project timing caused the decline in Latin
America sales, while orders increased at a double-digit rate. Process automation markets continue to support elevated
investment levels with a robust project pipeline, particularly in North America.
Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation underlying sales were flat, with North America unchanged,
Asia up 9%, Europe down 5%, Latin America up 3%, and Middle East and Africa up 18%. Industrial goods markets
reflected mix trends with strength in Asia, improvement in North America and softness in Europe. Emerging markets
were up high single digits. Growth in the fluid automation, motors and drives, electrical distribution, materials joining
businesses was offset by weakness in mechanical power transmission markets. Sales in the power generating alternators
business were flat with stable but sluggish markets. Market conditions are expected to slowly improve as demand
recovery and favorable comparisons support a modest growth outlook.
Moving to slide 8, Network Power. Network Power underlying sales increased 2% with North America up 1%, Asia up
2%, Europe up 1%, Latin America up 8%, and Middle East and Africa up 27%. The embedded computing and power
divestiture and currency translation deducted 13% for reported sales down 11%. Strong demand for global
telecommunications infrastructure and steady data center market conditions drove the growth.
Emerging markets were up double digits, led by Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Telecommunications end
markets were supported by 4G network investments globally. Data center investment growth in Asia and Europe was
offset by slower demand in the Americas. Profit margin declined primarily due to a $13 million one-time research and

development credit in the prior year. Market conditions are expected to be favorable in the meantime, supported by a
recovery in Europe and momentum in Asia.
Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 5%, with North America down 1%,
Asia up 13%, Europe up 5%, Latin America up 9%, and Middle East and Africa up 6%. Growth was supported by the
global refrigeration market recovery and stable air conditioning markets. U.S sales were mixed with double-digit
growth in temperature controls, weakness in service, and flat demand in air-conditioning after mid-teens growth in the
prior year.
Growth in China exceeded 20% with strength in air conditioning and refrigeration businesses. Europe improved as
well. Orders accelerated to 8% growth in the quarter, led by Asia and Europe. Growth momentum is expected to be led
by global refrigeration markets along with continued strength in the air-conditioning business.
Moving to slide 10, Commercial & Residential Solutions. Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying
sales increased 3%, with North America up 2%, Asia up 11%, Europe up 6%, Latin America up 6%, and Middle East
and Africa up 4%. Residential investment in North America continues to increase steadily, which drove growth in the
professional tools, food waste disposers, and storage businesses. Wet/dry vacuums business declined in large part due
to high demand in the prior year from Hurricane Sandy. Market conditions are expected to remain solid in the
near-term with support from continued North America residential momentum.
Next slide, 2014 outlook. Economic indicators remain mixed but trending slightly favorable as reflected in our
underlying orders, which have been trending in a 3% to 4% range for several months. We are expecting global
macroeconomic trends to remain favorable, supported by improved conditions in Europe.
Based on current market conditions our 2014 outlook is unchanged with underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%.
Reported sales are expected to change minus 1% to 1%, which reflects the embedded computing and power divestiture,
completed acquisitions and currency translation.
Margins are expected to expand approximately 0.5%, with the benefits from portfolio changes and the volume leverage
partially offset by accelerated strategic investments.
Earnings per share excluding goodwill and tax charges are expected to grow 4% to 7%. Business segment and other
financial metric forecasts will be provided at our Annual Investor Conference next week in Boston.
And with that summary of results, I will turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Pat. First of all I want to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully you guys won't get
too much snow. I'm looking out my conference room right now. We've got plenty of snow falling here in St. Louis, a
nice cold winter. Good for the oil and gas industry.
First quarter unfolded as we expected. From the standpoint of our financial forecast that we presented in November and
will update in details at the Investors Conference next week in Boston, it happened just like we believed it would
happen.
We will talk about the incremental investments next week and where they're going and why this is important. And what
you'll see and feel, why this is pretty strategic to us and why the timing is right now. I also intend to have five business
leaders with me next week in addition to my talk, so we'll have the five business leaders give a brief update on the key
issues that they're seeing, both from a business standpoint and the investment profile, give you a chance to give a
broader perspective of what's going on across this company.
I want to thank all the operational leaders for delivering in the first quarter, a good first quarter with underlying sales
actually a little bit over 3% in the 3.4% range. Order trends should continue to drive sequentially better sales, better
earnings, better margins, and growth in the next two quarters. From my perspective we have a good start, and things are

lining up for a very solid year, as we talked about back in November and we'll talk about next week.
New acquisitions are starting off well and will contribute EPS this year, even with the normal balance sheet accounting
actions we had to take in the first quarter, which is typical of this type of acquisitions, nothing unusual there. We've
done $1.2 billion. We still are targeting $1.5 billion for the year and with one small divestiture, which we hope to get
done in the proceeding second half of our fiscal year.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow was very good in the first quarter on top of last year's extremely strong first
quarter. And as I look at it right now, we're targeting somewhere around $3.4 billion or $3.5 billion in operating cash
flow. And we will continue to pay back money to our shareholders most likely in the 50% to 60% range this year, a
little bit under 60% given the fact that we're doing more acquisitions than we have in the last three years.
But overall very good cash flow performance, the balance sheet is in very good shape, and we have the flexibility and
the needs – or the flexibility and the ability to do what we need to do from acquisitions or investments internally or
paying money back to our shareholders.
As usual I'll give you a lot more details on the economic expectations, what we see both for the world in 2014 and over
the next couple years, and what that means to our various businesses. As I go in great detail along those lines, but just
to give you a little perspective right now, after taking a long trip around the world with adding a couple of their OC
members. As we look at the U.S.A. right now, it's getting – it is getting slightly better. We see the U.S.A. trends
improving, and we expect pretty good growth in the U.S.A. this year versus last year. Canada, getting a little bit better
though a very slow start. The weather's not been very good and – but we do expect Canada to have a regional growth
this year both as the oil and gas monies happen , and if we can figure out how to get that pipeline going at some point,
that would really help all of our investments up and down in Canada and the Midwest.
Europe – European trends continue to improve. Europe was flat in the quarter but all businesses were up except for one
which is Industrial Automation, and that was primarily driven because of the Caterpillar. But everybody else was up
and we had a good quarter in Europe. I expect that we'll continue to gain momentum. I do not expect that to be
super-fast growth, but improvement growth, which will help us in the United States and also help China. We'll talk
further about that next week.
Just coming back to the Middle East, I also see the Middle East doing well for us right now both in orders and sales and
expect Middle East potentially to be the strongest growth segment that we have or the area this year coming out of the
Middle East. China had a great start all across all businesses. The order pace was good. Yes, the news coming out of
China as things are slowing, that's nothing new. We do expect China to still have good growth here this year as we see
right now, and we'll see how that goes in the next couple of months. But right now, everything looks pretty good for us.
In total, Asia Pacific looks pretty good, driven by China and partly Southeast Asia, and hopefully India will hold in
there right now as it did in the – as the orders show right now.
Latin America will be okay growth this year. It won't be as good as last year in my opinion but still be positive,
probably high-single digit. Hopefully that will continue to strengthen, but overall as I unfold the year I like the pace, I
like where things are right now. We're making investments. I – in my opinion, all the operational performance was
delivered in the first quarter. Basically we talked about – we laid out in our targets and our financial plans, so I felt
good about it. And I am looking forward to seeing everyone next week in Boston, and to help Pat's job a lot easier, we
decided not to give any charts out this year. So it'll be really not to decide which ones we're going to put in, not put in.
So we'll have no charts and so that will be a lot easier for everybody. And Pat is dying right now because he's looking
forward to that conversation. But – so I look forward to seeing everybody next week and hopefully you guys will have
reasonable weather for the next couple of days and not get snowed in.
So with that, let's open the floor for questions and see what's on your guys' mind. Thank you.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, Dave.
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: Hi, John.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Dave, could you talk a little bit about your emerging market exposures, what you're seeing and
maybe exclude China? And the question is sort of how the cadence of emerging market trends played out over the
quarter and kind of how you're thinking about it this year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Sure. I went through a little bit there. From my perspective right now in the emerging markets,
the Middle East looks still pretty good. I was just saying the order pace is good. I expect them to have a good year. I
wouldn't be surprised if they're not the strongest, fastest growth rate, high single digit maybe even getting close to 10%.
India is a market I'm concerned about. And by factoring in the – so I think I'm looking at Asia being somewhere in the
6% to 8%. I'm factoring in basically a challenging year in India. We'll see how that performs. I'm a little bit concerned
about India. Southeast Asia looks pretty good. Obviously, the timeline thing bothers me a little bit from this
perspective. Our business has not been disruptive yet but there's a potential or good chance that it could be disruptive as
this gets a little bit more widespread.
Coming back into Latin America, the order pace looks pretty good. We have some delays relative to what's going on in
Mexico because the law changes which are going to be very good relative to the energy marketplace. It will be good for
us. That slows us down relative to sales. Overall, I'm pretty confident that our Mexican and our Latin American
business will be high single-digit for the year. Africa is doing okay. Eastern Europe, right now, it's starting to improve.
I would say if Europe continues to trend upward then we'll see Eastern Europe doing okay this year. So my biggest
concern right now in emerging markets would be probably down deep into the Latin America and Brazil. Brazil region,
Venezuela region and I am also concerned about India at this point in time. But that's my perspective and I think China
from – the way our will line up, I think we'll do okay in China this year.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. Hey, David, if we were to look at Network Power, how were
margins ex-embedded computing? And I'm really sort of is there a way to kind of parse out the margins
year-over-year? Like who did the margins perform ex-embedded, I think you still have kind of this part of that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, they were still slightly down based on some of the investments and restructuring things
we're doing right now. But we see – they were where we thought they would be for the start of this year. We have a lot
going on relative to Network Power relative to new products and changing things like that. So from a market
performance standpoint, I'm pleased with Network Power's unfolding, but they were still slightly down even if you take
out the embedded piece. But they're in good shape. They had – orders were positive, sales were positive, Europe was
positive, Asia was very positive. So right now, I think Network Power is on track to have a much better year than they
did last year which is important for us.
<Q - John G. Inch>: The fact that you don't have embedded in the business and you once did low teens margins. Is
there some dynamic given the fact that I agree the business is getting better but there's still a lot of mix questions, right?
Is there some reason why you don't think this business over time, so obviously not 2014, couldn't get back to kind of a
low teens margin?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, our plan is to get it back in that low teens margin, that 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%. Yes, we are.
We expect that, that's where it will go. I mean the fundamentals are there. I mean right now, we have significant
investments as we're rebuilding in the technologies, we're rebuilding in some global sales positions and technology
positions. So we expect that to figure back up in that range. That business fundamentally should be there.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey. Dave, hoping you could expand on your comment on process and the robust pipeline. I
know you choose your words carefully and that sounds pretty positive and you highlighted North America. Maybe just
take us in, what are the end markets? What are the customers telling you and when did these turn into revenue?
<A - David N. Farr>: From our perspective right now in North America, we are starting to see some of the
downstream investments from all the strength that the oil, the real oil and the gas coming out of the North America.
We're starting to see the investments are happening across the southern part of this America, and the project is being let
go right now. We will start getting some sales late this year. As you remember, I said all along our profits would be –
the growth would be a little bit more real end loaded because of some of these projects. So from my perspective right
now, our project business both here in the Americas is looking pretty good. Also, Asia is still looking very, very good. I
think we're going to have another record-setting year, both in bookings and sales in Asia, and I'm pleasantly surprised
at the investment profile even coming out of the Middle East in the oil and gas area.
So I would expect based on the pipeline we're seeing right now, based on the level of activity from the bidding
standpoint that we should have a very good process here again this year. Obviously, we're coming off a very high
levels, and I don't – right now, I do not anticipate getting double-digit top line sales, but I expect to us have high single
digit type of growth sales out of these guys, but it's setting up very nicely, and obviously, we continue to make very
good money and profitability and invest a lot in this business too.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Okay. That's real helpful. And just given all the headlines on some of the Latin America
currencies, you all are one of the very few that engages in hedging practices. So this might be a good opportunity just to
refresh everyone on the hedging and how perhaps any of the currency swings affect you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah. I mean the only hedging we do right now is at the operational level from the standpoint of
buying and selling goods, but that's the sort of transactional that flows in and out. There is not much going on. We don't
hedge a whole lot. Obviously, the currency right now the weakness, and the Brazilian real is not a good thing. But
sometimes we have swings in the quarter because what happens, a lot of our global contracts in the process, in
particular, are done in dollars and they go back and forth, they true-up by year-end, but we're not doing a whole lot of
hedging right now. But, yes, clearly, the weakening of southern currencies are severely disturbing from the standpoint
of overall business and what's going to happen down there. So that's why I am more cautious about Latin America than
my internal people would be. Let's put it that way. I think to your point, though, there's going to be a concern there.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Understood. All right, we'll hear more about that in Boston.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, Deane. Travel safely.

<A - David N. Farr>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi.
<A - David N. Farr>: Are you guys getting a lot of snow?
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Yesterday, some, but it's pretty much gone now.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: In terms of the – you talked about the accelerated investments back in November and I
guess did you see kind of the normal run rate for the year in Q1? Because I guess your clean gross margin was up 60
bps, your SG&A to sales ex the charitable stuff was flattish, so it didn't – from the outside, it wasn't obvious that you'd
stepped up investments. I just wondered if that was something that you've done and just absorbed it in the operational
leverage.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say we did it and we absorbed it in operational leverage, but also – it will grow bigger
as the year goes on, but we still did pretty good job of actually absorbing some of the start of this investments. And
clearly, we got very close to 3.5% underlying sales growth for the quarter, that's a good number for us. Once we get in
that 3.5% range, we do leverage a little bit better as we move towards 4%, it's even better. So clearly, we are – the
investment dollars will ramp up as the year goes on, Julian, and I'm hoping that – hopefully we'll have pretty good
leverage as the year goes on too. So maybe a little bit slightly better profitability, but we've got to get the sales, that's
key for us right now.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then within Industrial Automation, yeah, you've done a lot of restructuring
there the last four years or so. The margins were down slightly, I guess, even with revenues being up. Was there
anything – was that because of, I don't know, decremental margins within power transmission, or was there anything
kind of special going on there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Nothing special, just some tough mix for the quarter and some investments going forward. So I
mean that's a little bit of mixed noise from quarter to quarter that move around, but overall, the profitability of that
business should be pretty good again this year as it was last year.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just lastly, within your U.S. process business, you reiterated the fact
that sales should pick up later in the year from downstream projects. I guess, was the 6% growth in the U.S. we saw in
the December quarter, was that a surprise, just the base was very, very difficult, but you still grew 6%, I guess, even
without these projects coming through?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I would say it's probably – I was pleasantly surprised at how the U.S. did. The U.S. did a
little bit better than I thought they would. I actually thought we would grow a little bit in the quarter in Europe, but we
didn't, but as I look at the first quarter, I was pleasantly surprised in the U.S. I was hoping a little bit of growth out of
Europe. I was disappointed in Latin America, which did not grow in that and so we saw better growth in the U.S., and
not as much growth in Latin America. So I think those are the three surprises I saw in the quarter.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. Take care.

right now. And we're aggressively going after that business. We want to make sure we protect our installed base there.
And that is one of the biggest telecom investments you're going to see in China for the next couple years. And we want
to make sure we have our adequate fair share of that.
So I would say that's the place that we've had to sharpen our pencil the most around the world. And other than that
pricing is holding in there pretty well right now. We might see a little bit of squeeze in if some of the commodity
pressure keeps dropping down. But right now, from a price cost standpoint, we're in pretty good shape. Would you say
so, Frank?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yes, yes, we were positive for the quarter, and I think we're pretty much on our plan for
the year right now.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we'll get an update here in February as the guys come in for President's Council, but
nothing surprising. I don't think you're going to see much overall movement positive or negative around. I mean we
might be like I said I think in November, slightly positive or slightly negative. We're going to be pretty tight this one.
There's not a lot of movement right now.
<Q - Joshua C. Pokrzywinski>: Got you. So the pressure, or I guess design pressure on your end in embedded – or
not, I'm sorry, not embedded, Network Power in China right now, playing for the rest of the year as you see it today?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say that we're going to close that a little bit. We'll probably end up being a little bit red
there by the end of the year, but it will be less red than it is today.
<Q - Joshua C. Pokrzywinski>: Got you. All right, thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. Thank you. I'll see you next week hopefully.

Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. So Dave, I mean you clearly sound more positive on Europe. I mean I know it was
only flat in the quarter, but things seem to be getting better there. How positive does the turn kind of in capital
investment plans feel there? And how much do you think Europe could actually grow?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm going to talk about that next week. But right now my gut tells me that we're not looking for a
big turn. I mean I'm looking probably for Europe in the 1% to 2% type of growth range for us. I look at the GFI
probably growing 2% to 3% type next year.
I mean the trend lines continue to improve. Clearly we need to get it towards that 2% range or the 3% range in GFI to
help us a little bit more, but I was pleasantly surprised at what I'm hearing in Europe from our customer base and also
from our own guys internally. And that's going to be very important from my perspective, the way I see the world is
China. If Europe starts growing again in output, and you're going to see China be helped, and then you'll see us be
helped and so – the U.S. helped. So I think that's a key thing in the world doing well next year. If Europe stalls, then I
think you'll see the global economy stall again. And that I think Europe's going to be the key driver of this thing.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And on process in terms of this pipeline, the pickup in the second half of 2014
that you have been talking about, what's the tail like on that accelerated growth once it starts going? I mean how long is
this pipeline going to run when we start to think into 2015-plus?
<A - David N. Farr>: If the pipeline actually gets built, and they start actually flowing the oil down into the southern
part of the United States, then you could see for many years, being like two, three, four years, a pretty significant build
out of what I'd call say downstream type of businesses across Louisiana and the Texas and Oklahoma region.
People talk about, oh there's only 50 new jobs because of the pipeline. But that doesn't take into consideration that if
you build that pipeline and you have that steady stream of oil coming just like the gas pipelines that are being built right
now, the manufacturing and downstream production will happen in that region. And we will have a lot more
high-paying jobs. First of all to build those factories; and secondly to operate those factories. And those are skilled jobs
when you're looking at be it refining or chemical, whatever type of process you're looking at. Those are pretty good
jobs. And those are ones that will come down the road. That would be more in the 2015, 2016 time range. So it'd be
very positive.

Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve. Did you make the show in New York in the HVAC? Or was it more too
cold, so you couldn't [indiscernible] (30:56)?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: No, I made it. I saw your guys there.
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh my goodness.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: And yeah some good technology. Good technology.
<A - David N. Farr>: Was it a heating show or an air-conditioning show?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Well when I walked across town about five blocks in the snow, I was wishing it was a heating
show, but it was pretty cold so.
But back to business. On Network Power so could you just give us the actual embedded sales and profit you booked in
the quarter? I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean by the margin was still down a little bit
ex-embedded. Does that mean down a little bit ex-embedded, stripping it out of the first quarter of 2013 as well? Or
down from the 7.2%? Just wondering what the run rate is in the second quarter here?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're going give it to you right now, hold still, hold still.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Steve, this is Frank. Hang on one second here.
<A - David N. Farr>: This is because I'm not going to give anybody any charts, so we're going to give you actual
numbers. This is a trade-off, because no one gets charts, you get blamed. You get this information is because you get
this information, no one gets charts. So...
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: So it raises the margin for both 2013 and 2014 when you strip it out of both years, but the
delta actually gets a little bit worse.
<A - David N. Farr>: What were sales last year in the ...?

<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: It was essentially breakeven sales last year. We booked about $315 million this year,
closer to $150.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So $150 million at breakeven?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yes. Basically, yes.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So I don't know, it's like a lows – like mid 7%, low to mid 7% type margin? And am I
doing the math right?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: When you strip it out, yeah, no, it's a little higher than that.
<A - David N. Farr>: It's higher. Yeah, approximately what?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: It's about 8%.
<A - David N. Farr>: 8%
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. 8%. Now the seasonality here, Dave, as we move through the year, I mean, historically, at
least in the last several years, it's just been kind of like first and second quarter even, and then you kind of see a little bit
of a ramp in the second half. I mean is that how we think about the second quarter margin for these guys kind of in that
similar range?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, I think across all of Emerson our seasonal pattern is pretty similar. The first quarters are
weakest, and then second gets a little bit better, and then third and then fourth. Sometimes third's even better than
fourth. But third and fourth are just – clearly were always the second. It's just the way our customer base is the way our
– the type of channel we have here. That's the way it is. So it's going to be first, second, third, fourth. I would say that's
how it's going to go.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then sequentially on the total sales for next quarter, I guess last several years you've
been kind of a high single-digit sales number. Obviously, you have some headwind from embedded. So just for total
Emerson, kind of mid-single-digit sequential sales increase first to second quarter? Is that the right seasonality?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, I think right now what we're looking at more would be, if we did about – we're going to be
in the fours, I would say. I think right now the order – the order pattern is pretty important to us. January was not a
great month for anybody as you've been hearing everywhere I mean that we lost a lot of days.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: How bad was January? Was it down?
<A - David N. Farr>: We lost several days. I don't know the exact numbers right now. Just anecdotal, I mean, because
we lost two or three days in a lot of businesses. And so I would expect, and our customers did too. So I expect that if
this weather stays up like this, there's a lot of people losing today again too.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. What...sorry, go ahead.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, go ahead. So I would expect we're going to be – I mean the numbers I'm looking at right
now for the quarter, I'd be looking at 4%, 4.5% range for underlying sales growth.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: For underlying year-over-year sales growth for the total company?
<A - David N. Farr>: That's correct.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: And then one last quick one just on China. I know you've got some dynamics around Process
and Network Power, but I guess in just kind of the general industrial you're seeing in China there has been a bit of an
uptick for a couple of peers. I think Siemens and Rockwell talked about it. It doesn't appear that that economy is getting
like materially better. Is that – are there some stocking dynamics going on there do you think? Is there – how do you
think about just kind of like general industrial demand in China?

<A - David N. Farr>: Our general industrial businesses, it was very strong in the quarter both in sales. I mean we are
strong across the board in China in sales and orders in the first quarter. It had been very weak for about 18 months. The
climate guys started leading out, if you remember correctly, last year late. And so we're starting to see – there's not a
channel building here because this is not a channel business, that much of business for us. We're seeing pretty much a
lot of the people starting to invest, continue to invest in the productivity. They've got their capacity right sized, and so
right now I just came back from meetings with all my agent leaders that we saw a very good first quarter. We still feel
very good about the second quarter. And so if we see orders and we see a good quarter in the second quarter in China
then I might feel very good about the year there.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Rich.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Two quick ones. On Process, the margin was pretty good this quarter and last quarter, Dave,
you talked about MRO potentially picking up in North America. Did that come through maybe earlier than expected?
<A - David N. Farr>: We did see some good MRO in the quarter, yes, we did. And I don't have the full analyzing. I
don't ask them to do it every quarter but I would say that also tells me we can have a lot of big projects flowing through
there either at this point in time. So we had a lot of MRO. So it was just overall – it was a good mix. It was the right
mix for us. Sometimes you get lucky but I would say MRO came especially since you saw North America do well too.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: All right. So the way to think about it going forward is the mix probably gets a little less
favorable.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say so. As we go into the second half this year, we're going to start seeing some more –
I would see some more margins squeeze. We'll still do okay for the year. We'll still do very well for the margin for the
year but I would say that we could see some squeeze. Another thing going for us too is we're going to have some good
growth in the acquisitions we've made too which are a pretty good help us there too. So it's going to be an interesting
dynamic. I expect good pretty things out of Process this year.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. And then in a network with UPS, in North America, it's been pretty tepid for a while now
based on your order commentary and the results. What are the dynamics there? What are you seeing out there
competitively? It doesn't sound like anybody is knocking the cover off the ball but how you think this plays out over
the course of the next 12 to 18 months in terms of growth?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think we and our competitors are going to start seeing a better market dynamic in the UPS
here. We're actually seeing the orders now and as you know the UPS has a little bit longer lead times because of big
systems. So, I was in Italy I saw that the pipeline there and I've heard what the pipeline here is in North America. So I
think you're going to see UPS which have been weak for the last – you're right, the last 18 months for all of us. You're
going to start seeing better investments. We're actually seeing better UPS business outside the United States right now
because there is some big projects being done outside the United States by some of the big data center. So – and the
cloud data centers. Right now, based on the pipeline and based on the order pace, I think you're going to start seeing
North America and UPS do better.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay, great. See you next week.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. See you next week. Look forward to it.

Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steven.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Nice to hear you speaking positively about manufacturing and a U.S. insurgence whether
it's a pipeline or anything else.
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm a very pro-American guy. I'm from the Midwest. We're very positive people out here.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Excellent. So let me...
<A - David N. Farr>: Can win World Series.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Well, there's always next year, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much. I appreciate that opportunity.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: So can you just talk a little bit about acquisitions in your strategy? You did Virgo] and
Enardo. Those obviously give you quite a lot additional capability. Should we be thinking about this on a more
aggressive basis going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: As I said, we'll going to probably do another $300 million this year. We would like to do – we
would like stay focused on this $1 billion to $1.5 billion type of bolt-on acquisitions over the next couple of years. As I
talk about next week that's what I'm going talk about, we're going to be looking at that level type of acquisitions. These
are ones that we're courting. These are ones that we're working. The timing is not always – we don't drive the timing.
We work hard but that's the type of acquisition we're going to do. We did one in Network Power. A nice solutions
service type business there. We get a couple of acquisitions in the Process in the first quarter. So you're going to see us
do those in Process, some in the Network Power, some Industrial Automation and some in climate along those type of
things. Nothing that real big. Maybe ranging anywhere from $30 million up to the $500 million range. That's our focus
point right now.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. And I know you talked about January before a little bit on weather, but if
you think about the PMIs that you are actually staring at coming out recently, obviously for the U.S. but elsewhere too.
Are you as confident – I mean is there anything that sort of impacted your confidence level on that? Or you are just
saying, you know what, we are seeing what we are seeing in our portfolio, so it has got to be weather and move on?
And it will get better in a couple months. How are you thinking about that, Dave?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, the numbers that came out yesterday didn't surprise me, because we had all the business
leaders in last week and we had heard – we run a 4-4-5 type of company or a 4-4-5.5, that means we close after four
weeks in a month. So, we already knew what January was going to be like from a business there. So, we lost days in
North America. We lost days around the world at some point, because of the weather. So the numbers didn't surprise
me, and I mean, our customers are still optimistic, what we're seeing is still very positive. So I think that they will come
back. If the weather stays like this for the next couple of months, you'll lose some more sloppiness and obviously, make
February and March much harder, but right now, I feel pretty good. The China numbers didn't surprise me at all. I mean
given where the Chinese New Year fell and what's going on with governments trying to play around the shadow
banking a little bit, trying to play it out a little bit, but overall, my customer base in China is still pretty positive, so
nothing surprising there.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm – nothing surprising there.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And maybe just before I go, could you just address quickly that then what you're
seeing in terms of non-res momentum? And then you mentioned the power transmission side as well.
<A - David N. Farr>: The non-res, the enquiries, the things we're hearing in the United States relative to non-res
construction are positive. We haven't seen a lot of order pace yet on it. We're seeing a lot of enquiries, we're seeing a lot
of planning around it and so from even from our perspective today, we went to our board on two North America
non-res constructions that will unfold as the year unfolds and goes into next year. So, I think that all of us has kept our
capacity real low. We've worked it down, in fact, we've taken it down after the 2008 crash and now we're starting to
work it back up again. So, I think it's going to unfold here. I think non-res will start picking up, it's not going to be an
explosion, but I think it's going to pick up as the year goes on.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: All right. All right. I'll see you next week. Thanks, Dave.

Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Dave, is this the portfolio you have that you are going to ride for the year? Is this – are you
fairly committed to what you have? Just reading your annual report, it seems like this is the game plan. Is that accurate?
<A - David N. Farr>: That's accurate except for one small divestiture this year which is, that's where we'll ride this
year right now, and I'm particularly interested in getting North America and particularly the U.S. to strengthen
improvement, and then I think we'll talk about next week that I have – we have plans that in the next couple of years
that we would most likely see $1 billion to $1.5 billion type of divestiture. So you'll see that talk about that next week.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the strategic investments, are these long – what's the mix of
kind of long-term, short-term projects? When I think about ERP systems and things like that they tend to last three or
four years, but are a lot of the strategic investments you made things that we could be fairly confident will be over with
in 2014?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think you're going to – yeah, I think you're going to see us -some of these things are going to
last up two or three years. That's the type of investment period we're seeing here. We'll talk – I'll talk about how you're
going to see a little bit of tweaking up in a couple of areas and we'll see the numbers, and we'll talk about those. But all
of them will start paying back in my opinion as we leave this year and start getting to next year, in particular, ones in
some of the service side that we're investing and some in the technology side that we're investing. And those will pay
back much faster than a, let's say, the Oracle type of investments or customers facing that stuff. I mean – so the
majority of the investments we're talking about are going to be ones and will start paying back late this year and start
feeding this next year a little bit too. So it's self-funding here as we build on.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up, and sorry if you already answered this question.
But in the alternator business, we've had several quarters of inventory de-stock. Is that pretty much done at this point?
<A - David N. Farr>: They're going sideways right now, yes.

Your next question comes from Brian Langenberg with Langenberg & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Thank you. Hey, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Brian.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Good afternoon. I just want to ask the same question in a slightly different way, it's an
analyst thing, with Europe.
<A - David N. Farr>: And I'll see if I can answer the same way.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: No, you can't.
<A - David N. Farr>: Go ahead and ask the question.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: You have to answer the same way differently.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, exactly.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: With Europe obviously it's a big place. Dive a little bit deep here. Talk about the short
cycle versus maybe capital spending driven. And then the second part of this is, there's somebody doing something in
Europe for Europe, and there's in Europe for someplace else. So the best that you can maybe talk about what you've
been seeing in Europe in that way and color the commentary that way if you would? Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. So the first question is on short cycle, long cycle. The short-cycle business is, I mean I
would say right now is what's really driving us at this point in time. The longer cycle business is just starting to unfold
as I see it. It's early days. We're starting to – just the order pace we see it. We see it coming as the activity people
talking about it coming at us.
So right now what has been driving this shorter cycle type of stuff, MRO business or some of the consumer or light
industrial stuff, and that has been driving us here a little bit. I expect the longer cycle stuff in order for our year to
unfold, and I'm talking 3% to 5% with 3.5% in the first quarter underlying growth, and I'm talking over 4% in the
second quarter. We're expecting some of that longer-cycle stuff to start kicking in for us.
In Europe right now we've actually seen some of our – outside Europe improving. Europe for Europe has not improved
as much. But Europe for outside Europe is starting to improve, and that's a good sign.
And so from my perspective if the economic numbers and underlying GDP or gross fixed investment continue to
improve, you're going to see – then you'll start seeing investments in Europe for Europe.
Italy is still a concern. The southern part of the countries in Europe is still a concern. France, we haven't seen much
recovery in France yet. But there is enough going on in Europe right now that for the exporting type of business, that's
a good sign. And if China continues to improve then you'll see that will help us too.

seemed to be resolved fairly quickly.
<A - David N. Farr>: We haven't seen it yet. I was talking to the guys about it. They are definitely even though we
had a very good month and quarter on receivables, the receivable issue in China is still there. They're very slow paying.
But they're getting access to money. It got a little tighter a couple quarters ago, but it seemed to unfold a little but right
now.
And I think the government is trying very carefully to figure how to rein this down slowly without totally crushing
things. But right now it's okay. But the receivable is definitely spread out a little bit, and that's something we'll be
working pretty hard. We don't have much in the company bad debt. The company decides our bad debt at the end of the
year is what, $7 million?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: $10 million.
<A - David N. Farr>: $10 million. So we don't have much but it's something I'm going to watch very closely here.
<Q - Adam Michael Baumgarten>: Got you. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeremie.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Question on pricing, could you talk about pricing across your businesses? I mean Industrial
Automation and Network Power margins are down. I'm wondering if there's anything related to pricing here? And then
more generally across the other business platforms as well.
<A - David N. Farr>: As I mentioned earlier, Jeremie, the pricing across our businesses right now in this quarter was
pretty good. Everyone was slightly positive. When we look at the price cost, it was green across the whole company.
And then if you look at Network Power, it's more of a mix issue. We've gone after – strategically we want to make sure
we play in the rollout of China Mobile with the 4G. And the other thing is that we have some new product coming out
in North America on our precision cooling platform, a much broader platform. It's a newer product, which from a cost
standpoint is a little bit high. And we don't have our costs quite in line yet with what the selling price is. So there's a
little bit of squeeze there.
But it's more of a mix thing in Network Power at this point in time. And that's where it is. It's pretty good, and I expect
it to be decent for the year for us.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Great. And then could we go back to the alternators business? You're talking about a
stabilization here? I'm wondering could you comment on the extent of the decline that you've experienced here over the
past year or so?
<A - David N. Farr>: We've not given those numbers out. It was quite significant as the numbers. And I'm sure I mean
we'll pull something together if you're going to be there next week, we'll try to talk about it a little bit. I don't want to
give you a number off the top of my head right here, but it's not something I will go talk about either.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: We can give you a general feel. Let's put it this way. It's got a 2 in front of it.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, John.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: So two quick questions. First, in Network Power can you talk about how demand was in the
sort of office LAN environment? I know you've talked about data center pretty well. But can you talk about that LAN
opportunity? And then, secondly, within Climate Technologies in the U.S., if you could just talk about the dynamics of
that field services business and when we should see that rebound? Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah on the LAN I don't have that type of detail. What we'll do is I'll talk to Scott Barbour, he'll
be there next week, and we will be webcasting. So why don't we find out a little bit, give a little bit of color on that on
the LAN, because I don't want to make something up, John. Some people accuse me of making things up, but I don't
want to do it.
Now relative to Climate Technologies and the Service, I think the key issue there is we just – we've seen just an
unbelievably weak replacement type of marketplace right now. People are either putting whole new systems in or
they're working on the heating system because we're just not seeing much. It's been over a year that we've seen a very
weak replacement. And so I would expect we would see an improvement when the spring comes that people – they're
going to evaluate, do we put a whole new system in or do you repair? If your heating went out which we saw a lot of
people here in the St. Louis in the early heat wave, a lot of heaters went out, they replaced the whole system. There
wasn't repair going on. So I'm hoping that we'll see as the spring – we'll see a recovery in that repair cycle. A very nice
part of our business, which has been down for almost a year and a half and maybe two years now and a profitable side
of our business there too. So – and that's our current feel. We don't have anything better than that at this point in time.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, John.

Your next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: Good afternoon. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jamie.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: So maybe just to follow on to that question. Just more generally about climate in the U.S. with
some of those puts and takes. How you're kind of thinking about those dynamics for the year with, you mentioned, AC
flat, field service was feeling some pressure. It sounds like you might improve in this spring, maybe just more broadly
in the U.S. how you're thinking about climate?
<A - David N. Farr>: Broadly in climate U.S., I feel we have a good year. I mean on the AC side, just look at the AC
side, the housing I think you're going – the housing continues to be okay, I think it's been several years now that we
have not seen a strong HVAC marketplace in North America. I'm feeling there is going to be a better one this year,
inventories are extremely, extremely low right now. On the refrigeration side we've seen the marine business pop back
which is a good sign. If we actually are correct about non-res picking back up as the year progresses, you'll start seeing
some of our non-res business improve too and the refrigeration side will improve. And then the only call on the
replacement market will be is that people have the money to spend and they feel like they're spending the money.

They will – the replacement market will soon come back up. I feel pretty good about climate technology in North
America this year. I feel good about in Asia, good about in Europe. We've had a couple – two flat years in climate.
They are due to have, what I call, a solid breakout year because there is still – we'll talk a little bit about this through
the cycle. There is still, I believe, 5% to 7% underlying growth companies globally and they need to be at the high end
of that cycle this year.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: That's helpful.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's where it is.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, Jamie. I'll see you – you'll be there next week?
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: I am. Could I squeeze in one last one before we go?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, if it's a decent question, yes, Jamie. I'll take it. If it's not decent, I'm just going to hang up,
okay?
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: All right. Fair enough.
<A - David N. Farr>: No pressure on you. No pressure.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: No pressure. So just on the Network Power margins, I think you said for the full year pro forma
there were around 10.5 in 2013. Is that right? I think you said that last quarter. I'm just wondering how you're thinking
about...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: ...this year relative to that? It sounds like some pressure relative to that.
<A - David N. Farr>: What we're trying to do is I would expect – we're not trying to get much margin improvement
this year out of Network Power. What I'm trying to do right now is we are making some strategic investments. We are
trying to get the business moving on a positive top line basis and I hope a slight improvement in margin, but that is not
my focus in this business. We have gone through – we have torn this business apart. We have been making some
significant investments. We want this business to have a positive top line. And then I expect if that happens, you will
start seeing the margin improvement. And so we are looking at margin, slight margin improvement, that's the game
plan this year, but the game for me is growth. I want some positive growth like we saw in the first quarter. That's
important for me. And the new products are coming off. So that's why our focus is in that business this year.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: Thanks very much. We'll see you next week then.
<A - David N. Farr>: See you next week, Jamie. You didn't get the X button, you are lucky. You didn't ask about
Obamacare or something like that, man. Did you get your healthcare plan yet?
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: I got mine.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's good. Yeah, everyone at this company has got one too.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: All right. Thanks a lot.
David N. Farr
Take care, everybody. I want to – that's it. I want to thank everybody. I'm looking forward to seeing everybody next
week again. The first quarter unfolded like we thought it would and we're still – we still feel good about the year. We
still feel good about the recovery, and I'm looking and obviously feeling a little bit better about a stronger second
quarter at their normal progression. Look forward to talking to people next week, and I'm looking for Pat to talk about

why we're not handing a chart out next week. I mean that should be an interesting conversation. I mean this will be
good send-off for Pat to figure out how to explain to you guys you get no charts. I mean, just give them a booklet of
blank pages. That's what I think I would do.
Pat, take care and have a great one. Be safe.
