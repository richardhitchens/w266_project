MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference
Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I
would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be part of our fourth quarter 2012 earnings

followed by a question-and-answer period. On the call with us today are Don Bailey, Head of Emerging Businesses and
Encompass; Don Civgin, Head of Allstate Financial and Insurance; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Sam
Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, Head of Auto, Home and Agencies.
Last night we issued our press release and investor supplement as well as posted a slide presentation to be used in
conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are available on our website. We plan to file our 10-K for 2012 by the

Beginning with the first slide, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations,
and actual results may differ materially from those statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2011, our 10-Q for the
third quarter 2012, and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will
contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website.
A recording of this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up
questions you may have once this call is completed.
Now let's begin with Tom.
Thomas J. Wilson
Well, good morning, and thanks again for your interest in Allstate. Today, I'll cover our results in relationship to our
strategy in 2012 priorities, then I'll cover our priorities for 2013. Bob will cover our business unit results, and Steve will
cover investment performance and capital management.
But before we go through with 2012, let me just update everybody on Sandy and the progress we've made in helping
our customers restore their lives. So, as you know, Sandy was a huge storm that affected an enormous heavily
populated area and, of course, many of you personally. We were one of the first insurance companies on the scene to
help our customers. With our mobile units, we often got to customers' homes before they even called us.
We've received about 170,000 claims to date, we've closed 98% of the claims reported, and we've paid out about 95%
of our expected net losses. Now we did update our initial loss estimate which was, as you'll remember, $1.075 billion to
$1.117 billion, that's a $42 million increase. And our losses of course would have been significantly higher had we not
taken the actions we did to reduce our catastrophic exposure over the prior six years.
And of course while the numbers are large, the real significance is the fabulous work that Allstaters have done for our
customers, whether that's our claim professionals, the local agency owners, or the thousands of other team members
across the country that sort of rose to the occasion, helping those people rebuild their lives. We're very proud of what
we have accomplished, and we know our customers are happy as well.
Our customer-focus strategy is to provide unique products and services to distinct customer segments, which is based
on their preferences for price, service and delivery channel, and that's shown on Slide 2; there's the four segments we
have there.
The Allstate brand serves customers who prefer local advice and assistance in branded products, that's in the lower left
side of that slide. In 2012, we introduced or expanded new products and services like Claim Sat Guarantee, Drive Wise,
Good Hands Roadside, and House & Home, to differentiate Allstate from the competition.
The Allstate brand profitably grew the top line in 2012, primarily on the strength of increased average premium for
auto and homeowners. It generated a total underlying combined ratio in the mid-80s. Now policies in force did decline
for the full year, but in the fourth quarter we began to reduce the negative impact of auto profitability improvement
actions in New York and Florida, and our long-term program to raise returns in the homeowners business.
Allstate brand premium growth did accelerate at the end of the year in auto, homeowners, emerging businesses and
Canada. Esurance, which served the self-directed customer segment in the lower right, continued to exceed
expectations from a top line perspective of producing net written premiums of over $1 billion for the year and unit
growth at 31% year-over-year. The combined ratio remains elevated given the rapid growth, but we continue to
monitor the long-term profit estimates and adjust pricing as needed, and we're comfortable with the economics of that
business.
The advice-seeking brand-neutral customer segment is in the upper left; that's served by Encompass, which of course
distributes through independent agencies. Our strategy is to serve this market with a differentiated package policy. That
gained traction throughout 2012 with top-line growth of 5.3% compared to 2011, and 8.2% in the fourth quarter versus
the fourth quarter of 2011. The underlying combined ratio is 96 for the year, but given the property risk in that

business, we need to further improve profitability in that segment.
Answer Financial is in the upper right; that serves self-directed brand-neutral customers, the [ph] growth spring (5:55)
policies and leads received from Esurance and third parties. This business generated non-proprietary premiums, which
don't show up in our top line, of over $400 million for the year. This represents an increase of 9% from 2001. So these
results show that our strategy of providing differentiated products and services to unique customer segments is
working.
We also had strong operating results in 2012, as shown on Slide 3. On a consolidated basis, we generated $2.3 billion
in net income, that's an increase of $1.5 billion from 2011...
Unverified Participant
No, I just moved it down. You said you didn't want it to get any hotter so I read that as make it a little cooler. It's 71
I've moved it to. I moved it down one degree.
Thomas J. Wilson
Is somebody not on mute? Okay. Well, with that weather forecast, let me keep going.
So operating income grew to $2.1 billion. Our book value per share rose over 17% to $42.39 per share, that's at the
year-end 2012. We produced a net income return on equity of 11.9% and an operating income ROE of 12.4%. The
underlying property liability combined ratio was 87.2, which compares favorably to our outlook range of 88 to 91 set at
this time last year. That was the result of both excellent execution and favorable weather.
As we discussed throughout 2012, we had four priorities for that year. One, maintain auto profitability, two, raise
returns in the homeowners annuity businesses, three, we wanted to grow insurance premiums and, four, proactively
manage our investments and capital. And we established all of those goals last year.
We maintained auto profitability with the Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio of 96.1, which was a slight
increase from 2011; that's primarily due to the effects of Sandy. The underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand
standard auto was 94.0, which is compared to 95.3 in 2011.
Homeowners profitability was improved with an underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand homeowners of 65.1,
that's a 5.8-point improvement in 2011. The recorded combined ratio for the year was 88.0, which included Sandy and
the other catastrophes we experienced throughout 2012, but it was helped by prior year catastrophe reserve releases.
This result shows that our efforts over the last four years are working. We also benefited from milder-than-expected
weather outside of catastrophes, which we do not expect to be the case in 2013. Annuity returns also improved on
strong limited partnership income results. That said, low interest rates will continue to put negative pressure on the
returns from this line.
In total, property-liability net written premiums grew 4% from 2011, as we just discussed. Additionally, issued life
insurance policies through the Allstate agencies increased 9.3% for the year while Allstate benefits grew new business
written premium by 6.5% over the prior year. Our investment portfolio generated a total return of 7.3%, reflecting
proactive portfolio actions and the decline in interest rates. Our portfolios have been supported by strong limited
partnership results mostly offsetting the downward pressure caused by lower reinvestment rate.
From a capital management perspective, we repurchased $910 million worth of our shares in 2012, that was after
completing the $1 billion buyback we started last year, in 2011. And then we initiated another $1 billion buyback in
December to be funded by issuing a like amount of subordinated debentures. When you add in dividends, we returned
over $1.3 billion to shareholders. Reflecting the confidence in the execution of our strategy and operating plans, we
raised the quarterly dividend by 13.6% to $0.25 per share for the first quarter of this year and we authorized an
additional $1 billion share buyback to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014.

Looking forward for 2013, our priorities are very similar to last year's, but with the increased emphasis on growth. If
you go to Slide 4, to grow our insurance premiums, maintain auto profitability, raise returns in homeowners and
annuity businesses, and proactively manage our investments. We're adding a fifth priority, which is to reduce our cost
structure. Now, effective expense management has always been a part of our disciplined approach to business, we
always work hard on keeping our expenses down. But given the difficult economic climate our customers are facing,
we're adding this priority to heighten our focus on what customers are really willing to pay for.
Finally, in keeping with our practice to provide you with an outlook for our property-liability underlying combined
ratio in 2013, we've set a range of 88 to 90, which is 1 point narrower than last year's. This outlook reflects the more
stable base of auto profitability, and the actions taken that were designed to raise homeowner rates. Partially offsetting
is an expectation for a higher non-catastrophe frequency with more normal weather.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Bob to cover the details of the business unit results.
Robert Block
Thanks, Don. Let's review the results for our property-liability and Allstate Financial on Slide 5, which provides the
details for property-liability net written premium and policies in force. For Allstate Brand Standard Auto at $15.7
billion, the net written premium was essentially flat for the year. We did post positive premium growth over prior year
for the fourth quarter of 2012. Increased average premium and a slightly higher renewal ratio more than offset a small
decline in new issued applications.
Units declined 0.9% in 2012 from 2011, but sequentially were flat to the end of the third quarter of 2012. We received
approval for rate increases averaging 3.1% on a country-wide basis over the course of 2012 in keeping with our priority
of maintaining auto profitability.
Allstate Brand Homeowners increased net written premium in the fourth quarter and the year by 3.4% and 2.8%,
respectively. The quarter's result was driven by a 7.1% increase in average premium on a gross written basis and an
increase in new issued applications partially offset by a decline in retention.
Approved rate changes averaged more over 6% in 2012 on a country-wide basis to improve the margins in
homeowners. Emerging Businesses, Encompass, Canada, and Esurance all contributed positive net written premium
growth in 2012.
On Slide 6, we provide a breakdown of our combined ratio for the year and for the fourth quarter, and just a few points.
For the year, we recorded a combined ratio of 95.5, an improvement of 7.9 points from 2011, as we maintained our
margins in auto and significantly improved our margins in homeowners. The Allstate and Encompass brands saw
material improvements in the reported combined ratios in 2012, much of it coming from lower catastrophe losses. The
2012 property-liability underlying combined ratio was 87.2, better than the range of 88-91 which we provided at the
beginning of 2012.
In addition to maintaining discipline in pricing in claims management, we benefited from very favorable
non-catastrophe weather during the year. Our 2013 underlying combined ratio outlook range is 88-90, and represents an
improvement from the outlook we provided in 2012. It also factors in a return to more normal non-cat weather trends
for the year.
Loss cost trends for the Allstate Brand standard auto modestly improved in the fourth quarter of 2012. On Slide 7,
reported frequencies of bodily injury and property damage, which are shown in the upper left chart, declined 2.1% and
3.7% for the quarter from the fourth quarter of 2011. For the year, frequencies for both coverages declined relative to
2011.
Paid severity, shown in the upper right, also moderated in the quarter with bodily injury increasing 5.2% and property
damage increasing only 0.4%. For 2012, the paid severities for bodily injury and property damage increased 4.1% and
3.0%, respectively. When you add the results from the other coverages in auto with our rate actions over time, you get a

fairly steady combined ratio result as shown by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of Slide 7.
Maintaining auto profitability remains a critical priority for us and one in which we have a history of success, as
depicted on Slide 8. In the top chart, we have posted an Allstate Brand standard auto underlying combined ratio of 95
or better in every quarter but two for the four years shown in the chart. The chart on the bottom shows the improved
results for average earned premium, which is the red line, and the very favorable loss trends in 2012, which is in the
blue line, which we expect to moderate in 2013.
A similar set of charts are included for homeowners on Slides 9 and 10. Non-catastrophe loss costs remain below prior
year levels in the fourth quarter, as reported frequency declined 10% while paid severity increased 6% compared to the
fourth quarter of 2011, shown in the upper right on Slide 9.
With the loss cost trends declining and average earned premium increasing over 9% in the fourth quarter, the
underlying combined ratio continued to improve to 62.4 in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 4.6-point improvement from
the fourth quarter of 2011. For the year, the underlying combined ratio was 65.1, 5.8 points better than 2011.
Referring to the chart on the bottom of Slide 10, average earned premium has steadily increased due to the impact of
our rate actions taken over the last several years. The loss trend has been very favorable for the entire year, a trend we
expect to moderate in 2013.
Moving to Allstate Financial on Slide 11. We continue to focus on growing underwritten products sold through Allstate
Agencies and Allstate Benefits, further reducing the concentration of spread-based products. This shift will improve
returns. Total premiums and contract charges on underwritten products increased 3.8% for the year and 4.9% for the
fourth quarter. In 2012, issued life insurance policies sold through Allstate Agencies increased 9.3% for the year and
11.9% in the fourth quarter relative to comparable periods in 2011.
New net written premium produced by Allstate Benefits rose 6.5% for the year compared to 2011 and 13.3% for the
fourth quarter, when a significant portion of the business is written as part of the annual enrollment season.
Allstate Financial generated net income of $541 million, a decline from 2011's net income of $590 million, driven by
after-tax net realized capital losses in 2012 compared to realized capital gains in 2011, partially offset by a reserve
release in 2012 associated with the non-routine valuation adjustment for derivatives embedded in equity indexed
annuities and a 4.3% increase in operating income. The increase in operating income was due to an increase in the
investment spread, driven primarily by the reclassification of equity method limited partnership income from realized
capital gains to invested income beginning in 2012, partially offset by decreased benefit spread and increased expenses.
For the quarter, net income was $166 million, a $31 million increase from the fourth quarter 2011, with operating
income of $144 million, a $14 million or 10.8% increase from the prior year quarter. Operating income return on equity
of 8% declined 30 basis points in 2012 from 2011, as higher operating income was more than offset by the growth of
capital due to the accumulation of undistributed profits.
Lastly, ongoing efforts to reduce exposure to spread-based business drove a decline in contract holder funds of just
over $3 billion, bringing the balance in contract holder funds to $39.3 billion at the year-end 2012. We continue to
review options to reduce the size and improve the returns of the spread-based businesses.
With that, let's hear from Steve.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Bob. We delivered strong investment results in the fourth quarter and for the year as we balanced portfolio
yield, risk and return objectives in the current low interest rate environment while proactively positioning the portfolio
for an eventual rise in interest rates.
On Slide 12, you see our portfolio total return of 7.3% for the year, driven by significant fixed income and equity
appreciation coupled with stable net investment income. The returns reflect positive contributions across the entire

portfolio. For the fourth quarter, net investment income was $1.033 billion and the annualized portfolio yield was 4.7%,
reflecting an increase over both the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011.
The increase includes the impact of our change in classification of equity method limited partnership results to net
investment income from realized capital gains that Bob noted a bit earlier. Excluding limited partnership results, net
investment income was above the prior quarter, reflecting higher equity dividends but lower than the fourth quarter of
2011, consistent with the smaller Allstate Financial portfolio, an impact of lower reinvestment yields.
Also on this slide is the size and composition of our overall portfolio. We ended 2012 with a carrying value of $97
billion, reflecting the improved valuations, which more than offset the ongoing deduction of Allstate Financial's
spread-based business. Through 2012, we continue to favor this ability of corporate credit including an increased
allocation to high-yield bonds.
Slide 13 highlights trends in the portfolio unrealized gains, yield and maturity profile. The chart on the upper left shows
the trend in pre-tax unrealized net capital gains. We ended 2012 with unrealized gains of $5.55 billion, reflecting an
increase of $2.67 billion over year-end 2011. The increase was primarily in the fixed income portfolio and resulted
from tighter credit spreads and lower interest rates.
In the fourth quarter, we further reduced interest rate risk in our property-liability portfolio shifting out of longer
maturity assets. These and similar future actions will better position our portfolio for an eventual rise in interest rates.
The sale of longer-term securities pulls forward future income to the realization of gains. We expect this activity to
contribute to decline in our property-liability portfolio yield and net investment income.
The chart on the upper right illustrates a shift in our fixed income maturity profile resulting from our proactive
management of interest rate risk over the past several years. Our actions to reposition the fixed income portfolio
include shifting out of longer term municipal and corporate bonds and shorter term lower yielding treasuries in
immediate term bonds. We expect our continued reinvestment in the current low rate environment portfolio actions to
reduce interest rate risk in the ongoing reduction of Allstate Financial's liabilities to further pressure investment income
and portfolio yields going forward.
We finished the quarter on a strong capital position as you can see on Slide 14. Shareholders' equity of $20.6 billion
increased $2.3 billion of year-end 2011. Statutory surplus rose $17.2 billion and portfolio assets in the holding
company level were $2.1 billion at year-end. Our book value per share came in at $42.39, 17.2% higher than at
year-end 2011 on the strength of our operating performance, improved portfolio evaluations, and active capital
management.
We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders during 2012 through dividends and share repurchases. Yesterday the board
increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25, a $0.03 per quarter or 13.6% increase. We completed the November 2011
share repurchase program during the fourth quarter, and began repurchases under a new $1 billion program authorized
by the board in December to be financed through hybrid security issuances. The board also authorized an additional $1
billion repurchase program yesterday bringing our total buy-back program to $2 billion to be executed through March
2014.
Now let's go to the question-and-answer session.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you, and good morning. First, I want to point out that – I believe it's the first time that
Allstate brand premiums were in positive territory on growth for the first time in 11 quarters. So, I wanted to get your
perspective on whether you feel that trend could continue in light of PIF growth still being negative.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Jay. This is Tom. I'll give you a perspective and Matt might want to jump in
as well. First, you're right, premiums have gone up, as we point out, largely the result of higher average premiums in
the homeowners business. The actions we've taken over that period of time, it actually began before 11 quarters ago,
was really to reduce our catastrophe exposure by getting smaller homeowners.
You know we're down by 1.2 million homeowner policies in the last four years. That has obviously had an impact on
our auto business. As the actions we took in New York and Florida which were proactive and fast, that we went at that
one hard which hit both of our – also hit auto growth. Matt has a number of plans going out to try to turn that around,
and maybe he'd want to make few comments about the strategy to move them both... I think what you're really after is
items in force or policies as opposed to premiums.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Hey, Jay, it's Matt. Thank you for pointing that out, first. Look, the way we look at this is
– the last several years have been a stabilization year as we – a couple of stabilization years – as we wanted to ensure
that we were charging an appropriate rate and getting the appropriate returns in the business. We are continuing to
focus on top line and IF, and we'll continue to do that as long as we're able to do that in an economic matter. We look at
a couple of indicators.
We look at – on the homeowners side, we look at new business and we look at retention, and as you see in Page 28 of
the Supp, new business was up 5.8 above prior year in the fourth quarter and the trend was extremely positive. We
started first quarter at minus 11.4, second quarter was minus 5.7, third quarter flattened out, and the fourth quarter we
were at positive 5.8. Yet, add to that the retention side of it, and as we've slowed down the non-renewal actions and as
we've focused more intensively on the customer experience, we've seen the GAAP to prior year retention improving
each quarter. And it improved in the fourth quarter to just minus 0.6.
So, on the homeowners side, you take that boost in new business; retention getting better; non-renewal options
declining; greater focus on customer experience; the impact of House & Home, which we rolled out to 17 states in
2012 and we have another 12 additional states planned for this year, and in those states production is up extremely
strong. And so we have a good story on the homeowner side. Not only does that help homeowners, revenue and IF, but
it helps auto as well due to the bundling. You look at the same two factors on the auto side, and although new business
continues to run below prior year, the GAAP got smaller in the second half of 2012. If you look at the First half versus
prior year versus Second half versus prior year, it's dramatically different. First quarter, I think we were down almost
11%, second quarter down 3%, and then third and fourth it was down 1.3%, so clearly moderating on the new business
side. And retention improved.
So as you can see on Page 28 of the Supp, the retention trend has been pretty stable at 89 the past three quarters. We
got a boost from Florida in the fourth quarter where that retention improved and we've stabilized things in Florida and
New York, as Tom said. And so, we think we're pretty well positioned to change the momentum and change these trend
lines. We've been moderating a lot in the last quarter, and we're cautiously optimistic.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: All right. Thanks for that insight. I also want to touch base on the comment about expense
management. The P&C expense ratio was 26.5% in 2012. It's up from around 25% in the 2010 timeframe. Is that a
good way to think about in terms of where Allstate wants to get the expense ratio back to?
<A - Robert Block>: Jay, a better way to look at it is by segment. So, look at the expense ratio for Esurance, you'll see
that's substantially higher than net average and that's because of course it's all front-end loaded with advertising
expenses. Then you can look at the Allstate agency piece, and then you can look at the Encompass piece. And our goal
is to have a highly competitive expense position in each of those segments, which is relative to the way in which you
go to market and the services you provide to your customers. So, for example in the Allstate agency channel, our
agencies provide ongoing service and counseling for our customers, which is why they get a renewal commission. You
don't have that in the Esurance business model for those customers who don't want that, so you have to really look at it
by segment.

Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your question, please?
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Hi. Great. The first question in regards to the 88 to 90 underlying combined ratio
guidance. So that's – I believe this year it was lower than 88. You guys are hoping to maintain auto or the goal is to
maintain auto and drive continued improvement in homeowners. So that would – so I guess basically is the delta there,
you guys don't expect the lower non-cat weather to reoccur and if so, could you size up what benefit you guys had from
that in the full year?
<A - Robert Block>: Yeah, it's good question, Mike. Let me address – so 88 to 90. Last year we had a three-point
spread, this year it's a two-point spread. That's largely based on our confidence that the actions that Matt's team has
taken in New York and Florida are working, and we like what we see there so we can have a narrower range. Secondly,
then you say, okay, but you're still – the range is still above where you are this year. I think you really have to – it is the
weather. It's a reflection of the return to more normal frequency in the auto and homeowner business. December was an
incredibly strong month for us. If you look at the underlying combined ratio in homeowners for the fourth quarter, it
was like 62 and change. I don't think the business is operating at this point at that big a delta versus where it was last
quarter – fourth quarter of last year.
So, some of that's weather. If you want a variance analysis on weather, it's possible but there's some art to it, and so, our
range is a range we expect to be in. That's why we establish it, to give you some confidence as to where we're going.
And we typically are in there, and so we made an estimate as to what the weather would be, and it said we'll be in the
88 to 90.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And in regards to the investment portfolio, it sounds like Steve talked about
preparing for higher interest rates, but then so shifting the reducing interest rate sensitivity. So, what kind of new
money yields are you guys expecting in the near-term versus the existing portfolio yields?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. Let me give you an overview from a corporate risk standpoint, and then Judy will talk
about what she's doing to implement that. So, overall, when we look at the quarter risk profile, we look at interest rates,
caps, underwriting risk, inflation, a whole variety of things. And from our risk management perspective, we're
assuming that rates will rise. We don't think they're going to run away tomorrow, but we think they will go up over
time. And so, as we usually do, we try to get out ahead of these things and be proactive about it. We're not – we only
have a sort of moderate level of concern about inflation, which is another thing of course that can hurt insurance
companies.
So, what we're doing is reducing our interest rate risk. We started that in the fourth quarter; we'll continue it throughout
this year. And that means basically taking capital gains on the portfolio and pulling operating income forward. So, you
can take capital gain today or you can get the higher interest rates. We believe the economic smart thing to do is to pull
those gains forward. And so, we run the company economically, not just for operating EPS. Judy can talk about what
she's done to the portfolio and what she's reinvesting in.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So, when you look at the portfolio, currently the – just looking at the fixed income yield on
the property and casualty portfolio, it's around 3.8, and that's a good estimate of what you should think about in terms
of where the portfolio is in some of the activities that we're doing. The reinvest that we're looking at is, as Tom said,
shorter duration. A good proxy would be three to five-year maturities, investment grade corporate. Probably yields
around 1.5% to 2% is a good way to think about it.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the Esurance growth. There's some
surprise in the first quarter, but I notice every quarter it's been strong. And when I look at Geico and Progressive,
there's a heavy seasonality to when they add policies. Can you talk a little about the marketing there and whether you
expect at a certain point it will normalize to a seasonality or not?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. Let me – I'll get Don to answer that part. Let me first, in Esurance, we're really happy
with Esurance. I mean, it fits with our customer-focused strategy. We didn't think – while we had an offering in that
lower right-hand quadrant with the Allstate brand, we weren't really taking share and we said we need a sharper,
better-focused customer offering to serve the self-serve customer, and we felt we could leverage a bunch of our
capabilities at Allstate which we've done other times, whether that be with Encompass or the benefits business. And so
net-net, we like what we've done. We like – 30% growth is good. And Don can talk about the seasonality and perhaps
talk about the other things you're doing to drive growth in the business, kind of surf around the acquisitions.
<A - Don Civgin>: Okay. Hi, Josh. First of all on the seasonality question, the seasonality in Esurance has historically
followed their marketing spend, and so there has been a higher first quarter customer acquisition in the past. I think that
will probably moderate in the future, as they've increased our advertising spend a fair amount. And I think we're going
spread that out through the year going forward.
As far as the marketing spread, the efficiency throughout the year, remember, this wasn't just – when we completed the
acquisition at the fourth quarter of last year, we began a new ad campaign heralding the fact that Esurance and Allstate
were now connected. That campaign began at the beginning of 2012, and the impressions have been building as the
year has gone on. So, it was less effective the first day it ran than it was the last day it's run through the year. And I
think the momentum that's built has been very strong. So, it's – the campaign's working quite well. It's hard not to be
happy with written premium growth going up 30% for the quarter on an apples-to-apples basis if you adjust for the
acquisition date last year. The policies are going up, 31% for the year, so, that's strong as well. I think from my
perspective, we acquired Esurance so that we could really compete effectively against Geico and Progressive in that
customer segment, and our goal was to grow that business economically. The GAAP combined ratio kind of gets in the
way of looking at things economically for you, but we're convinced that the growth we are getting is economic when
you spread the advertising expense over the life of that customer, and we want to see how far we can take it. But
clearly, it's doing what we wanted, which is taking market share in an economic way.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And so the ad spend will – you expect will be consistent throughout the year?
<A - Don Civgin>: No. I don't know it will be completely consistent quarter-to-quarter. I just don't think we'll have as
much seasonality as they've had historically in the past.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. And the other question, capital management, obviously you have 2 billion share
repurchase on the table right now. Presuming amendable non-cat weather and reasonably low amount of catastrophes,
could there be more buy-back in 2013 if the weather complies?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, this is Tom. The – we've always shown an ability and a willingness to deploy capital
back to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchases. $2 billion is a pretty big program when your market
cap is $21 billion. We're pretty comfortable with that. I think working through that is probably what you should expect
for 2013.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. Thanks for the answers.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore Partners. Your question, please?
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi. Thanks. So, the first question is on the net investment income. If I could just have a
clarification. So, I believe the old money rates that you have right now is 3.8%, new money rates 1.5% to 2.0%. That's
on the P&C portfolio. Just curious how much for fixed income assets are maturing this year and next year, and so that –

Page 10 of 16
yeah, that'd be helpful.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: Okay. So the old money rate is really just the portfolio rate that you've referenced so that's
around 3.7 to 3.8. And the way that we're estimating maturities, pre-pays and calls for 2013 in the property and casualty
portfolio is between $1.5 billion and $2 billion with the piece of that being maturities which will actual happen and
then we just have to estimate the calls and pre-pays. So, that's why that we have the range.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And then if you're trying to get an estimate for investment income...
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: On top of that will be the roles we do intentionally on our part to reduce interest rate risk.
Okay, so we're going be selling securities and we have been throughout last fourth quarter and we'll be selling in this
year – taking capital gains which will then be reinvested. That's on top of what you talked about.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Sure. So, I just want to get the numbers right. So, the $1.5 billion to $2 billion is per quarter?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: No, that's for the total year for the property and casualty portfolio, but that excludes what
Tom just talked about. And that activity – when we look at that activity we think it's going be in the range of – we think
that that activity is going to be on top of the calls and maturities.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. And how much of a negative impact do you think that that's going to have upon the
investment income?
<A - Robert Block>: We're not – here's what I'd say. We're not trying not to do earnings guidance by line. And so what
you can do – the way to get an estimate is look at our capital gains each quarter as we go forward. Then you can adjust
as you look forward based on how much we've sold that quarter and what you think we'll reinvest in. Because the
timing of it, how much we do will depend on what we think about the future trends and interest rates where we're at,
the pace of it. So, that's a – we're living through that one. We're letting you know our intention is to sell bonds, realize
gains and accelerate it in from operating income into capital gains, but we don't really have a forecast for what we'll do
this year.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. The second question is on Esurance. The growth was great, but the business is running
at 108, I believe, core combined ratio. Do you think that you can get it to 100 or maybe a 96 by this year, or is it going
be next year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll give you the directions I've given to Don and Don can talk about the actual number, but
we look at the loss ratio. And we say where is the loss ratio relative to what it needs to be to be economic. We also look
at that loss ratio by age of business, and we look at that loss ratio by state. And so there's several different cuts on it,
with the goal of making sure that there's enough profit coming off the difference between premiums and the loss ratio
to pay for all those upfront expenses.
And so, to the extent that it is, and Don can talk about cost of acquisitions and stuff like that, we'll continue to fund that
business for growth. Esurance hit our underwriting combined I think $192 million this year in terms of negative to it,
and I'm good with that because it was all economic. We can continue to invest in growth in that business, which means
the combined ratio would be over 100, but if you're making money on it by segment, by cell, by age, by state, then we
don't worry as much about what the total combined ratio is at the top because of the way the advertising expenses are
accounted for. Don, do you have anything?
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, I'll just maybe add a couple things. We can – this is going to sound bad. We can actually
make the combined ratio kind of what we'd like it to be by adjusting the advertising. So, I think what you're talking
about is the GAAP combined ratio, and the better thing to focus on is what Tom talked about, which is the economic
combined ratio. Their accounting model is different than Allstate's. Most of their expense is frontloaded on advertising,
that gets expensed in the quarter. You do – you take the advertising expense. But then the second term and the third
term and the fourth term, the profitability goes up substantially because you don't have the commission we have on the
Allstate side.

So, what we look at is over the life of the policy we're writing, is that business economic. At the moment, that business
is quite economic for us. And so, as Tom said, we're happy to feed the growth of that by investing in the advertising
upfront. It's going to depend on making sure that the retention remains strong. And I would tell you the retention's gone
up this year. And so, nobody likes to run 108; I don't like it either. But I think you have to go below that number and try
to understand why it's running 108. If it's running 108 for good reasons, we'll continue doing it.

Our next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please?
<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: Good morning. Thanks for the call and congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit more about Encompass, and what structurally is the reasons why the profitability differs from
your in-force Allstate branded business?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Paul. This is Tom. I'll make a quick comment and then maybe Don you can
talk about the strategy to grow the business profitably. So, Encompass of course serves the customers who want local
advice but want choice between carriers, so we sell through independent agents. The cost structure associated with
selling through independent agents is higher than the cost structure of selling through captive agents, and it's pretty
obvious as to why that would be the case. And so, we run a higher expense ratio there, but that's because that's what
customers want. We made a couple of changes to improve that business, the biggest of which was a new management
team. And Don can talk about what we're doing to leverage that management team's skills and how we expect to grow
the business.
I would tell you, I'm not completely satisfied that the profitability is where it needs to be because the combined ratio is
still a little high, and there's a lot of property in that package policy, and so you need a pretty low combined ratio on
that property business. But Don can talk – we've made good progress, and we're seeing some signs of life in that. So,
I'm happy about it.
<A - Donald J. Bailey>: Yeah, Paul, this is Don, Don Bailey. We've made good progress over the last couple of years
in that business and, as Tom said, a new management team, but we've reestablished our focus on the package product.
So, for us, the strategy is it's about customers and it's about our agents. On the customer side, we've already committed
to the package product, which is the 12-month policy. One premium, one bill, one property deductible, and we think
that differentiates in the marketplace for our customers, which are in that mass affluent segment.
From an agent standpoint, we've recommitted over the last couple of years to them as well. In terms of ease of doing
business, being consistent in our underwriting appetite, upgrading our technology platforms, and that has led to a
significant increase in the number of engaged agents we have. We distribute for about 2,800 agents in the United
States. There's about 37,000 total in the independent agent space. About 1,700 of those we would consider active. So,
we've got more runway with our current agents and we've got probably less than 1% market share in the segment that
we chase. So, we think some of the recent trends for us certainly can't continue if we continue to run the business the
way we have been.

Geico benefit to Berkshire. I don't know whether you've thought through what a customer is worth to you in lifetime

probably added $350 million of value to the firm which would be a 30-year purchase price. So, what do you think
about a value of a customer in lifetime benefits to the company?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, Bob, I don't know where Warren Buffet gets $1,500, so I can't really speak to sort of
the math. I'll just assume that he's got [indiscernible] (47:41) numbers. I tend to think about customers not in economic
terms as to how much can we make off them, but as to how do we fully meet their needs and capabilities and how do
we differentiate ourselves so we keep winning them. Just because you got them once doesn't mean you're going to keep
them.
And when you start putting numbers on them and say that this person's a $1,500 sign, it seems odd to me. So, it's just
the way we think about it. We think about it as like we're trying to always do a good job, we have to drive retention up.
So you see retention going up in the Esurance business because of the work we're doing, the way we serve our
customers, the type of customers. Matt talked about retention in his businesses. And so, I'd like to keep them all forever
and that's our goal. I don't know if that makes them worth $1,500 or more, but I know it's good for our shareholders.
<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Okay. Somehow you have to size your ad spend versus the customers that you get, so you
have to put a number on it at some point. But I hear it may be a softer process in your current mindset. If I could pivot
to the life company, I'm interested on where this company stands relative to Matt's and yours goal that you articulated
to get $1 billion of dividends out of it over the next four years, I think which was a couple years ago. It looks like the
stat surplus is down, but you said that the ROE had some pressures because of more capital. I guess the final question is
where does the life company stand in your overall strategy? It looks like there's some people out there willing to pay
pretty good prices for life companies today, which I'm sure you're mindful of. What's the overall game plan with the
unit?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: A lot of – as usual, you've thought it through in a fairly thorough way. So I'll try to give you
– or maybe I'll start at the end and then see if I get the details as well. First, our strategy at Allstate Financial has been
to focus on underwritten products. If you go back 10 years, it was to make it bigger and broader and we were pushing
hard at both the annuity business and the life business expanding through both our captive channels and independent
agencies. Given – in about the middle – about 2005 or so, we said this annuity business doesn't look like it's giving us
the kind of returns we like. We thought fixed annuities, the returns were low, variable annuities we thought the returns
were too speculative, and we started to shift.
So we sold the VA business of course in 2006. We started slowing down the size of our annuity sales. Had we been
pressured enough, I would have stopped them all and maybe sold it at that time. That would have been a good idea,
because the deals we see now people selling annuities, I'm not sure they're great transactions. But, so where we are
today is of course focused on our underwritten products, be supportive of the Allstate Agency customer rates at lower
left, do they want to buy everything from one person if they can.
Also, we have a great position in the workplace benefits business. And as we mentioned, that business is growing quite
well. We really like that business, it gives good returns. So, both in the underwritten price, the returns are above our
cost of capital, and so we're focusing on growing those businesses. At the same time, to get the costs of the return on
equity up, we've also been trying to reduce the size of the fixed annuity business, since that's the one we have left.
We've been pretty aggressive. I think we're down about $3 billion this year, Don. We'd like it to go down faster and
we're looking at every which way we can to make it go down faster because it's just low ROE business.
What we've learned along the way is we can separate the decision from serving our customers from putting our capital
to work. So, we sell VAs to our customers today, and they're just made by somebody else. We sell a bunch of annuities
today, made by somebody else. So, looking forward, what our goal is to try and get returns up on the life business. That
includes getting capital out of there. It was – we got about – when you include the bank last year, I think we got back
about $367 million. This year we expect to get more back. I'm now setting objectives for Don. And the – so we're – we
expect over the next couple years for it to be a net generator of capital for us to continue to work to try to reduce the
size of the fixed annuity business and then to continue to focus on helping support the Allstate Agencies and the
Benefits business. Is that helpful?

<Q - Bob Ray Glasspiegel>: Very helpful. So selling it or spinning it off, nowhere near your radar screen?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: If we could do something with the fixed annuity business, I'd be happy to do it. But the
deals people have been making that don't look that attractive to me. If we had an attractive way to reinsure some of
that, that's not really a spin-off; the way you're thinking of it as a capital market standpoint. I'm thinking of it as a how
do we get our returns up in that business. And that's our goal, get returns up for Allstate Financial. We'll do it in as
effective and efficient a way as we can.

Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Your question, please?
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Hi, Tom. I was wondering if you could give a sense of what you think ad spend will be for
the Allstate brand 2013 versus 2012?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'm sorry. Say that again, Ian?
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Advertising spend. Do you expect the advertising spend to be flat, down, up versus 2012?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yeah, I'd rather not comment on that because other people listen to the call and figure out
what we're doing in ad spend. I would just underline that Matt's focused on growth. And to the extent we think it's
economic, we're willing to invest in it as long as we can come in with our combined ratio target overall. And it's a
pretty, as you know, it's a pretty aggressive advertising market today, but it's also shifting. You're seeing people move
out of big ads that are done on major TV to more electronic communications and stuff like that. So we have Sanjay
Gupta joined us as our Chief Marketing Officer last year. We also have a great advertisement team at least with Lisa
Cochrane and some others. We feel like we've got the right weapons, and we fire them when we think they're going to
drive growth.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Got it. Great. And then to the growth question. Matt obviously talked a little bit earlier about
New York and Florida being important states. But there's also – I'm talking specifically about auto here. There's
obviously challenges in both states. I'm curious just how those are impacting you either [inaudible] (54:52) has that
been an impediment to trying to grow, or do you think you've kind of gotten ahead of the market in figuring how to
address that? And then just New York with all the losses from auto and Sandy, I assume there's going to be price
increases coming. How does that affect your ability to grow?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, let's take them individually because although they're typically grouped together, they
tend to have some things in common, but some things occur differently. Florida is a difficult environment due in part
by the PIP issues that you referenced, but it's just a tricky environment. One way, you have to be very disciplined, very
cautious, and as you grow, you need to do so in a really disciplined manner. I talked at one of the other calls about the
first mover disadvantage that you sometimes get by seeing things before others see them. In Florida and New York,
that's really an advantage. So, we watch trends emerge and we stay on top of them very aggressively.
So, you can see in Florida on Page 23 of the SUP that we've continued to improve the margins in Florida as the
year-over-year loss ratio ended 2012 several points below 2011 levels. That gives us some flexibility to start looking at
growth. We've seen, as I said, stabilization in retention there. But we have to be cautious in the growth there, and we'll
do so deliberately and cautiously so that as we grow and if we're able to grow, we're doing so profitably and not
exposing ourselves inappropriately on the risk side.
In New York, as you said, Sandy creates some opaqueness to some of the results. We have to see what happens.
Clearly, with some of the requirements that we not terminate policies, that influenced the retention rate there. So, we
have to see how that shakes out, but we're optimistic there, too. You've seen standard auto with that continues to
decline, but at a slower rate than seen in the third quarter. And if you take out Sandy, and I think we tried to break this
out for you on Page 23 of the SUP in New York, the loss ratio excluding Sandy improved compared to the fourth

quarter of 2011. So, we're seeing – if you ex out Sandy, we're seeing some nice improvement there, so we think we're
fairly well positioned in New York as well.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: You're thinking you can get enough rate, just given the moratoriums, you can get enough
rate for the cat load, probably higher cat load to still grow?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I can't predict what rates we will get or we will take. We strive always to ensure that we
have a proper economic return on the business, and we'll manage our relationships there and our rates to ensure that
happens.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. Hey, Bob, maybe could you elaborate a little bit about – you mentioned – we talk
about non-cat weather. I think we talked more on the homeowners side. Can you talk a little bit about the large loss
activity, or the lack of large loss activity, I should say, in the fourth quarter? How much of that benefited standard auto,
just to try and reconcile how we're thinking about those forward, and then just one follow-up, thanks.
<A - Robert Block>: The lack of large loss activity favorably impacting auto in the fourth quarter?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Yeah, well, you said – you said weather was benign, I guess, in...
<A - Robert Block>: Well, it was. If you look at the frequency trends, we had a nice decrease in the fourth quarter
relative to 2011, so the frequency trends continued. That is when we look forward, is something that we are not
necessarily counting on when we look at 2013. I think that everybody in the industry I think experienced a better
weather pattern in 2012 than they had over the past few years. So, I think that's really what we're saying on that.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay. Well...
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And on the large losses, I think it sometimes causes us to hesitate, and that's not to make the
reserving expert. But to the extent frequency goes down because of the weather, those tend to be smaller average claim
sizes. So, as a result of that, your severity tends to go up a little bit when your frequency goes down. So, actually, the
large losses didn't really go down.
Somebody's going get in an accident and really hurt themselves or somebody else, they're usually going to do it
whether it's the weather or not, as the weather – variability in the weather tends to take out small claims. But I think if
you look at paid pure premium, the way Bob laid it out on a slide, you get a sense for – we feel like the fourth quarter is
pretty good. We don't think you can always count on frequency being down, and so that's why we picked the numbers
we picked.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got you. And then – and just one piece of the disclosure I was trying to figure out was so
we've got the cats in the homeowners and auto and then cats overall, is there – do you guys disclose, or do we have
available the cat number in the other segment, and what did that look like in 4Q, and maybe for the year? I'm just trying
to understand the underlying there.
<A - Robert Block>: Yeah, the way the supplement was structured this quarter, they reformatted a few things and one
of the things that is not – is no longer in there specifically is cat losses on the other personal lines.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Yeah.
<A - Robert Block>: I'm working with accounting to get that number.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Oh, you are. Okay. Great. All right. So, we'll follow up with you after then. Thank you. And
then just one last quick one, investment income. I mean, it looks like, so you're down year-over-year about 7% just on

the fixed maturity piece. And I guess there's some being moved to alternatives and equities. But, just trying to
understand whether or not that pace of decline should accelerate, just given that it sounds like some harvesting and
some continued repositioning and how generally should we think about what you're going be doing there? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Mike, this is Tom. I think your numbers are correct. We don't want to do a forecast of
investment income because of course everything depends on what happens with rates and reinvestment rates and how
much we decide to reduce interest rate risk. But I think the general direction you described is the one we're trying to
give you. I think investment income is likely to – excluding what we get off doing the partnerships in the alternative
investments is likely to go down next year, because rates are low and we are harvesting gains and reducing our interest
rate risk. So, the direction is right. Everyone has to make their own estimate as to how much it will go down.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Sure, fair. Thank you very much, Tom. Thanks, Bob.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. Maybe we do one last question, I think because we're about at the top of the hour,
right?

Our final question today is from Ray Iardella of Macquarie. Your question, please?
<Q - Ray Iardella>: Thanks, and thanks for squeezing me in. Just maybe a question more sort of longer-term thinking.
Tom, when you think about the 13% ROE goal by 2014, maybe talk about whether or not you need to improve the
P&C combined ratio from the 88 to 90, just given maybe some of the pressures of investment income. And if not,
maybe talk about the levers maybe outside the life business that you guys have to get your ROEs up to that goal.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, that's a good question. A complicated one, but I'll try to do it quickly. First, driving
profitable growth is our goal, and we're highly focused on the return on equity. 13% was the goal we set in 2010 – early
2010. It is still our goal. Some of the actions we took and had planned on to get there have worked well and we're on
the way there. Other things are not as far along as we would like to get to that goal.
We picked 13% because, I don't know if you were at that meeting or not, because that was the return we had gotten
over a long period of time out of the business. So, there were four key assumptions: one, we could maintain auto
profitability; two, we can improve returns in homeowners; three, that we could get the Allstate Financial ROE up to 9%
to 10%; and four, that investment income would be essentially flat.
We're comfortable with the first two. Auto profitability's still doing well. As we said, we like what we've got going in
homeowners. And at the time, getting the improvement from where we were to getting to 13%, about 70% of it was in
the homeowners business. So, we have been like laser-focused on getting that done, and Matt's team has been pushing
forward on work that's really we've been working on for four or five years to try to get there. So, that one we feel very
good about, as we feel good about the sustainability of our auto margins.
In terms – we've made less progress on AF because the interest rates have come down, and that of course impacts the
third one as well. So, we're focused on doing what is economic as well as getting to 13%. So, for example, lower rates,
doing what we're doing to reduce interest rate risks, makes that fourth lever even harder to accomplish. So – but that
said, we're going to do what's economic for the shareholders. And if we think it's the right risk return trade-off, we'll do
it. And we are still shooting for 13%, but I'm not going be a slave to an operating EPS number and put our shareholders
at risk for interest rates moving up in the unrealized going from $5.5 billion to being wiped out. If we can capture some
of that for our shareholders today we will.
So, it's a complicated model. We're still working on it. Our goal is to get shareholders a 13% return. There's lots of
levers we can pull; you mentioned many of them. And we're working our way at it.
<Q - Ray Iardella>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thomas J. Wilson
Okay. Let me just close. So, 2012 was a year where you all had the ability to see through cat losses to the underlying
strength of our business model. We have a clear and focused strategy, which is to differentiate ourselves versus the
competition, and focus on the needs of each customer segment and we're executing well. We will proactively address
any of those challenges that come our way including the ones we just talked about, with the goal of creating value for
our shareholders by doing a great job for our customers. So, thank you very much, and we'll talk to you next quarter.
