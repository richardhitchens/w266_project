MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference
Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the
call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter
Thank you, Gwen. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams
Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites
williams.com and williamslp.com.
These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; a
presentation discussing these results; guidance updates and growth opportunities, with related audio commentary from
our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books which contain detailed information regarding
various aspects of our business.
This morning, Alan will make a few comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here
from our Midstream business. Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business. And our CFO, Don Chappel, is

also available to respond to any questions.
In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking
statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it.
Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation
materials.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you on the phone and webcast who have joined us this morning. I'm
certainly looking forward to your questions. Before we open up the phone lines, I want to take the opportunity to
briefly touch on a few key things for the Williams and Williams Partners investment story. In short, we're rewarding
investors now with strong dividend and cash distribution growth through the guidance period, and we are expanding
our business to create continuing value growth in a very resilient future dividend and distribution growth.
First, let's take a look at our fourth quarter performance. We turned in solid results in line with our third quarter
guidance, despite a natural gas liquids margin environment that dropped even faster than we expected.
To give some scale to that drop and to the headwinds we were facing, it's important to understand that our fourth
quarter NGL margins were down 46% from the prior year. Margins took another 8% hit from what we thought were
low third quarter levels. And from a financial perspective, our fourth quarter NGL margins were off about $75 million
compared just to the midpoint of the forecast that we shared at the third quarter results.
Much of this didn't show up in the unit margin because we didn't produce ethane when it was negative – in the negative
margin territory, so what you saw out there is a little bit higher unit margin than you might have expected, but lower
volumes as a result of that ethane rejection.
We provide some detail on our slides regarding the positions that allowed us to overcome these very low NGL margins,
but here are some of the highlights there. First, we're successfully growing our fee-based revenues in this business for
Williams Partners. In the Midstream segment, we generated fourth quarter fee-based revenues 18% higher than a year
ago. For both the Midstream and Gas Pipeline business, we generated fee-based revenues that were up 5% from the
third quarter to the fourth quarter.
And second, we continue to benefit from the natural hedge against ethane exposure that our Olefins business creates.
Williams Partners benefited in the last two months of 2012 with the
acquisition of the Olefins business and there is even greater benefit for WPZ ahead with the well-timed expansion of
the Geismar facility expected in service later this year.
This combination supports our ability to reward investors with strong growth in cash dividends and cash distributions.
We are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to grow Williams' cash dividend by some 20%, with this year and – for
both this year and next year. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to increase the
cash distributions we pay unitholders by approximately 9% in both 2013 and 2014.
When we add our large platform of growth capital projects and the rapid growth in cash distributions we're expecting
from our recent investment in Access Midstream, what you have is a value creation engine that is powerful, durable
and resilient and will continue to grow for many years to come.
In our earnings announcements yesterday afternoon, you also saw that we are lowering our 2013 and 2014 earnings and
cash flow guidance. We expect the growth in our fee-based business will partially offset the effect of sharply lower
ethane and propane prices and ethylene prices in 2014. And we will see Williams Partners benefiting from the late 2012

acquisition of Williams Olefins business and the significant expansion of our Geismar facility in the fourth quarter.
And I also would remind you that we have quite a bit of collared contracts that are expiring here in the first quarter of
2013, and, of course, those allow us to get even better exposed to the weak ethane price and continue our short position
at Geismar there on ethane.
Our coverage at WPZ is certainly being impacted by the heavy load of investing about $12 billion in growth capital
during the three-year period from 2012 through 2014, but we're deploying that capital towards a vast array of great
growth projects across our operating areas, from the Marcellus and Utica shales, in Canada, to the Eastern Seaboard,
and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These are projects that we know and understand. Many are well into the
construction phase and the essential ingredient in these value-creating projects is largely within our reach; it's our
execution.
If I can direct you for future reference to Slide 13 in the quarterly presentation materials that are posted on our website,
you'll see here exactly where we are spending that $12 billion and where it is – and when exactly it begins to contribute
to our cash flows.
I think you'll agree that these projects are very strategic. They are large scale and they move us even more significantly
toward a business mix dominated by a revenue stream that can support strong contingent growth in dividends and
distributions. And these growth investments largely start contributing in meaningful value in 2015 and beyond. So there
is much good yet to come with these major strategic investments that we continue to invest heavily into.
This natural gas infrastructure supercycle is creating tremendous opportunities for North America, our industry and,
importantly, for Williams and Williams Partners. We are aggressively pursuing and executing on these opportunities to
deliver shareholder value for years to come and we remain committed to the idea that there is a lot of value associated
with this large-scale infrastructure.
Now, let's open the phone lines, and I'll let others on our executive leadership team help answer your questions this
morning.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Christine Cho>: How are you guys planning to fund the coverage shortfall at WPZ in 2013? Is it going to be with
debt? Or are you going to do IDR waivers? And can you just remind me what has been disclosed to-date for IDR
waivers? Is it $105 million in 2013 and $16 million in 2014?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, this is Don Chappel. In terms of the exact funding plan, we've not disclosed that,
but we do have a lot of flexibility around that. It will be a combination of debt and equity. Certainly, Williams is
well-positioned to support WPZ in many ways and – but we have no additional IDR waivers contemplated at this time.
The IDR waivers that are currently – have been granted are very modest, and I think you mentioned those numbers and
they just go out for two years.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Can you just talk about what your plans are for the extra cash at WMB otherwise,
especially with the...
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: We have a number of investment opportunities in the NGL pipeline, petchem pipeline
space where Alan has laid out a strategy earlier about building that business and Alan can speak to that again. So that's
an opportunity. And the balance, we have some flexibility. And so we'll look at the facts and circumstances to

determine what the best use of that excess cash is.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Can you give a little more detail about how the investment in ACMP brought your cash
taxes to zero in 2013 and 10% in 2014?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sure. Our investment – again, there's an allocation for tax purposes. The inside basis at
ACMP did not change. Our investment was allocated between hard assets and intangibles. In terms of the hard assets,
they enjoy accelerated depreciation. And the intangibles enjoy straight-line depreciation, but it's really the depreciation
of that investment that's creating a very large tax deduction for us, which, over the next few years, will significantly
lower our tax rate. In addition, the January 2013 fiscal cliff legislation included an extension of bonus depreciation.
And given the large amount of capital that we continue to invest, that's pretty significant as well.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then I notice that your Geismar expansion – the start date was pushed back by a
quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'll address that now and I'll ask maybe Rory to hit a little harder on that. We really didn't
push it back as much as – that's not really the cause in the drop in volumes there, but we are giving ourselves some
room for the tie-ins and some expanded tie-in work on there. So I would just say we're being fairly conservative in
knowing that when you go to start up a facility like that often there's bobbles and interruptions as you try to do that and
we're planning for that rather than explaining that later. So that's really the purpose for that. But really the start-up is
still scheduled right into the October timeframe.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then you talked about how you started to recently see ethane rejection during the
fourth quarter, how much did you reject in 4Q? And then also you talked about how you're assuming that all your
equity volumes are going to be rejected in the first quarter of 2013, what does your guidance assume for the rest of the
year?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, let me take a look at that on fourth quarter. I know the first quarter of 2013, we've got
rejection plans for the entire period, but if you could hang on just a second here. The fourth quarter – yeah, looks like
we had about two to three weeks in [ph] December of (12:32) ethane rejection.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Maybe just – this is Don Chappel, just related to that, I'd just refer to slide number 8 –
eighth in our deck that illustrates the declining ethane margin, with lower crack – frac spreads, but the widening crack
margin at Geismar. And I'd note there that at our assumed about $0.06 of margin there, that equates to about, I think,
it's $27 million of remaining ethane margins. So we have very little ethane exposure left, and, in fact, as ethane prices
go lower, that $27 million does not include the benefit of Geismar's margins expanding. So if you look at the
sensitivities in our data book, you can get some sense of the combined effect, but, again, there's only $27 million of
total ethane margin assumed in 2013.
In our data book, we have the same slide for 2014 and you'll see with the Geismar expansion, while the ethane margin
is assumed to be a bit wider, the Geismar expansion completely mitigates that...
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: And I think I mentioned to some investors before, if ethane prices go to the point that we're
in full rejection and go even lower, then we've taken all the pain on the ethane margin and then Geismar starts to see
even greater gains as its costs go down.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Great. And then last question for me, this is more of an accounting question. But how are you
calculating the adjusted segment profit for Access Midstream Partners? Is that just net income that you expect at
ACMP and multiplied by your ownership? It just seems a little light. And I'm just trying to figure out: do the Class C
units participate in earnings but not the Class B, is that how that works?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Our proportionate share of their equity earnings and then, again, our purchase price was
allocated in part to intangibles. Some of the intangibles are contracts and we have deprecation or amortization of that.
That totaled about $65 million in both 2013 and 2014...

<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: So, again, the earnings are reduced by that amortization expense. And you can see from a
cash flow standpoint, if you add that back, you get to a segment profit plus DD&A or an EBITDA number, our pro rata
share it's $65 million higher than the earnings. So I think we're on – in terms of our share of – our share from more of a
cash flow perspective segment profit plus DD&A. So that's not actually the distribution, but is $103 million in 2013
and $160 million in 2014.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: You're welcome.

We'll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of quick questions, first, maybe start with the macro.
Can you just give us a little color on what you're seeing right now in the ethane and propane markets? And anything
maybe nearer-term that could drive pricing? You probably know better than most that most of the E&Ps right now are
forecasting ethane rejection for most of 2013.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I think the market on the ethane side continues to struggle to balance itself with a lot
of new projects coming on – continuing to come on: major NGL pipelines, major fractionators continuing to come on
that will continue to provide plenty of supply into a market that is going to be slow to grow. I think, obviously, with our
expansion and other expansions, we'll see a little bit of growth this year, but in – it's probably a couple years out before
we really see the market try to catch up with all that supply on the ethane side. So we really don't see a lot of upside.
For us, the best thing that can happen for us is probably volatility here in 2013 and then a weak, a very weak ethane
price in 2014. And if that happens, then we'll have some upside to what we have forecasted here for 2013 and 2014.
On the propane side, I would say the fundamentals are a little more positive there, certainly, a lot of cracking going on
right now. Propane is at a price that is encouraging a lot of cracking of propane, and our cracker is running rich and
probably any other light-end cracker is running rich and running propane in it right now as much as they can because
propylene prices are so high that that's making that a favored feedstock. So that, combined with hopefully some larger
export facilities coming on later this year, I think that'll start to balance the fundamentals a little better on propane. So I
would say a little bit of upside to propane and – but still that market has a lot of supply still available in it.
I would say this: that there is a lot of propane that is on the market that can be trucked and railed and so forth that is
already in the market supply versus ethane that is being rejected and not on the supply scene. Said another way, when a
lot of these big NGL pipelines come on line, they're going to have the capacity for ethane, but a lot of that propane is
already getting captured in local fractionators and being trucked and railed. So it won't be as large of an incremental
supply into the market when that infrastructure comes on line.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. And then maybe just sticking with propane, what's the latest on the PDH project?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Very excited about that project. A lot of things coming together quickly on it and we've
been – we've contracted with an engineering firm to do a feed study on it. And I would say we look forward to
accelerating the decision on that project with continued strong fundamentals for low propane prices in Canada, with
very little outlook for the propane out of Canada. And, as well, a lot of interest in the propylene supplies that we
already have. As you'll recall from our Redwater fractionator and splitter, we already have pretty large propylene
supply there. This would add to that and starts to get to a level that it could attract derivative investment downstream,
which would really be a home run for us because it would take that rail – some of that rail cost out that we're investing
in today into the Gulf Coast.

<Q - Holly Stewart>: Yep, so maybe a decision by year-end?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Oh, I would say it'd be quite a bit sooner than that.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. Great. And then appreciate the additional Marcellus-related detail on your systems and
expansion plans. I guess, bigger picture, what are the production bottlenecks today?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I would say that for the most part it is around liquids, particularly, for instance, in the
wet Marcellus and in the West Virginia area. That production has a lot more condensate and is a lot richer than really
anybody, I think, expected. Certainly, we expected it anyway, speaking for ourselves, and I think for the producers as
well. And so, a lot of the facilities there really haven't been designed to be able to handle all of those liquids. So there is
a lot of redo work going on up there, and there's a lot of production that is sitting waiting behind infrastructure on both
our facilities and other people's facilities as well.
And so we're working hard to overcome that, but I can tell you that we have a lot of frustrated producers sitting behind
our production, and, obviously, we're anxious to get things remedied and bring it on line as well. But there is a
significant amount of production that is curtailed, either by a lack of connection or in some cases just unreliable
operations where the pipelines continue to fill up with liquids and shut in the gas production.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: And is there more volume on a particular system of yours that's backed up?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. The Ohio Valley Midstream is really the one that's curtailed. The other systems are
running fairly well. We have had a few struggles in getting the laser pipeline up and running. And so, we've had a little
bit of curtailed volume in the Northeast. But as you can see, it's not curtailing it a lot because you can see how fast the
volumes have come up, 80% year-on-year there. So, hard to say it's heavily curtailed, but there is some curtailment
there on the north end of the laser system.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Okay. And then one last one, I promise. Just to clean up, what was your 4Q ethylene cracker
spread? And then full year, as well, that you realized?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Randy, you want to take that?
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: Just moment to look that up so we can come back with that.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Holly, was the question what our ethylene crack spread was at Geismar?
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Yeah, for 4Q and then full year if you've got it. And that's it for me so you can pass it on.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes. Full year was $0.40. I don't know what the – just the quarter was, but I think the full
year spread was $0.40.
<Q - Holly Stewart>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you, Holly.

We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I get – I understand all the issues surrounding lower commodity prices and I appreciate the
comments last night in your podcast on the constraints you're having in the Marcellus. I was wondering if you could
quantify some of those constraints? It seems like if I – if we look at your presentations in the past versus the
presentation you put out last night, that your volume assumptions for 2013 [ph] why (22:43) the Marcellus and Utica

are lower than what you guys had anticipated previously when you looked at these assets last year. Can you give –
quantify for us exactly what's going on? And then, I have a follow-up question to that.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. I'll ask Frank Billings to take that question.
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Yeah. This is Frank Billings. I'd say if we were going to quantify today the volume, the
kind of curtailment or issues that we're having in the Ohio Valley [indiscernible] (23:09), I could put that at about 100
million to 150 million a day of volume that we have that the producers could be producing into our gathering systems
for the forecast period. We're moving our volumes back to address kind of both the operating issues that we're
experiencing in OVM and then certain producers drilling investment to better align their drilling dollars with getting
the best netbacks for commodities produced. So I think that's the thing that's driving our volume forecast today in the –
in that part of the Northeast.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: So if I'm looking at your 2013 and 2014 guidance for volumes, you'd say that those numbers
have been curtailed by about 150 million a day?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: Well, I think that's what's hitting us today. Our expectation is is we would be getting that as
volumes back online, but we have some operational things we need to solve and some asset modifications that we'd
have to make at some of the central receipt points in the field so that we can get that volume flowing. But that volume's
available to us today. We just have to get some of our assets better situated to handle the condensate volumes and get
the – so that we can get the production flowing consistently.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I would say, in general there, we're very encouraged with the resource and the value
it can deliver to the producers. But there are a lot of infrastructure constraints, including both the upstream side and as
well the downstream market side. So, us continuing to develop infrastructure for the NGL market outlets and the
condensate outlets, it's critical to the success of the producers.
And so, I think even though there's already this amount of production sitting and waiting, I don't think they'll continue
to drill so robustly if we don't start to provide the market outlets up there in an unconstrained way. And we're certainly
working very rapidly on that, so a lot of great opportunity. The good news is it's a great resource and I would just say
it's even better than most people thought and, therefore, it's requiring some – pretty rapid expansions on the market
outlets in the upstream infrastructure.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Alan, do you worry about basis kind of narrowing in the Marcellus and Columbia pool
area? It seems like we've basically gotten close to parity to Hub and, in some situations, it looks like we – we actually
moved to a negative basis in that region. Do you worry about that and that kind of crimping production volume
growth?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I think – I think what you'll see – I think it'll be hard to see what the actual basis
differential. But the answer to your question is yes. We've got to continue to open up market outlets for both the gas
and the liquids. But I would tell you right now probably the liquids is the bigger driver on that. But I think what you
really are going to see are kind of inter-regional spikes. And so, it's not just what you could see as a East Dominion
price or a Columbia price. It's really going to boil down to inter-regional prices and what pipes are – people are getting
paid.
Now, if you have firm transport out of the area and then get into Zone 6, on Transco, that's a beautiful thing right now
for somebody, but, obviously, that capacity is limited. And so, I would just say I think – I think it's very, very spotty up
there and I don't think those basis differentials really tell us the whole story for what producers are getting for their gas
right now.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then on the Western volumes, is anything changed in your guidance or expectations
in the West for this year versus what you had expected previously?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Pretty limited change on that, I believe, and continued – I would say the one thing
that I'm aware of that's changed is – and certainly embedded in our guidance at this point though – is we did have a lot
of production froze off in the first quarter, not from our facilities for the most part, but certainly, producer freeze off in
the San Juan Basin and some in the Wamsutter area. And so, we certainly saw some impact here in the first quarter on
fee-based volumes there.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then last question from me. On the quarterly comments that you have in your press
release, you talked about earnings being impacted by increased costs and lower NGL margins. Can you just give us an
idea what you talk about – what do you mean by increased costs?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, certainly, getting all these businesses started up is a heavy load. Developing a lot of
these projects is a heavy load. So, for instance, you see a little spike in cost in Canada, for instance, and a lot of that, of
course, is in developing a project like a PDH project. And so, we've got a lot of upfront development expenses.
You'll notice that we're pretty conservative how we book that. You'll notice in the fourth quarter we – in the gas
pipeline segment, we took a $19 million reduction in expense that basically was expenses that we had on capital
projects earlier that we don't capitalize until we know that project's going to come through.
And so, in other words, we expensed those and hold them in an account until we're sure the project's approved and
permitted. And so, that's where some – that kind of expense from. So, when we've got a big heavy capital budget like
we have right now, a lot of the expenses in developing those projects weigh heavy against our expense line until those
projects are capitalized.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: And would you say those higher expenses are running through your numbers right now are
higher than what you guys had previously envisioned in your last guidance?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I don't think there's too much more than what was in the last guidance, maybe on the PDH
project. But, again, if we approve that this year, then that expense gets capitalized...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: ... going forward so.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Fair enough.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Just to be clear. The phenomena that Alan mentioned in the fourth quarter is unique to our
Regulated Gas Pipeline business, wherein that business you expense it until you have a probable asset and then once it
becomes probable you can actually capitalize previously expensed projects. In the Non-regulated business, you expense
it and then when you have a probable project, you expense going forward, but you can't go back and, call it, reclaim
what you previously expensed.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Understood. Great. Thanks for the time, guys, appreciate it.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

We'll go next to Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Quick question on – and I realize that it's a similar question to one that's been asked already. But
when you talk about the volume impacts, the limited volume impacts between the guidance provided on the third
quarter call and the guidance provided for the fourth quarter, can you quantify in terms of either segment profit or
EBITDA, the expected impact from volume metric declines either in the Western or the Eastern portions of the

Midstream business on segment profit or EBITDA in 2013 and 2014?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I think in the – I think the 150 million or so that Frank talked about along with some
other small things, I think is about $85 million, maybe $80 million to $120 million in total there is about what's in
there.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Okay. Great. And one of the, I guess, notes in the presentation when you announced the Access
transaction and mentioned again in your fourth quarter materials is the potential NGL pipeline project out of the
Marcellus. And I guess I'd be interested in your thoughts about how heavy NGL pipeline out of the Northeast might
potentially impact demand for local fractionation? And to the extent that a pipeline might reduce the demand for local
kind of Northeast sited fractionation, how a potential pipeline project, maybe underwritten by Chesapeake volumes,
would impact your plans for the development of the Caiman or Ohio Valley Midstream assets?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, that is an excellent question and I'll tell you we have a very good vantage point as
you can imagine given our investment in ACMP and our investment in Blue Racer. We have a very good vantage point
up there right now around the degree of fractionation and the degree of liquids that's available from this area.
And I will just tell you, I don't think that local fractionation is the answer up here. It is certainly going to overwhelm
these markets. And something large scale is going to need to be built. And even, frankly, as it supports an ethylene
cracker that Shell has announced and others have talked about, that also – having a big Raw Make line provide a lot of
flexibility in terms of ethane access back and forth between those markets. And so, we think that something definitely
needs to be done there and we're working very hard on that.
You heard Don mention earlier when asked about what we were going to do with all the extra cash at WMB, and based
on both continued cash distributions, as well as – I think when you do the math on it, you'll see there's quite a bit of
extra cash distribution there, particularly, in 2013 and 2014, given the tax rate and the performance in Canada.
And so, that is a very interesting place for us right now, and I'll tell you we have teams working that very hard. And it's
not as simple as just building a Raw Make pipeline into the Gulf Coast. There's a tremendous amount of issues about
where you land up that product and having the distribution network to distribute that product into the markets and into
big market outlets as we go forward. And so, I think if it was just as simple as just Raw Make pipeline, we'd probably
be past that at this point, but there's quite a bit of work we're doing on the distribution and storage end.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Got it. And given your comments that fractionation will likely overwhelm local demand in the
Northeast, does that make your Ohio Valley development more biased to focusing on just the de-ethanization
opportunities? Or maybe less focused on the fractionation and more focused on the gathering and processing side of
things?
<A - Francis E. Billings>: This is Frank Billings. I'd say it's a very good question. I think what we see relative to your
fractionation investment is that Williams will still have the opportunity to make those fractionation investments. I think
what we're really evaluating is the market location for those fractionation investments. The producers that we have
behind our OVM assets are going to be looking for a portfolio of markets to get into and I think we're well positioned
to provide local market opportunities for those producers that want to have access to those markets. But then I think
we're also going to be able to provide Gulf Coast markets and Gulf Coast access.
So, we're trying to position the producers such that they can maximize the value of their netback and we feel like we'll
still be able to make those investments. It may just be in different markets. We are looking at – behind OVM and we
think in this marketplace in the Northeast, we think there's opportunities to have some customized solutions or
customized infrastructure investments that allow Shell and others that are looking at chemical expansions to have the
ethane that they need and give them ethane supply certainty so they can make their investments.
And then we're looking at producers in Canada that want to have the condensates, so we're looking at ways to
consolidate our commodity such that they can have access to those. And then, obviously, the local market we'll look at
depropanizer investments to the extent that depropanization option makes sense.

But with access to the Gulf Coast you're going to see – you're going to start to see those different commodities being
sold into those markets based on the best netback at that time. And I think what we're doing with the NGL
infrastructure is providing the best opportunities for our producers and we think that's advantageous for them
long-term, but it also thinks it allows for us to place some pretty strategic investments in that area as well as the Gulf
Coast.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Great. And just one last question from me. Given the fact that you guys have made moves in –
in say, Western Canada to take an area that is – that's long propane and create your own solution to that with the PDH
facility, when you look at the Northeast, really Williams is pretty uniquely positioned in the sense that you are probably
the only operator either midstream or upstream up there who's got the know-how – who's got the access to liquids
volumes on the upstream side, as well the know-how to execute in olefins or petrochemical project.
Given the fact that I'd say the noise is out at Shell, sounds like they're probably a little bit more slow-moving and
conservative than folks who are long ethane producers – who are long ethane in the Northeast would like. Isn't there an
opportunity for Williams to get involved on the petrochemical side and maybe preempt a third-party petrochemical
project by building your own or JV-ing with one of those companies?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I would just say, first of all, our focus on the petchem side is to continue to provide
market outlet for both our product and for our producers' product and not to go headlong into the petrochemical
business. And so, I think it's always important to remember that. That we see that as a great hedge to our business and
we think it's important – an important part of a midstream company's role today with all the independent producers that
we have to develop the infrastructure and the market outlets. And so, while 20 years ago, you would've seen the majors
developing all that infrastructure and all that market outlet in – ahead or in concert with developing a big resource, we
think it's the role today of the major midstream players to do that.
And so, it's not out of the question, but I would just tell you that we have looked at it and looked at it and we think all
of the investment required in storage, particularly, underground storage, which as you can imagine is a challenge in the
Northeast. And all of the derivative market for all the product that's already interconnected into Gulf Coast is quite a bit
to overcome. And so, we certainly aren't the chemical players that Shell Chemical is and certainly wouldn't doubt their
understanding of that market. But from our standpoint, we'd have to get way into a lot of other derivative markets and
so forth to overcome that.
And so, for us, we think the simplest way is to get some of that product into markets that are expanding. And, frankly,
we look forward to working with Shell to help provide supplies in – as that is another market outlook as well and we
certainly intend to be connected to that if they go forward with that project.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: You bet.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thank you. I want to come back to this question on the use of cash at WMB and if you look at I
guess Page 83 of the data book, you've got about $2.32 of cash flow you're going to generate, even before the Canadian
operations, but paying out $1.75. If I just kind of playback what I've heard, it sounds like your preferences to reinvest
that excess cash flow into infrastructure rather than paying it out, maybe even say a special dividend or what not.
Maybe you could just walk us through how you're thinking about that excess cash flow?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, this is Don. Yeah, I think we would prefer to reinvest it. We think that, certainly, in
terms of the dividend to increase the dividend on the back of accelerated depreciation with knowledge that the rate's
going to go up in a couple of years is really not that sustainable. Obviously, we expect to have much higher cash flows
in a couple of years. But nonetheless, just with the opportunity set that we see in front of us, I think we've talked a lot

about and Alan just put a voice to the opportunities we see around the NGL side of the business, we think that capital is
– can be strategically invested at very attractive rates of return and we think that will really provide greater value for
investors long-term.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, great. Next question was just on the WPZ and the cash distribution. I mean, we're
forecasting sort of just over 1.0 times in 2014, and you made a – I think comment in the press release about getting
back to normal levels. I mean, how are you seeing – where you want normal levels for coverage to be – understanding
that we've got sort of weaker propane prices and NGL margins and what not? But I'm just trying to figure out where we
ought to think about as a normalized coverage ratio target?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I would comment that we would like to see the coverage at or above 1.0 over an extended
period of time. I'll remind you over 2010, 2011, we were operating at kind of 1.3, 1.4 times coverage. So, if you take...
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Sure.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: The two strong, two very strong years and then if you take 2012 and our current guidance
on 2013, you'll still end up way above 1.0. So, again, I think there will be ups and downs in coverage. As you'll recall,
when we had coverage up in the 1.3, 1.4 range, a lot of investors and analysts were suggesting that we should raise the
distribution. And we said it's high because margins are high and we want to be in a position that when margins roll
back and they will because they always do and then they'll go back up that we're not under too much stress or strain.
So, we really look at it on a longer-term basis. So, I think, longer-term, we'd like to be 1.0 or better. And if we're better
than 1.0, we're pretty happy about that.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And I would add to that it's certainly – if we saw this as a business that wasn't growing and
we had that kind of coverage that would be one thing, but we certainly see a transitory nation – in nature and we
certainly put a lot of equity into this business and funding a lot of this cash flow that's very – that's yet to come on in
terms of driving our distribution. And so, I think we feel very good about where we are. And as Don said, we really
look to the long-term. But I think to answer your question, we certainly – if we were in a steady-state kind of
environment, we would want to be in the 1.0 to 1.10 range if we were in a steady-state environment.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: And certainly our business mix will be a factor in that. As you know, we're moving more
and more to a fee-based portfolio. And, as well, Access is entirely fee-based. And as the cash distributions back to
Williams grow off Access that will further shift us toward fee. And then it's a question of what kind of margins we
enjoy? And if we're in a low-margin cycle, the coverage would be tighter. And if we're in a high-margin cycle, it'll be
more robust. But I think the business mix, and you have to think about Access as a contributor to that as well.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Great. And then, last one, just small one from me, you talked about the attractive economics of
running propane versus ethane. Just how much can you run through Geismar, sort of an ethane propane mix, if you
think about that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, we can run about 30% on an inlet-volume basis in propane.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. That's it from me. Thanks, guys.

We'll go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate all the color and the time. At this point, I just
have a few clarifying questions if I could, and maybe the first is just on Ohio Valley and the 150 million a day that was
referenced of delay. I didn't catch – is that something that we'll sort of see kind of a consistent delay through 2013 and
2014? Or by 2014, for instance, should the challenges of getting the right equipment in place be surpassed where we
don't have any of those curtailments in that $80 million to $120 million of EBITDA, Alan, I believe you referenced

won't be dragging anymore. Can I just get a little bit clarification on that?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Sure. This is Frank again. Yeah, that 100 [million] – that volume that I referenced, that's
volume that we know is available to us today. It's actually produced volume that's just behind our system. And we feel
we're going to get the majority of those operational issues resolved in the second quarter. So, we're hoping that we have
that volume flowing freely to our Fort Beeler facility into our fractionation assets in 2013.
So, really, it's on us to make certain that we get through the operating and asset issues that we've been dealing with over
the last few months and we get the assets stabilized. And when we do that, we'll have a nice base business for 2013,
and we will be able to grow forward from there per the guidance.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. So, we actually have the – reading the guidance, that volume is actually coming back, call
it, by midyear then?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Yeah, midyear to the end of the year.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay. All right.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I think that the challenge is all the time we're doing that, of course, there's new volumes
being drilled. And so, we constantly will be in a catch-up mode for some time. I think it's important to note, though, if
you look at Laurel Mountain, we've been at that for a while now and we are now ahead of Chevron finally out there in
terms of capacity. We're getting close to being there. While I would say we're going to be on a treadmill for a long time
in Northeast with Cabot, some of the other producers there, I would say we're pretty well at pace with those producers
right now. And we just – things have moved faster in OVM, particularly, again, from a liquids production standpoint,
both of in terms of richer gas and higher degrees of condensate.
So, I think we're very confident in our ability to catch up, but I would just say given the productivity of those reserves,
we're going to be on a treadmill there for a long, long time to come. And likely will be having some lagging excess
capacity or excess production held behind our infrastructure for quite a while.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: And, Alan, if I could just as a follow-up on that, the – I guess the producer frustration – is all of
this, in effect, call it industry rich gas related? Has there been any execution type of issues where Williams has stubbed
its toe? I just want to make sure there's no risk of brand franchise bruising, for instance.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I'll let Frank take that. But I would just tell you we're not the only one struggling up
there. I think about anybody if they were honest with you would tell you that what's going on up there is a lot of this.
And, as well, the producers are having their own issues upstream of our facilities as well. And, Frank, I don't know if
you want to add some color to that?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Sure. I would say the issues that we've had have been mostly around our field receipt points
and, obviously, those are vital in getting the production into our gathering systems and ultimately into our processing
assets. We've not completed those installations as timely as we would have liked. And then we have experienced
inconsistent operations and reliability as production has come back up to those facilities.
Again, for 2013, I think our key operating issue for us is going to be to optimize and stabilize the current assets that we
have in place and have the facilities better match to the gas quality of the production. No one really knows with
certainty the composition until it's actually produced. And I think we've experienced some mismatched facilities to the
production and the – and then what we're seeing out there. So, the reserves are there. Obviously, I think the producers
would be producing more, but we have to reliably handle the production and move the production for these producers.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. Thank you. And maybe just last question, Don, just a clarification on the cash tax
guidance and understanding what's happened has been a benefit both of ACMP, as well as legislation on bonus
depreciation. Is it possible to attribute that in any way 90% to ACMP, 10% to the legislation? I mean, if we were trying
to basically ascribe a benefit, if you will, even prior to legislation from the purchase price, for instance, of ACMP, this
is real value you guys are getting. Is there any way to do that?

And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the long call here.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I got a couple of questions. If we can kind of dig a little deeper into the petchem services at the
MB level, it's got the distinction of being kind of a growth opportunity that if you had 7 times the investment to
EBITDA, maybe having $100 million of EBITDA in a couple of years and can be dropped down because it's in the
states. Can you discuss kind of the long-term vision of that? And at what point in parts or in whole a dropdown might
make sense?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Certainly, that would make a lot of sense. I don't think there'd be really any prohibition to
the majority of the investments that we're making there from being qualified income. And certainly, we feel like WPZ's
pretty full on capital opportunity right now. And so, WPZ is well-positioned to do a lot of that development. And
certainly, it centers around the kind of things we've talked about in the past, tremendous amount of liquids coming into
the area and a lot of changes going on in the petchem space there where parties are trying to crack lighter products. And
that changes a lot of things. It changes butane movements, changes propylene movements, a lot of things that change as
a result of the feedstock coming into those plants changing.
And we have been thinking for some time there'll be quite a shift in logistics requirements for the business and that you
can't build all these new cracking capacity in the Gulf Coast and not have a lot of new logistics issues. And so, we've
been working to get ahead of that, both in terms of giving our supplies and our producers' supplies access to better
markets. But as well, helping serve the petchem market in an open-access manner, which heretofore has been pretty
much not the way business has been done in the Gulf Coast in terms of having open-access pipelines for all these
products in between the facilities. And so, we think there's been a huge opportunity left to us there to be that
open-access provider for services.
And so, we continue to see a lot of opportunities. We picked up pipelines from BP that were underutilized. We picked
up pipelines from Exxon that were underutilized, and we picked up a pipeline from the Explorer that were
underutilized. And we have quite a bit of similar activity going on to continue to have distribution networks that move
with an expanding market there.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Alan, do I understand what you're saying is that there's not just obvious opportunities for the
organic CapEx that's already laid out on the acquired pipes, but there's incremental M&A opportunities in that
segment?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say its pretty – they're pretty modest relative to what we normally – what you'd
normally hear from us in terms of M&A. And so, those acquisitions that we've made over the last couple of years are in
total I think $400 million or somewhere in that ballpark. And so, I would say – combined. And so, I would say it's those
kind of pick-ups we'll continue to assemble smaller investments like that and piece them together into a smart network.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. A couple other quick follow-ups, noticed the CapEx costs on the Canadian off-gas
ethane project were up from 3Q guidance. Is this just incremental accretive CapEx on an expanding offtake? Or is it
simply inflation?

<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: The – this is Randy Newcomer. The Canadian ethane project – recovery project at
Redwater is currently in construction and slated to be completed in May of this year. And so, what that represents is
additional – a better cost estimation basically for completion of the project. So it's inflation in the cost of the project.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And last question from me. I noticed that the ethylene price [ph] stock (54:26) had some
changes. We went up a little in 2013, which is benefiting Geismar margins there. But then, we kind of flat-lined into
2014 versus what was previously assumed to be a steep contango into the following year. Can you discuss kind of
what's driving the long-term expectations there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. We continue to really follow CMAI's forecast there. And so, you'll see that's right in
line with CMAI's forecast. And that earlier, I think, $0.62 that we had in there is also right in line with CMAI. So, lot of
moving parts in that space, and we think those guys did a pretty good job of providing that guidance. And so, we take a
look and certainly are influenced heavily by their perspective and that's actually what drove that.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I got you. So, this can easily jump around quarter to quarter in terms of long-term guidance. It's
not something you're trying to kind of neutralize by flat-lining it?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That's correct.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: And I would say, certainly, this year, right now, that forecast is conservative relative to
what we're seeing on the ethylene and certainly conservative – our forecast is conservative compared to what we're
seeing right now in propylene. But certainly, there'll be some volumes continuing, new ethylene production coming on
as some of these new facilities get back on line. So, I don't think that's going to be real big, frankly, in 2013 and maybe
not even in 2014. But beyond that, we'll probably start see ethylene production pick up.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. Thank you.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Sharon.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Looking at, I guess, your guidance for the Geismar volumes is the difference really just related to
the timing of the expansion?
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: The – are you referring to – this is Randy Newcomer. Are you referring to the volume
just under 125 million?
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Yes.
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: Basically, it's several different factors, but the primary factors are related to the timing of
the turnaround where we are running longer, moving the turnaround from the spring to the fall between turnaround
cycles. And at the end of the – tail end of turnaround you end up having a little bit of natural degradation in your
production capacity over the course of the run, so that's impacting it a little bit.
The second thing is, as we're planning this turnaround, obviously, it's a combination of both maintenance activities and
tie-in related to the expansion. And so, as you might expect, there's a lot of complexity to that and the need for a lot of
good planning effort. We're not quite finished with the final plan for the activity during that timeframe, but we've
injected a little bit of additional – as Alan spoke to before – a little bit more conservatism into the volume forecast of

understanding that there'll probably be a few bobbles as we come up from the expansion.
We're going to come up after the turnaround in full expansion mode, whereas before we were going to come up at the
current rate and then bring the expansion on later in the year. With moving the timing of the turnaround to the fall, we
will be coming up off the turnaround in full expansion mode; so a combination of factors there.
Additionally, when you'll crack heavy with propane versus ethylene you make a little bit less ethylene and more
propylene. And so, we really have to look at the total olefins production rather than just ethylene and the 125 million
pounds per year is related just to ethylene. If you net it with the other olefins that you produce, that certainly are
valuable as well, like propylene, it's about 100 million pounds a year.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And do you anticipate, I guess, cracking propane at that 30% max or close to it this year?
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: It just depends on the relative price at any given point in time. We tune that up each
month.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. So, basically, if you took our assumptions on the ethane-to-ethylene spread, anytime
we're cracking propane to propylene, it's an upgrade to those economics. That's the only reason we would be doing that
is that if we see better economics. And obviously, right now, we're seeing better economics cracking propane. And so –
so that's always kind of an upside to the basic ethane-to-ethylene spread.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, okay. And then, maybe if you could talk about Williams' competitive position in bidding for
the new pipeline project in Florida?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: Yeah, this is Frank Ferazzi. We, like much of the rest of the market, have received the
documents for FP&L's RFP. And so, it's a complicated set – it's a complicated RFP. It's 200 pages or more. And so,
we're in a process of evaluating both the commercial aspects of the RFP, as well as our financial planning people
looking at the route and coming up with an estimate of capital. And so, we have a lot of work to do between now and
early April when responses to the RFP are due. And have not yet decided whether we're going to bid or not. I would
say that I think Gulfstream is in a good position: currently in the marketplace, strong assets, strong relationships with
the market, so I think that will give us an advantage in the end.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And I guess if you do decide to bid, would this be a project you're pursuing with Spectra like
a JV, 50%/50% JV?
<A - Frank J. Ferazzi>: It would be a project, a bid that would come from Gulfstream, which, of course, is owned by
Williams and Spectra jointly.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay, great. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from T. J. Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - T. J. Schultz>: Hey, guys, just following up on the NGL projects in the Marcellus and Utica. I guess as the liquid
takeaway options evolve and options for ethane takeaway come along, what is the status or interest level of your
proposed confluence rich gas project there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would say confluences has merged into a lot of different things but we are in really
good shape there, I would say. And have made good progress on contracting with parties in the area that'll look
different than what we originally laid out. But in terms of investment opportunity, it'll look very much the same. And
so, we're excited about that and it's helping, as well – it's helping to support our confidence in a large Raw Make system
being built in the Gulf Coast as well. And so, things are coming together there very nicely.
<Q - T. J. Schultz>: Okay. Thanks. Everything else I had was answered. Appreciate it.

And we'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Back to the question on the use of cash at WMB. The coverage ratio at PZ is – was 0.95 in
2012 and we've talked about where it is for 2013, and 2014 it's 1.0 times with some nice increases in ethane and
propane. I guess I'm looking for more on – at what point does NV support PZ, given that they need to do equity and
forgo some [ph] RDRs (1:02:34) with some of that use of cash, given that it's a fairly weak outlook for the next couple
of years?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Becca, this is Don. I'd say it's a fairly hypothetical question right now. I mean, I appreciate
the question, but I would say it would depend on the facts and circumstances that develop. I would say if, again, the
plan that we laid out, we execute on the plan. We don't believe there's a need for support. We'll see how things play out.
And if the situation were to be more difficult, that'd be something we'd have to consider. But I think it's hard to be
formulaic about it. Again, we look at – and in terms of coverage, we looked at 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, so if you
really look at kind of the five-year average and, again, the five years is well above 1.0.
Yes, we expect 2013 to be below 1.0, but, again, we're also investing a tremendous amount of capital in fee-based
growth projects that we expect to come into service in 2014 and 2015 and really loose the fee-based cash flows and
boost the coverage, at the same that we're raising distributions. And 2013 is burdened by the carrying cost of those
projects, both in terms of equity and debt that have been issued to fund that growth. So, it's not just about commodity
price, but it's about the tremendous growth that's occurring and the carrying cost event.
So, again, we think this is still just a near-term challenge and, again, with the business plan that we've laid out and
assuming effective execution, we think we'll be through this in a relatively short order.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you guys. That's all I had.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Becca.

And we'll take our next question from Selman Akyol with Stifel.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Appreciate all the detail. Just going back to Geismar for a minute or two, first of all, can you just
remind us of the contract structure? Or are you just selling all into the spot market?
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: Well, this is Randy Newcomer. We have a number of contracts and our contract mix, as
Alan alluded to earlier, is changing. A lot of our ethane-plus kind of contracts and our collared ethylene sales have
rolled off. And, in fact, as of now we really only have one that is on sale on ethane-plus basis. The rest of them are all
contracts that are priced at market basically. Some of them are spot. Some of them are yearly contracts, but the pricing's
based on more spot kind of pricing.
And we purposely have done that because we believe in the fundamentals of that – that ethylene's going to continue to
be in good demand and we'll have a great ethylene crack going forward. So, we've positioned ourselves to be exposed

to the full crack for the present and – including our expanded volumes as they come on later in the year.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Okay. And then, given your ability to, I guess, to crack propane into propylene, given margins
have been extremely robust for propylene this first quarter, would you expect high margins then going into Q1?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yes, we do.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Okay. And then, if you look at in the 2014, looks like your capacity utilization assumptions are
pretty high then going into as well and you're seeing that, I guess, reflected by your customers, too?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: You're talking about on the volumes...
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Yeah.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: At Geismar?
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Yes.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, yeah, that's obviously a full year of the expansion coming up and actually what's
driving that. Even in the fourth quarter of this year, because what we said we built in some conservatism. We normally
– you normally see us putting in a – depending on how many – how much downtime we expect for the year, but
normally you'd see us running around 98% to 99% uptime on a facility like that. And I think we've got somewhere in
the 92% range built in just following the start-up there in the fourth quarter. Again, just trying to be conservative
relative to kind of bobbles we might experience as we bring that new facility up. So, it's a combination of those two
things that is driving, but, obviously, the big driver is the new expansion that'll be online a full year in 2014.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Great. And then, just looking back to your guidance, you have about $2 billion forecasted for
distributions in 2013. Can you say how many units that's based on?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Asking how many units?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: That's a good question. We haven't disclosed the number of units, but it would be –
obviously, the current units outstanding and some plan for – or some assumption on new units, and we're not prepared
to provide guidance on that at this point.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: All right. And then, one very small last question from me. The Mid-Atlantic Connector, when
do you have that coming on line in 2013?
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: Just one second. Yeah, Mid-Atlantic Connector actually went in service last week.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Okay.
<A - Randy M. Newcomer>: It was originally scheduled to be in service in November, but we had a two-month delay.
<Q - Selman Akyol>: Thank you very much.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.
