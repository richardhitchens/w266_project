MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to The Allstate Corporation Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference
Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior
Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert L. Block
Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today's for Allstate's second quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. After our prepared remarks presented by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we will have a
question and answer session. Last night, we issued our press release and Investor Supplement, filed our 10-Q for the
second quarter 2013 and posted a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also
posted a document describing our current reinsurance program. All of these are available on our website.
This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ
materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012, our 10-Q for the second quarter and our most
recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for
which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. We're recording this call and a replay will be
available following the conclusion of the call. I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after
the call.

Now, I'll turn the program over to Tom Wilson. Tom?
Thomas J. Wilson
Good morning and thanks for investing your time with us. I'll start by covering the second quarter results as they relate
to our strategy and our 2013 priorities. Bob and Steve will cover the business performance and capital actions that were
taken in the quarter. The performance this quarter is driven by a strong management team, who's familiar, of course, to
many of you, and they're here as well to provide additional perspective in the question and answer period. So: Matt
Winter, who leads our Allstate Agency business; Don Civgin, who has responsibility for Allstate Financial and
Esurance. Judy Greffin is our Chief Investment Officer. Don Bailey leads the Emerging Businesses and Sam Pilch is
our Corporate Controller.
We generated solid results in the second quarter, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy, which is to offer
unique products and services to distinct customer segments. This strategy distinguishes us from the other personal lines
companies, who focus on either one customer segment or just using different methods of distribution. We believe that a
focus on the entire value proposition will lead to longer-term growth and profitability. You can see positive outcomes
from this strategy this quarter, particularly as the impacts from restructuring the Allstate brand homeowner's business
becomes less severe.
On Slide 2, we show the four customer segments and our property-liability results for each one. The three brands where
we underwrite the risks, Allstate, Encompass, and Esurance, all grew in net written premium and Answer Financial also
increased non-proprietary premium. The Allstate brand, which serves customers who prefer local advice and assistance
and a branded experience, units declined from the prior year quarter, but increased from the first quarter of 2013. Auto
policies were flat versus a year ago, while homeowners declined by 4.4%, reflecting the actions taken to improve
returns. As these profit improvement actions are successful, we believe the negative impact on growth will be reduced.
The Allstate agencies did a great job this quarter. They had very strong results, with higher customer satisfaction,
improved retention for standard auto and homeowners, strong new business growth, reflecting both company marketing
and local agency initiative. The actions taken over the last three years to position high-performing agencies for success,
by concentrating on supporting them and restructuring compensation, is working. This segment maintained
profitability, with a combined ratio of 94.6 and an underlying combined ratio of 85.4, as rate increases essentially offset
modest loss cost increases.
The Encompass brand, in the upper left, serves customers who want local advice, but a choice of products and services,
continued to show positive growth with units up 6.8%. Strategically, we remain focused on household penetration with
our unique package policy that represents about 75% of Encompass' volume. The combined ratio in the quarter was
102.4, with an underlying combined ratio of 92.7. Pricing and underwriting actions continue to be undertaken to
improve margins.
The Esurance brand serves a self-directed brand-sensitive customer segment and continues to generate significant
premium and unit growth, as it successfully leverages the benefits of being part of Allstate. Increased advertising that's
more effective, sophisticated pricing for preferred risk auto customers and improved claim practices are designed to
acquire and retain profitable lifetime value customers. The combined ratio remained high at 119.7, reflecting the high
levels of marketing spend and the expensing of acquisition intangibles. The loss ratio did increase over the prior year
quarter; however, reflecting increased bodily injury severities and higher than expected discount utilization. Gary
Tolman and Esurance team are working closely with Don to adjust pricing and underwriting to ensure we maintain the
long-term profitability of this growth.
Overall, our customer-focused strategy is strengthening our competitive position. On Slide 3, we provide a progress
report on the five operating priorities for 2013. I've already covered the grow insurance premiums priority for
property-liability. Allstate Financial increased premiums and contract charges 3.6% over the second quarter of 2012.
That growth in premiums and contract charges for underwritten products was 4.8%, with Allstate Benefits growing
11.9% compared to the prior year quarter.

We maintained auto profitability in the quarter, with a standard auto combined ratio of 97 for the three underwriting
brands, comparable to the second quarter of last year. The Allstate brand, which represents about 90% of the earned
premium, had a combined ratio of 94.9. That's 0.6 points better than last year's second quarter and an underlying
combined ratio of 94.2, which is slightly higher than the prior year quarter. We continued to make progress on raising
returns in homeowners, with a combined ratio of 95.3, a 9.1 point improvement from Q2 2012. Allstate brand
homeowners had a combined ratio of 95.2 and an underlying combined ratio of 62.7, 1.9 points better than the prior
year quarter. Annuity returns did increase in the second quarter, but the long-term outlook is still challenged by long –
low interest rates.
Our fourth goal is to proactively manage investments. In the second quarter, we continued to mitigate the impact of
rising interest rates on the property-liability portfolio by selling long bonds and investing in shorter maturities. If you
look over the last year and a half, the percentage of bonds with maturities longer than seven years decreased from 46%
to 20% of the property-liability portfolio. If we had not taken this approach, investment income, of course, would have
been higher, but the value of the portfolio would have declined by more than it did this quarter. If you just measure it
over the last nine months, the portfolio would have declined by an additional $400 million, as interest rates rose in the
second quarter. The total return for the quarter was a negative 1.5%, as the unrealized gain position declined in value
by $2.7 billion in the quarter.
The fifth priority is to reduce our cost structure, so we can give customers great value with a differentiated offering. We
announced the closing of a call center and introduced employee benefit changes that are effective at the beginning of
2014, that will equalize benefits amongst employees and reduce costs. We're also eliminating some retiree life
insurance benefits starting in 2014 up through 2016. In the quarter, our property-liability expense ratio did increase,
primarily due to technology and marketing investments to support profitable growth. Over time, we expect this ratio to
decline.
As you know, we also took another step to improve shareholder returns from Allstate Financial, by entering into an
agreement to sell Lincoln Benefit Life to The Resolution Group. Lincoln Benefit primarily serves customers that want
local advice and a choice of life and annuity products, which is the upper left-hand quadrant on the four square. It also
manufactured life and annuity products that were sold through Allstate agencies.
Strategically, we did not have a differentiated offering, corporate capability or size to generate attractive returns serving
life and annuity customers through independent agencies. As a result, we chose to exit this business, as we did with
variable annuities to banker broker distribution channels, and payout annuities. This will enable us to redeploy capital
into higher return activities. We will retain the life insurance risks written through the Allstate agencies via a
reinsurance agreement. We also announced Allstate Financial's decision to stop writing fixed annuities, but we will
provide Allstate agencies and exclusive financial specialists with similar non-proprietary products, so they can fully
meet customers' needs.
Now, let me turn it back over to Bob.
Robert L. Block
Thanks, Tom. On Slide 4, we provide financial highlights for our consolidated results, as well as property-liability and
Allstate Financial. Referring to the top-half of the slide, on a consolidated basis, we generated net income of $434
million, or $0.92 per common share, in the second quarter. The increase over the prior year quarter was primarily
driven by higher after-tax realized capital gains and operating income more than offsetting the $312 million after-tax
loss on the repurchase of $1.83 billion of debt as part of our capital management program.
Operating income of $529 million, or $1.12 per common share, increased 22.5% from Q2 2012, driven primarily from
lower catastrophe losses in the second quarter 2013 compared to the prior year quarter. Net income return on equity
was 11.6% and 12.3% on an operating income basis, both increases from the second quarter 2012.

Details underlying these overall results are shown on the bottom-half of the slide. Property-liability recorded $617
million in net income for the second quarter, a significant increase compared to the prior year quarter. Earned premium
of $6.9 billion grew 2.9% from Q2 2012, with a combined ratio of 96.1, an improvement of 1.9 points. Catastrophe
losses in the second quarter were $647 million, down $172 million from the prior year quarter. The underlying
combined ratio for the quarter was 86.9, below the full year outlook range and 0.6 points higher than the second quarter
of 2012.
Now, before the question about updating the outlook range for the underlying combined ratio of 88 to 90 set earlier this
year can be raised in the Q&A, I want to say that we are not updating the range at this time. Should the first half trends
continue for the second half of 2013, we could finish the year a little better than or at the lower end of this range.
The combined ratios on a recorded and underlying basis for each brand are shown on the lower right-hand side of the
exhibit. The Allstate brand continued to generate solid profitability, as the positive effects of rate changes essentially
offset the modest increases in loss cost on an underlying basis. Encompass recorded combined ratio results for the
quarter were comparable to the prior year quarter, while the underlying combined ratio improved by 4.3 points.
Esurance combined ratio of 119.7 remained elevated, reflecting the impacts of increased new business volume, higher
bodily injury severities and increased utilization of price discounts.
Allstate Financial posted net income of $190 million in the quarter, an improvement of $58 million from Q2 2012.
Operating income benefited from favorable results in the benefit and investment spreads, partially offset by a small
increase in operating costs. Realized capital gains were higher than second quarter 2012 by $32 million after-tax.
Premiums and contract charges increased 3.6% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012, helped by an
11.9% increase for Allstate Benefits.
On Slide 5, we provide net written premium and policy in force trends by brand and in total. For property-liability, net
written premium increased 4.2% from the second quarter 2012 and overall units were essentially flat with the prior year
quarter and grew 177,000 from the first quarter 2013. Our strategy to provide unique products and services to distinct
consumer segments is working, as net written premium grew compared to the second quarter 2012 for each brand and
units also increased from the first quarter 2013.
Within the Allstate brand, which serves customers who prefer local advice, assistance and a branded experience,
standard auto net written premium of $4 billion increased 2.8% from the prior year quarter, while units increased
sequentially that were flat year-over-year. Allstate brand homeowners' net written premium of $1.7 billion grew 3.3%
and unit volume declined at a slower rate than the prior quarter. Results for both of these lines reflect favorable trends
in new business and retention. On the bottom two charts, you can see the growth trends for Encompass, which serves
customers who want local advice, but a choice of products and services, and Esurance, serving self-directed
brand-sensitive customers. Both continued to grow compared to prior year in net written premium and units.
And we've been able to maintain margins as net written premium trends improve. On Slide 6, we have combined the
margin trends for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners on one slide. The charts on the left-hand side of the
slide show the earned premium and loss trend per policy, while the charts on the right-hand side show the combined
ratio trends. For standard auto, losses per policy increased at a rate just slightly higher than the earned premium per
policy. Essentially flat frequencies and moderate increases in severities were partially offset by increases in rates. The
combined ratio for standard auto remained at a consistently profitable level.
For Allstate brand homeowners, shown on the bottom-half of the slide, loss cost increases per policy remain at very
low levels, running below the increase in earned premium per policy. This resulted in an improvement in the
underlying combined ratio of 1.9 points to 62.7. The recorded combined ratio for the quarter was 95.2, a 9.7 point gain
from prior year.
Now, let's go to Steve.

Thank you, Bob. Second quarter investment results reflect continued interest rate risk reduction actions in our
property-liability portfolio maintaining alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile and continued
repositioning of our public equity portfolio to a more targeted strategy. The carrying value of our portfolio declined $5
billion to $92.3 billion compared to $97.3 billion at year end, reflecting the reduction in Allstate Financial's
spread-based liabilities, as well as lower fixed income valuations due to higher interest rates. We continue to increase
the equity and owned component of our portfolio from which we expect to generate higher returns over time; however,
earnings from these assets will be more variable.
On Slide 7, you can see net investment income totaled $984 million in the second quarter, slightly ahead of the prior
quarter, but lower than the second quarter of 2012. The decline in core debt income was mitigated somewhat by
prepayment fees, as well as litigation proceeds, which added, in aggregate, $37 million in net investment income for the
quarter. Total portfolio yield was 4.6%, slightly ahead of the prior quarter and consistent with the second quarter of
2012.
Turning to total return on the bottom-right graph, lower fixed income valuations resulting from significant increase in
Treasury rates, led to a negative total return of 1.5% for the second quarter, despite a consistent contribution from net
investment income. An attribution of the change in unrealized capital gain is provided on the bottom-left of the slide.
The increase in rates, along with somewhat wider credit spreads, drove a $2.4 billion decrease in our unrealized capital
gains compared to year end 2012, $2.2 billion of which occurred in the second quarter.
While the decrease in unrealized gains during the quarter was significant, we estimate the valuation decline in our
property-liability portfolio was mitigated by approximately $400 million, through the repositioning of the portfolio that
began in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, Allstate Financials' assets and liabilities are more effectively
matched on an economic basis.
Move to Slide 8, depicts trends in our property-liability and Allstate Financial business units. As you can see in the
graph in the top-left, the earned yield trend on our property-liability core debt reflects four quarters of risk reduction
activity. Through our risk reduction actions, we positioned the portfolio to be less adversely impacted by an increase in
interest rates and pulls forward future income through realization of gains and the sale of longer-term securities, as
shown in the scheduled maturity graph in the upper-right. The current yield on intermediate corporates, our targeted
reinvestment proxy, is approximately 1.75% to 2%. Given the shortfall relative to the portfolio yield, maturity and sales
activities have and will continue to result in a decline in net investment income for the core debt portfolio.
For Allstate Financial, you can see at the bottom of the page, the net investment income has declined as a result of the
managed reduction of spread-based liabilities, a trend that will be accelerated with the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.
Over the past few years, Allstate Financial's investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows,
rather than being reinvested. So the portfolio yield has not declined as much as the property-liability portfolio. Future
investment income will continue to be impacted by the pace of the liability outflows and reinvestment activity.
Slide 9 provides a recap of the recent transactions we have announced. In May, we initiated a capital management plan,
designed to increase our capital flexibility to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. We purchased $1.83
billion of debt, recognizing an after-tax loss of $312 million in the second quarter. We issued $500 million each of 10
year and 30 year notes and $287.5 million of preferred – perpetual preferred stock. We expect to issue an additional
approximately $2 billion of perpetual preferred stock and subordinated "hybrid" debt to complete the debt refinancing,
prefund our $950 million of 2014 maturity and complete the current share repurchase program.
After the quarter closed, we announced changes to our pension and life insurance benefits, as well as the pending sale
of Lincoln Benefit Life. The impacts will be reflected in our financial statements beginning in the third quarter. The
table at the bottom of the slide summarizes the estimated impacts of each on a pro forma basis as if they had occurred
at June 30, based on the mid-point of the ranges we have announced. Our pension and post-retirement liabilities will be
re-measured effective July 15 and the impact of the changes in benefits and a higher discount rate, given the rising
interest rates during the year, will be recognized, for the most part, in accumulated other comprehensive income as a
component of equity. A separate curtailment gain related to the changes in retiree life will be recognized in income.
The impact on ongoing retirement and benefit expenses is currently being calculated based upon an assumption as of

July 15.
As Tom mentioned, the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life exit the business, which we did not have a competitive customer or
market position. The transaction reduces our financial risk and is expected to free up approximately $1 billion of
deployable capital. This capital will be freed up in The Allstate Life Insurance Company and, as you know, a number
of steps will be necessary for us to move that ultimately to the parent company. Lincoln Benefit Life will be treated as
held-for-sale beginning in the third quarter, with its assets and liabilities collapsed into separate lines on the balance
sheet. The estimated loss on the sale will be recorded and adjusted in future quarters until the sale is closed.
We remain in a strong capital position at the end of the second quarter. Slide 10 shows our capital position at various
points in time. We have split up the long-term debt between senior debt and "hybrid" debt, so you can see the change in
the make-up over time. When our capital plan is fully completed, we expect the split between senior and "hybrid" debt
to be approximately 60% to 40%. Our estimated statutory surplus at June 30 is $17 billion in total, with $13.6 billion
estimated for the property-liability companies. Holding company level assets were $2.4 billion. As Bob noted, our net
and operating returns on equity were consistent with the last few quarters in the 11% to 12% range, overall, a solid
quarter. We made good progress on the execution of our customer-focused strategy and our 2013 priorities.
With that, why don't we open it up to questions?
Robert L. Block
Okay, Matt, if you can start the Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question,
please?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Sure. Thanks. So just one question on standard auto, I mean, looks like so sequentially, PIF
grew. The year-over-year decline was the lowest it's been in awhile. If we were just to roll forward that sequential
growth, you could looking at PIF growth, for the first time in a long time, later this year. I mean, is that something that
you're thinking about? Is that something that you're moving towards, just given where the profitability is there now or
just love your thoughts on that? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Mike, I assume you're talking about the Allstate brand, which...
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Correct. Yes...
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yes. I'll throw that to Matt's way.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Thanks, Michael. Certainly, we're looking at that and focused on that. And our goal is to do
it. We've been – what we've been working on for many years, which is to position ourselves so that we can get in a
position that both new business and retention are improving and we retain the strong muscle of auto profitability at the
same time. And so a lot of effort has gone into that. A lot of that was influenced by actions that we had to take in the
homeowners market. As you know, now that our decline in the homeowners PIF has slowed and the new business has
picked up there, that has also assisted in the standard auto line. 80% of our homeowners' new business comes with at
least one auto.
And so that, in combination with all of the work that the team has done and the agency owners have done to drive new
business and improve retention, has put us in a position where we're looking forward to continuing to make momentum
on the new business and the retention and we believe that, over time, that will yield favorable results for us.

<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: So looking at that 2Q to 1Q sequential, I mean, is that something – is that fair to kind of
think about extrapolating in terms of your – internally, your own goal to say, hey, look, we're here, we think we can
start turning this into actually positive growth this year?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Well, it's always dangerous to extrapolate from one quarter. We think we see a lot of positive
trends. We think we're doing a lot of things that have long-term sustainable impact. And we believe as long as we're
diligent, they'll have long-term favorable results.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thanks. And then just one quick one on the life business, is there anything in there for
the second quarter that is non-recurring, I mean, and we want to – would think about what the economics are there,
excluding the transaction that you guys just completed? Is there anything else we need to peel out from those results to
have sort of a clean number?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yes. I'll let Don answer that. But you should not expect operating income to stay at its level
that it's at for – obviously, there's some one-time items Don can talk about. But secondly, remember that business keeps
getting smaller. So as it gets smaller in size, obviously, it's going to generate less operating income.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yes, Mike, it's Don. I'd say there's nothing, strictly speaking, that is non-recurring. Nothing from
the sales LTL is reflected in there. But there's a lot of volatility in the investment income line and we had a really good
quarter.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Stanford Bernstein. Your question, please?
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So a couple of years ago, you guys identified
13% ROE by 2014 as a – sort of the primary operating goal that the firm was going to be positioned around. You've
made a lot of progress to that. You're coming close to, I think, you're regularly hitting a 12% on an operating basis.
Should we still think about that as a 2014 – as the firm's 2014 objective, as you're now starting to work through your
annual planning process?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yes. Morning, Josh. This is Tom.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi, Tom.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good memory. So first, two years ago, we established a goal of 13% by 2014, when we
were operating on about a 9% return, which was a 400 basis points improvement. And at that point, it was really to
show that we had conviction that we could make substantial improvements in returns. It was not an indicator that 13%
was the exact right sweet spot on creating shareholder value. Now, there were some assumptions underneath that 400
basis point improvement. One was we had to make sure we maintained auto profitability, which you see we've continue
to do.
Second, about 70% of that increase was related to improving returns in homeowners. And we're well on our way there.
I suspect we'll get somewhere we'll get into that this morning. Matt can give you an update on that.
There were two other goals. One was maintain investment income. And rates have moved down by about 250 basis
points since that time, so we're not on track to maintain that portion of the increase. And then lastly, it was to raise
returns at Allstate Financial from 9% – about 9% to 10%. And as you can see, because of the interest rates and some
other things that are going on, that we're not at that point either. So we're working hard on those last two items, as you
know.
At the same time, we're also investing more in Esurance than we thought we were because we like the growth there.
And we're changed the capital structure some. So there's a bunch of moving pieces in there. As we get closer to 2014,

we'll be updating our range and you'll be able to figure out with where the capital structure is and where we are, what it
will look like for next year, but we're not giving any indication.
I'll tell you, though, our goal, of course, is just to get as attractive a return as we can, while driving growth in the
business in the environment we're in, but I don't want us to blindly chase a number that's an accounting number, as
opposed to an economic number which ultimately drives shareholder value. So we're working hard on driving it up. But
so, for example, when we shorten a duration in the portfolio, which saved us a bunch of money this quarter, of course,
if you just market-to-market this quarter, that was – took away some of that ROE. But we thought it was a good trade
from a risk return standpoint. So we're going to always manage to what we think is good long-term value and then we'll
update it as we go forward into 2014.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's really helpful, Tom. I guess I'll just ask the follow-up question that you sort of teed up
on, which is on homeowners' margin expansion. Is that – would you guys still think of that as the primary earnings
lever – I mean, recognizing you're doing a bunch of stuff – expenses and – expenses on the – both on the debt side as
well as internally. But is that still the primary lever we should be focused on? And then the question would be how
much more good news do you think you can get out of the various initiatives, house and home and things like that, that
you're pursuing today?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, I'll let Matt talk about what he's doing. I'll just remind you, we think we've captured a
lot of where we were. We were in the 70s underlying combined ratio at the time. I don't remember the exact number,
Josh, but now we're in the low 60s, which is where we said we thought we needed to go. Matt's doing a whole bunch of
things, though, with his team to take it from what became competitive disadvantage in the marketplace to a competitive
advantage and I'll let him talk about both that and sustainability of profitability.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. Thanks for the question. You're correct that we've looked to homeowners for several
years to improve the overall profitability of the enterprise. The good news is the underlying profitability continues to
improve, as we benefit from some of the actions taken in the last several quarters. It has allowed us to begin growth. If
you look at new business growth in homeowners and retention, both are improved as we've had to take less rate,
because we're closer to rate adequate and all the house and home that goes in, goes in as rate adequate.
So we continue to make improvement in what we have. And, at this point, as we put on profitable, high-margin,
high-return business, our goal is to figure out how to do more and more of that, while remaining in the proper risk
profile. So a lot of the work we're doing now has to do with how we manage that risk, how we manage concentration
risk and how we can manage those two elements and still grow and continue to expand the homeowners business and
all the auto that – and other products that come with it.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Great. Thank you. Thank you, Tom, Matt. Keep up the good work.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. In the Allstate brands, premium growth is now at the highest level since 2005. And my
sense is there's a number of numerical drivers to that. But one of the most interesting would be the recovery in
homeowners. I mean, for example, I'm hearing in New York in the drive time in the morning, more advertising so
maybe you can talk a little bit about the level of comfort of increasing the homeowners exposure. And then also, other
personal lines is showing, by far, the fastest growth among the Allstate brand. So make you can talk a little bit about
what's driving that and whether you're getting cross-selling opportunities as a result.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Jay, thank you for the compliments. We like those. Maybe Matt can talk about perhaps what
he's – he already talked a little bit what he's doing with house and home. But maybe he can talk about PML
optimization, or probable maximum loss optimization. And then Don Bailey can give you some insights into what

we're doing on the other lines, which is, of course, focused around – the strategy that Matt's trying to execute, or is
executing, with our agencies is about selling lots of stuff to those customers. So you're right to think about it as a total
package, as opposed to a line. Way too often people start looking at us and talking to about a single product, when
really we're talking about the variety and the breadth and longevity of our relationship.
<A - Matthew Winter>: So, Jay, I'm glad that our advertising spend is hitting you and that you're hearing it. As I
mentioned, I believe at the last call as well, one of the areas that we're spending a lot of time on in homeowners is PML
optimization and the other is what we'll call aggregate risk management, which is really just looking at our
homeowners portfolio and figuring out, at a more granular and sophisticated level, how we could use diversification
benefit, how we could use various combinations of product sets and features and reinsurance to manage to grow in
some areas without increasing above an acceptable level our probable maximal loss or our concentration risk.
And so what you're seeing now in New York is a very careful and, I think, very disciplined way of thoughtfully
growing a little bit within the state in those areas that do not pose undue concentration risk or PML risk for us. So we're
doing it fairly thoughtfully. We're doing it in a way that maximizes the overall number of products that it brings to us.
And so, as Tom mentioned, we're trying to look at this from a household perspective, not a single line perspective. So
what you'll see is we may be growing more in those areas where we get multiple products with the home, as opposed to
single monoline home. And with that, I'll turn it over to Don Bailey, who can talk to you a little bit about the other
personal lines.
<A - Donald J. Bailey>: Thanks, Matt. So, as Tom mentioned, the other personal lines incorporates a portfolio of
additional products. And we have, if you listen to the language in the hallways here, really changed the language.
Matt's certainly led that with us trying to pivot from more of a product-focused organization to a household-focused
organization for all the right reasons. Close rates go up. Retention rates go up. Profitability improves as a result. And
these consumer household lines, as we refer to them, really are critical in terms of making progress in that effort. So the
language has certainly changed, but a lot of other things have changed for us, too, over the last several months. Our
training in this regard has changed. Technology has substantially improved to help enable more of these cross-sells and
household penetration.
The product design aspects of these – portfolio have evolved to be more agent-friendly, to be more consumer-friendly
and so we've made progress there. And then our expectations of all of us and everybody in the field and of our agents
have changed in terms of what we are seeking in terms of an outcome on this. So the last thing we've done is we've put
leadership focused specifically on that. Let's make progress on that. Let's hit targets on that and let's make sure this is a
meaningful piece of our success story as we go forward. So, yes, you'll see that in there. It's not by accident. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thanks for that. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yes. I would just point out on Page 25 of the supplement, we've started to break out how we
look at our customers and trying to help you see that we can't separate where – our customer relationship from where
we deploy capital. So you'll see Ivantage, where we sell other people's product through the agencies. You'll see the
non-proprietary premium at the bottom of that, which is almost $1.4 billion. So that gets to the point that Matt and Don
were just making. And that's what we're doing with the annuities as well, which is we want to sell those to our
customers. We know our customers need them, want them. It helps our relationship, but it's not a place where we
choose to deploy capital, so we've been able to separate those by getting more sophisticated.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: On the issue of Encompass, one of the larger challenges there appears to be the standard auto and
continuing to run well above the 100 combined ratio level. What's the issue there and can it be fixed?
<A - Donald J. Bailey>: So on – this is Don Bailey. On the Encompass piece, if you'd look at the loss ratio – if you
look at the underlying loss ratio, you'll see that we've actually improved rather substantially on that on a year-over-year
basis. And why is that? We've had a move from what we'd probably refer to as a monoline or a segment auto approach
to a package approach. The auto line performs far better in a package than it does on a stand-alone basis. So we've
made meaningful changes in moving our portfolio forward in that regard and we're seeing progress in that unacceptable

number as a result. We're also taking a meaningful rate in that space as well. So while the number isn't where we want
it to be today, there clearly is underlying improvement there and there will continue to be as we go forward.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your question, please?
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks. Good morning. I guess two questions on Allstate Protection: one, we did see a slight
uptick in the underlying loss ratio for Allstate brand standard auto. Is it fair to attribute that to the improving policy
account growth and is there – could you talk about how much more of that increase you'd be willing to tolerate for the
sake of policy growth?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Morning, Meyer. We'll let Matt do that. Yes, I would point out just a slight uptick.
Remember, there's – as you know, there's a lot of variability in sort of frequency and severity on a quarter by quarter
basis.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, hey, Meyer, it's Matt. You should not think of it as a trade-off between profitability and
growth, because that's not what we're doing. We are focused on growing and maintaining profitability, so it's not a
question of that we're letting our combined ratio creep up in order to facilitate growth. I think most of the uptick that
you see is attributable to two pieces of the loss ratio, the PD paid severity and the BI paid severity. So let me take you
through those.
The PD paid severity was elevated in the quarter, but, if you recall, in the first quarter, PD severity was below prior
year by almost a point. And we attributed that to the subro demamds that were at significantly lower than normal levels.
Those subros typically carry a higher severity than average claims. And in the second quarter, what we've seen is a
higher than normal subro demand. It's about 25% higher actually. And our working hypothesis is that due to
Superstorm Sandy, the other carriers' workloads were such for the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this
year, that they delayed the subro processing and the payments until the second quarter. So we are seeing that uptick
now. It's merely a delay from the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter this year. But on a normalized annual
basis, it's right in line with our historical average.
On the BI paid severity, I mentioned last quarter that we were accelerating the closure of older, more complicated
claims and that, in combination with the change in state mix and liability limits, contributed to the increase. If you take
that – those two pieces out, the remainder was aligned with medical care CPI. And so that has actually come down off
of that peak, as we said, as we work through more of those older, more complex claims. And we're moving much closer
to historical norms, which are around the medical care CPI.
The only place that you can see any "investment" in our growth show up in the combined ratio is we pointed out that
we did make some targeted investments in technology and marketing this quarter, which have shown up in the expense
ratio. Those were intentional. We believe this was the right time to make some targeted investments in technology and
marketing, in order to push momentum and provide our agents with the tools and the stability they need to handle this
higher volume. And it's certainly controllable and we'll continue to monitor when it makes sense to continue to invest
in those two areas and when it may make sense to slow down that investment.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Meyer, let also make one overall strategic comment. Of course, price is obviously very
important, as you point out, as a driver of customers' decision making. But that's not the only component of our
strategy. Our strategy, of course, is to give a highly-focused customer value proposition. That means good price to
value. So price is not the only lever is what Matt is saying that he can drive growth, whether it's better technology, so
the agencies can do a better job knowing who their customers are, whether it's new products and launching those. We
have a multi-faceted way that we're seeking to grow, not just – we don't view it as just a price and a profit trade-off for
growth.

<Q - Meyer Shields>: That was very thorough. I appreciate it. On the homeowners side, when we look at the
aggregated lower reinsurance spend that you disclosed last night, I guess, does that still translate – let me ask this
differently. Do you expect to retain the savings or pass them on to customers or – and is the overall internal cat
provision lower or higher than it was 12 months ago?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: The internal tax provision? I...
<Q - Meyer Shields>: No. Catastrophe provision.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Oh, catastrophe provision. Well, let me take a shot at it and see if anyone else wants to join
in here, because it's a complicated question. If you go way up, we looked at hurricane and earthquake losses and said
we don't want to have those losses, so – but we don't want to get rid of the homeowners' line, so we're going to sort of
synthetically divest some significant portion of those by using reinsurance. And that's how we got started in doing
reinsurance. When we first did that, we were not able to pass that through in our higher rates because it takes awhile to
get it through the regulators and everybody else.
Since that time, we've made a bunch of changes to our filings. Most of it, but not all of it, gets passed through. So as
costs come down, we would expect, over time, that to be factored into our pricing. That may or may not translate into
different homeowners' prices, because there's all kinds of, as you know, all kinds of other pieces of loss cost going
through there. And we may or may not be getting it back for that portion of the country where the reduction comes
from. We don't really have an internal way in which you're describing it. So we – Matt works with Steve and Sam and
they figure out what the right balance is working with our Enterprise Risk & Return Council with inside the guidelines,
I guess. So there's not really a – there's nothing we're doing internally that would confuse the reported results.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay, that helpful. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your question, please?
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. In regards to Allstate brand auto rate actions, so if I look at
the 10-Q, it shows 0.4% rate increases on a year-to-date basis in 21 states. So I was curious if – is that the level of rate
increases we should be thinking about through year end and, if so, does that imply that you're okay allowing the loss
ratio to rise a little bit?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, let me start at the end. No, we're not okay allowing the loss ratio to rise a little bit.
What you're seeing is a one month – a one quarter snapshot in what should be viewed on a much longer basis. So if you
go back historically, and that's long before I took over this role, the company has been very good about consistently
reflecting its experience and what it was seeing in its rates and taking rates as needed, not holding back on rate actions
hoping that stuff goes away, not holding back on rate actions in order to capture market share, but passing those
through as they were experienced and as we were seeing them. And as a result, sometimes we have what I refer to a
first-mover disadvantage, because we took rate sooner than some of our competitors and on a more consistent basis.
And sometimes, it's actually to our benefit because we got out ahead of the curve. I think what you're seeing now is
we're out ahead of the curve in many areas.
I'd also suggest you go back – if you go back several years, two or three years, the vast majority of the rate that you
were seeing was driven by a couple of very large states, notably Florida and New York. If you go back to 2010,
somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of the overall country-wide rate that you saw was driven by those two states.
Now that those two states have returned to profitability are requiring less rate action, it's the smaller states where we've
taken consistent rate as needed that are just vacillating and we will continue to monitor it closely. We will take rates as
needed. We are not deliberately trying to let loss ratios float up, as you refer to. We're going to continue to do what
we've always done. It's just that our timing is better, because we did the hard work upfront and it cost us upfront. If you
go back several years, you saw that on the homeowners' side and the auto side, and now we're actually benefiting from
that timing.

<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Got it. That's helpful. Lastly, in regards to the initiative to issue additional "hybrid" debt
in the coming year, do you expect to take advantage of the debt-to-capital equity credit? I think – I believe that's
provided by the rating agencies for those types of securities and potentially repurchase stock in excess of earnings,
taking advantage of that credit.
<A - Don Civgin>: So our goal – our first program we announced last December in our share repurchase was
effectively a "hybrid" debt for equity swap. We said we would issue $1 billion of "hybrids". We would buy back $1
billion of stock. So we have actually been working on that specific transaction for 2013. The rest of the program, about
$2 billion more, we expect to issue, hopefully, during the course of the rest of this year, maybe $750 million or so of
"hybrids" and $1 billion, $1.25 billion preferred. That is really part of just our capital management strategy we have
previously talked about and does not impact any future share repurchase program, which we generally look at once a
year towards the beginning of the year, as part of our strategic planning process.

Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Yes. Thank you very much. Related to what you were talking about, Mike, on pricing, I
just see two very different pricing strategies at Esurance versus Allstate brand. What you are reacting to at Esurance,
which has rather meaningful price increases versus what you're reacting to at Allstate brand, where you think you could
be moderate?
<A - Don Civgin>: Josh, it's Don. It's Don Civgin. Let me talk a little bit about Esurance first. First of all, Esurance,
obviously, was – is designed for a different customer value proposition, different product, different features and it
competes in a different market. The transaction – there's a year and a half into it. You guys have been through this
before, where you're a year and a half into a transaction and lots of things are going wrong. In this particular case, I'm
proud of the fact that Esurance has really only one thing that we're focused on right now and a lot of things have gone
well. The integration's gone well, advertising, brand linkage, all of that has worked really well. The combined ratio is
high. Part of it is high because of the advertising expense that we've talked about before.
But the loss ratio in the second quarter was higher than Gary or I were anticipating or would like. We are taking price
increases. We've taken them, if you look over the course of the last few quarters, we've taken them pretty consistently
as well. Those decisions are independent from what Matt's doing on the Allstate brand. What we're trying to do at
Esurance is make sure that the combination of the loss results, as well as the rest of the expenses, result in an economic
combined ratio over the life of the product. So I'm less concerned about the advertising expense being elevated than I
am over the life of that customer, are we having a good economic combined ratio that gives me good return on capital
and creates shareholder value.
So that's why we've taken the price increases in the last quarter. And I'll be honest. I think we're going to continue to
take some price increases going forward. In spite of the fact that might pressure some of the growth we've seen, it's the
right thing to do to get the loss ratio to where we want it to be.
<A - Matthew Winter>: So Josh, it's Matt. Let me just follow-on on the Allstate brand part. First of all, as Don
explained, it's different segment and it's a different block of business. Their historical business has been somewhat
different than the Allstate brand and they started in a different place. So it's somewhat deceptive to look at price
increases without knowing where the starting point was. We experienced that in homeowners over the last several
years. It depends where you start, depends upon how much of a price increase – rate increase you have to take. And so
as we have different blocks and different starting points, it's not surprising that in some places, Esurance may have to
take more significant rate than Allstate brand and it might happen that we're doing just the opposite in some states at
some point in the future. I would think of them as somewhat independent.

<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: That's perfectly appropriate. Looking at the homeowners, you still bled about 41,000
homeowners between 1Q 2013 and 2Q 2013. Where are you in terms of shaping the portfolio to where you want it to
be from a capacity perspective? And two, where are you in the process of trying to win back customers who you lost in
the reshaping process and you actually – if you could have tailor-made it perfectly for you, you would have never
non-renewed.
<A - Matthew Winter>: This is Matt again. We're making good progress in our efforts. Once again, I can't tell you
either what inning we're in or what yard line we are, but I can tell you I feel good about the progress that's been made.
And I think the fact that the decline has slowed dramatically and consistently over the last several quarters, is an
indication that we have less work to do and we're taking less severe action there. That being said, it's all going to
depend upon the combination of new business and retention. So new business was up 35% in the second quarter. That's
great. It accelerated the improvement seen in the previous quarters, but retention is going to be one of our core levers
there and retention did tick-up last quarter. But I still think we have work to do.
And it's not just on the winning back of those customers who we may have non-renewed previously, but it's also
keeping those customers we have. And so we have a fairly concerted effort on the retention front. New business – the
new business engine is moving, especially with House and Home, which the growth in – new business growth for
House and Home is about six points higher than it is for the country-wide average. So the House and Home initiative
certainly is helping us on the new business side.
But the lever that I think we have to pull even harder is the retention one. And certainly as we have less profitability
actions to take, as we have less rate to put in and less non-renewals and less strict underwriting guidelines, as we return
to a more normalized level, my expectation is we'll continue to see improvement on retention as well.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: And to what extent do you look at the marketplace and see your competitors also
re-underwriting their books? I mean, I'm not right now in the market for homeowner's insurance, but I imagine,
everyone tells me it's pretty hard to find a reasonable rate. I'm surprised retention isn't better, given the lack of options.
<A - Robert L. Block>: Yes. Let me move aside, because I want to make sure we give people enough time for
questions.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Of course.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Just, I think Matt's view is he's got a long-term plan to start to grow the business and you'll
start to see that play out as we go forward.

Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery. Your question, please?
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. It looks like you're giving us a early warning that you may
improve your guidance in underwriting, although you didn't go all the way through. And that's with a little negative
wiggle at Esurance. So what do you see and what are the biggest drivers that's coming in better than you thought
beginning of the year, given that Esurance sounds like it might be a slight negative versus earlier expectations?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Bob, this is Tom. I'm a little confused by the sort of early warning on a improvement in
one's forecast. I'm still struggling with that a little but.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Fair point.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: What we did was of course you and I know, four, maybe five, six years ago, we moved
away from guidance. And we said we'll just tell you what we think the underlying combined ratio will be for the year.
We've put in at a range, because you know frequency bounces around from year-to-year. It's weather-driven, a whole

bunch of things. You can easily get a point move in a combined ratio just from frequency. Severity, obviously, can
bounce around as well. So we try to put a range on it. We're feeling good about where we are in that range, particularly
since we're below the range and we're six months in.
But you should not expect us to be updating the range. Because what happens is you update the range, it eventually
moves into a quarterly forecast. Because you give it for a year, then you give it for the next nine months, then the next
six months, and then the next thing you know, you're doing it for the last quarter. And because it bounces around a lot
by quarter, we think the best way to communicate to you all as to how are we doing relative to what we expect is the
annual range. So, and we think that's the right way to do it, on a calendar year basis.
So we're just, Bob, is just making the point that we feel pretty good about where we're at. We don't see a lot of adverse
trends in frequency or severity when you look at the first six months of the year so we feel good about where we're at in
the range. If you just do the math, we'd have to have a pretty good bump to be above the range in the second half there
and we're letting you know we don't think that's going to happen, but we're also not getting into the process of
re-forecasting that range every quarter.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: So you're saying vanilla frequency severity trends are contributing to the potential
upside?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think the way in which we do business is contributing to the consistency of the results.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Okay and one quick follow-up, on the life side, financial services side, you're going to
be discontinuing 20% to 30% of the earnings. Is that what you were saying before the deal closes? What is the sort of
core running rate of what's left?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So, yes. This is Steve. What we disclosed was roughly about a quarter of the earnings is
what's earned by the businesses that we are selling. As we go forward, that will be out of our earnings next year, but it
will still be in our earnings for this year until the closing date, which we are hopeful about, subject to regulatory
approval will be the end of the year. I missed the second part of your question.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Well, what is the core run rate of – so you're saying 75% of Q2, which was a little bit
high, is sort of.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yes. So, Bob, it's Don. I think what we've disclosed is that a number of about $130 million or so of
run rate income is going to leave the company when we complete the transaction.
<Q - Robert R. Glasspiegel>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your question, please?
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi. Good morning. The first question is on the ROE levers that you want to pull right now,
seems that on both the homeowners and the auto, you're pretty close to where you want to be. And so just curious, if
I'm looking forward to next year versus this year, what ROE levers are you looking to pull?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Vinay, we'll be able to figure that out when we get to next year's outlook, which will be in
the fourth quarter is when we typically give the – after we report the fourth quarter results, we give next year's results.
There's a bunch of moving pieces here in terms of what happened to investment income, what happened to the capital
structure, where we are in frequency and severity the last half of the year, how much progress we feel, how much
growth there is. So we're now not prepared to say what we're going to do next year.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. The second question is on the pension and life benefits, those reductions. You've
disclosed the impact, like the net impact on net earnings this year, but just curious as to what's going to be the recurring
benefit on a quarterly basis because of lower expenses?

<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So this is Steve. We're currently calculating that. We have to do it on the basis of the date we
announced the change, which was July 15. So the actuaries hasn't had time to really calculate that. What we disclosed
was the impact on the balance sheet really and not as a period of time at an estimated range, not the actual income
statement impact, which I don't have a handle on it right now.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: But it'll be a good number.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. All right. And will you guys let it flow to the bottom-line or are you looking to give it
back to the policy holders in the form of lower rates?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We don't, as I was saying before, we don't look at everything as terms of reducing price to
drive growth. We have a consistent strategy. So as we said, we want our expense ratio to come down while we're
delivering good differentiated value, but as Matt pointed out, they took some – he took some actions, investments,
things like technology and marketing to drive growth. So we don't specifically target individual actions and put them
through into one portion of the value proposition.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please?
<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the call. Could you just review with us kind of
what's left in the life insurance financial business that's not part of the core, either the, as I understand it, the core
business of selling traditional life insurance through the agencies and the worksite marketing business. And kind of
what is the operating strategy at the moment for those units?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Morning, Paul. This is Tom. Let me give you an overview and then Don can talk about
specifically that piece. So as you'll remember, the strategy that we started a couple years ago, when Matt was leading
that business, was to: one, be focused on the Allstate agencies; and two, to be focused on the worksite. So you're
correct in that we've continued to refine that strategy and, of course, selling Lincoln Benefit is an outcome of, the
natural outcome of that. Don also just recently announced shutting down the fixed annuity business through those
agencies, so that's a continued refinement, which narrows it down a little bit. So it's really life insurance.
And from a manufacturing standpoint, it's life insurance through the Allstate agencies. From a providing coverage for
our customers, it's everything. We sell variable annuities. We sold that business in 2006 and we're still selling a lot of
those. We sell mutual funds. We sell fixed annuities. We sell long-term care. We sell a whole bunch of things through
our agencies. So you have to kind of distinguish between what are we doing for those customers and what are we
underwriting. And the – so I – but then also, there's about a $32 billion block of annuities, which are in several different
forms, that we still have, still will retain, when we get done with the Lincoln Benefit transaction, and Don can talk
about what our strategy is there.
<A - Donald J. Bailey>: Okay. Hey, Paul. It's a – let me try to answer it this way. When Matt first started with this
strategy for the Life business, which was a 6% return business, we've gotten that number up to about 8% now, mostly
through improvements in operating income. We've still got some elevated capital levels and we're working hard to
reduce those as well. I think Tom said it right. You have to view what's left from a customer point of view and then
kind of what – just what the liabilities are. From a customer point of view, we're fully committed to meeting the
customer value proposition that Allstate has to the Allstate customer through our agency distribution, agencies and
exclusive financial specialists.
We are going to manufacture Life products. We've historically had good returns in that business. We will continue to
use our paper to write that product. But on the annuities side, we're basically out of that business as it relates to putting
it on our balance sheet. The LBL transaction takes with it about $13 billion of reserves. $9 billion of that is annuities.
So that's strategically very important, because it continues to reduce our exposure to the spread business. When you

look at it from a balance sheet point of view, we have life blocks and we have annuity blocks.
As Tom said, the annuity blocks are still larger than we'd like. And we continue to work both on the liability side and
the asset side to find ways to make that accretive to our income, as opposed to dilutive, which is what it's doing now.
And the Life business we want to grow. We like the liabilities there. I think we've had historically good results. We're
good at those products. But, again, back to the customer point of view, they will not see a difference as to whether it's
going on our paper or somebody else's paper.
<A - Robert L. Block>: Last question, please?

Our final question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question, please?
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. It seems like frequency for the last three years has, in auto,
been pretty much nonexistent. Any theories on why that is and what you think's going to happen going forward?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hi, Adam, Tom. Matt can talk about it. I guess I would just characterize it – we wouldn't say
it is nonexistent. Perhaps it hasn't been increasing rapidly, but it's still there. So, but in terms of pressure on the loss
ratio, Matt can talk about it.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Yes, I wish it would completely disappear. This business would be easy. But we're actually
looking at it and we call it benign. It's stable and it's performing within the historical ranges. And so we're not
experiencing pressure from the frequency side, but that's on a country-wide basis. And so we have to monitor it on a
much more granular basis. We'll continue to look at it on a geography – by geography basis. In some cases, it may
tick-up and we'll get on it quickly. But from a country-wide basis, we've seen it stabilize within the historical range.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And Adam, this is Tom. On a longer-term basis, of course, you're absolutely right. It's been
declining. So whether that's the age of the population, increased sophistication of the car, or the fewer miles driven
because of gas prices and the recession, you do see a long-term trend down. We're paying attention to that, particularly
on that second item with safer cars, with the machine-to-machine communication, which is why we think our strategy
of selling multiple things to the customers is the right way to go, because if you carry that trend line out to mass point,
if really had no accidents, you wouldn't need much insurance.
And so we're seeking to try to protect all our customers from all of life's uncertainties, which is why doing the life
insurance piece, having homeowners, doing boat insurance, personal umbrella policies. And in wrapping all of our stuff
around that customer, so they have kind of a circle of protection is why it's important for us. So you're right. It's been
benign. And that's why you see basically very little increase in our average premium, so customers continue to pay a
good price – pay the right price for what the risk is they have.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, how's the DRIVEWISE roll-out going and is that
helping growth at all, do you think?
<A - Matthew Winter>: It's Matt. Thanks for asking. It's going well. We've now rolled out in 20 states as of the end of
June. We hope to put on another eight to 10 through the second half of the year, very favorable early results. I think I
talked a little bit about it on the last call. To-date, we have about a little over 600 million miles through the system – 20
million hours driven by the customers. We're seeing double-digit growth per month in devices installed in the vehicles,
and over a third of the new customers take DRIVEWISE when offered in those states where it's available. So the
acceptance rate is high. About 70% of the users are receiving a discount. That discount averages around 10% to 12%.
So they're taking advantage of it. We're learning from it. The customers are benefiting from it. So it's a positive story all
the way around.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And I would like to point out, too. Remember, there's a difference between our strategy and
some other people in the business. Not everybody, but ours is to stay connected, as Matt talked about. So we're – as
opposed to using it for just pricing, ours is about pricing, but it's also about finding other ways to stay connected with

Thomas J. Wilson
Thank you all for participating. We made good progress this quarter on strategic initiatives, including our focus on the
customer raising returns, and homeowners deploying capital in the right places, and enhancing our financial strength.
We've also made great progress on the five priorities and we'll keep working hard on your behalf as we go through the
rest of the year. Thanks very much.
