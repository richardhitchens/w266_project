MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to today's program. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's call is being recorded,
and I will be standing by should you need any assistance.
It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead, sir.
Lee McEntire
Good morning. Thanks, everybody on the phone as well as the webcast, for joining us this morning for our second
quarter results.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me remind you that we may make some forward-looking statements
today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release document, our website, or the other
SEC filings.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO, for some opening comments before he gives it to Bruce.
Brian T. Moynihan

As you look at our results, you can see the storyline for this quarter is much the same as it was for last quarter. You can
see that revenue is showing stability in most of the core businesses. You can see the good core expense control,
continued credit improvement, and solid business activity throughout the franchise. You can see, obviously, that
litigation expense from our legacy mortgage issues continued to affect earnings this quarter. And you can also see us
continue to build our strong balance sheet position in capital and liquidity.
In a minute, Bruce will take you through the details of the results. But I thought it would be good if we spend a couple
of minutes at the outset here talking about what our customer and client data is telling us about the economy and what
we see in our franchise.
As we all know, the economy was off to a little bit of a slow start this year, but growth has picked up recently. The
most recent jobs data shows nearly 1.4 million jobs were created in the first half of this year. As we have strong
positions, leadership positions across consumer and commercial companies in America, we have a view into the key
indicators of an improving economy, which show signs everywhere of improvement. Even in advance of short-term
interest rates changing, which would help our deposit-rich Consumer and Business Banking segment, our Consumer
business had another good quarter. They performed well, growing earnings 29% from last year, including solid
origination activities across the various products.
In addition, as we look at our underlying consumers, they have increased their spending. You can see in our data that
the retail volumes in debit and credit cards were up 4% from last year's second quarter, but more importantly up 8%
from the first quarter this year, showing increased momentum in spending among our card customers. Consumers are
growing their card balances also. They're borrowing a little bit more, and they continue to add to their deposit balances.
As you know, home sales continue to improve across the industry, and we can see that in our own results as our
originations in mortgages increased from first to second quarter. But importantly, our purchased mortgage origination
continued to grow. Our home equity originations also were up almost 30% in the quarter.
When you look at the underlying transaction activity and volume activity in our stores, 7 million to 8 million visitors
come in each week, showing continued strong activity. You can also see that in our online activity, where our 30
million online customers continued to grow their overall volumes; and importantly in our mobile activity, where our
15.5 million mobile customers continued to increase the use of technology, including depositing 10% of all the retail
checks in our company through their mobile phone and other devices.
The health of the consumer is also evident in our asset quality. Delinquencies continue to improve. Our consumer card
loss rate ended the quarter at less than 3%. We see on the wealth management side the Markets growth has added to
consumer wealth. We have nearly $2.5 trillion in client balances in our global Wealth Investment Management
business, including $100 billion in brokerage assets with our retail and preferred customer base in our Consumer
business.
We also see encouraging signs throughout our commercial customers. Commercial construction has improved and
manufacturing activity in our clients has accelerated. The borrowing of our commercial customers remains healthy
across the industry and credit quality is very strong. Encouraging is that middle-market utilization rates are moving
forward again this quarter ever so slightly.
Industry sales and trading activity among our trading counterparties has been low, as many of our peers have talked
about, in this low volatility environment. However, our underlying business performed well. Tom Montag and his team
in our Global Markets business posted $1.1 billion in earnings for the quarter. Our investment banking pipeline
remained strong and the back half of 2014 looks healthy.
While the economy still faces challenges, progress is being made throughout the economy but also throughout our
company. We're seeing good business activity, and it's strengthening as we go through 2014. We're seeing improved
financial health for our consumers and our customers and our corporate customers. But the most important thing to
think about is that signs of a gradually improving economy are how our businesses continue to be positioned to take
advantage of the activity and deliver for you, our shareholders.

With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce R. Thompson
Great, thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide two and work through the second quarter results.
We reported earnings of $2.3 billion or $0.19 per diluted share this quarter, which included pre-tax litigation expense of
$4 billion, which equated to roughly $0.22 a share after tax. $3.8 billion of the litigation expense is associated with the
build in reserves for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters, which also included the AIG settlement that
we announced this morning.
We're very pleased to have reached a definitive agreement with AIG, which resolves all outstanding RMBS litigation
between the parties for a settlement amount of $650 million. This agreement is important for two primary reasons.
First, we have now resolved 95% of the unpaid balance of all RMBS as to which securities litigation has either been
filed or threatened for all Bank of America related entities. It also includes AIG's agreement to withdraw as an objector
to the Bank of New York Mellon private label securities settlement, referred to as the Article 77 proceeding.
Revenues this quarter on an FTE [Fully Taxable Equivalent] basis were $22 billion. Relative to the second quarter of
2013, revenue was down $990 million, driven by lower net interest income and mortgage banking income. Relative to
the first quarter of 2014, it was approximately $800 million lower, as higher investment banking fees, higher mortgage
banking revenue was more than offset by seasonally lower sales and trading revenue as well as lower equity investment
income.
Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $18.5 billion, but included $4 billion of litigation expense. If we back out
that litigation expense and compare it to Q2 2013 expenses, expenses improved by $1 billion or 6%, which was driven
by lower LAS [Legacy Assets and Servicing] non-litigation expenses and to a lesser extent our New BAC savings.
If we back out the $1 billion of retirement-eligible incentive comp from our first quarter results as well, you can see
expenses declined roughly $700 million from the first quarter as a result of lower revenue related compensation within
our Global Markets business, lower LAS expenses ex-litigation, and to a lesser degree our New BAC savings.
Provision for credit losses was $411 million, with net charge-offs of $1.1 billion and a reserve release of $662 million
during the quarter.
Our results from the quarter also benefited from the sale of $2.1 billion in non-performing residential loans. The
income statement benefit from that sale was approximately $350 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share after tax, and you saw
roughly $150 million of that benefit flow through other income and the balance through the recovery of net charge-offs.
And lastly, the aggregate amount of a few other items, including debt securities gains, equity investment income, net
DVA, as well as FAS 91, resulted in a benefit to EPS of approximately $0.04 a share.
If we move to slide three and look at our balance sheet highlights, you can see the balance sheet increased $21 billion
from the first quarter of 2014. Our debt securities increased as a result of valuations and increases to highly liquid
securities in our primary banking subsidiary. Our repo matched book increased as well.
If we look at ending loans, they were down $4.3 billion, primarily due to lower residential mortgages, principally
within our discretionary portfolios. And that also included the $2.1 billion bulk sale that I just mentioned.
If we exclude residential mortgage loans, our consumer loans rose slightly, as our U.S. card balances grew $1.3 billion
and our securities-based lending with our Wealth Management clients increased $1.8 billion. This was partially offset
by paydowns within our home equity book.
If we move to the commercial side, commercial loans were up modestly, as C&I growth was mostly offset by a few
sizable loan paydowns as well is a focus on overall relationship returns.

Period end deposits were over $1.1 trillion and reached record levels. Our tangible common equity ratio improved 14
basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to 7.14%. Tangible book value per share was $14.24, a 3% improvement
from the first quarter, and was driven by both our earnings during the quarter as well as a $2.3 billion increase in the
value of our debt securities, which you saw flow through OCI.
Lastly, to further enhance our Tier 1 capital structure, during the second quarter we received shareholder approval and
amended the Series T preferred shares, which increased our Tier 1 capital by $2.9 billion. And we issued $1.5 billion in
preferred stock during the quarter at a favorable rate.
On slide four, we show our capital ratios under Basel III. Under the transition rules, our CET1 capital was $153.6
billion, risk-weighted assets $1.28 trillion, and that resulted in a ratio of 12%. If we look at our Basel III regulatory
capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, we saw very strong improvement from the first quarter of 2014. Our CET1
capital improved $7 billion, driven by earnings, OCI improvement, as well as lower threshold deductions. The numbers
in the chart reflect risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach, with our CET1 ratio improving from 9% to
9.5%, well above our 8.5% 2019 proposed minimum requirements. Under the advanced approach, our CET1 ratio
improved from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter of 2014 to 9.9%. That was driven by the improvement in our capital,
partially offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets.
If we turn to the supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate that at the end of the second quarter of 2014 we exceeded
the updated U.S. rules that are applicable beginning in 2018. Our bank holding company exceeds the 5% minimum, and
our primary bank subsidiaries, BANA and FIA, are both in excess of the 6% minimum.
If we turn to slide five on funding and liquidity, our long-term debt of $257 billion was up modestly during the quarter,
as our debt issuances were larger than maturities during the period. As we look forward at our debt issuance during the
balance of the year, we'll continue to be opportunistic, but we do expect our parent issuance to be below the $13 billion
of contractual maturities in the second half of 2014. We're also likely to continue to issue term debt out of our primary
bank subsidiaries.
Our second quarter 2014 long-term debt yields improved 12 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to 2.29%. We've
realized significant improvement given only two years ago this yield was over 3% and our average debt balances were
nearly $75 billion higher. Our total global excess liquidity sources during the quarter increased to a record $431 billion,
as bank liquidity continued to grow in the second quarter and our time to required funding remained strong at 38
months.
If we turn to slide six, our net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.2 billion, consistent with the first
quarter of 2014, as a less negative impact from market-related adjustments was offset by an anticipated decline in the
core net interest income. Negatively impacting our reported net interest income during the quarter were market-related
adjustments of $175 million and that compares to $273 million negative in the first quarter of 2014. As you all know,
long-term rates declined again during the quarter.
Our net interest income if we exclude the market-related adjustments declined as previously expected and
communicated due to seasonally lower average consumer loan balances and yields, offset by an extra day of interest.
And all of that resulted in net interest income of $10.4 billion.
As a result of the increased liquidity in the first half of the year as well as lower loan balances and loan yields, the net
interest yield excluding market-related adjustments declined 10 basis points to 2.26%.
We continue to thoughtfully manage our OCI sensitivity and are very mindful of the liquidity and leverage rules, as this
quarter we invested more into shorter duration Treasury securities. We continue to remain positioned to benefit if
interest rates move higher, particularly from the shorter end of the curve. And as we head into the back half of 2014, we
still expect modest improvement off of the second quarter of 2014 level of net interest income, which was $10.4 billion
excluding market related adjustments.
Non-interest expense on slide seven was $18.5 billion during the second quarter, and once again included $4 billion of
litigation expense. As we mentioned, $3.8 billion of the litigation expense relates to a build in reserves associated with

previously disclosed legacy mortgage-related matters, including the AIG agreement. If we exclude litigation, total
expenses were $14.6 billion this quarter. If we compare those to the first quarter of 2014 and exclude
retirement-eligible costs that we saw during the first quarter of 2014, our expenses declined $700 million on lower
incentives related to sales and trading revenue, reduced LAS non-litigation expense, and to a lesser extent New BAC
savings.
Our legacy assets and servicing expenses during the quarter ex-litigation were $1.4 billion and declined approximately
$150 million from the first quarter of 2014. As we look forward with respect to our two expense programs, New BAC
as well as our LAS expenses ex-litigation, we have modified our expectation slightly. Our New BAC expense program
is ahead of schedule, and we now expect to reach a quarterly level of $2 billion in expense savings in the fourth quarter
of 2014 as opposed to mid-2015. This means on an annualized basis, we will have fully achieved the $8 billion target
that we announced in 2011. In the second quarter of 2014, our quarterly savings rate that was achieved on New BAC
was $1.8 billion-plus.
Moving to our LAS expenses ex-litigation, we continue to make very good progress, but our compliance with
applicable mortgage programs as well as governance guidelines may delay the expected timing of achieving our $1.1
billion goal by one quarter.
If we turn to asset quality on slide eight, you can see credit quality once again improved on all fronts. Net charge-offs
declined $315 million from the first quarter of 2014 to $1.1 billion, or a 48 basis point net loss ratio. As I mentioned
earlier, this quarter did include a $2.1 billion sale of bulk non-performing loans, which included recoveries of $185
million on previously recorded net charge-offs. If we exclude the effect of the bulk sale net charge-offs, they declined
$130 million or 9%, and the net loss ratio would have been at 56 basis points. These are decade level lows.
Delinquencies, a leading indicator of net charge-offs, also showed improvement during the second quarter. Provision
expense during the quarter was $411 million, and we released $662 million of reserves. We would expect net
charge-offs going forward to continue to show modest improvement from the second quarter of 2014 levels of $1.3
billion, which excludes the recoveries that we received on the non-performing loan sales. We would also expect reserve
releases to decline modestly through the balance of 2014.
Let's walk through the business segment results now starting on slide nine with Consumer and Business Banking. We
continue to make solid progress on the strategy in this business through deepening relationships and reducing our costs
by optimizing the delivery network. We're simplifying the product set as we reduce the number of offerings and focus
the smaller product set on customer feedback and offer greater rewards to customers who bring us more of their
relationships.
Some of the more significant operational activity during the quarter included the rollout of an advanced platform for
mobile banking that had added functionality, rolling out the SafeBalance checking account, as well as an enhanced
Preferred Rewards program that we launched after a successful pilot program. We are pleased with the results again
this quarter, as our earnings of $1.8 billion grew 29% from the second quarter of 2013 and were up 7% from the first
quarter of 2014. This business generated a 24% return on allocated capital during the quarter.
Our revenue was relatively stable across the periods, as lower net interest income was partially offset by higher service
charges. Our expenses are down 4% from the second quarter of 2013 on lower operating, litigation, and personnel
costs.
Our network delivery optimization benefits continued, as we reduced another 72 banking centers through both sales as
well as consolidations. Our credit quality remained strong, as net charge-offs declined versus both periods. Our U.S.
credit card business exited the quarter with less than a 3% loss rate in June.
Second quarter provision expense was $534 million. Our net charge-offs improved $313 million from the second
quarter of 2013 and $36 million from the first quarter of 2014. We released $120 million more in reserves this quarter
than the second quarter of 2013 and $242 million more than the first quarter of 2014.

From a customer activity perspective this quarter, we saw continued growth in our mobile banking customers, which
reached 15.5 million customers. And our customer deposit transactions using mobile devices represented 10% of all
transactions.
Our average deposits of $544 billion are up organically almost $11 billion or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2014
and up 5% or nearly $25 billion compared to the second quarter of 2013. And we did that as our rates paid on our
deposits reached a new low of 6 basis points.
Our brokerage assets surpassed $105 billion and are up 26% year-over-year, based on both improved market valuation
as well as customer flows.
Our card issuance remained strong at 1.1 million new accounts in the second quarter of 2014, with approximately
two-thirds of those cards going to existing customers. We saw growth in ending U.S. credit card balances this period,
with ending balances up $1.3 billion relative to the first quarter of 2014, and our risk-adjusted margin remained strong
at approximately 9%.
If you move to Consumer Real Estate Services, the loss in the quarter was driven by $3.8 billion of litigation expense.
Overall, we saw higher originations, improved mortgage banking revenue, and lower cost in both the fulfillment as well
as the servicing sides of the business.
Let's focus first on the reported sub-segment of home loans, where we record the origination of consumer real estate.
Our home loans saw better leverage versus the first quarter of 2014, as both revenue and expenses improved.
Our first mortgage retail originations were $11.1 billion and were up 25% from the first quarter of 2014, leading to
higher core production revenue. As Brian mentioned, our mix of originations continues to shift to purchase, as we're
now at 47% purchased versus 17% in the year-ago quarter.
At the end of the quarter, our origination pipeline was up 15% from the first quarter of 2014, but our applications per
day are slowing a bit. Our home equity originations were $2.6 billion and increased 31% from the first quarter of 2014.
We continue to reduce production staffing levels, and the savings from several quarters of these reductions are
beginning to show in our expense levels.
If we move to the Legacy Assets and Servicing sub-segment, the driver here was the aforementioned litigation cost.
From a cost of servicing perspective, our LAS expenses ex-litigation did decline $141 million to $1.4 billion. And our
number of 60-plus day delinquent loans dropped 14,000 units to 263,000 units, or down 5% from the end of the first
quarter of 2014.
The primary revenue component in our LAS sub-segment, servicing fees, declined $40 million versus the first quarter,
as the size of our servicing portfolio declined. This was offset by a better net hedging performance on our MSR. Also
during the quarter, we did benefit from lower rep and warrant provision, which was $87 million, or down nearly $100
million from the first quarter of 2014.
If we turn to slide 11, Global Wealth and Investment Management, this business turned in another record revenue
quarter. Our pre-tax margins remained strong, north of 25% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our revenue of $4.6
billion was up 2% from the second quarter of 2013 and 1% over the first quarter of 2014. Record asset management
fees offset the softness in transactional activity.
Net income, $724 million, was slightly lower than both comparative periods, driven by increased expenses. Our
expense levels versus the second quarter of 2013 reflect higher revenue related incentive comp, other volume related
costs, as well as continued investment in technology and other areas to support the growth that we're seeing within the
business.
Relative to the first quarter of 2014, expenses were driven by higher revenue related costs, litigation related expenses,
as well as marketing. Our return on allocated capital during the quarter was 24%.

The momentum we're seeing in flows continued and was quite strong during the quarter. Client balances were up $72
billion from the end of the first quarter of 2014 to a record $2.5 trillion. Long-term AUM flows were nearly $12 billion
for the quarter, marking the fifth straight year of positive quarterly AUM flows.
Our ending client loan balances were up $3.9 billion to a record $123 billion, which is up 3% from the first quarter of
2014, as we saw growth in both our securities-based lending as well as our residential mortgage lending.
From a referral perspective, we continue to see coordinated efforts across Wealth Management and the banking groups,
as our referrals resulted in the funding of more than 250 institutional retirement plans worth more than $2.4 billion in
assets this quarter, and that compares to 156 wins in the year-ago quarter for $600 million in assets.
If we turn to slide 12, our Global Banking earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 4% from the second quarter of
2013 and up 9% over the first quarter of 2014. Our return on allocated capital was very strong at 18%.
Compared to the second quarter of 2013, our revenue showed modest improvement while expenses increased and credit
costs declined. Within the revenue category, our investment banking fees company-wide this quarter were $1.6 billion,
up 5% from the second quarter of 2013 and up 6% on a linked-quarter basis. We maintained a solid leadership position
in investment banking fees, and we had particularly strong equity underwriting results during the quarter.
Our provision was $132 million during the quarter and included $156 million reserve build. Our provision costs were
favorable to both comparative periods, as we added less reserves in the first quarter of 2014 and had less charge-offs
compared to the second quarter of 2013.
Expenses increased $50 million versus the second quarter of 2013 on higher litigation but improved $129 million from
the first quarter of 2014 on lower personnel and back-office support costs.
If we look at the balance sheet, average loans were $271 billion during the quarter, up 6% compared to the second
quarter of 2013 but flattish compared to the first quarter of 2014.
Our loan balances relative to the first quarter of 2014 bear I think several comments that I'd like to make. The first is
we saw sizable paydowns during the quarter, as our customers accessed the capital markets. We had approximately $2
billion of such paydowns where our customers chose to access the markets and refinance existing bank loans.
Within commercial real estate, we continued to optimize the mix with several small portfolio sales that took those
balances down a little over $2 billion. And we are being sensitive with respect to pricing of commercial loans, as we're
not going to chase loans at the expense of overall client relationship profitability goals. And lastly, within the Global
Banking segment, deposit flows remained solid and were stronger at the end of the quarter.
If we move to Global Markets on slide 13, we earned $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2014. That's up 14% from
the year-ago period and down seasonally 16% from the seasonally strong period of the first quarter. Net DVA during
the quarter was a gain of $69 million versus gains of $49 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $112 million in the
first quarter of 2014.
Despite the slowdown in FICC across the industry group, we were pleased with the results this quarter. Our revenue
was up 9% from the second quarter of 2013 but down 9% from the seasonally high first quarter 2014.
Our second quarter of 2014 revenue did include an equity gain of roughly $240 million on the monetization of an
equity investment. That is not reflected as part of our sales and trading revenue. Our sales and trading revenue net of
DVA was $3.4 billion, which was 1% lower than the second quarter of 2013 and 17% lower than the first quarter of
2014. Our FICC sales and trading revenue during the quarter increased 5% compared to the second quarter of 2013 and
was down 20% from the seasonally higher first quarter of 2014 levels.
Driving the year-over-year improvement within FICC were results in both our mortgage business, our muni business,
as trading conditions and our performance improved in both areas. Those improvements were partially offset by weaker
financial performance in foreign exchange as well as commodities.

On the equity sales and trading side, we were down 14% from the second quarter of 2013 and 11% from the first
quarter of 2014, as lower market volatility depressed overall secondary market client activity. Expenses were up from
the second quarter of 2013 on higher technology and staff support investments and to a lesser degree incentives, but
down from the first quarter of 2014, in line with the seasonal revenue decline that we saw. Trading related assets on
average increased $23 billion to $460 billion during the quarter, and our return on allocated capital was 13% during the
second quarter.
On slide 14, we saw we show All Other. Revenue was down $463 million from the first quarter of 2014 on lower
equity investment gains of $618 million, which were partially offset by lower negative market related adjustments to
net interest income during the quarter. Our second quarter 2014 expense in All Other was down $1.3 billion from the
first quarter, as it included retirement-eligible incentive costs and some litigation expense.
The second quarter of 2014 provision benefit of $246 million was $111 million better than the first quarter of 2014 and
$67 million better than the second quarter of 2013. Net charge-offs of $11 million improved $195 million from the first
quarter of 2014, driven by the recoveries that I had mentioned associated with our bulk NPL sales.
During the quarter, our effective tax rate was relatively low, primarily as a result of the impact of tax preference items
on a lower earnings base. For the back half of 2014, we would expect to see an effective tax rate of approximately 31%
ex any unusual items.
I'm going to wrap up before we take questions with a couple closing comments. We feel like we made very strong
progress during the quarter. We saw good business activity across the customer base. We experienced year-over-year
revenue growth in our Global Banking, Global Markets, and Global Wealth Management businesses. Our Consumer
business profitability grew 29% from last year. And in the mortgage business, we're taking costs out of the fulfillment
side as well as the costs to service our delinquent loans.
We reported $0.19 of earnings and absorbed costs, allowing us to resolve all outstanding RMBS issues with AIG and
build substantial reserves for our remaining legacy mortgage issues. We did this while adding to our already strong
Basel III capital ratios and improving our liquidity measures to record levels. And our asset quality improved to
decade-low loss ratios.
And with that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hey, a couple of questions. One, you had some callouts on some nice gains, and I know
a couple of other banks reporting here this cycle have done the same thing. I'm wondering how much more in your
pipeline do you think you have to extract some value from the mortgage-related portfolio here that you're
[indiscernible] (37:47)?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We took, Betsy, a piece of our non-performing loans out. And as non-performing loans,
and as you know when you receive it, to the extent that you receive income, you write down the basis of those loans.
And we took those loans out and saw healthy gains. We continue to look at the sale of non-performing loans, but I
would not expect anything near the magnitude from the sale of non-performing loans that we saw this quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. Separately on just litigation related stuff, you highlighted the AIG agreement that
looks like a great win for you guys. I guess the question is does them pulling out as a dissenter do anything to speed up

the timing on that Article 77 case?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the timing is going to progress on the schedule that it otherwise would have. I
think you all know that from an objective perspective that they were probably the strongest and most vocal objector
with respect to the case. And we'll just have to see as we move forward what the impact from them dropping their
objection to the case is. I think the other thing that's important is as it relates to holdings of the securities or at least a
basis to object, they were the largest holder that was out there holding securities as part of the settlement. I think they
noted that in their release this morning.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Thanks, okay. And then just lastly, there has been a lot of debate recently about how the
Fed could potentially start to exit. Obviously in the [indiscernible] (39:33) they talked about that, and it's been on some
of the calls recently about how people are thinking about rate betas. I know from the 10-Q you have a relatively
positive outlook for what rising rates does to your earnings stream. Could you just remind us what percentage of your
deposits are consumer and how you're thinking about rate betas in a rate rise environment relative to asset betas?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure, a couple things. If you look at asset sensitivity, you'll see that the exposure to a 100
basis point parallel shift in rates that the benefit increased this quarter from about $3.2 billion in the first quarter to $3.4
billion.
As you look at the deposit base, a couple of things of note; the first is north of 70% of the overall deposits that we have
throughout the company are within our Consumer and Wealth Management business. And as it relates to I would say
overall asset betas that through history given the branch network and the relationships, those tend to be very stable. I
think you get a sense for that as you look at the continued deposit growth that we've seen while at the same time taking
rates paydown pretty significantly.
If you move to the institutional side and look at where we are, roughly 75% of the deposits that we have within the
institutional business are domiciled here in the U.S., and the predominant mix of that is with our core corporate and
commercial customers. And if you look at the reason that they're holding those deposits with us, it's because we tend to
be their core relationship bank. We do their cash management. We do their treasury service revenue and have
relationships that are beyond just a place for them to put their deposits. So as we move forward, there's obviously a
level of uncertainty to the extent of a Fed withdrawal. But as we look at the overall deposit base, the stability of it, and
our outlook going forward, we feel like that we're very well positioned.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd add on the consumer side also as you look at year-over-year dynamics in terms of
deposit growth of $25 billion, also look that we are still running off a CD portfolio that was more of a funding portfolio
for some of the companies that we acquired. So I think there's round numbers a $10 billion reduction in CDs over that
time period. And we've also obviously sold some deposits, not a huge amount. So that growth is over top of all that net.
And so we feel good about the consumer franchise's ability to continue to grow deposits even while being very
disciplined on price. And as rates rise, that will be recognized and we except that those deposits now are much more
core. Checking account deposits year-over-year I think are up 25% – 30% in terms of average balance.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, thanks a lot.

And we'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up quickly up on that deposit question. I noticed
that non-interest-bearing was up 11%, interest-bearing up only 1%, so that speaks to your efforts. Do you think there's
more to go there, or should we start to see deposit growth more in line with your peers at this point?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you look just on our consumer business, the year-over-year growth was $25
billion and the linked-quarter growth was $10 billion, so obviously we're growing at a faster rate in the current
environment – up a spot so to speak, Jim, than we have been year-over-year. And so the growth rate of 2% was

nominal in a quarter which would be annualized 8% at about the high 5% to low 6% year-over-year, so it's accelerating
still by the good core activity.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay, great. And then on loan growth, you still have, as you mentioned, a couple of
asset sales, still some legacy asset runoff. When do we start to see the inflection point in your view? And maybe, if you
can, give us a sense of underlying demand that you're seeing in your customer group.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure, it's a very good question, Jim. And I think we need to break out and discuss – if you
look at the declines that we saw in the residential mortgage area, those are largely due to whole loan repayments of
loans that are held within our investment portfolio. And so if you look at the consumer business, I think there are
couple key things that I would note. The first is on a linked-quarter basis, this is the first quarter in some time where we
actually saw ending card balances within our domestic card balance increase. And those were up, as we mentioned,
roughly $1.3 billion from the first quarter to the second quarter, so we saw growth there.
And then if you move to what we saw within the Wealth Management area, as I mentioned, we saw very strong growth
both in securities-based lending as well as within mortgage originations there. Once again, on the home equity front,
the progress that we're making on the origination front, where we saw about $2.6 billion, is really being masked by the
runoff in the amortization of the home equity book that we had that runs off to the extent of $3 billion to $4 billion a
quarter. So within the consumer businesses, if you look at the core front end, we are seeing some consumer loan
growth. It just gets masked by the runoff of some of the consumer real estate.
On the overall commercial and corporate side, I did reference the couple payoffs. As we look out, one of the
benchmarks that we look at is the revolver draws that we have within our Commercial Banking business. That number,
which had gotten as low as in the low 30%s, was up almost 100 basis points this quarter. It is now in the high 30%s, so
we are starting to see some greater activity on the revolver space within our Commercial Banking customers. And
overall activity with the corporate customers continues to be good. But we are seeing, as I referenced, customers taking
advantage of favorable debt capital markets, which we obviously benefit from, from a debt underwriting perspective.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right, that's fair, just one last question on the LCR. Maybe I missed it. Did you disclose
where you are on that front?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We did not. At the parent at this point, we are above 100% at the parent, so we're good
from 2017 compliance there. If we look at the combined BANA/FIA LCR ratio, those two companies or two banks will
be put together October 1. That LCR number is in the high 80%s at this point. And we'll continue to build the LCR
ratio at the banks to be at least a year ahead of where we need to be.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Will that put any further pressure on NIM if you're building more liquidity there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It should not. As we look at, there has been a significant build at this point. And as we
look at the funding and the balance of that between both core consumer deposit growth as well as where we are, that
should not have an effect. If you look at the build that we talked about in the first quarter and second quarter, at this
point I'd say we've eaten that expense and we now need to get after it and optimize it to get the expense knocked back
down.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: On expenses, it seems like most of the New BAC savings are in the run rate here,
yet we still read about various expense initiatives that you have underway in terms of branch rationalization and
simplification and things like that, so I was just wondering. Is there another New BAC or just ongoing efforts to bring
down costs and how meaningful those might be?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think in the near term, Matt, the number one thing about costs is continue to work down
the LAS legacy cost down to a more normalized level on a per loan basis and also keep reducing the number of
delinquent loans, so that's the real expense leverage. And what Bruce talked about earlier is we've got to make sure we
do it the right way, especially in connection with finishing up some of the regulatory work there, so that's the real large
dollar amount.
You're pointing out exactly the situation on the core. If you run about $13 million a quarter in core expenses, it's not a
bad number if you annualize it and think that through. But the real question is how do you hold it there and keep
investing in the businesses. And so when we started with New BAC, we never gave a target that said we're going to
save all this money but we're going to reinvest it. We gave you a net target and now we're reaching that. And so what
we challenge our teams to is how to maintain good operating leverage going forward. And so we're more about
simplifying the company and continuing to take out expenses, but a lot of that will offset the 1,000 people we've added
in the branches to sell more products that you're seeing the benefits of, the continued adds we make in the Wealth
Management business and training programs. We hired 30% or 40% more people out of schools this year because
we've got to keep replenishing our talent base, commercial bankers, et cetera.
So as you look for the inflationary type things that go on, merit raises and healthcare expense and stuff like that, and
investing in the business, including the $3 billion-plus we put in technology development every year, will need to be
offset by hard expense work. And so that's the plan we have and we keep driving those plans in place. So it would be
less bottom line reduction on a core expense base and more of how you hold it there in a relatively slow growth
environment.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: So I'll try and summarize. Even if there's some modest revenue growth, you would
hope to keep that $13 billion relatively stable on a net basis then?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: With one exception. When markets kick up you're going to have more comp related to that
or Wealth Management comp, which is good. So you've got to be careful because those things come and go and you
can see that just in the last couple quarters. But if you think about what David Darnell and the teams have done in the
retail business, they are still rationalizing the branch structure, which will offset putting more people into branches that
are more personal bankers and FSAs, and they've done a pretty good job of offsetting it. In addition, we're repatriating
some jobs to help on the customer delight scores and stuff from places that legacy enterprises had in other places and
bringing them in, and that rationalization is going on. That's adding to our job count in the near term but will rationalize
back out.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then on the LAS costs, obviously making good progress there, and I'm
not sure there's too much concern if it gets pushed out one quarter. But is there still the goal of getting down to $500
million or below $500 million per quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes. Obviously, that is going to trail and move with as we drive down the 60-plus day
delinquent loans. But clearly the $1.1 billion that we'll either have in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year
is still way too high given the number of 60-plus day delinquent loans that we have as well as the size of the servicing
portfolio.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then lastly if I could squeeze in on the CCAR capital resubmission
process, just remind us. When do you expect to get an update on that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. We submitted our materials to the Fed on May 27. They have up to 75 days to
respond. I believe the 75th day is August 10, and we continue to see where they come out.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, thank you.

And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thank you, a quick question on the matched book for at least the Fed funds sold and
repurchased on the asset side was up 6.5% quarter on quarter. It's the opposite of what we're seeing at a lot of banks and
trends in the market, so I'm just curious. Is there an opportunity to get closer to clients? Is this a function of the fact that
your SLR is in great shape so why not use it when you can? I'm just curious on what's underlying that trend.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would say, Glenn, probably more than anything, if you go back and look at both the
notional side of the balance sheet as well as the matched book, we were probably a little bit lower at the end of the first
quarter of 2014 than you'd normally see. So that number will bounce around, but I wouldn't read anything into the fact
that it was up because it was much lower at both the end of 2013 as well as the first quarter of 2014.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Anything different on the client usage front? It is bucking a trend. I hear your comments on
the year end. It's just with the change in SLR, it's changing pricing theoretically. I just don't know if it's more
theoretical than actual.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the pricing is probably more theoretical because if you look across the industry, we
continue to see both the banks in Europe as well as the banks in Asia provide it. So I'm not sure you're seeing any
meaningful movement in what you're able to charge from a matched book perspective.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I get that, yes, okay. Switching gears, in Wealth Management, obviously, everything's doing
pretty darn good in Wealth Management, but I'll pick a little bit and I'll just ask. Expense – negative operating leverage
in the quarter when the markets are doing well, meaning revenues are up but expenses are up more, I heard and saw
your comments on the additional investments in technology. Is it comp or is it that additional investment technology?
In other words, when markets are growing and flows are great, you would expect margins to hold their ground, not give
it up. Maybe a little more color on what investments to help that business grow would be helpful.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure, you've got a couple things. The first is as you look at the expense growth during the
quarter and you look at the buckets, roughly half of it relates to incentive-related comp that is a result of increased
revenues. We do have a couple of initiatives that you'd expect to roll off over the next couple quarters within the
Wealth Management business. We obviously had the rollout of MerrillONE over the last couple quarters where you
saw some expense there. There has been some additional money spent as we invest in systems related to retirement
systems and retirement programs as we continue to see growth there. And so you do have some of that activity as well
as just making sure that the right investments within the various control and support functions are appropriate. So at the
same time, as we look forward, you need to see positive operating leverage, not negative operating leverage. And that's
what we'll look to work for as we go through the next couple quarters of the year.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: You point out – it's an obvious point and the team is focused on it, but we have made some
near-term investments, including training programs and hiring people into the business, work in the branches and stuff
to help, but it is something that we've got to monitor closely, and we think it will come down more in line with what
you'd expect.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate that. Last one is slide 20 shows that the private label outstanding claims
keep going up every quarter; anything new there? I'm not sure what's driving that. I know that we have most of this
stuff accounted for in the settlements, but I was just curious.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the notable thing that I would call out is that when we get private label claims that
comp, there are two different types of claims that come in. There is the first that are claims where people have had the
ability to look at loan files and submit a claim based on a loan file not being what they thought it would be.
And the second is that you can have people that at points in time do what we call or throw in what we would
characterize as a bulk claim where they're just throwing it in without having done any work whatsoever on the loan file.
And what's important when you look at what we saw during the second quarter of 2014, we saw roughly $1.9 billion of

original unpaid balance on the loans, not loss, growth of that amount. The amount of bulk claims where no file reviews
had been done was $1.9 billion. So I would not read too much into that number because it's not for loan files where
there has been any work done.
And I would just say generally if you look at what we've seen regarding some of the recent decisions where there seems
to be some stickiness at this point on different statutes of limitation as well as a recent ruling that came out of
California with respect to RMBS litigation, that we do feel like we're moving forward. And getting AIG behind us is
significant in regards to putting the rest of this behind us.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate that. That's it for me, thanks.

And we'll go next to John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Bruce, the increase in Tier 1 common of $7 billion was impressive
relative to the net income in the quarter. Any more color on the drivers there? You mentioned AOCI. What were the
threshold deductions that helped drive the capital expansion so much more than net income?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. So as we've said, given where we are from a disallowed DTA position, that we're at
a point where broadly speaking we accrete capital on a pre-tax as opposed to an after-tax basis. And so as you look at
the results, we had roughly $3 billion of pre-tax income. We had roughly $3.5 billion of pre-tax OCI. That gets you to
about $6.5 billion. And then as you look at threshold deductions of roughly 10%, take 10% of that $6.5 billion, it gets
you roughly $700 million. That gets you to roughly $7.2 billion of capital build. You back out the common dividend of
$100 million, and that gets you to your $7.1 billion build.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and that building at a pre-tax due to the DTA, that's something that should
continue on a steady pace, right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Clearly at least over the next I would say probably two quarters to four quarters, it will be
a function of the exact earnings, but for the near term that's correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And could you give us the numbers on what the excluded DTA is today and
what it changed in during the quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I believe that the excluded DTA was roughly $15 billion, and it was down a little over $1
billion.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. On RWA, are there risks that the continued legal settlements would drive up
your operational risk metrics, or is there a forward-looking component to the op risk calc that already anticipates more
settlements coming?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah. We're mindful of the fact of settlements. There's obviously a lot of discussion and
dialog around op risk RWA. If you look at and when we noted that the reason risk-weighted assets went up during the
quarter under the advanced approach, it was for doing exactly what you referenced, was reflecting an increased amount
of operational risk RWA. We don't give the exact number, but you should assume that that amount is in the 26% to
27% of our total risk-weighted assets number and is in line with our largest peer.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. On capital, on the last CCAR, your binding constraint was the leverage ratio
more than the risk-based Tier 1 minimum. I assume the recent preferred issuance and the Buffett conversions will help
close that gap and position you better for next year's CCAR minimum. Could you comment on that? Or are there more
things you can do to close the gap and have a quantitative cushion that's bigger to that leverage ratio next year as well?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. Well, the first, John, is just to manage the notional size of the balance sheet, which
we continue to do. The second thing that I would note is when you look at the sale of the re-performing loans that we

did, those are the types of assets that in the CCAR at least we believe – we don't have access to the Federal Reserve's
models, but those are the types of assets that tend to get hard. So, we continue to look hard and look to drive down the
non-performing consumer real estate piece of what we have, and this quarter was a good example of it.
And then you're exactly right with respect to the leverage ratio that there's a benefit that that preferred stock gives.
We're north of $4 billion this quarter that we generated. We'll continue to look to see if more preferred makes sense.
And then lastly, we'll continue to look out and see if sub debt makes sense from a total capital perspective as well. The
incremental cost of those is very low, and we just want to make sure the balance sheet is optimized for those different
buckets.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thanks. On sales and trading just in terms of the dynamics of the quarter, did
you see a pickup in June as the other banks did? And any sense of what drove that? And have you seen any
follow-through on that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Our activity levels, and if you saw a P&L throughout the quarter, while June was
marginally better, I would characterize the activity that we saw within the sales and trading business during the second
quarter to be fairly consistent. And if we look out at the third quarter, typically with the summer the third quarter is a
little bit seasonally slower than the second quarter.
If you look at our results last year, you see that. And as we come into the third quarter, there's nothing unusual in our
third quarter numbers of last year. And how we compare to those numbers is going to be a function of how well we
perform this quarter, and that's obviously up to us.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, if you look at page 19, you can see the second quarter, second quarter, second
quarter across the last three years. And it's remarkably stable in terms of markets revenue on the lower part of that page.
And so what Tom and the team did a few years ago was actually reduced their head count, almost 5,000 people, and
that's allowed us to make $1 billion in this kind of environment as we did this quarter. So this will ebb and flow. And as
you and I have talked about on various occasions, it is a core part of what we do. But we show you the separate P&L to
show that in the first quarter we had a good quarter and this quarter had $1 billion. And it may come down if activity
moves around for clients. But it is relatively stable revenue base that we can make money on because of the expense
adjustments we made last year – in the last several years.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And last thing for me, Bruce, on the CRES piece, in terms of mortgage
servicing revenues, is this quarter's core mortgage servicing revenue a stable base as you see it, or is there further
shrinkage in the size of the servicing book from sales that are ongoing that would impact the servicing fees?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah. We've got one more sale that we'll look to wrap up this quarter that's got fairly high
content of 60-plus day delinquent loans. But beyond that one transfer this quarter, we're largely at the end of servicing
sales and we're at a base of what you see should be what we have going forward with the pluses and minuses being
what runs off versus what we put on.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And you're still taking rep and warranty provisions. What are those for? Is that
for current originations or is it still catch-up from past stuff?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As you look at it, I think rep and warrant was less than $100 million this quarter. You're
going to always have that as you go forward. But we're not seeing much rep and warrant at all on recent originations.
It's going to be more legacy related.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you, John.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks, good morning. The first question I had was just a follow-up on CRES. Is there any
immediate benefit in terms of the ability to accelerate LAS legacy servicing cost reductions now because of the bulk
sale?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: From a number of units perspective, as you look at the bulk sale, there was a piece of it
that we serviced and there was also a piece that others serviced. So in the context of the number of 60-plus day
delinquent loans, it was not meaningful relative to the total.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So what we're really looking at is more of what you were talking about in response to
John's question a minute ago, which is the potential for one more sale this quarter and then just normal runoff?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, a question for you while we're on the topic of mortgage stuff. Obviously, you had the
$4 billion litigation reserve build essentially this quarter. It appears based on what you gave as an after-tax impact that
you take a full tax benefit against that. Of course, what we find with a lot of these things, especially with like the DOJ
settlements, is that a large amount is not deductible. Do you have any flexibility with respect to being able to use a
lower tax rate?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: A couple things. We don't give the exact numbers. But if you go back and look at the first
quarter, we've looked at and tried to understand what the tax treatment is for the different settlements. There was a
piece of it in the first quarter that we would have assumed was not tax deductible. And you're right; the piece in the
reserve that we took this quarter, there was a presumption that it was tax deductible. The short answer is until you get to
the end, you don't know the exact mix. So we've tried to be thoughtful with that. And I'd just say as it relates with the
total number, as we said last quarter, I think there was $2.4 billion of litigation expense over and above what was for
settlements. And this quarter, you've got in the high $3 billion, and I think it gives you a sense as to the magnitude of
the reserves that have been built over the last two quarters.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Switching topics, you did talk about pricing on commercial loans in the context of not
seeing a meaningful increase in commercial loan balances this quarter and I guess alluded to the discipline that you're
exercising. Can you talk a little bit about the conditions that you're seeing in the commercial loan market and where
you think they're soft?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. If you look at and embedded under the Global Banking segment, we've got the loans
that are done within our Corporate and Investment Bank that tend to be for the larger companies. And as we looked at
spreads and yields on a linked-quarter basis within our business, we saw relative stability in the yields in those
businesses.
And as we look out in the marketplace, given that those loans that are brought for those customers tend to be broadly
syndicated and there tends to be a relationship in the yield between that and where they can access capital in the capital
markets, that loan pricing over the last quarter has hung in there and, like I said, was generally flat Q1 to Q2. I would
say we tend to see a little bit more of the competitive pressure tends to be within the base Commercial Bank, which is
core middle-market companies, where they tend to be more one, two, or three bank deals. And we have seen – that area
continues to be pretty competitive and we're just being disciplined with how we approach that market. And given the
footprint that we have, we do have the flexibility to not chase things within some of these regional markets.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just to follow up on that, when you say banks competing for that business, are you using
the word bank in a traditional sense, or are you actually seeing a lot of the competition for those type of mid-market
loans coming from outside of what we would think of as the traditional banking sector?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, I think for the core commercial customer, that's going to be the traditional banking
customer as you think of it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, and then just a housekeeping question just to make sure I understand what you were
saying. You said there were maybe $250 million of gains in global markets I guess, probably not to put words in your

mouth, but things like Markets. But I think you said you could not include those numbers in the core equities or fixed
income segment revenues. Is that right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct. So we had a position that went public during the quarter. There was a gain
and it's reflected in the revenues of the Global Markets segment, but we did not think it was appropriate to include that
in the core FICC and equity sales and trading. So if you go to the table on page 13, when you look at that FICC and
equity sales and trading number ex-DVA that that does not include any benefit from the gain that we saw within the
overall segment during the quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, perfect. Thanks for the clarification.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure.
Operator
And we'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I was wondering. You've got a little less than $250 billion of residential
real estate loans and $90 billion of home equity. How much do you think those decline before those stabilize? Because
I think you tried to talk about it in terms of the overall loan growth, but those are really the categories that are
shrinking. Do you have a sense as to where those categories will level out?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: If you start from a home equity perspective, I think the repayment and runoff of those is a
good thing and not a bad thing. And you will continue to see, I would expect, over the next couple of years that the
amortization of those is going to be greater than the new loans coming on the book. We would not expect though as
you look at net interest income given the yields on those versus what you can do with other things that the runoff of
that book will have a negative impact from an overall net interest income perspective.
And as it relates to the whole loans piece that we have, I would expect that over time that that will continue to run
down. We continue to look, as we've talked about before on the home loans business, to put in to originate mortgages
for customers where we want to hold those loans. During the quarter we put about $6 billion of home loans that were
originated for our customers on our balance sheet. Roughly 75% to 80% of those would have been of the jumbo
variety. But I think to be realistic over the next probably couple years, you're likely to see a little bit more runoff of that
than you'll see new loans coming on. And we obviously have the decision at that point of do you want to reinvest those
proceeds in other home loans that you can buy out in the market or invest those in securities. And I would say at this
point with LCR as well as what we're focused on from a customer perspective, they're much more likely to be invested
in securities than new home loans that are not for our customers.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. Secondly, the reserve build for legal, I guess could you talk about how much you
have in reserves in total or maybe address as to how you came up with that number given the fact that I think if I'm
reading the footnotes correctly that your possible but not accrued losses have stayed flat from the first quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: A couple things. The range of possible loss that you quoted of being flat from the first
quarter to the second quarter relates to our representation and warranty reserve, not our litigation RPL. So you're
correct that the rep and warrant piece was flat quarter over quarter. We do not update and provide our range of possible
loss on litigation expense until we file the 10-Q.
As it relates to overall litigation reserves, we do not put out an exact or a level of our litigation reserve. What I do think
is notable and probably most relevant is the information that I gave you as it relates to the litigation reserve that's been
built over the last two quarters that relates to legacy mortgage-related matters. And I think you can see and people are
aware of what the most significant of those matters are. And obviously, each quarter as it relates to the reserving, we go
through each quarter and assess where we are and what we think is appropriate from a reserving perspective, and we
did that again in this quarter just like we do in any quarter.

<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, and just a quick follow-up to the first one. You had mentioned investing some of
the runoff from the mortgage and home equity portfolio in securities. Is that in the context of keeping those balances
stable, or would you actually increase that portfolio?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The first goal is obviously, as we've talked about, is to find and invest in loans that are for
our core customers across the platform, and that's priority one. To the extent that there is residual or excess, which there
has been given the deposit growth that we've seen, the money does get invested and it's been invested primarily in the
most recent several quarters in securities.
I mentioned OCI risk. The notable thing is if you look at the OCI risk that we have as a company, even though the
securities book has increased significantly over the course the last 12 months, the overall level of OCI risk based on the
different metrics that we look at has not changed. And that's a result of us shortening the portfolio, investing in shorter
duration Treasury securities.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
And we'll go next to Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So the first question I have pertains to capital and RWA specifically. So over the last five
quarters, we have actually seen the RWAs on a flat to upward trajectory. And then effectively, the growth has mirrored
the balance sheet growth that we've seen over that same period. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether there
were any additional mitigation levers that you guys could potentially pull or whether those types of opportunities have
been largely exhausted, and thus the growth going forward will likely continue to mirror the balance sheet.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as it relates to the risk-weighted assets, I think you need to bifurcate risk-weighted
assets under Basel III standardized versus those under Basel III advanced. As you look at the Basel III standardized
ratios, the benefits that we have there tend to come from the rolloff of the different consumer loan portfolios both in
first mortgage as well as in home equity. And we would expect as we've talked about throughout the call that you will
continue to see a runoff there. And given that a lot of the stuff that's running off is higher loan to value than the new
stuff that's coming on that there's incremental benefit there.
So if you look at over the last five quarters, I think the way that the standardized metric is set up, the standardized
metric is going to tend to mirror the overall loan growth that you have. And I would just think, as I mentioned going
forward, on average it will probably be a little bit lower mix coming on than what rolls off. On the advanced approach,
at this point as we look forward, there will continue to be opportunities on stuff that's advanced that tends to be heavier
risk-weighted that rolls off between now and 2017. It's not going to be anywhere near as material as what we've seen.
And under the advanced approach, the recent increases you've seen have largely been attributable to operational risk as
opposed to what we're seeing within the core loan categories.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, thanks, that's really helpful. Switching over to GWIM for a moment and actually
taking a longer-term view on the earnings power within this segment, I guess one area where we struggle from a
modeling perspective is trying to contemplate exactly how high the operating margin can get in a rising rate scenario
because the operating leverage improvement can be fairly dramatic. But presumably there is that peak margin level
where competition is going to intensify to such a degree that effectively there's going to be no more room for
improvement beyond – I don't know – let's call it 30%. And I didn't know if that was something which you guys had
evaluated at least in the context of a rising rate scenario.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think you've got one of the levers in the business that people often overlook is the lever
towards rising rates because in the business itself the amount of total deposits and loans are significant, $250

billion-odd of deposits and [ph] the same (1:20:00) with loans. And I think we said on last call and I said many times
we can see this margin moving towards 30% in that dynamic – in that environment. But I think when you get to there,
you start to top out a little bit if you just understand the broad base of revenue and the amount that goes through the
grid and things like that that become the governor on what you can do beyond that. But at the mix of our business in
Wealth Management with probably the banking business and the loans and deposits and the general client base and
what we've seen there, that gives us leverage to the upside, as you described.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, great, and one final one on credit. At your Analyst Day a number of years ago, you
had given some guidance on through the cycle charge-off rates. But clearly since that update, your loan mix has
changed fairly dramatically, and at the same time underwriting standards have tightened meaningfully. From what I
recall, I believe that through the cycle charge-off rate at that time that was implied, it was somewhere in the
neighborhood of 120 bps. Clearly it's going to be lower than that going forward, but I was hoping you could give an
update, maybe some updated guidance on where you think that through the cycle net charge-off rate will likely end up.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think if you look at the charge-offs, the key is that when you really think about the broad
constitution of $1.3 billion if you move the recoveries but some range, you've got to look at the card business. And
what changed since that time is we have changed our position in the card business fairly dramatically with the sales
from international portfolios and even how we've approached the U.S. just based on the demand of the card business.
The good news is the card business is starting to grow in terms of balances. And going back to an earlier question, we
got rid of the non-core aspects and now you're seeing the core start to come through, 1.1 million new cards. People are
using the card more, and the balances are growing.
And so I think that if you just think about that, that number is today and will be the dominant part of the charge-off
question. And you should think that $100 billion-ish in balances as you look forward, you'd expect that to grow but not
to change itself dramatically. It's not for us to change it dramatically in terms of the position on our balance sheet
because we need to keep that book balanced because it has higher charge-offs in period of unemployment levels. So I'd
say if you went back and looked at that, that is the biggest core adjustment between the two items.
And then the counter to that is if you look at the Appendix page is you see the charge-offs on the mortgage business. In
the first mortgage business you have recoveries. But if you look at the home equity side, you still have a charge-off rate
which based on the underwriting criteria of the stuff going on would be much higher, and so we had a couple hundred
million dollars in quarterly charge-offs that you can see on page 21, so we expect to see improvement in that from
where we are. But I'd say the card business is about as good – is getting very strong. We ought to see a little bit of help
in home equity. So we're going to have a reversal from the recoveries on the first mortgage loans, but it is at a
fundamentally different level because we've mixed the balance sheet differently on purpose.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, that's great. Thank you for taking my questions.

And we will go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. Going back to your LAS costs excluding litigation, where you
mentioned that probably to get to the $1.1 billion target is going to take another quarter or two, what should we be
watching? And how long do you think that LAS expenses are going to move to become non-material I guess is another
way to say it? Can you give us things of what we should be tracking?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. The first thing in order to be clear, Paul, that getting to the $1.1 billion is moved
back – maybe moved back one quarter, not two.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: I'm sorry.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So we're looking at one quarter. The second though, the biggest item that really relates to
the trajectory of LAS expenses is your number of 60-plus day delinquent loans because the cost to service that is many

multiples of what the cost of servicing a current loan is. So as you go forward, we have full implementation of the
national mortgage settlement effective September 30. That will be a big benchmark. And then as you go beyond then,
as we've always said, a one to two quarter lag, you will see expenses trend down as your number of 60-plus day
delinquent loans trend down. And as those trend down, you need less people as well as a variety of other expenses, so
that's the key metric to watch.
And as it relates to just how long that's going to continue, I would not expect that we get down to the level of what
should be a recurring number of 60-plus day delinquents until probably the end of 2015 or the first part of 2016. So as
it relates to continued expense leverage, we would expect to see upside in that business probably all the way through
the end of 2016 as it relates to driving expense down.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And, Paul, we've got work to do in the sense of if you go back I think, and if you look, I
think it's the fourth quarter of 2012, it was about $3.1 billion. The fourth quarter of 2013 I think was $2.1 billion,
Bruce. And then we said $1.1 billion – originally we said higher, then we brought it down to $1.1 billion. And now we
think that it's somewhere a little higher than that, but that's the broad move. And the question is how do you keep going
on that. And that is really going to be, as Bruce said, the number of 60-plus delinquent loans, which allows you to
release people. But we're also getting a condition that we now have got the place stabilized enough behind us that we
can start to invest in technology. We'll add a level of improvement that we haven't been able to invest in while we just
had to get the work done.
And so we expect the assistance of forming that business as we move into the middle of 2015 into 2016, and we expect
consolidations of physical plants and things like that which will add to the expense leverage. But we haven't been able
to do that as much yet just because of just the massive amount of work that had to take place. So there's still a lot of
work ahead of the team. But if you put in the context of $2 billion-ish per quarter of an expense reduction across eight
quarters, a lot of work has been done too.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And just to follow up, you talked about you do have another MSR sale. I don't know how
material that is. But right now, there has not been a lot of transfer of MSRs due to various – [ph] Loskey (1:26:30) up in
New York questioning a lot of the stuff that other companies are doing. Can that interfere with the sale, or do you think
you can sell the MSR without the headline risk of [ph] Loskey (1:26:40)?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The MSR sale that I referenced that will happen in the second half of the year in the
context of what we've done is relatively small. It's just that the delinquency content associated with that sale is high, so
it's material from that perspective. But from an overall size perspective, it's not material.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay, guys. Thank you very much.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks. I'm going to ask you a couple questions. First off, you've been harvesting about
$400 million worth of gains out of the debt portfolio. Is that in the sense of trying to minimize your AOCI risk when
rates do go up as you're shortening the portfolio, or do you just want to think about your strategy because that's been a
pretty consistent flow-through over the last year?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As you look at those gains, we are committed to not, as we continue to see liquidity build,
not taking incremental OCI risk, as I referenced. And so over the last year, even as the securities portfolio has grown,
we've managed to keep the OCI risk from an absolute dollar perspective relatively flat. And as you see markets move
up and down, obviously selling longer duration securities as you have growth in the securities portfolio is part of that
strategy.

Page 20 of 24
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: So I just want to make sure that the gains are just an outflow of that overall strategy that
you had talked about.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, you're exactly correct.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. When you look at the Consumer and Business Bank, you have a considerable
amount more in deposits than you really have in loans, which to me seems a little bit more skewed than what you
would normally expect. How do you strategically think you can utilize that balance sheet funding over time? What are
some of the initiatives that you're doing to – because you should be able to penetrate that customer base with more
lending?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, we should be able to penetrate it with more lending. So if you look on page 17 it is,
you can see that – or page 18, excuse me, you can see the growth in card originations, the growth in home equity
originations, which go on the balance sheet. As Bruce talked about earlier, we're putting about I'd say half broadly
stated of the originations and mortgages are going on the balance sheet. In the Business Banking segment, which is a
small part of our Commercial Banking segment geared to $50 million and under revenue companies, we're actually
starting to see net loan growth for the first time in a long time because we ran off some non-core portfolios. And so
that's the core opportunity in the franchise as it continues to originate credit to the core customer base. And there's lots
of opportunity there but you can see us making progress against each quarter.
I think on a broader context you've got to think about these businesses and how they mix together. So in every
company's retail business, it's an excess deposit generator just by the very nature of it. And not only does it fund along
with the consumer customers but also provides funding for the rest of the franchise. So I think you have to keep that
broader context, and that's why we invest, going to your first question, in mortgages and securities to for lack of a
better term get the value out of those deposits for the shareholder.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The other point that I just want to mention is that historically if you look at the front-end
lending in consumer real estate that we've done from a segment perspective that that consumer real estate lending on a
first mortgage basis, it shows up in the balance sheet in All Other. So you can't assume that those deposits that you see
within page nine – a lot of the loans they do for our customers are reflected in the All Other segment.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then in the mortgage segment, CRES, you're still if you take out the litigation
generating about a $700 million negative loss in the sense of your just pre-tax pre-provision between the revenues and
expenses. You're talking about bringing down the legacy asset servicing expenses. But what is the timetable in your
mind that would be reasonable to think of closing that $700 million gap?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: A couple things. The first is within Consumer Real Estate Services, if we look at the
home loans business on the front end, we talked about how we saw during the quarter that we increased both front-end
originations as well as took down expense. So Q1 to Q2 we saw about $100 million improvement on the front end of
the business that's reflected in Consumer Real Estate Services.
And as it relates to the $700 million number that you quoted, we obviously relative to the guidance have $300 million
of expense to get out of that business over the next 90 days. And then, as we've talked about earlier on the call, we've
got work to do to continue to drive that down significantly in both 2015 and the first part of 2016. And that's clearly
one of the highest priorities we have within the company.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And just lastly, and thanks for letting me ask you a few questions. If you're looking at
valuation of your servicing portfolio, it dropped off to 82 basis points this quarter, which seems relatively low as the
duration of that portfolio is extending. I know interest rates came back, so the models force you to write it back down.
But when you're looking at the prepayment speeds and the refinancing behavior, it seems like eventually that there's
some value as that portfolio lasts a lot longer than the model assumes at this point.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think to your point, the value and the fact that on a basis point basis it came down was
reflective of the lower rates that we saw at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter. And
you're right, at a point in time when rates start to move out, you would expect that MSR to extend and for there to be

value there. But we do not – I want to emphasize, that we look to manage the MSR risk as part of the overall strategy
and are managing that to have it be a flat book.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And while from an interest rate standpoint I understand that, it just seems like the models
have assumed a lot faster prepayments than we've really actually experienced, which eventually has to true up.
<A - Lee McEntire>: At the end of the day, it comes down to what the customer does. You're exactly right.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: All right, thanks.

And we'll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: My questions have been asked and answered. Thanks very much.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Thanks, Matt.

And we'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi, a couple follow-ups. First on the deposit data, I appreciate you giving us the color for every
100 basis point increase it would help by $3.4 billion. You described the deposit base. But what is the actual deposit
data that you use to come up with the $3.4 billion benefit?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We do not quote, Mike, the actual deposit data. We obviously go back and look at
historical data. Our assumption is as it relates to pass-through rates as far as how much of the first 100 basis points that
has to get passed along, we are in the 40% area with respect to that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay, 40% for the first 100 basis points?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Correct.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. So, I think that's in the ballpark of one of your large peers but below some others. And
is the reason that would be below others is because it's a lot of branch-based deposits?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: You're exactly correct. If we go back and look at what it's been throughout time, at points
where arguably we don't have the competitive position now, we look at a lot of historical data to come up with that
number.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: As it relates to expenses, you've achieved 90% of the $8 billion New BAC savings. I see the
branches are 5,023, and I think you said you wanted to be around 5,000 branches. So if I heard you right, I think you're
going from a period of right-sizing to growth. Is that a fair characterization?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We've been growing underlying activity if you look at some of the statistics and backed
things out, Mike, but you're right. If you go back a couple years ago when we started New BAC, we were running $15
billion-odd of core expenses. Now we're running $13 billion-odd, and so we're largely getting there. And the question
then is now how do you hold it there in an economic environment which is lower growth than traditionally expected in
the United States, and that's going to take constant vigilance on our part. But during the whole time period, we've
invested literally thousands and thousands of people into the sales side an0d stuff to drive that growth and we'll
continue to do that. The question is how do you balance that investment rating.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Mike – achieving the balance of the $2 billion in quarterly New BAC savings in the
fourth quarter is not dependent on future branch sales, so I just want to make sure that there's not an assumed linkage
there.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And are you reallocating some of the people assigned to New BAC to other areas? It seems like
you could dismantle that project group, so to speak.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's not a big project. This is done by the people who run the businesses. It's just
committed plans that we did. It's not a huge project group to actually accomplish it. It's done by whoever runs each
business, each function.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. As it relates to loan paydowns, Bruce, you mentioned that some bank loans declined as
customers went to the capital markets; in a way, a type of disintermediation from the bank. Can you elaborate on that?
Are you still seeing that this quarter? Do you think that was a one-off event, or is that something we should watch out
for?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Our sense is from what we saw during the quarter, it was more a one-off event. There
were a couple loans that were for acquisition related purposes that people then went out and refinanced, so it was just a
little bit of an anomaly that we saw in the second quarter. And if you look at just the attractiveness that the capital
markets have been, you would expect that to largely be over. But every now and then when you deal with large
multinational companies where some of the loan holds are a little bit higher, you can have those one-time events where
that happens, and we had a little bit of that in the second quarter. It's not something we would expect to recur.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: What I'm getting to is, do you guys think this is an inflection point for loan growth? I can find
one of your large peers who implied that it is, and I can find a large regional bank who says it's not. Where do you fall
out on the spectrum? You said, Brian, that middle-market utilization was up ever so slightly. Can you just give us that
utilization number and where you stand?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Sure. Bruce gave it to you earlier, but I'll have him do it again.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. The middle-market utilization rate was 37%-plus at the end of the first quarter and
was up almost 1% to mid-38%, which I don't think – in and of itself is not material, but it does seem that people are a
little bit more willing to access their revolving credit.
At the same time, practically speaking, you're not going to tend to see loan growth that's dramatically higher than the
rate at which the overall economy is growing. So clearly, as Brian alluded to in his opening comments, we did see an
economy that improved in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. And on the commercial side, our loan growth
is going to tend to mirror or be a little bit above what we see in the macro economy.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So do you think this is an inflection point for loan growth, or is that an answer you'd rather not
delve into?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We're seeing signs of improvement. I'm not sure I'd go as far as saying it's an inflection
point.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. At the Annual Meeting, the clock ran out on me before I could ask one question. Very
simple, what are your financial targets with and without higher interest rates?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We've been pretty consistent. If we go back, I believe Mike, to the third quarter or fourth
quarter earnings call, as we look out to and as we look at and embed in our models 100 basis point parallel shift in the
yield curve that we're looking at that point with a tangible common equity ratio of 7%, a return on asset of 1% to be at a
14% return on tangible common equity.
As you get into the – and you don't see that rate environment until 2016. And if you look at those metrics and back out
what we've said 100 basis points is worth to us on a parallel shift, you get a sense for what we need to get to ex the 100
basis point move.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I'm sorry. So without the 100 basis point shift, the target for ROA and ROTCE is what?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's going to be roughly $3.3 billion or $3.4 billion pre-tax. And at $0.63, it's $2 billion
less, which on roughly $140 billion of tangible common equity is going to be about 20 basis points less on assets at that
point.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay, and then last question. As it relates to Citigroup's settlement with the DOJ for MBS
securitizations and CDOs, you had quite a bit more in MBS securitizations and CDO structuring. And so how can we
think about this number and the amount of reserves that you have? I read one press article that you were willing to offer
$12 billion and the DOJ wanted $17 billion. I know you can't go to into too much detail on this. But can you just give
us a framework for how you view resolving this? On the one hand, you could argue maybe you shouldn't pay hardly
anything because you bought a lot of these entities that created these deals and you're just punishing the new
shareholders. And on the other hand, if you say that you had 10 times the level of some of this MBS activity it could be
a huge number. So how should we think about that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: As you said, Mike, I think we can't discuss that. And you've got a rendition of all the
different criteria that people have written about. But I think that this quarter we were able to put away the AIG case
which, if you remember, was back in 2011. A lot of people said it was worth a lot more money for $650 million. So
we'll continue to figure out what we can put behind us at reasonable cost to our shareholders. We just can't talk about
details that much.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, good job with the AIG. I was one of those people who thought it was going to be more
and it wasn't, but that's fine. I'll take any guidance I can get on the legal costs ahead. Thanks a lot.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Thank you.

And we'll take our last question from David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Just on the AIG settlement, I actually
thought AIG was the only remaining objector. Are there others?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: There are several other objectors that have not been as vocal. And as I said, we'll have to
see where it goes with them dropping out.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: And AIG has agreed to dismiss all its claims – or its objections I should say?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct. That's part of the settlement agreement.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Great, thanks very much.
Bruce R. Thompson
Great, super. I think we're through all the questions, so thanks a lot for joining us and we look forward to talking to you
next quarter.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you.
