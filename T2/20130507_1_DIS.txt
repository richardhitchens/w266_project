MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Robert A. Iger
Q2 Review
Iron Man 3
* We had a strong second quarter with EPS up 36% over last year when adjusted for comparability driven primarily by
Studio, Parks and Resorts and Media Networks
* We are pleased with our overall performance, confident in our strategy and thrilled with a stock price that keeps
reaching new record highs
o Of course it's great to announce such a strong earnings just after we are rolling out another Marvel blockbuster, Iron
Man 3, which had an incredible domestic opening with almost $175mm
o That makes it the second biggest opening weekend of all time, surpassed only by The Avengers
* Internationally Iron Man 3 set new opening weekend box office records in a number of countries and has already
brought in over $525mm outside the U.S.
o So to date the global box office for Iron Man 3 is more than $711mm
o We are proud of this movie and thrilled with its performance
* The Avengers franchise is certainly strong today, but we have a lot more to come with Thor: The Dark World in
November, Captain America: The Winter Soldier next year and The Avengers 2 in 2015

Animation
* On the animation front, Pixar continues to create great value for our company, too
* We are very excited about Monsters University which opens next month
* Pixar's slate of films for the next five years includes fantastic original stories as well as some great sequels to their
previous hits
o As we recently announced, we are in production on one of those sequels, Finding Dory, featuring Ellen Degeneres as
the voice of Dory one of the most beloved characters from Finding Nemo, which is one of the most popular and
profitable movies to date
* To Lucasfilm – on to Lucasfilm, our integration is well underway and based on our success with Pixar and Marvel,
we are confident we can drive great value from this acquisition
* In addition to the Star Wars feature films that we have already talked about, we are also working on opportunities for
television and our parks
o It's still very early in the process
o We will announce details as these developments evolve
* In the meantime, with great tent-pole features like Iron Man 2 and Monsters University followed by Johnny Depp as
Tonto in The Lone Ranger for July, our studio has delivered an incredibly strong slate of movies and we have a lot
more to look forward to
Parks and Resorts
* As I mentioned earlier, Parks and Resorts contributed significantly to our results this quarter as the investments we've
made in our domestic and international parks over the last several years begin to drive growth
o We have completed the phenomenal transformation of Disney California Adventure, added two spectacular new
cruise ships and we're well into our historic expansion of Fantasyland in Walt Disney World
Expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland
* And later this month we will complete our recent expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland with the opening of another
new land
* In Q2, Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort both set new attendance records for the quarter
* Attendance in our Disneyland Resort is now more evenly split between Disneyland and California Adventure, the
strategic goal of our investment in that expansion
* In Hong Kong Disneyland, the addition of new lands and attractions also continue to drive strong performance
Cable Networks
* Cable Networks were another important contributor to our results this quarter
* As I mentioned on our last call, with 30,000 hours of sports programming across all platforms every year, and
long-term rights to the marquis events, ESPN is still the must-have brand for sports fans
o And we just announced a 20-year agreement between ESPN and the Southeastern Conference to create and operate a
national multi-platform network airing SEC content 24/7
* ESPN has been covering the SEC since 1982 and this new network will provide unparalleled SEC fan experience
with live sports coverage as well as studio shows and original programming

* The new network launches in August 2014 and will serve SEC fans as well as multi-channel distributors and
advertisers who want to reach them
Kids Television Portfolio
* Our kids television portfolio is also doing extremely well and Disney Channel continues to be our biggest and most
effective global brand builder and content engine bringing Disney directly into hundreds of millions of homes around
the world
* We leveraged that strength to successfully launch Disney XD in multiple new markets and more recently to launch
Disney Junior which now reaches almost 400mm homes in 166 countries
o Here in the U.S., Disney Junior is now a 24-hour channel reaching nearly 60mm homes
* Anchored by hit preschool series like Sophia the First, Jake and the Never Land Pirates, Doc McStuffins and Mickey
Mouse Clubhouse, Disney Junior is beating Nick Junior's ratings by double-digits in almost every category and beating
Sprout's ratings by triple-digits across the board
* As an emerging franchise driver for our company, the success of Disney Junior goes far beyond television
o Disney Junior branded products have a strong and rapidly growing presence in the preschool retail space with retail
sales expected to increase by 80% to $1.5B in the current FY
Disney Interactive
* Finally, turning to Disney Interactive, yesterday we announced the new gaming agreement with Electronic Arts to
deliver and publish several new games based on the epic Star Wars franchise
* As you know, EA is one of the world's premier developers of mobile, tablet, console and PC games and this
multi-year, multi-title and multi-platform agreement will allow us to bring great new Star Wars game experiences to the
core gaming audiences
* We are already planning the first titles in this agreement and we look forward to announcing them with EA soon
* As part of this deal Disney retains rights to develop new titles within mobile, social, tablet and online gaming
categories as well as the rights to develop new titles for the Asian gaming market
Summary
* So overall, we feel great about what we achieved in Q2
* We have an effective strategy and we're looking forward to what's ahead
* It is an exciting time at Disney driven by high quality creative content and our unparalleled ability to leverage it for
continued long-term growth
o I am now going to ask Jay to review the details of our performance and then we'll take your questions
James A. Rasulo

o These results demonstrate the ongoing successful execution of our strategy and our ability to monetize our assets and
the performance of recent investments in our Parks and Resorts business
Media Networks
* Let me spend a few minutes discussing our second quarter in more detail and then I'll highlight some factors that may
influence our performance for Q3
* Growth in Media Networks was due to increased operating income from our Cable Networks partially offset by a
decline in our broadcasting business
o The performance of our cable business in Q2 reflects the benefit of new affiliate agreements resulting in total cable
affiliate revenue growth in the low teens or almost 10% when adjusting for the impact of revenue deferral timing at
ESPN and foreign exchange rates
ESPN
* Operating income at Cable increased 15% on revenue growth of 9% primarily due to growth at ESPN
* Results at ESPN with driven by increased affiliate and advertising revenue, partially offset by increased programming
and production costs
* The increase in programming costs were related to contractual rate increases for college football and college
basketball rights
* During Q2, ESPN deferred $70mm less in affiliate revenue compared to last year which benefited reported revenue
* In Q3, ESPN will recognize $73mm less in net deferred revenue than in the prior year, which will have an
unfavorable impact on Q3 reported revenue
o I'll remind you these changes have no impact on full-year results
* ESPN ad revenue was up 4% in Q2, primarily due to higher units sold and higher rates
o So far this quarter, ESPN's ad revenue – ad sales are pacing up more than 10%
Broadcasting
* At broadcasting, lower operating income in the quarter was due to higher write-off – cost write-offs for
underperforming shows and increase in prime time programming costs for acquired programming and a decline in ad
revenue at the ABC network, partially offset by an increase in ad revenue at our owned stations
o The decline in ad revenue at the network was due to lower ratings partially offset by higher rates and an increase in
online advertising
Ad Revenue
* Ad revenue at the ABC network was down low single digits compared to the prior year
* Quarter to date scatter pricing at the ABC network is running more than 25% above up-front levels
o Ad revenue at the stations was up 5% during Q2, and so far in Q3, TV station ad sales are pacing down single digits
vs. prior year
Parks and Resorts Segment
Operating Income
* Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered an impressive quarter, with revenue up 14% and operating income up 73%

Page 5 of 14
o The increase in operating income was primarily due to growth in domestic operations as a result of higher guest
spending and attendance at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort and higher passenger cruise days given a full
quarter of operation for the Disney Fantasy
* These increases were partially offset by higher costs, which were primarily due to growth initiatives
* For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 8% and per capita spending was up 10% on higher ticket
prices, food and beverage, and merchandise spending
* Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 7%, and occupancy was down 2 percentage points to 80%
due to an increase in available room nights at Walt Disney World
Domestic Resort Reservations
* So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior-year levels, while book rates are
comparable to prior-year levels
* Higher operating income at our international operations reflects higher guest spending at Disneyland Paris and
increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by lower results from Tokyo Disney Resort,
reflecting the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds that we collected last year
Total Segment Margins
* Total segment margins were up almost 400BPS in Q2 compared to the prior year and were favorably impacted by
about 2 percentage points due to the timing of New Year's and Easter holidays
* While operating income in Q2 was aided by a portion of the New Year and Easter holidays falling in Q2 relative to
when those holiday periods fell last year, the results also reflected improved attendance and spending throughout the
period, and the growth investments we've made over the past couple of years are performing well
Studio Entertainment
* Studio Entertainment operating income improved significantly in the quarter due to lower film write-offs compared to
prior year and improvement in our worldwide theatrical results due to the strong performance of Oz The Great and
Powerful and Wreck-It Ralph compared to John Carter last year
Consumer Products
* At Consumer Products, the increase in operating income resulted from higher performance in merchandise, licensing
and retail
o The increase in licensing is due to higher revenue from Disney Channel, standard character and Marvel merchandise,
partially offset by lower revenue from Cars merchandise as well as the resolution of a licensee audit
* On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up low single digits vs. last year
Retail Business
* The performance of our retail business was driven by higher comp store sales in North America and Japan, as well as
higher online sales in North America
* Results at our interactive business improved this quarter due to higher operating income from our Japan Mobile
business, increased sales of mobile games and lower purchase accounting impact at our social games business
o As we look to Q3, I'd like to highlight a few factors that will impact our results, most of which are timing related
* At Parks and Resorts, the timing of the Easter holiday will adversely impact our Q3 results, as only one week of the
two-week holiday fell in Q3, whereas the entire holiday period fell in Q3 last year
* We estimate the adverse impact of the Easter holiday shift on Q3 to be about $35mm

* Our Studio results in Q3 will be impacted by the timing of pre-release marketing expenses for The Lone Ranger,
which will be released domestically and in some international markets very early in fiscal Q4
* At Interactive, we expect an operating loss in Q3 that is comparable to the loss in Q2 due primarily to the shifting of
the release date of our Infinity game from Q3 to Q4
o And at Broadcasting, programming expenses are expected to be about $40mm higher due to an increase in hours of
original programming compared to last year
* We also face a difficult syndication comparison due to the sale of shows including Castle in the prior year, as well as
lower sales of library shows this year, which we expect to have a total adverse impact of about $40mm in Q3
Stock Repurchases
* We continued to repurchase our stock during Q2 by buying back 15.8mm shares for about $850mm
* FY-to-date, we have repurchased 38mm shares for $2B
* We feel great about the results this quarter and for H1 the FY
* We remain incredibly well positioned strategically and financially which enables us to continue to create value for
our shareholders
Q&A
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Quick question for Jay and then one for Bob. Jay, thanks for giving us the organic
affiliate fee number. You made Lowell's life a little easier tonight. The question I have for you is for the rest of the
year, what's the right rate, thinking about the like for like growth on affiliate fees? Is there anything unusual about this
quarter or will low teens kind of be consistent for the rest of the next couple of quarters?
<A - James A. Rasulo>: I think in general you can look for high single digits, low teens moving forward for the rest of
the year, nothing extraordinary about this quarter.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay, and then, Bob, for you, Jay has laid out kind of the big picture story on all
your drivers kind of kicking in the next couple of years. You spent the past few years investing in your franchises,
investing in your parks. A lot of your competitors have focused on buying back stock. Looking out the next couple of
years your drivers are all unknown to you. Would you consider at this point increasing the capital returns levels,
dividends, buybacks or even adding some incremental debt to the company? How do you think about that knowing all
you have done is kind of now paying dividends?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, we feel good about our ability to deliver more FCF. And don't have much to say
specifically about how we will allocate it, except that as you look back we obviously made three pretty important and
large acquisitions in Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, which we think delivered great – has already delivered and will
continue to deliver great growth and value to our shareholders. But I'm not sure that we, as we see ahead, we see
opportunities that are of like size, not to preclude that from occurring completely, but it is just not obvious to us. That
will then leave us with the opportunity, if we continue to grow our cash flow, to, you know, increase our dividend or
buy back more shares, but we have not made that decision yet. I think it will be a good problem for us to have.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Thanks.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: I think, Michael, in terms of the capital allocation, I mean almost because it's a given, Bob
didn't mention that, you know, first and foremost, we look for internal opportunities to invest our capital in projects like
you have seen us do over the last five years. In addition to acquisitions, you know, the work we have done in Parks and
Resorts, the joint ventures on free to air television stations, I mean we constantly look for ways that we can get superior
returns through investment in organic growth and we continue to want to grow the company organically. What's left
after that Bob just handled.

<A - Robert A. Iger>: We have also never really been a hoarder of cash. I think you can expect that philosophy to
continue. And we have been pleased with our credit rating. And I doubt you'll see us going to the market in a way that
would necessarily – that would impact our rating. For more debt that is.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Just to clarify, Jay, I wanted to ask you, the almost 10% growth in affiliate revs, that was
organic ex-currency and ex-deferrals. Was that ESPN or overall cable? I realize we're kind of splitting hairs here.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: That was the overall cable number. I can tell you that if you back those two factors out, Ben,
you are looking at 12.5% growth this year in affiliate revenues if you back out – this quarter, I'm sorry, if you back out
the deferral and the FX impacts.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: At cable.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Yes.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay, thank you. And then is there any particular reason – would Parks' margins be
better because of the calendar shift? I realize it benefits attendance, et cetera, but I would expect to see that incremental
expenses would be extra.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Yeah. But, of course, with the flow through you have on incremental business, in our
business, when you are taking on that kind of incremental revenue in a single quarter, I mean if you think about, for
instance, you know, around the holiday period, we're already fully staffed. So we have pretty very strong flow-through.
So yes, we think that of the 400BPS, about 2 percentage points was due to the shift in the front end and the back end of
that quarter in terms of impact on margins.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay, thanks. Lastly, Bob, could you just talk about your outlook for the Studio
segment? I mean you have put a lot of capital to work with Lucas and Marvel and clearly the titles are clicking on all
cylinders. When you look back a few years ago, this was $1 billion-plus profit pool. And I know the DVD market's
changed, but you've also made some head count changes. How do you think about the potential here for that line over
the next several years as you roll out all these franchise films?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, I think you'll see more and more focus on big tent-pole films and less on non-franchise,
non-branded smaller films. You have to – when you consider that strategy and that investment, you also have to
consider the impact that that investment and those films have across the company. So obviously, Consumer Products to
some extent, Interactive, certainly there are opportunities on the theme park front. But we feel good about the slate
ahead from all sectors of the company. Disney Animation, which is a – we think an excellent Christmas film in Frozen.
Pixar, I mentioned on the call, with a blend of sequels like Monsters as a for-instance and Nemo with some real good
original shows – original movies, rather. I mentioned Marvel, which is very, very rich. Star Wars in 2015. And then
some Disney live action films that we feel quite good about in terms of our ability to basically drive decent returns on
them. It is definitely a more challenged business in terms of what I'll call physical sales, or the physical home
entertainment side of the business, that is sell-through and rental of physical goods. But it's been growing nicely on the
digital front. And I think that bodes well for the future.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: – for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, if you could talk about the timing of the rollout of
MyMagic+, and is there any way to give us a sense of the potential impact from that initiative? It's not the easiest thing
for us to model. And for Jay, hotel bookings up 7% against flat room rates. Is there a discounting strategy to drive hotel
market share, or are those both an organic outcome as you look at it right now?
<A - James A. Rasulo>: I'll start, Doug. On hotel bookings, I would say it's an organic outcome. We have – you know,
in California because of the strength of the demand that has accompanied Disney's California Adventure, we have
really rolled out a lot of the discounting that's taken place on that property and feel very good about demand holding up
despite that and the overall both strategic and financial impact that product is having. But, of course, when you're
looking at average book rates across the domestic business, it's heavily weighted towards Walt Disney World. We've
brought on a lot more inventory with that new value hotel that we've opened. And I think that we feel pretty strongly
that you're seeing the demand numbers and, remember, when you bring on a big value hotel, the very mix of the pricing

that you have across the inventory of rooms will continue to push your rate down a little bit. But there's no promotional
pricing that's taking place to push volume right now in that business. We're really at a point, as we said we would be,
where we are yielding the volume returns and pricing returns on the ticket side that accompany the investment we've
made in that product. And I think you'll continue to see that as Fantasyland fully opens and then as MyMagic+ is fully
implemented, which Bob is going to speak to right now in terms of timing.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: The goal is for us to roll out MyMagic+ at some point this year. It's at various levels of beta
testing right now. We want to be very careful that it is working absolutely right before we roll it out to the general
public, because there's no reason for us to rush it to market. In terms of what we can expect from it, return wise, you're
right, it's somewhat – although we've modeled it, it's somewhat difficult to be specific about. You can expect that it will
create a better experience. And with that, we believe people will spend more time at our parks and ultimately deliver
more visits per guest. We also know that it will deliver some up-sell opportunities in terms of the array of products that
basically digital technology will allow. And we also think it's going to give us somewhat of a competitive advantage. I
think you have to look at all of those things, basically new products to sell, better experience that should obviously
keep people coming back for more or staying longer. And then a competitive advantage would be the way to do it. But
I can't get specific with you, Doug, in terms of how to model that.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Perhaps then, Bob, just in terms of timeframe, would that be something where by FY2014
you'd think we'd start to see some impact?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Yes. I think – well, I definitely believe we'll see some impact in FY2014. That's certainly our
plan.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Yeah.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Jay, you were going to mention something?
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Doug, just in terms how to think about this, we have known for a really long time that getting
our visitors to Walt Disney World to make decisions about where they spend their time before they leave home is a
powerful driver of visits per guest. When they get into the Orlando market and their time isn't yet planned, they can be
subject to everything you see down there, which is a lot of in-city marketing for all the many products that people have
put there to basically bleed off the feed that we fundamentally motivate. So if we can get people to plan their vacation
before they leave home, we know that we get more time with them. We get a bigger share of their wallet. So that's one
thing for you guys to think about. And the second thing is, what happens to purchases when they become much more
convenient and you don't spend time queuing up for a transaction, queuing up to get in the park and you actually have
more time to enjoy the entertainment and subsequently spend more money doing things other than standing in line
which, of course, you can't spend any money while you're doing that. So those are the components. You know, Bob
spoke to the enhanced product and competitive advantages and so on, sort of on the more strategic level, but on
components to think about how to model that financially, you might think through some of those.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: I have one for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, I'll start with you. The company is obviously
hitting on basically all cylinders. The Parks, Film, as you mentioned, and Consumer Products, Cable Networks, et
cetera, with a really strong multi-year outlook. There's one exception, which is this television business, meaning not
just the broadcast network but also your TV production is not at the levels of some of your peers. How much of a focus
is it for you? And can you give us some specifics about what you're thinking about doing in terms of turning that
around?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, I think the network, and particularly in this quarter our stations, too, have had somewhat
of a tough run these last few months. Station business has been generally soft, by the way. And even though our
stations are performing well in their markets and actually in some markets growing share nicely, the markets
themselves are basically compressing or getting smaller. And that's obviously an issue. On the network front, we'd like
a stronger prime time schedule, particularly one that is populated with more programming that we own. It's hard to look
at that y-over-y in terms of the product that we own because we tend to look more long term at these investments than
short term. So from a short-term perspective, you'd have to say that Scandal is certainly a program that we own, has

great potential in terms of delivering on our investment, but we'd like more of them. So what you really end up doing
there is you hope that your team in place, which is a great team, comes up with the kind of shows that not only drive
higher ratings and more advertising revenue, but ultimately includes a number of shows that we own that drive more
revenue in general. It's basically – there's no real secret to it, Jessica. As you know, you've been following us for a long
time. But we could use a few more new hits and certainly hits that we own. It's that simple. Paul Lee is hard at work
with his team on that, as you know, as we speak. I've seen the pilots; I'm reasonably encouraged by what I've seen.
Actually, more than reasonably encouraged. I'm very encouraged by what I've seen and hopefully the year ahead will
deliver more value for us than the year prior.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Okay. Thanks. Then in the Parks for Jay, I have a couple of like really short questions. But
can you break out what percent of the costs are variable at this point, what your mix is of international and domestic
visitors? Obviously spending has come down quite a bit. But if you could give us – like kind of update your thoughts
on what margins. You've said that you expect to get to peak margins at least in the U.S., which we can't see yet. How
do you feel about margins kind of over the next few years?
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Okay. Let me try to take a couple of those. So in terms of the international domestic mix, this
quarter is the same exact mix as last quarter. I told you in general we run between 18% and 22%. We're at the low end
in Q2 of that but our strength has been from Brazil and the UK. A little bit of weakness from Canada in Q2. But I
would say there's not a big story there, although we'd love to see our business from Brazil continue to grow. It's been a
real driver for us and it's nice to see growth back from the U.K. In past quarters, a lot of our international attendance
growth has been from Canada. So anyway, I think the story there is within the range and we're pretty happy with it,
with the overall increase in volume international has kept its pace. In terms of margins, you know, the story there is
going to be one of improving margins as we, you know, put behind us the launch costs and ramp-up lower margins of
new business initiatives that have been affecting us, you know, since we started on our big Parks capital program. You
know, sort of every quarter or every other quarter, we have been launching a business. There's been substantial
pre-opening costs that are associated with those, of course, with no revenue. And even in the following quarter when
the revenue starts, it's usually not at full tilt. So that should be contributing to our overall margins. We're pretty happy,
frankly, with what we see in the base business margins. If you back out, you know, the things that we backed out, I
think this has been a quarter that has evidenced very, very strong fundamental growth in margins in that business. And,
you know, even though there have been a lot of structural changes that have occurred, you know, since we used to talk
about 20% margins, i.e. the consolidation of businesses overseas into the Parks segment that were not consolidated
before, recognizing incentive comp in the Parks margins which was not done before, when you take those things out,
we really do believe that we can get back on a steady state basis to the kinds of margins we had pre-downturn. So I
think the story is good there. I'm sorry I can't give you a whole bunch more detail. In terms of the variable percentage,
you know, it varies through the course of the year, obviously, you are in periods where more – down periods in the year
when more of the costs are fixed. When you go through the holidays like New Year's and Easter you have a much
larger variable component, but I can't really give you too much insight beyond that.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Just staying on the Parks for a minute, given your experience at Cars Land and the real
impressive attendance growth that has followed that opening, could you give us a bit of color how we should think
about Fantasyland renovation and how significant can it be in terms of driving growth going forward at Disney World
and any sense of how much that might have – I know part of it was already renovated and opened but a lot of it is still
ahead of us. Any sense on sort of the timing when we might see sort of a big marketing push behind or we might see
more of a notable impact on that renovation?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, as you may or may not know, the Magic Kingdom park in Orlando is the number one
park down there. It's actually the number one park in the world. And we hadn't really done much to Fantasyland in the
many, many years since we opened. So this was significant, both from our perspective, but also from a guest
perspective. The only thing I can tell you that may give you some sense is that the Magic Kingdom broke an all-time
single day record for attendance during the Easter holiday. And we believe that was a direct result of the investment
that we made in Fantasyland. Obviously, the summer will tell us a lot more. We do know from a guest satisfaction
perspective that the numbers that we're seeing from the Magic Kingdom, specifically from Fantasyland, are way up.
We have more to open, as you cited, Alexia. But what we have opened is really being well received.

<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And in terms of the expenses, or sort of launch costs. I'm guessing it sort of is straight line
as long as far as you open it? Or is there a bigger component of it that comes later on that we'll see a bit more of cost
pressure around?
<A - James A. Rasulo>: I wouldn't expect to see significant cost pressure. Unlike – when you think about the
magnitude of Fantasyland, extraordinarily important for us to do that in the Magic Kingdom because of all the reasons
Bob just discussed but if you look at the impact of that on the overall cost base at Walt Disney World. It's nothing like
the Disney's California Adventure expansion which, you know, was substantive relative to the base of the Disneyland
Resort. I wouldn't look very hard for a whole bunch of costs associated with its launch. And I think that you can see
certainly in 2014 you will start to see, you know, reasonably good contribution from that. I wouldn't look for a cost
degradation there.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: I have one that's probably a handful of questions that are disguised as one question, so I'll just
limit myself to that. I'm interested in your international television business, so particularly as a network operator, or in
other cases where you are sort of a de facto operator by large licensing, large box of content and really just interested in
any commentary you'd share on how fast is that part of the business growing in both affiliate fees and advertising? How
much is that contributing to your media segment growth of those line items? What are the margin trends? I told you this
was several questions disguised as one. And how big would that sort of be as we look out and it compounds over the
next couple of years? And are there any opportunities for sort of investment there either organically or even through
M&A to increase that portion of your business? Thank you for indulging all of that.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I'm not sure we can give you much detail except to say that our international television
business, which is largely Disney branded, Disney Channels, Disney XD, Disney Junior, as I mentioned on my call in
166 countries, we do have, as you mentioned, we have program blocks that we have licensed to third party distributors
in a variety of places in the world and obviously we distribute the other content that the company owns, notably our
movies and our TV shows. All of that has grown very nicely over the years and we think that it will continue to grow.
We have also continued to make investments in new channels in new markets. So we are launching a free over the air
Disney Channel in Germany. We launched in Russia. We launched in Turkey. We're looking for some other
opportunities there as well. But to give you some perspective, I just don't have the details in terms of the growth
trajectory or what it looks like from a margin perspective. We also look at it as a brand building opportunity, too,
because, as I've mentioned a number of times, the Disney Channel has become one of the most important drivers of
basically brand value for the company. The impact that it has not only with the programs that it puts on, but essentially
supporting all the other content that the company has, particularly our movies, is pretty substantial around the world.
And there's value there that we don't necessarily put specifics against. But it's been a great growth engine for the
company. And we believe it will continue to be. Particularly, again, as some of these markets that we have only
launched recently haven't matured, Russia, a good example of that.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Yeah. What you are seeing right now in the numbers, Todd, are dilutive to our earnings in
each of those. There's still all of the launch stage, Germany, Turkey, Russia and our Japan D-Life project. We're still in
investment mode on all of those...
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the new ones.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: On the new ones. Needless to say, we wouldn't invest in those if they're not going to turn
around and be accretive to our earnings down the road. As Bob said, we can't get too much into the details how the
margins relate to our domestic business but we are investing in growth in the international television business.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Okay. I had to give it a try. Is it material to the affiliate fee growth rate when we look at sort of
low teens, 10 percentage organic? You know, is the international contribution, which I assume these things are growing
maybe faster than that. Is it material? Or should we not even think about it as we think about how that grows over the
years and props up and aids the acceleration of that growth? Then I will leave you alone.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: It was not material in Q2, Todd.

<A - Robert A. Iger>: But what I will say, I think what you can say, just as you think of the future, we have been very,
very aggressive over the last five years at launching new channels in many, many places. I think while we continue to
look for opportunities to launch new channels in new markets, as I mentioned, there will be fewer new launches in the
future than there have been in the past five years. Obviously, as they mature and we move out of the investment phase
and basically into the real growth phase, then you'll start to see an impact on the bottom line, both from advertising and
from affiliate fees.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Just one question, turning to ESPN and your sports franchises. So I think if I have this
correct, I think in the spring of next year, your new MLB deal takes effect. And then in the fall of 2014, your new NFL
deal and presumably new SEC network agreement kicks in. I want to ask about the NBA deal, which you share with
TNT. That, I think, goes until 2015-2016. And I'm just wondering how core the NBA is to your sports franchise. There
are other national sports networks out there: Fox Sports 1, NBC Sports. They'll presumably be hungry for sports
content when that deal comes up. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And the other question there is, do
your current affiliate renewals with the MSOs contemplate a renewal of your NBA deal in those contracts? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: The NBA deal that we currently have goes through 2016. So you're off a little bit, Anthony, in
your timing there. If you look at ESPN, they've locked down rights other than the NBA to virtually every other
important sports franchise that they have for a long time. And they've also concluded a number of very long-term
affiliate agreements. So if you think about our businesses going forward, there's probably more certainty as relates to
ESPN than almost any other business that we're in. Which I think, generally speaking, is a good thing. Now, there are
some opportunities to buy some other events. And we obviously have the NBA, which is important programming to us
coming up. And we have a few new affiliate deals to do, but not many. But I think generally speaking, ESPN is in great
shape. As we look at the timing of when new contracts kick in, as you mentioned Major League Baseball and the SEC,
we don't look at it in a vacuum. We look at it against the timing of when new distribution deals kick in. We talked
about, I think, more in the last quarter as it related to Comcast and new rates as a for instance. So we think that ESPN's
future in terms of its growth trajectory is actually quite good. And we know a lot about what it is likely to be. And I
can't comment as to whether there are affiliate deals that are in any way tied to a renewal of the NBA.
<Q - David Bank>: Two questions. The first is, Bob, can you talk about as viewership of premium video over time,
both ESPN and ABC, migrates incrementally over kind of online, how do you view the optimal – like the optimal
monetization for ad inventory on a kind of Nielsen OCR demo sold basis vs. just sort of a gross impression? How do
you think that inventory is maximized most and why? And then second, as you think about rolling out the FASTPASS+
and all those new technological elements, do you think it's a better strategy to bifurcate them by offering them to resort
guests or something only at first to drive higher occupancy, or do you kind of go wide for everybody with that stuff?
Thanks very much.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I'll answer the second question, because it's easier to answer. We have for years had in place
products that are available only to hotel guests. And actually, one thing that I think Jay alluded to, didn't say
specifically, is the MyMagic+ will definitely encourage people to stay more on property than off property. Jay was
talking about essentially by being able to plan ahead, people will basically have more planned with us and that will in
effect discourage them from doing other things. I think it will also encourage them to stay more in our hotels. And so I
think you have to look at that as an additional value to MyMagic+. I'm not 100% sure I understand your question, the
first part. But let me give it a shot. I don't know that you're going to see more viewing migrating online necessarily. I
think you'll see more online viewing of product, both scripted traditional entertainment and sports. We look at that as
essentially a real opportunity because we think we're giving consumers, particularly consumers who have already
bought the expanded basic bundle, an opportunity to choose the screen that makes most sense for us. What we
obviously need to happen at the same time, is we need for either Nielsen or some measurement system to kick in that
adequately compensates us for the increased consumption on new devices. What we have done is we have created
selling tools and a selling structure across our businesses, including at the network, by the way, that is essentially kind
of a selling – in fact, we're already talking as relates to ABC and the up-front, selling packages to advertisers that go
across all media, which we have been doing for a while at ESPN and we're doing much more aggressively at ABC and
the other networks. We think that will also add value. But I think the key is for us to get a measurement system in place
that enables us to monetize. I'm convinced that there's a lot of consumption going on there.

<Q - Alan S. Gould>: A couple of park-related questions. They are quick, though. When could you conceivably get
the rights back to the Marvel characters and attractions at the Parks? Second, could you give us the international park
revenue and operating income which I think comes in the Q? And then thirdly, the Interactive Division, do you still
think it will hit breakeven with the pushback of Infinity until August?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: The last question with the pushback of Infinity to August, it's doubtful you'll get break even this
year because of when Infinity will street, which is essentially in our fourth quarter, so it essentially pushes that back.
We believe in Infinity. It's actually been very well received by the gaming community and by consumers. And we're
pleased with what we see in the product. That also – retail has had really great buy-in for it as well. We think it will be
a great product and it's going to help drive profitability for FY2014. By pushing it back, it's going to make it harder to
achieve profitability or break even this year at that division even though the division will deliver results this year that
are substantially improved from last year. Had Infinity not pushed back and Infinity done what we expect it will do,
then achieving breakeven this year was very, very do-able. I can't really say very much about Marvel rights at the
Parks, other than to say that rights for the Marvel properties, particularly in Florida, are not ours at this point. And I'm
not going to even speculate as to not only when we'll get it back, but whether we'll ever get them back. We have plenty
of opportunity, though, for Marvel in our parks and we're hard at work developing Marvel presence, particularly in our
international parks, notably in Hong Kong.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Alan, in terms of revenue of our international parks, it was $543mm this quarter, with, we
saw growth in Paris and Hong Kong, as I mentioned. Because in the prior quarter we had business interruption
insurance payments in Tokyo, our revenue there was down a little bit, but the fundamentals at Tokyo Disney Resort are
quite strong.
<Q - Michael Senno>: I just wonder if you guys could quantify as you have done in the past, the margin impact at
Parks from new initiatives in this quarter and if we could expect to see that continue to decelerate as the year goes on?
And then second question, just in regard to the strong per cap spending, I understand there are ticket price increases,
but it seemed to accelerate this quarter and just wanted to see if there were any other particular drivers you're seeing at
the Parks that are resulting in that. Thanks.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: Okay. On the margin impact on new initiatives, so, you know, they are a little lumpy. This
quarter they happen to be marginally accretive to the overall margins, but just modestly, to be honest with you. As I
said, they are lumpy and I think, you know, next year, as everything moves into fuller stride, you'll start to see those be
more positive drivers to margins. Your second question on spending for the quarter across all categories, of course, per
caps were helped by the holiday business that Bob mentioned, particularly Easter. But there was nothing unusual about
any of the categories. They were all up across the board.
<Q - David W. Miller>: Jay, just following up on – I think it was Ben Swinburne's question, I think the third question
in, going back to my – I've followed you guys for a long time. And I'm going back to my models here, actually in the
spreadsheet all the way back to 2001. I don't see any example of a Q2 which is your March quarter, usually your
weakest quarter ironically enough for the Parks, where your margins were this high, 11.6%. I know what you are going
to say. You're going to talk about the timing shift. You're going to talk about the demand curve moving to the right. I
believe there were some phase 3 shutdown sequences that occurred in late March. Was there anything else going on on
costs that you're willing to elaborate on because these are truly outstanding margins? I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,
a record for Q2. And then within that, do you guys still have a fuel hedge for the boats or has that been unwound?
Thanks very much.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: You know, David, Jay mentioned that obviously some of the impact in Q2 at the Parks, both on
the margin side and on the bottom line had to do with the shift in timing of both Christmas and Easter. But let's call it
what it was, it was a great quarter for the Parks, a great quarter. There is nothing on the expense side to really note in
this case. You know, continued diligence in that regard for the Parks. I think they have done a good job of managing
their expenses, particularly when they have continued to invest to grow. But this was a quarter that I think stood out
because the product that we recently put online really worked, like California Adventure and Fantasyland and the ships,
as we've talked about. And the product that we have had online for years and years has, I think, in many respects, just

never looked better to the consumer. And in an economy that is I think seeing some slight improvement, you get results
like the results that we got. I think it bodes very well for our future. As we mentioned earlier, it will be a little
lumpiness in terms of margin expansion. The cost, for instance of the MyMagic+ you'll see in the next quarter as a for
instance and a little more on Fantasyland, but generally speaking, we have a great Parks story to tell. Just as an aside –
and we have talked a lot about California Adventure. Before we redid California Adventure, at a typical day at the
Disneyland Resort, you'd see about 75% of attendants going to Disneyland and 25% going to California Adventure.
That's now on most days more like 55/45. That's an incredible change. And it enables us to drive real bottom line
growth because you've got a better experience at Disneyland. We're getting pricing out of California Adventure that's
substantially above what we were able to drive before. We have increased food and merch spending there as a for
instance, that obviously contributes nicely to the margins. I'm not sure there's any other way to characterize the quarter
for the company in Parks and Resorts except to say it was a tremendous quarter.
<A - James A. Rasulo>: On your fuel hedging question, we generally hedge our fuel out of Port Canaveral, accounts
for about 1/3 of what we'll be using in terms of fuel for the cruise line this year.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: I just have a question for Mr. Iger. One of the things that always struck me as unusual
about your financials on a trailing basis is how much of the growth came from Media Nets relative to the other
divisions, even if you asked a man on the street what they thought of Disney, they wouldn't necessarily think of ESPN.
Now that you have sort of made all of the investments in Parks and made the investments in IP, are we just in harvest
mode now and just the investments that you have made you're just going to sort of execute and let the strategy play
out? Is that the right way to think about it? Or is there another pivot that you see sort of on the horizon over the next
three years?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: That's a bit of a tricky question there, Jason. You know, I don't want to in any way say that
there's something big afoot when I answer your question by saying we're never in harvest mode, per se. There are
always opportunities to harvest what we've invested in, but we are in extremely dynamic businesses and a very
dynamic global marketplace. There are always going to be opportunities for us, particularly given the strength of these
assets: ESPN, Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. There are going to always be opportunities for us to invest in those
to grow in a marketplace that generally is pretty robust. We talked about the fact that we believe we'll be able to grow
FCF nicely, I guess in a way that's a form of harvesting. But I get a little bit concerned about using the word harvest
because sometimes it suggests a status quo approach and I don't think status quo in as dynamic a marketplace as we
operate in is a good strategy.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Let me recast it. Is it fair to say that the Lucas acquisition was the capstone of a fairly
significant strategic pivot for the firm?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I said it before – asking me today as we look ahead at whether there's a Pixar or Lucas, a
Marvel on the horizon, I'd have to say not likely. We just don't see it. But that doesn't mean one isn't going to crop up
and that we won't act opportunistically as we did on those three to take advantage of it if we see an acquisition that we
believe is really going to deliver long-term value and growth for our shareholders. We feel really good about Pixar. We
feel great about Marvel. Not just because of this week, although we have to admit that it certainly helped. But when we
look ahead at what Marvel has got in the pipeline and the opportunity to monetize those properties, not only across our
businesses but across the world, obviously significant. We feel great about Lucas. It's been very well received. As we
look at Lucas, the more we get into it, the more we realize that we've got a property in our hands that is probably more
loved and more well-known than almost anything else that we have, which is remarkable. Remarkable that it was even
available for us to buy. I don't want to – I don't want to say never meaning that never again or there isn't one out there.
It's just much more difficult as we look ahead to cite one. I certainly wouldn't be able to mention it to you on this call. I
will say that on the Marvel and to give you maybe a little bit more of a perspective, on the Marvel and the Star Wars or
the Lucasfilm acquisitions, those appeared on, I'll call it, internal lists of things that we thought might make real sense
for this company and its shareholders for quite a long time. We looked at them very carefully. That list is shorter today
than it used to be.
