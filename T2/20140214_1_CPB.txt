financial and segment results. After that we'll take your questions.
As usual, we have created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website
this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app, which is available through Google or Apple.
Please keep in mind that our call is open to members of the media who are participating in listening-only mode.
Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements; they reflect the company's current expectations about
future plans and performance. Our forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which
could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to slide three in the presentation or to the company's
most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary
materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, Campbell and our joint venture partner agreed to restructure manufacturing and
streamline operations in China. We recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $13 million related to this initiative. In the
first quarter, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges and related costs of $23 million, associated with initiatives to
streamline our salaried workforce in North America and in Asia Pacific, and for previously announced initiative.
We recorded a loss of $9 million on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of our
European Simple Meals business. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $7 million associated with that sale.
Last year in the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge and related costs of $48 million related to
our U.S. supply chain in Mexico. In the first quarter, we recorded $10 million in transaction costs for Bolthouse and
$43 million in restructuring charges and related costs, related to U.S. supply chain initiatives.
Since our presentation today includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of
the measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our
presentation. These slides along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials also can be found on our
website accessible by computer or on your mobile device with the Campbell IR app.
As Denise will touch on later too, Campbell recently announced a CFO transition. Craig Owens, CFO since October
2008, will be retiring on May 1, 2014. He has been not only a strong and respected CFO, but also an outstanding
mentor to me and many others here at Campbell. And on behalf of all of us, who have had the privilege to work with
and laugh with Craig; I'd like to thank him for that.
So we're delighted to add that Anthony DiSilvestro is being promoted to CFO and he will be providing the financials
perspective at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference, CAGNY, in Florida on February 19, with Craig,
Denise, and I attending as well.
We invite interested shareholders, investors, members of the media and consumers to listen to and view our Investor
Presentation at CAGNY which will be video-cast live, actually video-cast at 10.30 AM Eastern from Boca Raton. A
replay for the video and copies of the materials will be available afterward on Campbell's website archive.
And with that, let me turn it over to Denise Morrison.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining Campbell's second quarter earnings call. I'd
like to cover three topics this morning. I will share my perspective on our second quarter and first half results, update
you on the unusual factors that negatively impacted our first quarter and how those played out in the second quarter,
and discuss our plans to drive stronger growth in the second half to deliver our full year guidance. Craig will then
provide details on our segment results.
Despite facing headwinds from a weaker retail and consumer environment, we continue to reshape our company for
longer term higher growth, while at the same time balancing short-term deliverables. In the second quarter, we
delivered growth of 6% and reported net sales 15% in adjusted EBIT and 19% in adjusted EPS from continuing

operations, which increased to $0.76. Clearly, we made progress from our disappointing start in the first quarter. Our
improved results were driven by growth in our core business and from acquisitions. We delivered 3% organic sales
growth in our core business, led by higher sales in U.S. Simple Meals, Pepperidge Farm, and Bolthouse Farms.
Acquisitions also contributed to our growth, led by Kelsen, which we acquired in the first quarter to give us a growth
platform in China and other developing markets. Kelsen was the main catalyst of our 14% growth in Global Baking and
Snacking and contributed to the higher operating earnings. We had a strong holiday season in U.S. Soup and
Pepperidge Farm, but January was weaker than expected. During the quarter, we also closed the sale of our European
Simple Meals business.
Let me take you through the four factors that negatively impacted our first quarter performance and explain how those
factors played out this quarter. As we said in November, those Q1 drivers were movements in inventory levels by U.S.
retailers and program timing, weakness in our core business trends, our decision to front-load marketing spend in Q1 to
support new products in Soup and Simple Meals and build the Bolthouse Farms brand, and our voluntary recall of a
range of Plum Organic products. We said in November that we expected a positive impact on second quarter results as
some of these drivers reversed. This in fact happened.
Looking first at inventory movements, our U.S. Soup business benefited from positive retailer inventory movements in
the second quarter, as we anticipated. That was a change from Q1 when retailer inventory declines and higher levels
coming into the year combined with later holiday timing hurt our Q1 results, especially in Soup.
Reflecting the reversal and inventory pressures, U.S. Soup shipments increased in the second quarter, driving 5% sales
growth. The late timing of the Thanksgiving holiday season also helped U.S. Soup and Pepperidge Farm as it pushed
shipments into the second quarter, as we expected. We had strong sales and consumption during the holiday season and
well executed holiday programs. For the quarter, sales of Campbell's condensed cooking soups grew double digits and
Swanson broth was on fire, up 21%. We also grew sales of Pepperidge Farm bread and stuffing.
Let's look more closely at the second factor that we discussed back in November, our core business trends. In the
second quarter, our core business performance improved, especially in U.S. Simple Meals, which delivered 7% growth
in sales and 12% growth in earnings. This performance reflected growth in Soup, the acquisition of Plum Organics, and
higher sales of sauces including our new innovation with Prego white sauces and Campbell's dinner sauces. As we said
in November, we began the fiscal year with a soup promotion plan that was more heavily weighted to the second and
third quarters. Despite strong holiday consumption, we didn't get the overall lifts in soup that we had anticipated in the
quarter from the balance of promotions. This caused soup shipments in the quarter to be ahead of consumption, which
was down more than a point for the quarter. As a result, we ended the second quarter with inventory levels that were
elevated from the year-earlier quarter.
So while we delivered growth in soup sales, we are far from satisfied with the category consumption and our
consumption performance. Accordingly, we have more aggressive plans in the second half, as I will explain in a few
minutes.
Turning to Pepperidge Farm, we delivered 5% growth in Goldfish in the second quarter, including crackers and our
new Goldfish Puffs. Sales of Pepperidge Farm cookies increased, with growth in Dessert Shop cookies. Fresh bakery
delivered solid performance as the business continued to innovate and leverage our shelf space gains. Sales in
Bolthouse Farms increased 6%, with double-digit growth in its premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings.
Bolthouse Farms continues to launch innovative new beverage products, supported by increased merchandising. We
continue to increase beverage assortment in the retail perimeter while we are still expanding points of distribution for
salad dressings.
Our core U.S. Beverage business and our business in Australia continued to face challenges. We told you previously
that we don't expect U.S. Beverages and our Australian business to be growth drivers this year, and that hasn't changed.
But we have taken several important steps in recent months to change the leadership in both of these businesses and
build a stronger foundation for future growth.

In U.S. Beverages, the second quarter sales decline was largely driven by our planned transition from the Coke
distribution system for our single-serve V8 beverages. Our five-year distribution agreement with Coke concluded on
December 31 after both companies elected not to renew the agreement for strategic reasons.
We have established a new national distributor network for immediate consumption, supported by a new sales team.
We started shipping in January to our new distributors, who are energized and focused on driving growth. Over time,
we see immediate consumption as a significant opportunity for expansion for both V8 and Bolthouse Farms.
In our V8 business overall, we are seeing improved trends in our V8 100% vegetable juice and continued growth in V8
V-Fusion+Energy. In Australia, we brought in new leadership, developed a more focused plan for our core biscuit
business, and implemented initiatives to drive productivity in that market. Restoring growth in this important business
is a work in progress that will take time.
The third factor we cited was front-loaded marketing to support new products. We told you in the first quarter that our
advertising and consumer spend increased 14% to support new products like Campbell's Homestyle soup and
Campbell's dinner sauces. In Q1, we also made our first brand building investment behind Bolthouse Farms. We knew
these upfront marketing investments would negatively impact earnings in the first quarter, but our decision has helped
to accelerate these brands.
Looking at our marketing spend in the second quarter; advertising and consumer promotion for the total company
increased 3%, including acquisitions. We are delivering solid performance in Campbell's skillet sauces and slow cooker
sauces. Our dinner sauces are delivering incremental sales in this new category. They are steadily building trial with
very good repeat purchase rates in consumer groups, including both younger and more affluent consumers.
Campbell's Homestyle ready-to-serve soup continues to expand distribution and improve velocity. Homestyle was
introduced following the discontinuation of 100% Natural RTS. This transition narrowed our shelf presence because
Homestyle was launched with fewer items. Going forward, we expect to gain back shelf space as we build out the line
and introduce new products in the back half.
The marketing investments behind Bolthouse Farms are raising consumer awareness of this wonderful brand as we aim
to expand its position in the $12 billion packaged fresh category. We were pleased with Bolthouse Farms solid
performance in the second quarter across all of its segments.
The final driver we discussed in November was the voluntary recall of some Plum Organics products. In the first
quarter, the company recognized $16 million in costs associated with the recall. We moved quickly in the second
quarter to address the manufacturing defect that led to that recall. The acquisition of Plum, which we completed last
June, contributed half of our 16% growth in U.S. Sauces in the second quarter. We believe that Plum which we will
continue to integrate, is well-positioned for a more significant sales contribution in the second half.
So to briefly summarize, the first quarter inventory headwind reversed, much as we anticipated. The Plum recall is
behind us. We feel good that we will obtain a return on the stepped-up advertising. Our core business, however,
remains a bit behind our expectation through the first half of the year for the reasons I just enumerated.
So looking at the first half, it was a tale of two cities. We got off to a slow start, but recovered in the second quarter, as
we said we would. In the first half, net sales from continuing operations increased 2%. Adjusted EBIT declined 5%,
and adjusted EPS decreased 4%. While we made substantial progress in the second quarter, we didn't expect to make
up all the growth that we lost in the first quarter. We recognize that we must deliver strong results in the second half to
achieve our full-year guidance. In the second half, we expect to grow organic sales by around 2% and acquisition
should contribute about 3% to our sales growth. For the full year, the extra week in the fiscal year will largely be offset
by currency. So, how are we going to deliver this growth?
Let me start by giving some highlights of our plans in U.S. Soup and Simple Meals. We expect U.S. Soup to deliver
modest growth in the second half of the year. We have a strong promotional calendar in the third quarter and marketing
in place to drive soup consumption in the back half of the year. We also expect our U.S. Soup business to benefit from
eight new soups that we launched in January under an accelerated timeframe. These include our first Latin-inspired

cooking soups, new pub-inspired varieties of Campbell Chunky soup and new Healthy Request varieties. By
comparison, we didn't launch any new soups in the second half last year.
In broth, we expect to drive continued growth in Swanson with strong Easter programs. Importantly, we expect other
businesses to contribute more significantly to growth in the second half, while does its part. In Simple Meals, we will
continue to build momentum in Campbell dinner sauces. We have already created separate shelf sections for this new
category in approximately 50% of the ACV. We aim to drive continued growth in Prego with more advertising and new
products, including expanded presence in white sauces, a space we weren't competing in the year ago. And we expect
Plum Organics to show improvement from the first half, with the full product range back in supply, expanded
distribution and several new products.
In Global Baking and Snacking, we expect Pepperidge Farm to deliver stronger growth in snacks in the second half.
We have plans to drive Goldfish with aggressive promotional activity; increased customer supported merchandising,
and accelerated channel expansion. Pepperidge Farm will increase innovation with new varieties and packs of Goldfish,
The national rollout of Goldfish Mac & Cheese and further expansion of Goldfish Puffs. We will continue to expand
Dessert Shop cookies with new varieties and we will launch coffee shop cookies indulgent morning offerings.
Internationally, we expect to deliver double-digit growth in sweet biscuits in Indonesia, and we are focused on
marketing Tim Tam, Shapes and Arnott's sweet biscuits in Australia with increased advertising and consumer
promotion, and strong customer programs.
After delivering solid second-quarter results, we expect a strong second half from Bolthouse Farms. We have one of the
most exciting spring innovation lineups in Bolthouse's history, with marketing support and plans to launch a number of
new beverages and delicious salad dressings.
Although, U.S. Beverages won't be a growth engine, we do expect to see improved sales in immediate consumption
channels over time as we fully develop our new national distributor network, which has been established and is
operative. We are also expanding V8 V-Fusion Refreshers, and we expect continued growth in energy drinks, which
are performing very well.
Across our portfolio, we will be intensely focused on driving productivity and managing expense in our global supply
chain. We expect to deliver improved gross margin trends in the second half, and Craig will discuss why we expect
profits to be better.
For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver net sales growth of 4% to 5%, adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6%,
and adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4%. We know it will require strong execution against the drivers of demand, we
know it will demand operating discipline, and we know that we must have a resolute focus on accelerating stronger
profitable growth across our core business, while we continue to integrate our acquisitions.
We don't expect to get everything back in the third quarter. It will take a strong fourth quarter performance as well. We
are in the midst of a turbulent period. Retailers are wrestling with challenged consumers who remain under pressure
and consumer behavior is becoming less predictable.
We believe the weakness that Campbell and other food companies experienced in January was partially related to the
extreme weather conditions, which dealt a blow to the U.S. economy. We expect to be competing in a more typical
environment over the remainder of the year. Obviously, if the environment is significantly worse than we expect, then
it will be tougher to reach our guidance.
In summary, we are optimistic about our plans for the second half of the year and believe that with solid execution, our
full year guidance is both reasonable and attainable. Before I turn the call over to Craig Owens, I also want to thank
him for his contribution to Campbell over the past five years. As we recently announced, Craig will retire from
Campbell on May 1st. This will be his last earnings call with us. Craig has done an outstanding job as our CFO and
Chief Administrative Officer. With his integrity, insights and expertise, he has earned the admiration and trust of our
leadership team and the investment community. He will be greatly missed by all.
Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Craig.

B. Craig Owens
Well, thanks, Denise. It's really been my pleasure to work with Campbell's and to be a part of your management team. I
feel really good about where Campbell's is and where it's going, and I'm particularly happy that Anthony is going to be
our next CFO, but I'm not quite done yet, so let's get back to work.
Let me walk through the second quarter results, segment highlights and then a brief outlook for the – with respect to
our earnings guidance. As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion of results will exclude the impact of restructuring charges
in both the current and prior year quarters, as well as the acquisition transaction cost in the prior year. I'll also exclude a
loss on foreign exchange forward contracts and a tax expense related to the sale of our European business that were
both recorded in continuing operations in the first quarter.
On October 28, 2013, which was the first day of our second quarter, the company completed the divestiture of our
Simple Meals business in Europe. This business is reported in discontinued operations. In the quarter, the company
recognized a net gain of $90 million after-tax or $0.28 per share from that sale. So, for continuing operations, we
reported second quarter net sales of $2.3 billion, a 6% increase from the prior year.
These results include a 5 point contribution from our Kelsen and Plum Organics acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions as
well as the negative impact of currency, organic net sales increased by 3%, primarily driven by gains in U.S. Simple
Meals. Organic sales also rose in our Global Baking and Snacking, Bolthouse and Foodservice and International
Simple Meals and Beverage segment while the U.S. Beverage sales decline for the quarter.
Adjusted EBIT increased 15% to $374 million, which includes a 3 point contribution from the Kelsen and Plum
acquisitions. The balance of the increase was driven by lower administrative expense, higher organic sales and lower
marketing expense, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76, a 19%
increase versus the prior year driven by the EBIT increase and also benefiting from a favorable tax rate.
Slide 24 shows the composition of the 6% sales growth. The organic sales increase of 3 points reflects 2 points of
favorable volume and mix and 2 points of growth from higher selling expense, partly offset by 1 point of increased
promotional spending. Unfavorable currency had a 2 point impact due to the Australian and Canadian dollars
weakening against the U.S. dollar.
The favorable volume mix is driven by our U.S. Simple Meals segment. The pricing gains were primarily related to the
list price increase on U.S. Condensed Soup and price increases on our Baking and Snacking segment. These increases
were partly offset by pricing declines in Mexico based on the new distribution model. The promotional spending
variance was primarily related to higher rates of spending in Global Baking and Snacking and in U.S. Simple Meals.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 140 basis points to 35.7%. The decline in gross margin was
primarily due to cost inflation, supply-chain related costs, including project expenses, weather-related costs, and higher
warehousing and transportation expense, and unfavorable mix, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher
selling prices. The rate increase in cost of goods sold was approximately 5% in the quarter, including 2 points to 3
points from inflation and the balance from the supply-chain costs that I cited above. This increase was partly offset by
productivity savings. The increase in the cost of goods sold rate for the year is now estimated at 3% to 4%, with
inflation and materials, energy and labor at around 2% to 3%, and our expectation for productivity gains remains at
approximately 3%.
Marketing and selling expense for the quarter decreased by $7 million to $268 million; the decrease was primarily due
to lower marketing overhead expense, lower advertising and consumer and promotional expenses, and reduced selling
expense of the negative impact of currency, partly offset by the addition of Kelsen and Plum Organics. Excluding
acquisitions, A&C for the quarter fell by 7% and is up 2% year-to-date, as we front-loaded marketing to support new
product launches.

Administrative expense decreased $21 million to $142 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation cost,
lower pension expense, and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives, partly offset by the impact of
acquisitions, which added approximately $7 million.
For the quarter, net interest expense decreased by $2 million to $29 million. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was
31%, a 170 basis point decrease versus the prior year; this was primarily due to lower taxes on foreign earnings in the
current quarter. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations increased 19% to $240 million. The share count was
unchanged versus the prior year.
Second quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on slide 27. Our U.S.
Simple Meals segment delivered $894 million in sales, including a $17 million contribution from the acquisition of
Plum. U.S. Simple Meals organic sales increased by 5% within the segment, U.S. Soup sales also increased by 5%,
benefiting from the movements in retailer inventory levels. As we reported with our Q1 results, retailers entered the
second quarter with lower inventories than prior-year. They exited the quarter with inventory somewhat higher than
prior year. Consumer takeaway in measured channels was down 1% for the quarter.
Excluding the impact of the Plum acquisition, U.S. Sauce sales increased by 8%. The increase was driven by gains in
Prego pasta sauce, including its new white sauces, the new Campbell's slow cooker sauce and Campbell skillet sauces.
Our Global Baking and Snacking segment delivered $639 million in sales, including a $92 million contribution from
Kelsen. Organic sales increased 2% versus the prior year with growth in Pepperidge Farm in Indonesia, partly offset by
declines in Arnott's in Australia. The sales gains in Pepperidge Farm reflected growth across fresh bakery and snacks.
In the bakery business; sandwich, bread, and rolls posted strong gains, even as Hostess Brands have been reintroduced
into the market.
Sales of stuffing also increased for the quarter, partially due to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Snacks
business had another quarter of growth with increases in Goldfish snack crackers, and Pepperidge Farm cookies, partly
offset by declines in adult cracker varieties. Sales at Arnott's decreased due to declines in Australia in both chocolate
and savory varieties, partly offset by strong growth in Indonesia.
Our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted a $359 million sales number, an increase of 2%. Sales rose 6%
at Bolthouse, driven by double-digit growth in Premium Refrigerated Beverages and Salad Dressings and single-digit
growth in the Carrot business. Sales declined in the North America Foodservice sub-segment, principally in soup. For
the first half, Bolthouse generated $392 million in sales.
International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $213 million in sales for the quarter. Organic sales increased by
1%. Sales gains in the Asia-Pacific region were partly offset by declines in Latin America. Sales in Canada were
comparable to a year ago, as is gains in snacks and soups were offset by declines in beverages. The sales decline in
Latin America was due to the lower selling price associated with the implementation of the new business model in
Mexico. Sales in Asia-Pacific increased due to gains in Malaysia and Japan.
U.S. Beverage sales declined by 3% to $176 million, the decrease in sales was driven by declines across the portfolio
primarily due to the impact of the transition to a new distribution network in single-serve immediate consumption
channels. In take-home channels we saw positive trends for V8 Red and for Splash beverages.
Operating earnings for the U.S. Simple Meals segment increased 12% to $214 million. Operating earnings increased
primarily due to productivity improvements, higher selling prices and lower marketing expense partly offset by cost
inflation and supply chain related costs.
Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 19% to $88 million. The increase was primarily driven
by the acquisition of Kelsen, higher selling prices and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation and
higher promotional spending. The operating expense increase reflected Kelsen's operating results and growth in
Pepperidge Farm, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott's. Kelsen's popularity during the holiday season in Asia
skews its profitability heavily to the second quarter.

Within International Simple Meals and Beverages, operating earnings were $38 million, an increase of 15%. The
increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher volume, lower selling and administrative cost, and
productivity improvements, partially offset by lower selling prices and the unfavorable impact of currency. Operating
earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice rose by 20% to $36 million, primarily due to reduced administrative
expense and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation.
For the first half, Bolthouse Farms generated $32 million in EBIT. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by
16% to $31 million. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily driven by cost of goods.
On slide 30, you can see U.S. Soup sales increased 5%, led by broth. As expected, the year's program timing and the
late Thanksgiving holiday had a very positive impact on second quarter sales. Sales of condensed soup increased 4%,
driven by double-digit gains in cooking varieties. Sales of eating varieties were comparable to the year-ago quarter.
Higher net pricing was partially offset by lower volumes.
Ready-to-serve soup sales were comparable to a year ago, as gains in Chunky and Homestyle canned soups were offset
by declines in microwavable soup varieties. Broth sales increased by 21%, driven by double-digit volume gains in
aseptic and canned broth. U.S. Soup sales for the first half decreased by 1%. The decrease was due to a 5% decline in
ready-to-serve soup and a 1% decrease in condensed soup. Broth increased by 10% for the half.
On slide 31, we look at the U.S. Wet Soup category for the 52 weeks ended January 26, 2014 and in our share
performance. The category as a whole rose 1.6%. Our sales in measured channels rose 1.9%, with gains driven by
ready-to-serve soup and broth. Condensed soup sales were comparable to the prior year. Campbell had a 59.4% market
share, an increase of 20 basis points for the year. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28% and private
label was at 13%. These figures were sourced from SymphonyIRI multi-outlet data and are based on dollar sales.
Our second quarter results represent a sharp improvement from the first quarter. Our position at the end of the first half
is entirely consistent with the guidance expectation we set when we reported the first quarter. For the first half, net sales
from continuing operations were $4.4 billion, a 2% increase from the prior year. These results include a four point
contribution from acquisitions, which consist of Plum Organics, Kelsen which was acquired on August 8, and one
additional week of results from Bolthouse Farms, which was acquired one week into the first quarter a year ago.
Excluding acquisitions and the negative impact of currency, organic net sales decreased by 1%, driven by declines in
U.S. Beverages and International Simple Meals and Beverages, partly offset by gains in Global Baking and Snacking.
Organic sales were comparable to the prior year in our U.S. Simple Meal and Bolthouse and Foodservice segments.
Adjusted EBIT decreased 5% to $711 million, primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage, lower organic sales,
and expenses related to the Plum Organics recall, partly offset by lower administrative expense. Adjusted earnings per
share were $1.42, a 4% decrease versus the prior year, driven by the EBIT decline partly offset by the lower adjusted
tax rate.
The composition of the 2% sales increase includes an organic sales decrease of one point, unfavorable currency of two
points, and an acquisition contribution of four points. The detail doesn't add because of rounding. Our adjusted gross
margin percentage declined by 180 basis points to 35.8%. The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to cost
inflation and supply chain related cost, the impact of acquisitions, and the Plum recall, partly offset by productivity
improvements.
Marketing and selling expenses increased $18 million to $529 million. The increase was primarily driven by the
addition of acquisitions and higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, partly offset by the impact of
currency and lower marketing overhead expense.
Administrative expenses decreased $28 million to $290 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation cost,
lower pension expense, and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives, partly offset by the impact of
acquisitions, which added about $10 million.
For the first half, net interest expense decreased by $5 million to $59 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower
average interest rates on our total debt portfolio and benefits from the proceeds from the sale of our European Simple

Meal business, partly offset by debt incurred to fund the Kelsen and Plum acquisitions.
The adjusted tax rate for the first half was 31.6%, a 70 basis point decrease versus the prior year, primarily due to lower
taxes on foreign earnings in 2014. This was partially offset by a favorable settlement of a state tax matter in 2013.
Adjusted earnings from continuing operations decreased by 4% to $449 million, and adjusted earnings per share from
continuing ops decreased to $1.42 for the first half.
Cash flow from operations was $363 million compared with $499 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily
due to taxes paid on the divestiture of the European Simple Meals business and lower cash earnings in fiscal 2014.
Capital expenditure of $127 million rose from $110 million a year ago. We're still expecting capital expenditures for
the year to be about $350 million.
As we previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to
reduce debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we will continue to repurchase shares sufficient to
offset dilution from equity compensation programs. Net debt has decreased by $107 million to $3.9 billion.
Results from the European Simple Meals business are reported as discontinued operations. The company completed the
divestiture of its European Simple Meals business to CVC Capital Partners on October 28. In the second quarter the
company recognized a net gain of $90 million after tax or $0.28 per share for the sale. For the first half, the net earnings
from discontinued operations were $81 million or $0.26 per share.
Campbell reiterated our annual guidance this morning. We expect continuing operations to grow sales by 4% to 5%,
adjusted EBIT by 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS by 2% to 4%. As a reminder, fiscal 2014 is comprised of 53 weeks, one
additional week compared to the prior year, the benefit of which is expected to be mostly offset by the impact of
currency translation. The contribution to sales from acquisitions is anticipated to be nearly $300 million. As we have
said before, in connection with the new business model in Mexico, reported sales and cost of products sold will be
reduced by approximately $35 million.
Interest expense is estimated at about $120 million for the year, and the tax rate is projected to be between 31% and
32%. EPS growth reflects the impact of a significant increase in the tax rate versus an unusually low rate for the last
year.

been having, or were there some other aspects to that that played into it?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Last year's weather contributed to the 5% growth, but we think it drove less than half of
those gains. We believe that our improved execution and more effective marketing and the introduction of new
products were the key drivers last year. This year, we were really satisfied with our holiday consumption, but January
we did get lifts on our promotion, but they weren't quite what we expected. And basically we have to do a better job in
the second half driving consumption.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: So you think the consumption on – or the lifts that weren't right where you wanted them, was
primarily just the weather we had more recently? Or when you say you didn't do a good enough, I'm trying to get a
sense of what didn't go as planned or where the improvements will come from?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. I mean, we've assessed the weather. It's neutral to us in this quarter. We definitely
acknowledge a benefit of cold temperatures, but we think it was offset by unfavorable weather disruptions. We had
plant closures for a while, retail store closures and some lost business in the Foodservice sector.

with you, best of luck.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Thank you. I will be at CAGNY.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, all right. Then I'll save the party until next week. I guess maybe kind of following up
on Andrew's question a bit. Just a couple of points around soup, one is, how do we judge like the broth sales being so
strong versus arguably the soup side of it, a bit weaker, and like how is it that one could be so strong and the other not
in the same type of environment? And then two, you brought forward new product soup sales from, I think what you
were going to introduce them next season into this season after the fiscal first quarter, and I find that to be kind of
unusual to the extent that the soup category shelf set et cetera are normally set quite early, and so I'm kind of wondering
how effective can new products be introduced in the heart of the season, when the retailers are kind of normally setting
it up way ahead of time?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay, I'll answer both. First of all on the broth business, we were very pleased with our
performance on broth, and we attribute it to a number of factors. First of all, starting with the consumer, we have seen
an increase in homemade soup behavior. I mean when people are making more soup at home and they're cooking more
with broth, which is great. We do think that that's partially driven by some of the innovation, we've brought to the broth
segment of the soup category with new flavor infused varieties. And we've also changed our advertising campaign to
really emphasize insights on why I cook. And we think the combination of all of those have really helped the business.
And as I said, we had a strong holiday. In regards to the new off-cycle products, our retailers are looking for growth,
and fortunately, we now have a pipeline with more products ready to go to market. So, we view this as positive because
we're doing something different and continuing to increase our new surrounding soup.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, folks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: So I wanted to ask some questions on the beverage side of your portfolio. I apologize if I
missed this in prepared remarks. But can you elaborate more on your new routes to market for immediate consumption
channels with V8? And also give us an update on the similar initiative that I think you have on Bolthouse to try to push
into those channels?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay. We have had for the last five-years, a contract with Coca-Cola for immediate
consumption distribution of V8, and that ended on December 31. Over the last year of that contract, we've continued to
work with Coke, and effective January 1, we were able to ship V8 products to a new network of distributors for
national distribution. In addition, we are now out working with predominantly convenient store customers to make sure
that we not only secure the V8 distribution that we had, but expand them. And we now have the benefit of going to
market with both V8 and Bolthouse Farms, which gives us in total, that just both, all retail channels about $1 billion of
healthy beverage business. So, we feel like we've got a great program going forward on immediate consumption. It is a
large part of other beverage company's sales and profits and it's a very small part of ours. So we see this as a really
great opportunity for us.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. Sticking on beverages, given your relationship with Green Mountain on the soup
initiative. I'm curious if you could comment on your intent to put either V8 or Bolthouse Farms into its new cold
beverage platform?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We continue to work with Green Mountain on the development of the new Fresh-Brewed
Soup K-Cup product and we do not have plans at this point for V8 or Bolthouse Farms execution.

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Look forward to seeing you at CAGNY. And just a quick question for you if I
could to understand the second quarter benefit you received from inventory. I really – what I'm trying to get to is, it
sounds like inventory levels need to come down a little bit in the second half of the year. So did you quantify or can
you quantify sort of the benefit to Q2? Or maybe, what you believe would have come out in the second half for the
year?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, the benefit to Q2, I would look at that as the difference between consumption, which
was down 1 and inventory which was up 5 less some of the low level that we entered the quarter with; it's hard to

quantify looking forward. Remember that inventories are moving in sort of a big bell curve through the season anyway.
So when we talk about inventory movement, we're talking about difference to prior year at the beginning and end of the
quarter, but they are always coming down in the second quarter and they will be coming down in the third quarter. It
depends on where we end. I think it's fair to say, we need to get good consumption and good execution in the third
quarter and get the inventory overhang that's out there consumed as we move through the quarter, and that's why I
mean we feel pretty good about that. As Denise referenced, we've got a lot of programming in the quarter and we're
looking forward to seeing that work for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi, thank you. I don't claim to be the best modeler in the world, but my SG&A modeling
has obviously gotten worse and worse here with Campbell, and I want to know if you could help me here. Your admin
costs are well below what I thought and they are well below a year ago. I know you've had some restructuring, but do
you think your admin costs are going to be down year-over-year? And then also, Craig, on the gross margin, I think last
quarter you said, you expected to be slightly higher versus year ago. You seem to be kind of angling at lower now.
How much of a headwind on gross margin should we expect for the year?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So, SG&A first. I think we would expect SG&A to be down versus prior year. We're
benefiting from the restructuring activities that we pursued. You'll continue to see benefit from that. You'll see benefit
from that in the second half. Pension cost is a positive for us this year. We've also, looks like we're headed for a little
bit lower incentive compensation cost. So all of those things will run favorably and look like they'll help us in the
second half too.
Gross margin has been negatively impacted in the first quarter – well actually really in the first half, but particularly in
the second quarter we've had – in the first quarter we had the Plum recall, and in the half, we've had some project
expense work that's fallen into cost of sales, maybe a little bit higher than what we originally anticipated. We've had
some weather related costs, the weather has been so severe, we actually had soup freeze in some of our transportation
and have to be destroyed and that sort of thing. So, we've had some kind of one-off impacts in cost of sales in the first
half.
As I look toward the second half, I'll try this again, I think our gross margin will be pretty similar to what it was last
year. But clearly, we won't recapture everything that we've lost in the first half.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: And consumer marketing, did your budget for that change at all? Are you going to be flat
this year, where are you going to be?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: For the full year, I would expect us...
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: We'll be a little bit below the sales growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, Bryan.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: First question, I just wanted to follow-up, I guess on Rob's question. If you kind of back the
envelope math, you need to grow operating – to get the low end of the guidance operating income has to grow by about
$90 million in the second half of the year. And just how much of that is sales dependent? And how much of it is going
to be, sort of more dependent upon some of the cost phasing and some of the lower cost in the second half? I'm just
trying to tease out sort of how much of the profit growth is really just purely sales dependent and how much is going to
be year-on-year comps or other programmatic savings?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yes, we looked at this...
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Go ahead, Anthony.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: ...pretty closely. And actually only a small part of it derived from the organic sales
growth, a big portion is in the G&A line related to the items that Craig just talked about. An also don't forget the 53rd
week has a significant impact in the fourth quarter as well.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Having said that as Denise said, I mean we do need better sales performance in the second half
than we had in the first half given the weak first quarter.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right. And we expect organic sales up 2% and 3% from acquisitions.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Don't forget that you've got a 53rd week and the acquisition contribution in the back half.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. But that optic of having such a big profit ramp in the back half doesn't look as
challenging as it does when you sort of factor in some of the cost comparisons or some of the other factors in the
second half.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Exactly. When you take it apart, it doesn't have to be driven by really extraordinary sales
results or anything.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Right. Okay. And then also just to follow up on Jason's question relative to the distribution
changeover at V8, has that started yet? And will there be any, do you expect to see any sort of impact on sales in terms
of just maybe pipeline fill, and subsequently have you seen any sort of change in inventories may be bled down? Just
trying to understand if there is any lumpiness in that, that we should expect going forward?

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. That has, it is an effect, effective January 1, and we did see wind down in sales to
Coke in the second quarter. We will be and are shipping now to the new distribution network. We believe that there
will be pipeline fill and increased sales over time. So, that's probably the best I can do at this point.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: The ramp-up probably won't be quite as dramatic because it's across a large number of
distributors, that will be coming on as we move through the quarter.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: In the distribution, the distributors, are they beverage distributors or are they sort of more
general merchandise distributors? Trying to understand who the – what the...

<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Good morning.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Diane.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Diane.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: I just wanted to add, a couple of your peers have talked about spending cuts under the SNAP
program and the headwind to sales. And I just was wondering do you have any way to quantify what the might mean
for Campbell across the pieces of your portfolio that are attractive to those consumers?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think it's very difficult for us to quantify. I would sort of put it into the larger basket of
consumer headwind issues that are out there. I mean, I think you have seen us and our peers under a lot of pressure to
get volume growth. You've seen the grocers under pressure to get volume growth. So, I think it's part of what's playing
in. I think it's really difficult to segregate out that specific impact.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. They're dealing with lower employment, higher payroll taxes, healthcare changes,
lower discretionary spending available on food, so the food stamps is part of all of that.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then just a follow-up on the beverage; coke
distribution. Was there anything in that contract that prevented you from having products in competing categories? I
guess, what I'm asking is now that you have a different distribution network, are there categories that would be
available for you to expand into that, perhaps before you weren't allowed in?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. At this point we're focused on expanding the beverage because that's a huge
opportunity for us.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: I probably think there weren't any contractual limitations?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: As we look ahead, the new distribution model does provide us some opportunities to
expand beyond the beverage category into some of our other simple meal categories as we push it into meaty
consumption channels.

because it's a chilled route to market for Bolthouse and at shelf-stable. Even though it's going into refrigerated spaces

Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Akshay.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about marketing in light of the lower spending that
you're expecting now. It's specific to Bolthouse. I know you spent some money on that brand, and I think that was the
first initiative behind that brand period. So can you just give us a sense, just an update on Bolthouse and what returns
you're seeing from these early investments you made? What does that imply for long-term growth trajectory of that
business? And then, if you could, just comment on which brands or categories are the ones where you're cutting the
marketing. That would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: In terms of Bolthouse Farms, recall, this is the first marketing effort that we've had on this
brand since it's been newly acquired. And the marketing largely met our expectations. We were actually very pleased
with the results. And we will continue to market that brand in the second half of this year and invest in it going
forward.
In terms of the other categories, we've been focusing our marketing largely at competitive levels on our core brands and
at ramped up levels on our new products, such as the Campbell's cooking sauces and Homestyle and Prego. The only
place I can tell you that we will course correct going forward is we believe we did not spend at the appropriate level on
condensed eating soup and we'll be course correcting that going forward.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: In terms of where the reductions are, I think beverages will be a little bit lower than our
original thinking there as we shift some of that probably to more trade related activity and as we continue to work our
way through some of the headwinds that we have seen in beverage and maybe a little bit lighter in Pepperidge. But
we're not going to be very different from the shape of our original expectation. It was always heavily front-loaded to
support the new product introductions and to do the first advertising around Bolthouse, and it was always intended to
taper back closer to the prior year or slightly below for the balance of the year.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: And just long-term implications of whatever you've learned from the advertising dollars
you spent on Bolthouse? Can you at least share what you learned from the marketing initiatives that you took on
Bolthouse? Thank you. I'll pass it on.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think it's probably a little early to give the full readout from that, but I would fully anticipate
that we will continue to be more active in terms of brand building around Bolthouse than they have been historically
there. We really think that's one of the opportunities that we have looking forward with the brand.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We'll take a note to make that part of our review at Analyst Day in July.

Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Your line is open.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Thank you and good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Dave.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: I want to go back on soup for just a minute, an important question here. We've done some
analysis on the multiyear trends. Third quarter of last year was absolutely a superstar quarter for consumption within
our Nielsen data, your results as well. So, Denise, how do you think about this expectation that second quarter
consumption underperforms, but yet the requirement is for third quarter to be a strong one, yet it faces singularly the
most difficult comparison that you've faced in quite a number of years.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We acknowledge the fact that we did have a very good third quarter last year. But we feel
as we look at our plans in the back half that they're robust, and we're doing some things over the top of what we did last
year to have a different outcome. So we have greater promotional frequency. We're launching eight new soups,
including our first Hispanic cooking soups. We're expanding pub-inspired Chunky soups, which are doing really, really
well. Some of those are in the top selling SKUs of all soup. And we're building more momentum on broth with a bigger
Easter program. So we believe that we have robust plans and we are planning on cycling quarter three and quarter four
with positive momentum on soup.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: I appreciate the answer. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: You're welcome, next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Hi. Can I ask about the outlook on the commodity cost side? There seem to be a lot of
moving pieces there. On the one hand, the grain envelope is down, which might help the Pepperidge Farm business. On
the other hand, we've got drought in California and meat pressures kicking in as well. As you look out to the second
half of the year, is the commodity outlook pretty benign at this point? Is that one of the reasons why the profit growth
should start to accelerate in the second half? Thank you.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yes, so in the second half, not much different on the commodity front, on the inflation rate
front. We will benefit from not having, as I described earlier, some of the one-off cost that we've had that have hit cost
of sales in the first half. But we're still looking for an inflation rate on inputs. And if you just narrow it down to
materials, it's more like 1% to 2%, 2.5%. Once you put labor and other overhead costs in it, it gets up to 2% to 3%. And
then in the first half we've been impacted with another point of unusual cost items, so not much impact in the second
half.
As we look forward to next year, you're right. The drought in California is probably going to have an impact on our
tomato and our processed tomato cost structure. Obviously, you're right about grains, a little bit relief for Pepperidge
going forward, but not much impact in the second half. As you know, we've got a commodity buying program that
keeps us out a little bit ahead of the curve, and we're pretty well locked in for the balance of this year.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning. You've owned Plum for three quarters now. What are your learnings on the
brand? And what I mean is, what do you know now about the consumer that you didn't know before about the new
channels that you got into with that brand? And is there anything, any overlap between Plum and Bolthouse because
they both cater more to millennials, probably that you can exploit?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's still early days of owning Plum. So far, despite the recall situation that we had, we are
continuing to see the brand grow in sales. However, we've been really focused on getting back into business on that
brand throughout our customer base before we start really expanding distribution and bringing out new products, which
will start to happen in the second half. So it's still early days, but we're very pleased with the brand and with the
business.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: So no learnings yet that you're willing to share?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, not yet, other than the fact that we studied the category before we made the
acquisition and we know it's a higher growth space which is very consistent with our strategy and it also is a very
popular brand with Millennials.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think one thing, it's a negative circumstance to have the recall, but one thing that we've seen
is that Plum consumers are very loyal to the brand. And I think they really appreciated the way that we have
communicated and handled that recall process. They've been very communicative through that process on social media
and that sort of thing, and it has proved, despite the negative starting point, to be a pretty good selection of brand
loyalty.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: They've showed us that through velocities too at stores where we are fully in-stock, so
that's an encouraging thing.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay, thanks.

<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Matthew.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Just two quick ones, since we're in overtime here. One, I just wanted to check in on
the Goldfish Puffs launch, just you know it's been very visible. It's had a lot of display, seems to be well promoted. So,
what can you tell us at this point about trial and incrementality to sort of the overall consumption on the brand?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Goldfish Puffs has been one of our better introductions and it's largely meeting our
expectations. Inclusive of new products, Goldfish was up 5%. So, Puffs certainly helped with – contribute to that sales
growth.

<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: It's been appealing to slightly older consumer, which we think is more incremental for us.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Targeted towards teens and that seems to be a good market for us beyond kids and it's
performing very well.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And are you at the point now where you have a view on repeat purchase or still
early?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Still early.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And then just quickly on the inventory. Just as we're thinking through the mix
implications going into next quarter is that more concentrated in ready-to-serve? Is it sort of broadly across soup or are
there other categories implicated?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I would say it weight more to the ready-to-serve category.

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, David.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: When you look back at that first half, and you think about the ROI on the innovation spend
that you had in the first quarter and advertising in that quarter and the promotion spending in the second quarter. How
are you reviewing that, as you're thinking about your tactics into the second half of the year? Will you pursue a similar
strategy or perhaps adjusting that somewhat?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Obviously, on the advertising, we definitely front-loaded the year, it was up 14% in the
first quarter, so that will not be repeated obviously. We expect a more normal ACT in the back half.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: If you think about innovation, against our dinner sauces, it's hard to think about that
over a quarter or even half. We're investing to create a new behavior and a category and a new shelf space. So, we're
investing pretty heavily to develop that market and we look at it more on a long-term ROIC basis.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I'm just asking because it seemed like you tried, I can appreciate the fact that you have, you
are pursuing something more incremental, something more that need a little bit more explaining in the first quarter
advertising spend. But it does feel like a lot of companies that have pursued more incremental with the advertising have
had disappointing returns on that. And so, I don't know, if that's just in general an indictment on the media spend in
general and how you're thinking about that, going forward.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think it's again really difficult we're still in the trial building phase. Well, on something like
dinner sauces, the purchase cycle is fairly long, so it does take some time and some investment. So again, I think it's
hard to respond to a quarter question.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: So, we're intentionally investment spending. I mean we know on these new product
introductions as you know you are not going to get the return in the quarter on the spending. So I think you have to
look at it over a little bit longer period of time and see how the trial and repeat build.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Thank you so much for taking the question. I believe on the last call you had mentioned
a possibility to refinance at least part of your August maturities. First, is that still the case? Second; if so, how are you
thinking about potentially adding change of control language to the future bond issuances and potentially retroactively
adding it in existing bonds? Thank you.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So, it's hard for me to see much advantage to adding it retroactively to bond issuances that are
out there. We'll consider it going forward, but I feel well, it's just too early to say. Anthony will give that some
consideration as we look forward to our future bond issuances.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping. Where should we
expect your debt reduction to be by the end of the year either absolutely or in terms of your leverage?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think if you look at the absolute numbers, one you take out the noise created by the European
divestiture and the purchases of Kelsen and Plum, it should be sort of a normal operating cash year for us. I mean we
tend to fall somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion of operating cash flow on an annual basis.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.

Our final question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Thanks for the question. Denise, sorry if I missed it. But did you quantify the impact of
the skillet and slow cooker sauces on the quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear that. Could you repeat that?
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Yes. Did you quantify the impact of the skillet and slow cooker sauces this quarter in the
sauces business?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We didn't, but we may be able to if I talk long enough. While we're looking, I'll give you
the replay. It's going to be available two hours after the call concludes. You'll dial 703-925-2533 and the passcode is
1630990, we'll have that up till February 28, was that long enough Anthony?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yes, it is. Dinner Sauces contributed about a point of sales growth to the U.S. Simple
Meals segment.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: One point. And then Denise, can you just walk through how you are seeing those aisle
merchandising programs developing at retail with your customers?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Are you talking about on the cooking sauces?
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Yes. Those are adding the square footage in the aisles.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Recall when we introduced skillet sauces last year, we had the situation where it was
merchandised in about five different places in the grocery store. So, we worked diligently this year for our customers to

place a section of cooking sauces in the store. And it varies where that is located, but typically it is sauce section or
even next to broth. But what it does is it gives worthy of space to ourselves and some of our competitors, but it gives
the consumer a destination to know where to shop for these kinds of products, and since we're building a platform,
that's been a strategic imperative.
