John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We earned a record earnings per share of $1.05 in the first
quarter, which was our 17th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. Wells Fargo's ability to grow consistently across a
variety of economic and interest rate environments demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model, and our
unwavering focus on our vision of meeting all of our customers' financial needs and helping them succeed financially.
Our financial results have strong capital generation. And returning more capital to our shareholders has remained a
priority. We're extremely pleased that our 2014 capital plan allows us to increase our common stock dividend by 17%,
subject to board approval of course, and also increase our common stock repurchases in 2014. We're proud of the fact
that we've been able to increase our dividends and share repurchases every year since 2011, while we have continued to
grow our capital levels.
Let me now highlight our growth during the quarter, compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.9 billion
and EPS of $1.05, both up 14% from a year ago. We had strong and broad-based loan growth, up $28 billion or 4%.
Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $594 million or 42% from a year ago,
and net charge-offs were only 41 basis points on average loans this quarter. Our outstanding deposit franchise
continued to generate strong growth with total deposits up $83.8 billion or 8%.
We deepened relationships across our company, achieving record retail banking cross-sell of 6.17 products per
household. Wholesale Banking increased cross-sell to 7.2 products, and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement cross-sell
was 10.42 products. We remain focused on reducing expenses with our efficiency ratio declining to 57.9%, down 40
basis points from a year ago. We increased our returns, growing return on assets by 8 basis points, to 1.57%, and return
on equity by 76 basis points, to 14.35%.
We continue to generate strong capital growth with our estimated common equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced
Approach, which was over 10%. Our results not only demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model, but
also the benefit of an improving economy. While economic growth during the first quarter was uneven, economic
activity improved later in the quarter, including national auto sales, which reached a seven-year high in March.
Employment also increased in March for the 42nd consecutive month, one of the longest periods of sustained growth
ever, and consumer confidence hit a six-year high. The housing recovery remained on track, and should benefit from
the spring buying season. I'm optimistic about future economic growth, because consumers and businesses have
continued to improve their financial conditions. Households have reduced their leverage to the lowest level since 2001
and the burden of their financial obligation is lower than at any time since the mid-1980s.
Also, businesses are well positioned to hire and invest with ample supplies of cash. As always, Wells Fargo is ready to
help all of our customers to meet their financial needs through our diversified product line and financial advice. I want
to conclude by highlighting the management changes we announced last week. Dave Hoyt, who has been with Wells
Fargo for over 32 years, is retiring in June.
Dave and his exceptional team of leaders have built our Wholesale Banking business, which is well positioned for
continued growth. Tim Sloan, who you all know has been an excellent financial and strategic leader for Wells Fargo,
and had previously spent 22 years in the Wholesale Banking group, is perfectly suited to continue Wholesale Banking's
commitment to serving customers as he becomes the Head of Wholesale Banking.

John Shrewsberry will join me as CFO on our earnings call next quarter, who has deep understanding of our financial
and business operations, as well as our shareholder expectations through his 20 years of proven leadership, including
heading Wells Fargo Securities with responsibility for investment banking, capital markets trading and investment
research businesses. John will be supported in his new role by a strong and talented finance team. These changes
demonstrate the deep bench of high caliber leaders at Wells Fargo, which I believe, is the best team in banking.
Tim will now provide more details on our first quarter. Tim?
Timothy J. Sloan
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplement starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions.
Wells Fargo earned a record $5.9 billion in the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter. Our record earnings per
share of $1.05 was also up 5% from last quarter. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth,
and our 12th consecutive quarter of record EPS, reflecting the benefit of our diversified business model.
As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth in the fundamental drivers
of our business. In commercial and consumer loans, deposits, cross-sell, credit, expense management which resulted in
growth in net income, capital, and earnings per share, and produced higher returns on assets and equity. I'll highlight
the drivers of our growth, which create long-term value for our shareholders throughout the call.
Page four highlights our revenue diversification, which is once again evenly split between net interest income and
non-interest income. The drivers of our fee income, however, can differ depending on the interest rate and economic
environment. For example, mortgage originations were 6% of our fee income this quarter, down from 23% a year ago
when the refinance market was strong. Other businesses such as equity investments, brokerage and mortgage servicing
contributed more to fee income this quarter, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model.
Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income
statement perspective, starting on page five. We had strong linked-quarter growth in both loans and deposits. We are
especially pleased with this performance since first quarter is generally a seasonally weaker quarter for growth. Loans
increased $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter, after increasing only $392 million on a linked-quarter basis a year ago.
Deposits grew by $15.4 billion, compared with $7.9 billion on a linked-quarter basis a year ago. The improving
economy and high-quality loan originations continued to benefit credit quality with net charge-offs declining to 41
basis points.
Turning to the income statement on page six, net interest income declined as we expected, reflecting the two fewer
days in the quarter and lower income from variable sources. Non-interest income increased in the quarter, reflecting
higher retail brokerage asset-based fees, mortgage servicing income, and market-sensitive revenue. This growth was
partially offset by seasonally lower deposit service charges and card fees, and lower mortgage production revenue.
Our expenses declined from the fourth quarter. While we had seasonally higher personnel expenses, we had lower
deferred compensation expense, salary expense, and revenue-based incentive compensation. Equipment, professional
services, and advertising expenses, all declined from elevated levels in the fourth quarter.
Our results this quarter included a $423 million discrete tax benefit, primarily from a reduction in the reserve for
uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior-period matters with state taxing authorities. This lowered our
income tax expense by $227 million compared with last quarter, and reduced our effective income tax rate to 27.9%.
Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail.
As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong loan growth in the first quarter, our 12th consecutive quarter of
year-over-year growth. Period-end loans were up $28 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our liquidating portfolio
continued to decline, down $12.8 billion from a year ago, and down $2.9 billion from the fourth quarter. Excluding our
liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $40.8 billion or 6% from a year ago, and was up $7 billion from the

fourth quarter.
On page eight, we highlight how broad-based our loan growth continued to be. C&I loans were up $12.7 billion or 7%
from a year ago, as we successfully grew loans in asset-backed finance, corporate banking, and government and
institutional banking. Foreign loans grew $7.2 billion or 18% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and
the UK CRE acquisition we completed in the third quarter.
Real estate, 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.2 billion, or 3% with growth in high-quality non-conforming
mortgages. Auto loans were up $5.3 billion or 11%, reflecting increased auto sales and record originations. Credit card
balances were up $1.9 billion or 8% with record new account growth. Deposit growth also remained strong in the first
quarter, with average deposits growing $91.1 billion or 9% from a year ago, and up $16.9 billion from the fourth
quarter.
This increase reflected solid growth across our businesses, particularly our consumer businesses, and an increase in
liquidity-related term deposits. Primary consumer checking customers were up 5.1% from a year ago, up from 4.7% in
the fourth quarter. We have steadily increased the growth rate of this higher cross-sell, more profitable customer base
over the past four quarters through product enhancements and consistent focus.
As shown on page 10, tax equivalent net interest income increased $157 million from a year ago, even though our net
interest margin declined 29 basis points, reflecting the benefit of lower funding costs. Net interest income declined
from the fourth quarter as expected, primarily from two fewer days in the quarter, and lower variable income.
Our net interest margin declined by 7 basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.2%, driven by three primary factors:
lower income from variable sources reflecting lower PCI resolutions reduced the NIM by 4 basis points; customer
driven deposit growth reduced the NIM by 2 basis points; and the liquidity actions that we took in the fourth quarter in
response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by 1 basis point.
While our deposit growth and liquidity actions reduced our NIM, they had minimal impact on net interest income. Like
last quarter, balance sheet repricing and growth did not impact the net interest margin this quarter. Growing net interest
income remains our focus, and we believe we should be able to grow net interest income throughout the remainder of
the year.
Non-interest income increased $148 million from the fourth quarter, with lower mortgage origination revenue offset by
stronger equity gains, mortgage servicing revenue, and brokerage fees. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income
declined $750 million, primarily reflecting lower mortgage banking results. Non-interest income, excluding mortgage
banking was up $534 million from a year ago, with growth across many of our businesses, including brokerage, trust
and investment management, credit and debit card, commercial real estate brokerage, and equity investments.
Our equity gains have steadily increased over the past year, reflecting good operating performance in our portfolio, and
the benefit of strong public and private equity markets. We've been in equity-related businesses for over 50 years. Like
the other businesses at Wells Fargo, these businesses, which are permitted under the Volcker Rule, have experienced
management teams that have produced strong results for decades.
Our equity gains this quarter reflected roughly the same number of transactions as last quarter, but our gains per
investment were higher, benefiting from positive market conditions. Our mortgage results in the first quarter reflected
the expected decline in origination volume. We originated $36 billion of mortgages, down $14 billion from the fourth
quarter. Our unclosed pipeline increased to $27 billion at the end of the quarter.
And we expect the normal seasonal benefit of a stronger purchase market in the second quarter to drive origination
growth. Our gain on sale margin was 1.61% in the first quarter, within the range of the margins we saw in the second
half of 2013. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results, with servicing revenue up $229 million
from the fourth quarter.
As shown on page 12, expenses were down $137 million from the fourth quarter, and down $452 million or 4% from a
year ago. We also improved our efficiency ratio to 57.9%. Our first quarter expenses included $440 million of
seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching, as well as $221 million in

annual equity rewards for retirement-eligible team members.
While we will not have these seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses
that will increase, including salary expense, reflecting day count, and the impact of our annual merit increases. And
certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter such as outside professional services and advertising
expenses are expected to increase in the second quarter.
We also plan to continue to invest in our businesses, and revenue-based incentive compensation expense could increase
as businesses grow. However, we expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the
second quarter.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 13, Community Banking earned $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up
31% from a year ago, and up 19% from the fourth quarter. Retail banking continued to grow cross-sell, achieving a
record of 6.17 products per household, up from 6.1 products a year ago.
While mobile banking continued to be our fastest growing channel with 12.5 million active mobile customers, up 23%
from a year ago, store traffic has remained strong with teller transactions stable from a year ago, despite decreases in
geographies that experienced severe winter weather during the quarter.
Our credit card business grew balances and fee income compared with the year ago, reflecting record new account
growth, up 6% from the first quarter of 2013. Purchase volume grew 14% from a year ago, and household penetration
increased to 38%, up from 34% a year ago. We continued to be the number one auto lender in the country with record
originations in the first quarter of $7.8 billion, up 15% from a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 15% from a year ago, and down 17% from the fourth
quarter. This decline was primarily driven by lower PCI resolutions in investment banking revenue, and seasonally
higher expenses. Wholesale Banking continued to generate strong loan growth, up 7% from a year ago, and up 2%
from the fourth quarter.
The linked-quarter growth was broad-based with corporate banking growing $2 billion from new loan growth and
higher utilization rates from our energy and large corporate and institutional customers. The asset-backed finance
portfolio increased $2 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher utilization rates on warehouse lines, and
the commercial real estate portfolio grew $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by higher utilization rates on
construction loans and new loan originations.
Credit quality remained exceptional with $59 million in net recoveries for the quarter. Wholesale Banking has had net
recoveries for five consecutive quarters, reflecting our conservative risk discipline and improving market conditions.
Cross-sell increased to a record 7.2 products per relationship, up from 6.8 products a year ago. Treasury Management
continued to be a key relationship-building product, with revenue up 4% from a year ago, driven by strong sales
growth, growth in commercial card volume, and pricing increases.
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $475 million in the first quarter, up 41% from a year ago, and down 3%
from the fourth quarter. We understand the importance of investing and saving for the future, which is why we are
focused on offering our customers sound guidance and advice. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $388
billion, up $63 billion or 19% from a year ago.
Revenues from advisory assets increased 25% from a year ago, and recurring revenues are now 80% of WBR revenues,
up from 74% a year ago. Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement also had strong loan growth with average loans up 14%
from a year ago, primarily driven by high-quality non-conforming mortgage loans.
Turning to page 16, credit quality continued to improve with first quarter losses down $138 million from the fourth
quarter, and net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only
1 basis point of average loans, and consumer losses declined to 75 basis points.
Non-performing assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters, and were down $840 million from the fourth
quarter. We had a $500 million reserve release in the quarter, and we continue to expect future reserve releases absent a

significant deterioration in the economy.
We also continue to focus on strong capital generation and believe the most important measure of our capital strength is
the estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III. Using the Advanced Approach fully phased-in, our ratio
grew to 10.04%, up 28 basis points from last quarter.
Although we repurchased 33.5 million common shares in the first quarter, the amount of shares outstanding at the end
of the quarter was up due to annual employee benefit plan issuances. As John mentioned at the beginning of our call,
our 2014 capital plan included an increase in share repurchase activity, compared with 2013 activity. And we expect
our share count to decline in the second quarter and throughout 2014 as a result of our anticipated share repurchases.
Also during the first quarter, our board approved an additional 350 million shares in our repurchase authority. Our 2014
capital plan also included a proposed dividend of $0.35 per share for the second quarter, subject to board approval, an
increase of 17% over the $0.30 per share we paid in the first quarter. At our last Investor Day in 2012, we provided a
target payout ratio of 50% to 65%. We look forward to revisiting this target at our next Investor Day on May 20th in
San Francisco.
In summary, our consistent EPS growth reflects the advantages of our diversified model. Our results in the first quarter
benefited from good loan growth and good deposit growth, improved credit quality, and lower expenses. Our capital
levels continued to grow while we returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We are optimistic that the continued improvement in the economy and the focus of our team members on meeting the
financial needs of our customers will continue to produce strong results.
We'll now open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Couple of questions. Morning. Hey. So a couple of questions; one, just on the LCR
[Liquidity Coverage Ratio], I know you mentioned that the LCR related bills hit NIM by $1 billion – 1 basis point, I'm
sorry, 1 basis point in the quarter. So just wanted to get a sense as to how far along you think you are, and how much
more you need to do to get to either 100% or whatever cushion you're going run over 100%?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. Betsy, that's a really good question. You saw us in the third quarter and fourth quarter
in particular make a number of decisions where we raised the liquidity in a number of ways to try to anticipate where
the domestic LCR would ultimately land. I think the problem that I've got in terms of – or a challenge we have in terms
of giving a specific answer to the question is we don't know what the final rules look like yet. But rest assured that we
think we have adequate liquidity to operate the company. And we don't anticipate whatever the final rules are, that it's
going to have a material impact on the company.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So don't be surprised if we have a couple more basis points coming out, but it's not
going to be much more than that. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I wouldn't necessarily equate it to net interest margin. Clearly, the impact of our liquidity
build this quarter was much less than in the fourth quarter in particular. But again, it's going be a function of what the
final rules look like. And those are in flux right now. But again, I don't believe it's going have a material impact on the
net income or the operations of the company.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Okay. And then just secondly on mortgage; the basic question is how are you thinking
about the go-forward from here? You did indicate that weather-related was tough in 1Q, and we have a seasonal pickup
with purchase activity in 2Q. But going into the year, I think the industry was thinking that mortgage originations
would be somewhere between $1.1 trillion and $1.3 trillion in terms trillions of dollars origination.
And you had some capacity in your mortgage origination business to potentially take some share in that environment.
Do you see that we're going be at materially lower levels of origination for the full year if you adjusted your expenses
for that? I've to say, I just saw you cut back in head count a little bit in the quarter. And maybe you could speak to what
the plans are for that over the next quarter or two quarters?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. I'll jump in, and then John may want to follow up. The first thing is that when you look
at our mortgage business, it was profitable, both on origination, and on servicing side, which we're very pleased with.
Mortgage is an important business for Wells Fargo. We've been in it for decades. We've been through cycles. Our
mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of a stronger selling season. You can see that we entered the
quarter with a slightly increased portfolio and pipeline, which we're very excited about.
But again, I would – when you look at the fund mental drivers of the mortgage business, and that is rates still
historically are very low, the affordability index is very attractive, and consumer debt is coming down, as well as
employment continues to increase. So we're optimistic. I don't know what the size of the market will be, but I know that
our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of opportunities. John, I don't know if you have anything to
add?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. I would just add a couple of things to that. We are optimistic; housing continues to
improve. I don't think we'll see the percentage increases in values this year that we saw last year, but we believe it to be
positive. I don't know if it's going to be in the 4% or 5%, which is kind of the consensus. But as I traveled around the
country, there's a lot of enthusiasm about housing. And just because the mortgage – who knows what the mortgage
market will be?
There's frankly a lot more cash buyers today to be honest about it. So – but housing is better, and a bigger share of our
originations today are purchase money, which is actually a healthy place to be. And when you think of the sales force,
the team that we have, and all the referrals coming out of our store channels and other places, this really plays to our
wheelhouse. So we're excited about it, and weather did have some impact but we're excited about the selling season.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: I guess I was just interested to see you had some job cuts in mortgage this first quarter...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, we're always challenging that...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: All right. So that's not an indication that you're – you were too optimistic going into the year.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No, no, no. We've always – we're adjusting – there's – it's a big business and we're always
looking at how to get more efficient of course, and making sure that'd be the right number of team members, but we are
ready for whatever comes in. And if it does that's not as good, we'll make adjustments. If it's better, we'll make
adjustments that way because that's – we've been nimble on our feet for decades in that business.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yep. Okay. Thanks.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thank you.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thanks so much for the clarity on the share count outlook. I will – I do want to pose a
question though on the 350 million share repurchase authority that I've been getting from investors. How should we
think about the catalyst that will drive the pace at which you use up this authority over the next few years?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So Erika, the way that I would describe it is that – and think about it, step back for a second;
we returned $11.4 billion to our shareholders last year. We are going to return more than that this year. In terms of the
specifics of how that's going play out on any given day, in a month, or within a quarter, we don't have a specific plan in
place that we're going to execute. But we would tell you that we think our shares are on sale every day, and we are
going to repurchase more shares this year than we did last year. And you're going to see that share count go down in the
second quarter, in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. And...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And the reason we can do that's because the earnings of the company; just think about it. And
that's the fundamental driver here.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: And so as a follow-up to that, you're clearly an earnings machine and you have plenty of
excess capital any way you measure it. I'm wondering, John, how are you – so could you update us on how you're
thinking about what potential acquisition opportunities there could be in terms of helping enhance particularly some of
your fee businesses?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. We don't need to do anything. And that's the beauty here, but we're always looking at
things in an opportunistic way. The biggest capital required acquisitions or the ones that use the most capital are deposit
businesses. We are of course at a level now where we're ready at the cap, we're over it. So what – the things that we
look at are, is there a way to enhance Wealth, Brokerage, Retirement? Possibly.
And that would be interesting to us. Portfolio purchases; we announced something with Dillard's recently. So these are
the kind of things that we like doing. We like the card business; what we're doing, and if there can be an add here or
there, so I would think of it as bolt-on businesses and not think of it in the way of transformational. But again, if we
don't do anything, that's just – that's also fine.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. Thank you for answering my questions.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you, Erika.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Couple of quick questions, Tim, one or two nitpicks on net interest income. How
much did the day count hurt NII dollars in the first quarter? And then, when you say that you think you can grow net
interest income for the rest of the year, I assume you mean kind of starting from the 1Q starting point. Is that a good
way to read what your comment was there?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. John, that's correct. So from the first quarter starting point, we believe that we're going
to grow net interest income throughout the year, similar to what we did last year. The impact of a couple of days was
somewhere in the $120 million to $130 million range.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: A quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then, in terms of investing cash with rates coming down this quarter, it
doesn't look like you did too much deployment this quarter. Could you just comment on that? There was some
movement in the held to maturity investments. It looked like they went up, but can you just kind of comment on what
happened this quarter on cash deployment?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. I mean, the good news is that the first call on cash deployment is always for loan
growth, and you saw good loan growth year-over-year, and on a sequential quarter basis, so we're very excited about
that. But you're right; rates have been pretty volatile this quarter. There've been times during the quarter when they
were more attractive from our perspective, and we did accelerate some of our investments.
Most of the purchases that we made in the quarter, which were about $13 billion on a gross basis were in at the held to
maturity category. And we specifically purchased some more treasuries. Every quarter has a little bit different
complexion. You've seen us be more aggressive, and you saw us be more aggressive, for example, in the third quarter
and the fourth quarter of last year. We will continue to invest our excess liquidity in a very appropriate way. But you're
right; rates are a little bit lower than we find attractive today.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then, on the volatile sources, is there a – like where are we on this quarter?
Is there a multi-quarter average or normal-ish that you could compare with those volatile sources, kind of below
averages this quarter? Is there any way to contextualize that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, the variable income, particularly related to PCI resolutions was, I would say, above
average in the fourth quarter. This quarter, if there is such an average for a volatile item, which, it was hard to [ph]
work with (35:06) to be honest, is a little bit of a challenge. But I would say this quarter is a little bit more typical than
what we've seen. Now there are other items in the variable category like loan fees and resolutions and things like that.
But the fourth quarter was just a little bit higher. And this feels a little bit more typical.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then could we have any comment on where you are in preparations for the
OLA [Orderly Liquidation Authority]? I know the rules aren't finished yet. But is there any quantification of available
billing resources or what level of potential requirement you might be preparing for to help us think on how far along
you are?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. Again, it's similar to the LCR question, and that is we don't know what the final rules
look like yet. I mean, we're hearing the same things that you probably are that it's going to be based on the required
level of Tier 1 common equity here in the U.S., and then some sort of metric that is going to be reflective of risk in the
underlying companies. I mean, the good news is that our business model is a little bit less risky than others.
And that, I think, should benefit us. Based upon what we're hearing, we don't anticipate any significant changes in the
level of our long-term debt. But having said that, I don't know what the final rules are going to be. My understanding is
that they could be released sometime this quarter, could be next quarter. We'll adjust. I wouldn't anticipate it having a
material impact on the operations of the company.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then the last thing from me; just on reserve releases, could you give us
underneath the service, what's driving the reserve release in terms of category? I assume there's not much that you're
releasing out of the commercial book anymore. Is it really – to the extent you've seen further reserve releases, is it
coming out of mortgage and home equity?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I would say, John, it's predominantly but not completely consumer-driven. You've seen – and
it's just a reflection of the fact that the underlying credit quality of the company continues to improve. I mean, think
about the quality of the loans that we've originated, post-crisis, the loan losses, credit quality are very, very good. And
so our expectation is that while our loan loss reserve release was down this quarter from the prior quarter and from the
prior quarter before that, we do anticipate future releases, but it's primarily consumer-driven.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thanks, John.

Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. You had alluded to, Tim, before, the idea of kind of bolt-on type
acquisitions. Is there like a maximum size that you would think about in portfolio acquisitions? And if it's what used to
be thought of as a kind of specialty finance business but has perhaps like Internet based deposits, does that qualify as a
bank? Does that restrict you? I mean, how do you think about those two questions as it relates to the acquisition
possibilities?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. Moshe, I don't think there'd be any difference in how we would view Internet based
deposits versus more traditional deposits. Deposits are going to be viewed as deposits.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And as John mentioned, they're just – it's not a business that we can buy. Clearly, we have
adequate capital to run our business and excess capital, which we primarily want to return to our shareholders. So we
have the capacity to do a relatively large acquisition. However, our focus is going to continue to be on running the
business. As John said, we don't really need to do an acquisition to continue to grow.
If you look at some of the sizes of the acquisitions that we've done over the last few years, the largest have been
portfolio acquisitions. And I think the largest was $4 billion, $4.5 billion. So we can clearly do something of that size
and really not miss a beat. Could we do something a little bit larger than that? Sure, we could. But as you know, we're
pretty discriminating in terms of what we want to acquire. So I wouldn't anticipate us making any big splash in the near
future.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, let me just make sure we're all on the same page here. Tim's absolutely right. Our best
opportunity to increase shareholder value is run our existing businesses even better. We have huge opportunity. We
have this diversified business model, this culture. We – 97% of revenues are here in the U.S. It's still a very fragmented
market. This is where the opportunity is, and we don't need to do anything. If we do, it would be clearly accretive and it
would look opportunistic to you and to us. But I just – our focus is on running the business.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. And one of the things on the mortgage side, the trade press has had a lot about this
that basically a lot of the origination growth has come in the non-banks. I mean, could you talk a little about your
strategies to sort of – from a market share standpoint, given that there's been this kind of growth coming from outside
of traditional banking industry?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I think that's a fair point. We're not overly concerned about that, though obviously
we've got to be cognizant of our competition. And the reason for that is we have the best distribution in the entire
market. We have number one market share. We have a very experienced team. We've got over 6,200 stores, retail
locations, plus additional mortgage offices. And I don't think anybody's better positioned to take advantage of the
business. And we view it as a core business. We are growing this business and we want to continue to grow the
business. We're not concerned about that. So we're going to have competition. We have non-bank competition in every
one of our businesses. John, I don't know if you want...?

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. Half of the U.S. population and half of the businesses in America reside within two
miles of one of our stores. Just think of that. And while people, a lot of times join us online, they pick the location –
they pick the provider that they're familiar with or that's close by them, because they still use the store, even for the
millenials who are very technologically advanced and savvy. So this is really a very important part of what we're doing.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So we don't – and we don't focus necessarily just on share for share's sake. We focus on
adding value and meeting the needs of our customers.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Just one last kind of nitpicky question; if you look at the yield on the loan
portfolio, your kind of commercial and commercial mortgage loans, just about $300 billion, had some pretty sizable
drops in the yield. Was that part of the restatement? Was that a PCI thing, or was there something else going on there?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: That was mostly related to the decline in the PCI resolution, Moshe.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it.

Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Joe.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: I just wondered if perhaps you could give us any more clarity on kind of the relative change in
the mortgage related production expenses quarter-to-quarter or sequentially, just based on the cutbacks you announced
in the back half of last year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, they were down and I wouldn't – I mean, the way that I would think about it, Joe, is
that we've been responding to the decline in the refinance activity, and we started to do that in the summer and
throughout the fall and through the winter. We think we're appropriately staffed right now to take advantage of the
spring selling season.
And so there'll be a little bit of a reduction in terms of the base level of expense, because of the changes that – or the
decisions that we made in the first quarter in terms of the number of people when you think about the second quarter.
But we're hopeful, candidly, that the expenses rise in the mortgage business in the second quarter, because that's going
to be reflective of the fact that revenue – or that originations are up, and there would be more incentive-based
compensation.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay. That makes sense. I guess beyond that, the other question would be just beyond
mortgage. Do you see weather having any factor in your loan growth trends this quarter? And I guess maybe another
way of looking at it is how did the pipeline look at quarter end relative to three months ago? Or how do you see loan
growth kind of progressing through the year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Loan growth in general or in mortgage, Joe?
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Yes. Yeah. No, beyond mortgage, the other categories.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: The pipelines look good. I think – we were really pleased. I mean a $4 billion plus growth on
a net basis and $7 billion in the first quarter; that's a really good first quarter, number one, just an absolute number. The
other thing that was exciting from our perspective is how broad-based it was. It wasn't just in any one specific business.
It was in our commercial and wholesale businesses. It was in many of our consumer lending businesses and it was in
the relationships we have in the Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement business, so it's very broad-based. So we're
optimistic about continued loan growth. I don't know what the number's going to be, but none of our businesses are
saying that they don't think they can grow loans for the rest of the year.

Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning, John and Tim.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning. How are you guys doing?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: First, Tim, good luck in the new role. And if Dave is listening, congratulations on his
pending retirement. I'm pretty jealous of that. Tim, I wanted to ask you a quick question on – actually two quick
questions. On the gross servicing on the mortgage side on slide – or on page, I guess, 39 of the release; before hedging
and before any fair value adjustments, you had a pretty good increase, about a 15% increase in the kind of gross
servicing income from fourth quarter to first quarter. What would drive such a big increase despite the fact that
portfolio is roughly the same size? Does the lower expenses on foreclosures impact that gross servicing income?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, a fair point. I mean, when you look at that page, you see that we originated – our
servicing fees were over $1 billion, which was terrific. Now you can look back and see that phenomenon in the second
quarter of last year too. But it is primarily driven by the point you just made, Chris, and that is that the quality of the
portfolio is better, and that's a good thing. But it's primarily a lack of late charges and special servicing fees and the
like.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. And just a unrelated question and just kind of backing in on the reserve, you're
releasing about 10 – well, I don't say releasing, but the reserve ratio has been going down about 10 basis points plus or
minus for the last couple quarters, per quarter. At that rate, if that were to continue, you'd be at a reserve ratio to loans
of, in the 130, 135 range by the end of the year. Is that something that you're comfortable going to in an environment
that we're in right now, in terms of the regulatory environment?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Chris, candidly, I didn't know that – I didn't appreciate the math that you just described that
it's been about 10 basis points a quarter. If it has been, it's been accidental more than anything. It's really a function of
the improvement – the underlying improvement in the portfolio. I think that that ratio will continue to improve. I don't
know where – we don't know where it's going to land. It's going to be a function of the portfolio – the performance of
the portfolio, but it's definitely going to go down.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: I was wondering if I could ask about the Basel III capital. And over the past couple of quarters,
it's just grown faster than a simple model of earnings less dividend, less buybacks, and linking RWA growth with asset
growth would imply. Is that something – what's been the main drivers of that? And as we look forward, should the – do
you think the Basel III ratio continues to grow faster than that kind of simplistic view would imply? Or is it going to
converge with the normal earnings growth rate?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Brian, it's a good question. And the whole topic is a little bit complicated, primarily
because we've had a number of rule changes and rule interpretations by the entire industry, number one. We – if you
recall in the third quarter, we did reduce our RWA, and we called out some specific items in the third quarter to reduce
our risk-weighted assets.
But I think the trend in terms of being different than just the basic math that you just described; it's more likely that it's
going be closer to the basic math that you just described than not. And candidly, it'll continue to be a function of the
underlying risk within the portfolio. I mean that is the primary driver. If we can continue to improve credit quality,
continue to improve market risk, continue to improve operational risk, those will be the big drivers, because that's what
the new methodology is based upon.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Appreciate that. And on the LCR, I know the rules aren't finalized, so all this is kind of
prospective as opposed to anything you'd be doing now. But I guess at a very simplistic level, it seems to kind of raise
the value of retail deposits and lower the value of commercial deposits kind of relative to each other, just because the
retail deposit run-off assumptions are so much lower. How big a deal is that? Is that something that just hit the margin?
Maybe you futz with the mix of commercial deposits or something, or as currently written, is that a bigger deal that
actually kind of shifts the focus of industry deposit gathering?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I don't think it would – it's going to fundamentally shift how we think about gathering
deposits. And John, you may have a different view, but any time we can bring in and broaden a relationship with one of
our retail or commercial customers, we want to do that. We want their deposits in. What we don't like are wholesale
deposits in the more traditional defined sense or hot money, things like that.
That's just not the – we're looking for long-term relationships. But even in the most extreme interpretation of the new
rules, we still want to grow our commercial deposits. And again, that's because we have such a large deposit base, we're
not overly concerned about the impact in terms of how it affects the LCR. But we'll know what the rules look like and
the impact, I'm sure, later this year.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Brian, Tim is absolutely right. We just love deposits when they are part of a primary
relationship. And we liked them at times when some were asking us, why are you growing deposits because you can't
utilize them? And we said it's good for long-term shareholder value. We have a fixed infrastructure. And the more
customers we can serve with that fixed infrastructure, magic happens; not always every quarter. And sure, we're all
looking for earnings assets, but I'll take all the deposits we can get that are part of a primary relationship, and we
cross-sell off that. And it's a major driver in customer loyalty. So it's a big emphasis here for us.

Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Ken.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Ken.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hey, guys. How are you doing?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: I just wanted to follow-up on the deposit side question. So – with you guys sounding pretty
confident about the loan pipeline, we're also continuing to see a very strong amount of deposit growth from you guys,
as well as in the industry. And I'm just wondering are there any undercurrents where you are at least starting to see
customers use deposits to fund their businesses? Or do you think we're just into a new regime where it's all just about
building a relationship and continuing to see deposits grow while loans grow? But I guess the question is what's
different, if anything, as far as how you're seeing loan pipelines grow versus deposit growth continuing?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Let me take a shot at that. You're right. What you typically see, Ken, is when loans start to
grow, the people – customers tend to use their own cash first. So there's some of that going on. But there's a lot of
liquidity in the system. People are saving more. Americans save more now than they did in the last decade or two
decades.
And frankly, our delivery – the health of our retail delivery system – when I say the health, I mean the online and the
stores and the ATMs and the mobile and phone, all of it working together as an omni-channel is a very compelling
value proposition for businesses and consumers. And we're getting a disproportionate share. So that is – and we just
love that. So – and I'd also say this; our deposit franchise is probably undervalued today, given the – where absolute
rates are. And that'll change over time.
The other thing that's happened is we probably have a better set of competitors today than we've had – more rational
competitors as in the past. So it's a combination of a lot of things. And we're expecting to continue to see strong growth.
I mean, when I look back at five years ago, when we merged with Wachovia, if you'd exclude CDs, we were – we had
about $650 billion of deposits. Today, if you exclude CDs, we're at about $1.05 trillion. We grew $400 billion in five
years.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Yep. Great. My second question, just IB was soft as it was for the industry on a
quarter-to-quarter basis, and some of that is seasonal. But I just wanted to get your comments on your thoughts about
market share opportunities and where you think the kind of IB pipeline looks from here?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We continue to be optimistic about the growth in our investment banking business. And the
reason for that is that most of the business that we're doing in investment banking is with existing Wells Fargo
customers who already have a relationship across the board. And so because we haven't penetrated that – those
customers as much as we'd like, we still think that there's a lot of opportunity there.
The share – market share is a result of focusing on customers and clients as opposed to trying to get to a specific market
share number. But you're right. We understand that that business can be a little bit volatile. We were down a bit this
quarter. And hopefully we'll be up in the second quarter and the third quarter. But as long as we focus on our clients
and on the overall relationship, particularly those that are already, we've got a good chance to continue to grow the
business.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then my last quick one is just, you mentioned the discrete tax benefit in the first
quarter. Can you just clarify what your expectation is for the tax rate for the rest of the year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. The expectation is it's likely the tax rate's going to go up. I'd love to be able to tell you
that we could have that kind of tax benefit every quarter, but I sure wouldn't plan on it. I think it's more likely that the

we're looking forward to growing revenues and growing income over time. But I think it's more likely that that tax
rate's going to be in the low 30%s.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Mike.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So Tim, I'm looking at this and thinking what are you leaving your successor? 17 quarters in a
row of higher EPS; and that's tough to continue. And I know I've been asking this several quarters, but if you take out, I
estimate, $0.07 benefit due to the lower tax rate, that's a trend that's going to maybe be tough to continue. I don't know,
what's your thought about that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Mike, I'd love to take credit for 17 quarters of consecutive earnings growth but there's
another 264,999 people around here that really get the credit for it. And it's not about what we do every quarter.
Obviously, we're very proud of not only the last 17 quarters, but the last five years where we've grown our earnings on
a compounded rate of 16%. So the trend has gone on for a long period of time. But every quarter's a little bit different.
And the second quarter's going to have a different complexion than the first and the fourth and the third of last year.
But we continue to be optimistic, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: But I asked it a little bit differently; revenues are down 3% year-over-year, and it's good.
Expenses are down 4% and that's helped efficiency improve from close to 59% down to 58%, but that's still in the high
end of your target of 55% to 59%. So did you guys not get as much in savings as you would've liked or is that a future
opportunity?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We continue to – our goal of improving the efficiency of the company, we provided a range
of 55% to 59% a couple of years ago. And we haven't gotten to the 55% level. That's clearly a goal that we'd like to
achieve some time. We think the improvement that we've made year-over-year on a sequential quarter basis to get back
to 57.9% has been very good. But I'm hopeful that the primary reason that the dollar expenses could continue to grow
in the company is because revenue's going to grow. That's a good thing. And that's why we focus on efficiency. So
there's still a lot of opportunity in terms of becoming more efficient at Wells Fargo. We're not done yet.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: On the expense side can you just elaborate on a few of the key initiatives that might move that
efficiency ratio to the lower end of the range.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. There's not really any one key efficiency project, Mike. We're a large company. We
have lots of different businesses and each business is focused on improving efficiency. But, for example, I mean, we're
focused on the amount of space that we have. We've done a great job in terms of reducing the amount of square footage
we have in the company.
But the fact of the matter is our people, our team members are working differently than they did 10 years ago and five
years ago. They're spending more time with customers and less time in the office. So we have an opportunity to reduce
our occupancy costs and reduce our square footage over time. That would be an example.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Mike, something else you could think about is that we still have a number of loss mitigation
folks as we're still working with elevated foreclosure and those kinds of issues, but on the other hand then we're
investing more in operational risk and compliance and those sort of things. So you're right. We're at the higher end of
that range – or but on the other hand, as you know that's a ratio. It's a numerator, expenses divided by revenue.
And we have seen revenue because of interest rates on the margin – the margin revenues while we've been able to grow
NII, it's – those numbers are not at – the margin's not at an all-time high. So as that improves that'll also give you some
lift, but whatever we do here, we will be very careful about what we spend money on, but never at the expense of the
long-term. And – but we're focused on it. And it's a good point you bring up.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And that's why I brought up revenues are down year-over-year and you're still at the high end of
the efficiency range. But I guess we'll hear more about that at the investor conference.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, actually, I think that's actually a good thing. Think of revenue's down and we actually
improved the efficiency ratio. So, I mean, so we are – but there is opportunity, and yeah you're right, we will talk more
about that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then if you can just elaborate on the management changes, John, I mean – I guess you're
gearing for the next generation. How much longer do you plan to stay around? And who would be in the pool of
potential successors?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, I'm glad you asked that. I was going to give you that information. I'm 60. I know you
think I look a lot younger and I – but I plan to stay here as the board is okay with that, and they want me through my
65th birthday. And we've got great people here. We have a terrific team of leaders. And you know some of them. I wish
you could know more.
For those of you who come to our investor conference next month, you'll get to meet more of them. Please come. That's
one of the reasons we'd love to show you more of them. But this is a great team. And I couldn't be more confident. In
fact, I think it's the best team in the industry. And one thing, even though – and Dave has been such a great leader, even
with his leaving, the average tenure of my 10 direct reports is still around 28 years with this company.

<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you provide the estimated leverage ratio under the new rules
that came out last week or earlier this week?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Matt, we didn't. And we're still working through that calculation, but just assume that at the
parent company level, we're comfortably above 7%, so it's really not an issue for us.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And that leads me to my next question, if we look at the three banks that are bigger
than you, I think when you kind of put together all the new requirements out there for capital and liquidity, it's a bit
more onerous for them than it is for you. And I'm just wondering like, are you actually seeing them pull back in certain
areas that you now feel like you can compete in? And has that changed since I guess last June when we first got the
current proposals for the SLR [Supplementary Leverage Ratio]?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Matt, I wish that was the case. The business is very competitive across the board today and
we expect that all of our competitors are going to adjust to whatever the new rules are. We candidly been doing that
since 2009. But it's a competitive market out there and hopefully for whatever reason we can continue to grow.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly, a number of kind of lumpy either revenue items or the tax gain,
anything on the expense side besides a seasonal increase in costs that you'd want to point out like litigation costs or
anything else lumpy that we should be thinking about?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, no. Not beyond the seasonal items in the first quarter. But again, I want to emphasize
that you should expect some increases in other line items within expenses in the second quarter that I called out. But
nothing in the quarter that was lumpy from an expense standpoint, other than the seasonal compensation related items.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And I guess on that expense outlook when you piece together the decline in some of
the seasonal benefits and increases elsewhere, if we just kind of hold revenue flat quarter to quarter through expenses,
stay flat or go up or down or what's the net of all those items?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, you know what, Matt, we'll know for sure in about 90 days and I just don't know what
exact dollar expenses will be. But one of the reasons why we – why I called out some of the categories is reducing
some of those categories are going to rise relative to their first quarter numbers. But again, a lot of our expenses are
driven off revenue and if – you know what, if revenues are higher in the second quarter and that's the reason that
expenses are up, I think we'll all be very, very happy.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, I don't think any of us look to the future and say let's hold revenues flat.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No.

Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks. I want to talk a little bit about the macro hedge on the mortgage side. The
servicing profitability has actually tripled since the last year, going from $300 million to about $900 million per
quarter. That represents more than half of the mortgage banking income. So I just wanted to kind of talk about and get
your feelings on further improvements in that as we move forward, and just had a few precise questions about maybe
some items that could help there as well?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Marty, you're absolutely correct that the – our servicing income is up significantly over
the past few years – or the past few quarters, as you can see. The drivers are primarily the fact that the underlying
quality of the portfolio continues to improve. So we – there's less adjustments that we need to take to devalue for things
like foreclosure cost, to make any changes related to the consent order or servicing settlement, and so on and so forth.
And in terms of the hedge, I mean I wouldn't think about it as kind of a macro hedge. It's a very complicated set of
hedging activities that we need to do.
We've got a large group of people that does it. They're very experienced. But as we talked about in the past, I mean
we're not trying to make any sort of macro bets from an interest rate standpoint or in terms of a market standpoint.
We're just trying to generate a predictable set of earnings from an underlying business that we like a lot. It was very

beneficial when we went through the refinancing boom, and we believe, can continue to provide good earnings. You're
absolutely correct that it's a larger portion of earnings than maybe the origination side, but my guess is that's going
change from quarter to quarter, depending upon origination volume.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And when I meant macro hedge, I meant more originations versus servicing. Not the
hedging of the...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Oh, sure...
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Service portfolio...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right. But again, I think sometimes folks think that somehow the
servicing business is a natural hedge to origination volume. And given the – what we've seen over the last year or so,
given the size of the refinance opportunity, we can see that that really wasn't the case.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And to some [ph] point (01:07:07), but not completely.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Correct.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: When you look at the prepayment speeds not really accelerating with refinance not really
coming off the floor, you still wrote down the MSRs about $400 million this quarter. I know rates came back in, but
really cash flows are what matter more than just the rates. The rate's a proxy. But if you don't get a significant increase
in prepayment speeds, there really shouldn't be further write downs in the portfolio at this point. So I was just curious
what you thought, or what was driving that write down this quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, you're absolutely correct that rates are a driver. And we've seen a lot of volatility in
rates for certain. But again, rates are the primary driver, also just underlying prepayment speeds that we're seeing for
other reasons in terms of how quickly folks are selling their homes and moving elsewhere. But our best guess is if –
that we could continue to see some benefit from the servicing portfolio.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then on – lastly, the provision for unfunded commitments jumped up this quarter
about $250 million. Is that something we should see at the same level? Or is that something you made a little
adjustment on this quarter that might fall back as you move forward?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, it's reflection of the fact that our loan commitments grew, which is a good thing. But
also we just adjusted some of our estimates, and I wouldn't anticipate that that would repeat itself on a quarterly basis.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: All right. Thanks.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Nancy
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: How are you?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: A question for you that I think John McDonald asked the question about the release in loan
loss reserves. Then I would sort of ask for additional detail on that. How much of this release was enabled by the
reserves you've built after the Wachovia deal? In other words, how much or how many of these reserves are related to

better credit quality at Wachovia than you had anticipated?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You know what? I don't have the percentage off the top of my head, Nancy. I think what you
saw is that we continued to build reserves throughout 2009. And I'm trying to remember what quarter we stopped
building reserves. I thought it was through most of 2009. But I would say it's a reflection of clearly improved credit
quality in the underlying portfolio that we inherited from Wachovia, as well as the Wells portfolio. But I don't know
what the percentage is, just related to that because today, it's really all mixed. We don't really think about it that way.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, but Nancy, you are right to this extent that Wachovia portfolio turned out to be better
than we had thought. And if you just look at how much we've moved from, on the PCI side, into the accretable from the
non-accretable. And we especially did a lot better on the Pick-A-Pay. We just had a terrific team that attacked that early
on. But credit turned out – I think partly because of things that we did, it turned out to be quite a lot better.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: But Nancy, again, just to reinforce John's last comment, and I should've mentioned it; most
of the improvement that we saw in the Wachovia portfolio was really in the – what you see in PCI and the detail we
provide there, as opposed to in the loan loss reserves.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Secondly, this is sort of a tangential credit quality question, and has to do with Dave
Hoyt's decision to retire. Number one, Tim, congratulations...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: But with the admonition that timing is everything in life. And secondly, Dave Hoyt was the
best in the industry at two things; number one, not answering a question. He was expert at that. But number two, just
foreseeing credit quality trends way in advance. And I have had the question from others, and I'm a little bit concerned
that Dave is sort of looking out into the future here, and seeing that commercial credit quality is about as good as it's
going to get. Could you just comment on that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, Nancy, I worked for Dave for about 20 years, and he absolutely was a terrific judge of
credit quality. I think if Dave was on the phone, he'd also say that there were hundreds, if not thousands of people that
were behind him in Wholesale Banking that helped in that. And so there's no question that Dave's retirement is
something that we weren't looking forward to. But we have a great team here, and I don't – I would not read into his
retirement as him saying from here on in credit quality is going to significantly deteriorate at Wells Fargo.
In fact, I think it's more likely that it's going to continue to improve. Now, the likelihood in the commercial portfolio
that we're going to continue to have quarters of recovery as opposed to loan losses; I mean that's just – that's not going
to happen forever. But the fact of the matter is that culture really matters. And the culture that we have in the Wholesale
Banking group in terms of making good credit decisions is going to continue on, because that's what Dave was very
good at instilling in thousands of people within the Wholesale Banking group.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And I can tell you, from my perspective, and while I've not had that much time with Dave, I've
only had 16 years with him, he is retiring. He has a fabulous family, including grandchildren. He has a lot of other
interests, and he just felt it was right for him. And while we're sad to see him go, we celebrate with him, his next stage.
And as Tim mentioned, his legacy are the thousands of people that he has led that are in leadership roles right now that
continue to propel this business forward.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Well, please let him know that I'm sure I'm not the only analyst who's going to miss
sparring with him. One other thing; on private equity, just the gains you had. You guys have long had an expertise in
technology, private equity investments, and is that still or is that sort of the primary source of a lot of the gains this
quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It was a source of some of the gains, Nancy, but it was really across the board. We had, as I
mentioned, about the same resolutions. I'd say about half were in technology-related, the other half weren't. And we're
very pleased with the gains that we had this quarter. But as you can appreciate, you can't count on those at the same
level every quarter. I wish we could. But this is a very buoyant time in the equity markets, both public and private,
notwithstanding some of the market volatility over the last couple of days. And we've got good management teams. As

Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Paul.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Hi. This is actually Jessica Ribner for Paul. How are you?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So we've upgraded. How are you, Jessica?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, good.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: You have upgraded. It's true. And then, he's going read the transcripts. You guys have
actually shrunk your market share almost in half to about 16% over the last couple quarters or the last few quarters, I
should say. But you're also talking about growing it. Where do you see that going?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. Sure, it's a good question. Again, if you step back and think about the time at which in
the cycle that our market share was so high, arguably two times maybe a little bit less than that; it was because the
primary source of mortgage origination volume, depending upon the quarter, could've been two-thirds of volume, or
three-quarters of volume, or even more in some quarters was refinance volume. And that's reflective of the fact that we
are the largest servicer, we had the highest quality servicing portfolio and generally those customers gave us the first
call and we were able to meet their needs by refinancing that mortgage.
And we had indicated that we thought that as the refinancing volume declined, and as the mix changed to more of a
purchase money market, our mortgage – our market share would go down. So that was absolutely anticipated. But we
don't think of the business as a market share business. We think about it as how do we solve the needs of our
customers? Do we have the right number of people in the right places? As John mentioned, we've got the best
distribution system in the market, and so we're optimistic about being able to grow. Whether that means we'll grow
market share, I don't know, but we're optimistic about growth in the business.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Jessica, the other thing you should think about is that the 16% or whatever that number is,
16% or 17%, part of it is an aggregation business where we do correspondent banking business, and which is a – we
love that business, but it's a lower margin business. And part of it is a retail business where we actually originate the
loan through one of our home mortgage consultants. Some of the correspondent business is going directly to Fannie
and Freddie. So that business is actually changing a bit. So when you look even at the time when we had maybe double
that share, you have to look at both sides of that. And while I focus on all of it, it's also important to make that
distinguishment.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Okay. Well, thank you. And then – and kind of a related question; you guys said earlier
on the call that you added about $7.2 billion of, it sounds like jumbo mortgages on the balance sheet. Is that correct?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No. Our loan growth was primarily, on a gross basis for the quarter, was about $7 billion
point-to-point. The growth in non-conforming mortgages on a gross basis, which would be – the jumbo category, was
about $5.8 billion.

<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Okay. And where do you see that trend going?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hopefully, it'll continue to go up. And I think that one of the areas that we indicated a couple
of years ago at our Investor Day was a real effort on the part of our team in the wealth area, as well as in our retail
banking area to coordinate more on that – those opportunities. And they've done just a terrific job. So we're hopeful,
with the improvement in the weather and the spring selling season that we'll continue to see that grow over time.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: The ones we put in the portfolio are a very small part of the originations. It's less than 5% or
so. So there's opportunity there.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: No. We still think that's an upgrade.
<Q - Keith E. Murray>: Thank you very much. Just on all the new rules; you've got Basel III, you've got SLR, you've
got LCR. When you think about loan pricing and pricing for commitments, has that all been factored in yet? And are
you still kind of working through the changes that'll have to be made?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Really good question. I don't believe that the industry – set us aside for a minute -- the
industry has necessarily adjusted yet, because the capital rules have just been finalized. The leverage rules, for
example, are relatively new. And we haven't seen the final liquidity rules. I'm sure there'll be some adjustments just like
there's been adjustments to all the other new rules and regulations that we have post-crisis. So I think it's more in the
future than in the past.
<Q - Keith E. Murray>: Okay. And then, are you seeing much impact from non-bank lenders out there? Every private
equity firm, non-banks, you're seeing a lot of them try to do more loans to middle-market firms. Are you seeing much
impact at all?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, there's no question that post-crisis, given a lot of the regulatory change has created
opportunities for unregulated or differently regulated institutions. I mean that's been the case for as long as I've been in
the lending business, and been with the bank. I think the important point to make is that generally, those firms
frequently are very good are monoline firms, and that is they have one product they can provide credit.
How we differentiate ourselves is that we have relationships and that we can provide tens of products or more and
broaden that relationship. So we don't find ourselves losing a lot of business to non-banks. I also think that generally,
the competitive environment's a little bit more rational than it would be today. But again, we have a real advantage
when we compete against a monoline product provider versus our relationship-focused and cross-sell orientation.
<Q - Keith E. Murray>: Thanks. And then just finally on fee-based businesses that you have, if you look out to the

growth?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I – we really like – we like all of our businesses. In fact, we think there's growth opportunity,
but a few – a couple of them jump out. Wealth, Brokerage, Retirement; you saw that we were up 41%, and I don't think
we can do 41% every quarter every year, but that's a huge growth opportunity for us. The card business; we think we've
got some exciting things happening there, but that doesn't diminish anything else.
We have opportunities with what we're doing internationally, because we've more of our U.S. customers doing business
there. We have opportunity in our capital markets businesses. And even mortgage where you think or people would
say, well, gees, you have the number one share, there's huge opportunity there. Half of our customers who call us their
bank who have a mortgage don't do it with us. I mean – so there's all kinds of opportunity here.
<Q - Keith E. Murray>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thank you very much.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hello. Just a couple of follow-up questions; one is I noticed that your card fees declined by
about the same amount as they did in the first quarter of last year. But in terms of your actual charge volumes, was
there any decline that was more than what is typically seasonal in this first quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, not at all.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: No. So in other words, no disruption from weather or any other exogenous – temporary
unemployment or any other exogenous factor?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No, not at all.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. And just turning to the gain on sale trend for a moment, and I recognize that the
changes weren't big but most of the proxies that we use suggested flat. And so I'm just wondering if there was anything
in mix or otherwise that would've explained the decline?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No. There wasn't necessarily a big change in mix. I mean that's one of the reasons why we
provided a range beginning in the third quarter of last year. I think there was a concern in the market that as volume
went down that that gain on sale margins would go down significantly. We think that the range that we provided, plus
or minus 1.5% is a reasonable range to operate in. But within any – comparing any quarter, five basis point, to 10 basis
point, to even 15 basis point level volatility is not uncommon at all.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And then lastly, just getting back to Brian's question about the accretion of Basel III
capital versus the growth in earnings; recognizing that there should be convergence it also seems that the quality of the
portfolio that you've originated over the past few years has lower embedded risk. So wouldn't that suggest that the –
that as the risk component becomes an increasingly important determinant of your Tier 1 under the Basel III, wouldn't
that suggest that Basel III capital continues to grow ahead of what the earnings math would otherwise suggest?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It could. But again, because it's a more complicated calculation right now, because you've got
the impact of market risk; you got the impact of operational risk, and candidly, the operational risk calculation for the

regulators, as well as the entire industry continues to be a work in progress, and in flux. I wouldn't want to jump to a
conclusion that just underlying credit quality only would be the sole driver of improvement in RWA.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And then just last one from me, and I hate to come back to this topic, because it's
already been addressed many times; reserve releases. I mean the non-performing assets continue to come down, but
many of the forward-looking credit quality indicators are starting to flatten in terms of their sequential improvement.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Right.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: So all else equal – and of course, your portfolio of loans continues to grow. So all else
equal, wouldn't that indicate that the pace of reserve release should start to decline also?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, it could. And to your point, that's what you've seen over the last three quarters. We
went from a $900 million release in the third quarter to $600 million last quarter, to $500 million this quarter. I don't
know what the release is going to be in the second quarter. We do believe we're going to have a release, but it's a fair
point. I mean this is not going to go on forever, but the fact of the matter is the portfolio continues to improve.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. All right, thanks very much.

Our final question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Derek?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Derek?
Operator
Derek, your line may be on mute. If you're on a speaker phone, please pick up your handset. Okay, there is no response
from that line.
John G. Stumpf
All right. Why don't we then conclude? Let me make a couple of comments. First of all, I'd like to thank Tim Sloan for
the great work he's done as our CFO. As you all know, he's going to take over the Wholesale Bank, but Tim, thank you
for the great leadership and the work you've done here. You've just been terrific. For those of you who don't know John
Shrewsberry; many of you do, you'll get to see him, if not before, but you'll surely see him when you come to our
investor conference.
Remember that was May 20 in San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you. It's always an exciting time for us to talk
about our business and share with you the enthusiasm and some of the great people that we have. So thank you very
much for your interest in Wells Fargo, and we'll talk to you next quarter and the investor conference earlier than that.
Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all for participating, and you may now
disconnect.
