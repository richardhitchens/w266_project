Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2014 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly
financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable
GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net
investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant
impact on GAAP net income.
Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John
Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks we will take your questions. Also here with us today to
participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve
Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. I
would like to remind you that during the Q&A session, we request you limit yourself to one question and one follow
up.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported second quarter results with operating earnings of
$1.6 billion. Earnings benefited from strong investment margins in a favorable market environment, but were
negatively impacted by weak underwriting results. Operating earnings were essentially flat relative to the second
quarter of 2013.
Operating earnings per share were $1.39, a 3% decrease from the prior-year period. Performance on a per-share basis
was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of Alico. The final $1 billion
tranche of equity units will convert in October of this year. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter.
Investment margins were favorable in the second quarter. Variable investment income was strong, driven by bond
prepayment fees, and recurring investment margins were stable even though interest rates were 50 basis points below
what we had assumed at the beginning of the year.
Despite low interest rates, investment margins had been resilient for three main reasons: Effective asset liability
management, good to variable investment income, and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the
mid-2000s to protect earnings and low interest rate environment. Second quarter operating earnings were also helped
by above average equity market returns. Results this quarter highlight the value of our balanced business mix, as strong
investment margins and outperformance in market-sensitive lines of business helped offset unfavorable underwriting
results in certain protection lines of business.
I'd like to comment specifically on disappointing underwriting margins in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits
and Retail Life and other segments. Second quarter earnings for Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were below
expectations. The shortfall in this segment was primarily driven by results in Disability and Dental. In Disability, claim
severity and an operational issue at one claims management center location, led to the under-performance this quarter.
Claim severity was 3% above expectations. As for the operational issue, we have brought in new leadership and
additional resources to improve claims management. We expect the issue to be corrected by year-end.
In Dental, we believe that above-normal utilization in the second quarter reflected the rescheduling of first quarter
dentist appointments that were canceled due to the unusually harsh winter. Please recall that we noted low utilization
on our first quarter earnings call.
On a year-to-date basis, dental utilization is in line with plan. Weak underwriting margins were also an issue in Retail
Life and other. While the second quarter was characterized by adverse mortality, the recent trend illustrates that
mortality fluctuations can generate both positive and negative surprises to earnings. For example, Retail Life and other

exceeded our plan in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 when mortality was favorable but fell short of our plan the
past two quarters due to unfavorable mortality after adjustments. The timing of large life claims can create earnings
volatility in this segment. In the second quarter we had one large claim associated with a death from a tragic accident
that reduced earnings by $13 million after-tax or $0.01 per share.
Moving to capital management. I would like to provide an update on MetLife's program to repurchase up to $1 billion
in common stock, which we announced on June 10. Through yesterday we have repurchased $135 million of stock at
an average price of $55.46 per share. Share repurchases were insignificant in the second quarter given the
commencement of the program in late June. As mentioned, when we announced the repurchase program, we will be an
opportunistic buyer of our shares.
Finally, I'd like to comment on the regulatory environment. Uncertainty surrounding potential new regulation is the
biggest issue facing MetLife today. However, policymakers in Washington are increasingly aware of the need to tailor
the prudential rules for insurance companies.
Our position on whether MetLife should be designated a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution, and if
so, what rules should apply has been consistent? First, MetLife should not be named a non-bank SIFI by the Financial
Stability Oversight Council because we do not meet the Dodd-Frank Act's criteria for designation. While MetLife is a
large financial institution, financial distress at the company would not pose a risk to the financial stability of the United
States. We are simply not interconnected enough with the rest of the financial system. Second, for any insured
designated as a non-bank SIFI or otherwise regulated by the Federal Reserve, the related rules should be appropriate for
the business of insurance.
I am encouraged that members of Congress have shown broad bipartisan support for legislation to accomplish this goal.
On June 3 the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a targeted amendment to Dodd-Frank clarifying that the Federal
Reserve has the authority to tailor capital rules for insurance companies. Companion legislation in the U.S. House of
Representatives already has 182 cosponsors, 103 Republicans and 79 Democrats. In addition, at a congressional
hearing earlier this month Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen, called the legislation useful and said that it would,
"Allow us greater latitude in tailoring appropriate regulations."
We are hopeful the legislation will be enacted into law this year. Imposing bank centric capital rules on life insurance
companies would make it more difficult for Americans to buy products to help protect their financial futures. At a time
when government social safety nets are under increasing pressure and corporate pensions are disappearing, public
policies should preserve and encourage competitively priced financial protection for consumers.
In closing, I would reiterate our view that MetLife's second quarter results highlight the benefit of the company's
diverse business mix. Strong investment margins and a favorable market environment help mitigate the impact of a
challenging underwriting quarter. We are also pleased to be repurchasing shares again, something MetLife had not
done since early 2008. We understand that returning capital is a key driver of shareholder value over time. And while
we continue to take a conservative approach to capital management in light of regulatory uncertainty, I'm encouraged
by the growing appreciation that the Federal Reserve should have rules that are appropriate for the business of
insurance.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results including a discussion of insurance
margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and
capital.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.6 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, and operating earnings per
share were $1.39, down 3% year-over-year. This quarter included three notable items.

First, in Retail Life, we had a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability waiver rider in a number of
term life contracts. This benefited operating earnings by $56 million after-tax or $0.05 per share. Second, in our P&C
business, we had higher than budgeted catastrophe losses of $28 million after-tax, which is partially offset by favorable
prior-year reserve development of $7 million after-tax. Therefore, the net decrease to operating earnings was $21
million or $0.02 per share. Finally, pre-tax variable investment income was $342 million reflecting higher bond
prepayment fees. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $221 million, which was $11
million or $0.01 per share above the top-end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range.
Turning to our bottom-line results, second quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $1.17 per share. Net income was $255
million below operating earnings in the quarter. Notable items that explain most of this difference are: number one,
charges of $104 million after-tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts; number
two, net investment losses of $81 million after-tax; number three, a loss of $62 million after-tax related to certain
variable annuity guarantees where the hedge assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment
for guarantee liabilities; and number four, partially offset by derivative net gains of $71 million after-tax and other
adjustments, which reflects the decline in interest rates in the quarter. Book value per share excluding AOCI was
$50.14 at June 30, up 2% from $49.34 at March 31.
Turning to second quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was less favorable than the prior-year quarter and
plan. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 87.3% versus 86.5% in the prior-year period. Severity was up
year-over-year but improved 6.3 points sequentially. We believe results this quarter were within the range of normal
quarterly fluctuations and are in line with the second quarter results over the past several years. Retail Life also had
unfavorable mortality quarter due to severity. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio in Retail Life was 48.9%, reflecting the
6.3-point benefit as a result of the disability waiver reserve adjustment. Excluding this notable benefit, Retail Life
interest-adjusted ratio was 55.2%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 53.6%.
We believe second quarter results reflect normal earnings volatility for this business. While the first two quarters of
2014 were characterized by poor mortality, the last two quarters of 2013 had favorable mortality. As a result, our
four-quarter average is in line with the long-term mortality results. Non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was
82.6%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 80.0%. Disability underwriting results were unfavorable to the prior
year due to the lower net closures of existing claims and slightly higher severity. Dental margins were unfavorable to
the prior year, driven by higher utilization. On a year-to-date basis, we remain on plan for the dental business.
Underwriting in long-term care improved year-over-year primarily driven by premium rate actions.
In our P&C business, the combined ratio including catastrophes is 107.5% in Retail and 96.4% in Group. The
combined ratios excluding catastrophes were 83.6% in Retail and 86.8% in Group. Despite the higher catastrophes,
overall P&C underwriting results were favorable to the prior-year quarter primarily due to lower non-catastrophe
accident year losses and prior-year development. Finally in Latin America, underwriting results were unfavorable due
in part to notable items including a reserve, a reinsurance true-up and litigation reserve as well as some higher claims
experienced in Mexico worksite marketing. Year-to-date, our Latin America business remains on plan.
Moving to second quarter investment margins, the simple average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 221
basis points, which is down 23 basis points versus the prior year. Product spreads excluding variable investment
income were 195 basis points, down 20 basis points versus the prior year. Our investment margins have remained at
attractive levels despite a multi-year period of low interest rates. The current rate environment has been relatively
consistent with the low rate stress scenario we discussed in our 2013 10-K. However, the negative impact on operating
earnings in the first half of 2014 has been modestly smaller than what we would have anticipated.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.2% in the second quarter as compared to 23.4% in the
year-ago quarter. Gross expense saves were $211 million in the second quarter and net saves were $149 million after
adjusting for reinvestment of $15 million and one-time costs of $47 million. We are pleased with our expense
performance and remain on track to deliver gross saves of $830 million to $860 million in 2014 and $1 billion in 2015,
with net saves of $600 million in 2015.

I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $652 million, up 12% versus
the prior year and up 6% when adjusting for notable items in both periods. The notable items include the reserve
adjustment in this quarter as well as excess variable investment income, higher catastrophes and favorable prior-year
development in both periods. Retail premiums, fees & other revenues were $3.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year due to
separate account growth and higher income annuity sales. Life & Other reported operating earnings of $253 million, up
19% year-over-year and up 1% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The primary drivers were lower
expenses offset by less favorable underwriting.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $399 million, up 8% versus the prior year. The primary driver was higher fees
from separate account growth due to favorable equity market performance. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or
GVWB reported operating earnings of $205 million, down 25% year-over-year primarily due to less favorable results
in disability and dental. GVWB premiums, fees & other revenues were $4.3 billion, up 6% due to business growth and
experience-related adjustments on participating Group Life contracts. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating
earnings of $374 million, up 8% year-over-year driven by higher investment margins as well as favorable expense
margins.
Premium, fees & other revenues were $816 million, up 29% year-over-year due to increased structured settlement sales
and pension closeouts. Latin America reported operating earnings of $160 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 40%
on a constant currency basis. These results reflect the ProVida acquisition, which continues to perform well. Operating
earnings for ProVida were above expectations this quarter, primarily due to favorable encaje returns. Adjusting for
ProVida, operating earnings were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis due to one-time items and
unfavorable underwriting, partially offset by growth in the region.
Looking ahead, we expect tax reform in Chile to be passed in the third quarter. As discussed at our June Investor Day,
the proposed tax rate change is an increase from 20% to 25%, phased-in over four-year period. As a result, we
anticipate a one-time charge related to the reduction of deferred tax assets. This one-time charge is expected to reduce
Latin America operating earnings in the third quarter by $40 million to $70 million. In addition to the one-time charge,
we believe the 2014 Latin America operating earnings will be dampened by approximately $10 million with most of
that reduction in the third quarter.
Premiums, fees and other revenues were $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, 27% on a constant currency basis, and
18% excluding ProVida on a constant currency basis. The strong growth was due to higher premiums related to a
government group life policy sale in Mexico, higher annuity sales in Chile, and direct marketing in Argentina.
Turning to Asia; operating earnings were $319 million, down 3% year over year and down 1% on a constant currency
basis, primarily reflecting the weakening of the yen. On a constant currency basis, lower surrender fee income from
foreign currency denominated fixed annuities in Japan essentially offset business growth in the region and favorable
one-time tax items in the current quarter.
Premiums, fees, and other revenues were $2.3 billion, down 5% year over year and down 2% on a constant currency
basis, also due to the lower surrender fee revenues in Japan. Asia sales were down 12% year over year as pricing
actions in Japan that we have noted on prior calls caused a decline in life sales and a related decline in accident and
health sales as A&H is often packaged with life products. Sales were strong elsewhere in Asia primarily driven by
A&H sales in Korea and China.
In EMEA operating earnings were $93 million, up 37% year over year and 41% on a constant currency basis. The key
drivers in the quarter were business growth across the region and one-time favorable items including taxes of $7
million and a $5 million benefit operating earnings as a result of eliminating an accounting lag to adjust our businesses
in Poland and Slovakia onto a calendar year basis. We would expect a comparable benefit to EMEA operating earnings
over the next couple of quarters as we eliminate the lag accounting in other countries.
Premiums, fees, and other revenues were $712 million, up 3% year over year and 1% on a constant currency basis,
driven by growth in UK, Russia, Turkey and the Gulf. Excluding divestitures, namely Belgium, and the negative
impact from the Poland pension reform, PFOs were up 6%. Sales for the region increased 3% with emerging markets

up 10% driven by growth in Poland and Turkey.
Finally the loss in Corporate & Other was $213 million after-tax. This line is volatile and we think the second quarter
loss was above the normal level. As you model our results for the balance of the year, I would suggest you consider the
average of the second quarter loss of $213 million and the first quarter loss adjusted for notable items of $156 million.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$5.5 billion at June 30, which is up from $4.7 billion at March 31. The increase in prior quarter was driven by
approximately $900 million of subsidiary dividends. We issued $1 billion of 10-year senior debt in the quarter to fund
debt maturities and redemptions. Also in the quarter we paid our quarterly dividend and funded the closing of the
Malaysian joint venture as we discussed at our June Investor Day.
Next I would like to provide you with an update of our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios
annually so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan our solvency margin was 966% as of the first
quarter of 2014, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies preliminary second quarter statutory
operating earnings were approximately $1.1 billion, up 72% from the prior year quarter and net income was
approximately $900 million, up fivefold. The year-over-year increase in statutory operating earnings was primarily due
to changes in reserves, including a portion related to the disability waiver, higher separate account fees, and favorable
interest margins, partially offset by lower underwriting results. In addition, to higher operating earnings, the increase in
statutory net income year over year was also due to lower derivative losses. Our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital is
expected to be approximately $28 billion as of June 30, up 7% compared to December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a solid second quarter. Investment margins remained healthy, expenses are well controlled,
and we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. While operating earnings were dampened by weakness in
underwriting, we believe results reflect the normal volatility in our business. In addition, our cash and capital position
remain strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in managing capital as we seek to maximize
shareholder value.
And with that I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Ryan Krueger of KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to touch on the group underwriting results. I think for
variety of reasons, they've been a bit soft for a few quarters now. Certainly heard your comments about looking to fix
the claims management in disability. I guess the question is, at this point, do you still feel comfortable with the
intermediate term outlook that you provided in December, which I think calls for the midpoint of your underwriting
target ranges, or should we be revising that to be slightly weaker going forward?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, Ryan. It's Bill Wheeler. So we forecasted an improvement in underwriting results year
over year, 2013 to 2014, and we gave those guidance ranges for group life and non-medical health. And obviously
group life this quarter reverted back to the middle of the guidance range. My expectation is that with non-medical
health, while it was at the top end, just above the top end of the guidance range of $77 million to $82 million that it too
will fall in the second half of the year, and move back inside the guidance range. We will get all the way to the
midpoint? I'm not sure yet, but I do expect the ratios to improve for the latter half of the year.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then a few weeks ago there was some proposed backstop capital
requirements that were released for global insurance SIFIs, which I know doesn't have direct supervisory authority, but
would appreciate any reaction you had to those.

<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hey, Ryan, this is Steve. I think those proposed rules are encouraging. They reflect the
insurance business model, and they dealt with the basic capital requirements that IAIS was proposing, and our hope is
that that approach is taken up as well in the United States in terms of putting together an approach that provides the
right kind of capital standards for insurance companies using an insurance framework not a bank framework. However,
I think we'd still caution people that there are other aspects to this kind of capital regime, which is evolving right now,
and there are these higher loss absorbency standards that will apply for globally systemically important insurers and we
haven't really seen a lot on that yet, so really more to come.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay, great. Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Great. Thanks. Just a question on Latin America, I understand you had the adverse mortality in
Mexico, but it still seems like our results this quarter are still under some pressure. So hoping you can provide some
additional data, obviously, what's kind of driving that..?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Nigel, Nigel, can you just speak a little more slowly because it's breaking up on our side.
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Sure. So a question on Latin America, I understand you had the adverse mortality in Mexico, but
it still seems like results, even excluding that, were under some pressure. So hoping you can provide some details as to
what's driving that. Is it a reflection of the more volatile markets, spending on growth initiatives? Any color there
would be helpful.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure, Nigel. So a little color on Latin America in terms of the underperformance. So as
John Hele mentioned, we had both relatively weak underwriting in our Mexican worksite marketing business. Now this
is a business we've obviously been running for a long time, and it's actually very steady. But we do see some movement
and volatility and mortality volatility, and we had a blip up this quarter. So that obviously was a big portion of the
difference versus expectations.
As I think was also mentioned, we had just a group of, I would say, smaller one-time adjustments, things like a
reinsurance true-up, a litigation reserve. In total they would've been something in the order of $10 million to $15
million after-tax in terms of results. So I think when you kind of reflect both of those variances in the quarter, you
realize that otherwise Latin America had a relatively good quarter or a quarter near expectations. And obviously a big
part of that is ProVida, and ProVida obviously is doing very well and had a very – I don't know how unusual I would
call it, but certainly a strong quarter with regard to encaje performance.
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Great. Thanks. And just a question on long-term care. One of your peers saw a sharp increase in
severity. I noticed that you actually had improvement in underwriting results from the previous year, but any shift that
you're all seeing with regards to severity trends, which potentially could emerge as a concern for your operations?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Nigel, could you repeat the last part of that question, please?
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Sure. Any shift in severity that you're seeing across your operations, which potentially could
emerge as a concern?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: This is John. According to long-term care, we've not seen any major changes other than what
we've been expecting, as we have seen an increase in earnings and we are getting the rate increases that we had
assumed generally that we had hoped to get. We don't get it in every state, but it is according to our plans that we've
laid out so far and so it's really where we had expected it to be.

Our next question will come from Mr. Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Good morning. First, just a quick question on the disability claims handling issue. Steve,
you had mentioned that you would expect that to be corrected by the end of the year. So does that imply that we're
going to see margins overall in the group business remain on the soft side? Meaning, are we likely to see disability loss
ratios remain high there for the next couple of quarters here?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Tom, it is Bill. I do think disability results will improve even in the third and fourth
quarter. Again, they probably won't get back to our original expectation that we laid out last December, though we
didn't obviously mention disability specifically. But I do think disability will probably improve in the third quarter and
the fourth quarter, mainly because of some IBNR reserves we put up in the first and second quarter and those won't
reoccur in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And so given everything else, that should see some improvement our
way. But I think it is right that in terms of the operational issue and then its impact on our financials, you won't see an
improvement really probably until 2015.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: And Bill, how material were those IBNR reserves you put up in 1Q and 2Q for disability?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: They explain a part of the variance in our disability performance. I would say if you think
of the other reasons that Steve laid out with regard to claim severity and also operational issue, that would be the third
of the three reasons.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. And then just my follow up is on the corporate side, the loss this quarter was above
the high-end of guidance if you just spread it out and looked at it on a quarterly basis. So I guess for John, should we
still take the initial guide that you put up in Corporate & Other to be a reasonable range? Meaning are we likely to see
the Corporate & Other experience in the loss shrink meaningfully from current levels, or any help with that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Sure. So Corporate is a very hard thing to forecast, obviously, and there's a lot of pieces in
there. This quarter we said was above well what we think is a normal run rate. We had some one-time expenses with
various cost saving programs. We had a tax booking in there that was more a timing issue. So what I said in my text
was that if you take this quarter, the $213 million and the first quarter adjusted for notable items we talked about in the
first quarter, that'd be $156 million, and if you sort of average that, we think that would be the more appropriate sort of
run rate.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. That's helpful. And actually if I could just sneak in one more for Bill Wheeler, a
competitor of yours reported exceptionally strong sales in their group business last night. Can you talk a little bit about
what you're seeing on the sales front in the group business, whether it's life insurance, disability or dental?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: I would say that the environment is okay and is constructive. I would not say it was very
aggressive. Our sales levels in group have been good so far this season, and where we need to get renewal increases,
we've been able to get them. So I think I would view the overall environment as pretty good.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Seth Weiss of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Great. Thank you. I wanted to just ask about Latin American sales and I know there was a big
one-timer in terms of a group contract sold I believe in Mexico. But outside of that, can you give us a sense of how
sales growth looked like in Latin America?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure, Seth. It's Bill again. So, we obviously had very high reported sales growth, well
north of 50%, or I think the number actually might have been close to 80% sales growth. But that was really driven by

a very large government group contract in Mexico. If you just adjust for that and nothing else, then sales growth looked
pretty flat. It increased 3% year-over-year. And so a couple other data points I'd give you, because that's obviously –
3% is not our normal expectation, but we didn't try to smooth sales for any other lumpy sales we might've had either in
this period or the year-ago period.
In the first quarter, for instance, we had sales growth year over year of 13%. And if you look at our revenue growth in
Latin America year over year, it's obviously very good and even when you take out things like ProVida and adjust for
currency, it's still double digit. And that's our expectation in terms of top line growth in Latin America, both for sales
and for revenues, is that we would have double digit. And even though this quarter the sales level was a little low,
adjusted for the big contract, I think double digit is sort of the right level that we should get going forward.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay. Thank you very much.

We have a question from the line of Joanne Smith of Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: Hi. Yes, good morning. Just in terms of the corporate expenses, I just want to go back to that
for a minute. What are you doing in terms of regulatory and compliance spend in terms of gearing up to potentially
meet the challenges of being a non-bank SIFI?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Joanne, this is John. So within some of these numbers are some of our costs for this. Right
now, of course, we're still in Stage III with the FSOC and they've asked us for a lot of information. We've been
providing that to them, but that's really the extent of it. We have a lot of planning underway, of course, if we are
named, but it's still early days right now for us to really understand the true cost impact over time. We also have costs
in there for FATCA and some other new regulations that are taking effect right now as well. It is included, but as I said,
the $213 million this quarter is above a current running rate for this year.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: John, have you looked at some of the spending at the bank to comply with the new capital
regime? Because it seems to me that the expenses have been a lot higher than I think anybody had anticipated and they
continue to go up. So when you're doing your planning, have you taken that into consideration?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We're taking a wide range of thought into consideration. It is unclear as to how much
regulatory burden it will be for insurers compared to some banks. We're in different businesses. It's different, I think,
for banks, even if you're in retail versus wholesale, and it varies from bank to bank and from place to place, so it's still a
learning experience, I think, for all insurers who are SIFIs or who may be designated as SIFIs.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: Okay, thanks. And then I just wanted to go back to the disability issue real quick. Have you
determined that there any pricing or other underwriting changes that need to be made? I understand the claims issue,
but is there a pricing issue as well?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Joanne, I wouldn't say there's a pricing issue per se, but we're obviously, this renewal
season where we had cases that are underwater and not performing at expectations, we're seeking renewals that will
alleviate that issue. And I would just say in general we are being more aggressive about disability pricing this sales
season than we have been in recent years.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: Okay. Thanks, Bill.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Joanne, this is John. In our last call I had mentioned that we were putting through selective
price increases in the disability line.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: Okay. But nothing beyond what you said in the last call?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: I think that's right.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes.

Next question will come from the line of John Nadel of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just a question – actually I hate to beat up on corporate this
much on your call, but if we're averaging the first half of the year, it looks like the full year is going to be at the upper
end of your range in terms of loss. I just want to clarify, does that still include $160 million to $200 million of after-tax
one-time costs related to expense initiatives? Is that still your expectation for 2014?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, I think your calculations seem to be correct. It's within the range. It's why we gave a
large range. Corporate & Other does vary from quarter-to-quarter, from year-to-year and it is a total inclusive of all the
expenses and information we put into Corporate, so the answer is yes.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: Yes, no. I just wanted to confirm that the $160 million to $200 million is still a reasonable
number in terms of those one-time costs.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes, it's in that ballpark and it's within the total range of what we had said.
<Q - Joanne A. Smith>: Okay. Maybe a bigger picture question, coming back to the regulatory front, The Wall Street
Journal ran an article, I think it was earlier this week, might've been late last week that discussed maybe a hang up as it
relates to tailoring rules for insurance companies that Dodd-Frank essentially would prevent the use of ratings or rating
agency ratings as a means of determining the risk associated with fixed income holdings. I'm just curious whether you
guys think that that's a real issue? And if so, what kind of workaround that issue has been discussed with regulators?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: John, it is Steve. Dodd-Frank does limit the use by the Fed of third-party rating agencies.
We do think that risk weighting of assets is likely to be part of the model they used when they regulate insurance
companies, and we think there will be some sort of a workaround. The banks have internal rating systems. The Basel
Committee is looking now at harmonizing these kinds of systems across the bank regulatory regimes, and I think there
will be an evolution in this area that will occur over some period of time that will take into effect the risk weighting of
assets. It would surprise me if regulators didn't take into effect as they regulated entities for soundness and safety, the
riskiness of the assets that they were holding. So I think there will be some way to address this issue that was raised in
the article you noted.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. I mean, we did see during the financial crisis, TIMCO and BlackRock were used as a
third-party source for some of the asset-backed securities. So seems to me this can be worked around too. And just a
last quick one, I don't suppose there's anything to announce in the conference call, but there was speculation that FSOC
was going to vote on Met either yesterday or today. Is there any update you can provide?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: John, we don't know when FSOC will vote. They don't tell us that.

Our next question will come from the line of Suneet Kamath of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Great. Thanks. Excuse me. Good morning. John, in your prepared remarks I think you
mentioned an earnings benefit from true up of a lag. I think some of your operations were on a – I don't know if it's a
one-month lag or whatever. So I was just wondering if you can go through that again and then also are there any other
significant operations that are still reported on the lag basis that might be trued up in the future?

<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah. So some of the businesses actually from Alico are reporting on a lag, a one-month lag
there. It's small. It's immaterial for the whole group. We are working to move these through and we have seen it here in
EMEA. This quarter is a $5 million benefit and we expect the benefit in the next few quarters as we take more
countries in EMEA off the lag.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. But there's nothing major in terms of regions that's still on a lag that can be trued up?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: These ones are small so it just flows through operating earnings because it's immaterial to the
whole company. The one remaining group that still is on a one-month lag is Japan. We expect that will be off for 2016,
but that will flow through the balance sheet that change because it's a large amount.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Got it. And then I think in your prepared remarks also, John, you mentioned that the
impact from low rates was smaller than what you would've expected in the first half of the year. Is that simply because
variable investment income was better? Or what was some of the drivers behind that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, I think our sensitivity we published in the 10-K was 2.5% flat for the year and rates
weren't 2.5% on average in the first quarter. They were a little above that. And so it wasn't quite as bad as we had put in
our sensitivity.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Have you changed your outlook for rates in the balance of the year? I think your
original expectation was that the 10-year would be, I forget what the number was, but 3% something by the end of this
year? Have you changed your thoughts around that?
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: Hi. It's Steve Goulart. You're right. I think original plan was based on Bloomberg consensus
at the time which I think was 3.36% on the 10-year. Obviously consensus has come down during the course of the year,
and we sort of reflect that as we go through our projecting process. Our view has been that the consensus was probably
a little bit more aggressive on rates rising than we thought would happen anyway so I'd say that we've been operating as
we expected for most of this year and our outlook continues to reflect that.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Great. Thanks.

Our next question will come from the line of Randy Binner of FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Thank you. I want to go back to the disability issue. I guess I may have missed this, but the
claims management operational issue that was referenced, could you expand on exactly what that operational issue was
and kind of what can be done to turn it around? It sounded like from the commentary that things should turnaround
pretty quickly so just trying to get some understanding of what that operational issue was?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Sure, Randy. So we manage a group disability claims out of four locations and in one of our
offices, we've seen a real slip and I would see our claims management metrics, and we feel that this is operationally
driven, not underwriting driven or anything else. So what we've done is we've brought in our best claims management
people in the company, changed the managerial structure there, and I think you're going to see a focus in terms of our
procedures regarding claims management over the next six months. It's a manageable issue, and our expectation is that
it can be adjusted pretty quickly.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Okay. So nothing outside of just folks not following, I guess, the best procedures, so just kind of
standard claims stuff? Nothing outside of that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah, that's right.
<Q - Randy Binner>: I want to try one just on buyback real quick if I can. I heard the equity units commentary in the
opening script and there's $1 billion authorization. I think that's ostensibly to kind of offset that dilution, but I mean,
imagining that we continue to have regulatory uncertainty which seems to be a good assumption, can Met operate a

buyback program kind of beyond just offsetting the equity unit dilution? I mean, is this capital management in the form
of buyback something that can be explored assuming there's continued regulatory uncertainty?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, Randy, as you know we were cautious and remain cautious in terms of capital
management because of the uncertainty. And we gave the reasoning behind the program we have currently, the $1
billion, which we think is a modest program, because of the delay in both the ruling around designation in MetLife
potentially as a non-bank SIFI and also seeing a draft of the rules. And at this point we really can't say much more
because we, again, had not seen the rules, we've not been designated as of yet, and until we have more information, it's
going to be difficult for us to answer that question. I will simply say that, as I noted in my prepared remarks, returning
capital to shareholders is a high priority for us. We have to do that consistent with the regulatory environment in which
we find ourselves, and as we learn more about that, we'll have more to say.
<Q - Randy Binner>: All right. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Sean Dargan of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Mr.
Dargan.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Hello. Can you hear me? Hello?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Yes, we can hear you.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Oh, I'm sorry. I have a question about the Japan sales outlook and the impact of the pricing
increases.
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: The Japan sales increase and what? I didn't hear...
<Q - Sean Dargan>: I'm sorry. The outlook for Japan sales. Was there a reference to the impact of a pricing increase in
the prepared remarks?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Yeah, there was. And this is Chris Townsend for Asia. So, the reference that John
made was to some repricing of our Yen life-based products which was – the actions were taken at the back end of last
year and that will drag through this year in terms of the sales impact going forward. So what you're seeing there is that
sales for Asia are down about 12%. We've had pretty good growth in non-Japan, Asia, particularly areas like China,
which is up about 30%. But in Japan itself, the actions we've taken of not only the pricing, but we've also changed some
of the commissions to make sure that the behaviors we want are representative in terms of long-term persistency of
relationship with our clients.
So as the Life sales are impacted because of that repricing, there is an impact obviously in terms of the packaging
which we've spoken about before. But going forward, what you'll see, and this will be about September time of this
year, we'll relaunch one of the yen-based life products which will be more competitive and will be very much in the
acceptable return area, and also a range of A&H products and medical products which will help the competitiveness
and help some of the features and benefits. So, sales will drag through third quarter. They'll be soft but they'll rebound
by the end of the year and give us a good start into 2015.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Thank you. And then just a question about EMEA. Has there been any noticeable impact from
the conflict in Ukraine and Russia?
<A - Michel A. Khalaf>: Hi, Sean. This is Michel Khalaf. So we have seen a drop in sales in Russia. That's primarily
due to the slowdown in the economy, and that's reflective of the fact that our overall growth for the region is below the
level that we expected to be at. So we're obviously – we have a diverse business in Russia, multiple channels and
multiple product lines. We are seeing an impact but we are also able to adjust our expense structure, so as long as the
impact is short term, it is not impacting our bottom line in Russia. We're obviously monitoring the situation very
closely.

And our next question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Thanks so much. Good morning. PFG earlier talked about suggestions or proposals
they're making on pension reform in Chile. Wondering what your views are and what you're communicating to
regulators on that topic?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, Chris. It's Bill Wheeler. So we're engaged in a very big – along with Principal and the
other members of the industry down there, we're engaged in a big dialogue with the Chilean government. They've
convened, I guess I'd call it a Blue Ribbon Panel of experts, both Chilean's and from the rest of the world to study
issues regarding the pension system there, which has really been a success but they're looking for ways to make it better
and do things like improve coverage and making sure that all members of Chilean society participate and things like
that. And so this Blue Ribbon Panel is in the middle of – they're holding hearings. We recently testified before the
panel giving our opinion about what should happen, and what we think works and needs to improve.
And I think Principal did too as well as other members of the industry. They're going to release a report in the fall with
sort of observations and then in January the expectation is, is that they'll then release a report with recommendations
which will form the basis of what the government might do in terms of making changes to the pension system. So I
think it's a thoughtful process, and I think the Bachelet government based on the discussions we've had with them, they
want to make sure that the pension system continues to be successful but they at the same time want to make sure that
there are improvements.
I would not call this the Bachelet government's highest priority in terms of what they want to get through legislatively.
They have a number of other agenda items they want to work on. So I know this isn't a centerpiece of what they're
focused on but that's the process that's going on.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay. Thanks. And then for Steve. When you were a bank holding company, you
obviously were subject to stress testing and bank capital ratio metrics. I know at that time you disagreed a bit in terms
of where your internal ratios maybe came out versus the Fed, but I'm wondering if you still update those estimates?
And if so, how those bank ratios have maybe changed over the past few years?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, this is John. We have our own internal stress testing system that we run from a
governance point of view. We used to have to provide this information when we were governed under the New York
Fed when we had a bank. We don't have a bank anymore. We don't provide anything to them. Basel I calculations don't
make any sense for an insurance company and nor that Basel I isn't even used anymore. So we have our own internal
system but we've not done things in sort of a bank sense for the Basel III. And we don't know what the capital rules will
be that the Federal Reserve will be introducing, nor when they might introduce them. So we will have to wait and see
when they come out with something. Obviously if we become a SIFI, we will start to do those calculations and see how
all that works out, but it's still way too early to understand what's going on there.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Thanks so much.
