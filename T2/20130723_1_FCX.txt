Kathleen L. Quirk
Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2013 Earnings

press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filing.
On the call today is our Chairman of the board, Jim Bob Moffett; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of our Freeport-McMoRan
Oil & Gas subsidiary and we've got a number of other executives with us today who will be available to answer any
questions.
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard and he'll be reviewing
performance and outlook as well as Jim Bob and Jim Flores. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open the call for
questions.
FCX reported today net income attributable to common stock of $482 million or $0.49 per share in the second quarter
of 2013. That compared to $710 million or $0.74 per share in the prior year quarter. Our results include the results of
the wholly owned subsidiary Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, following the acquisitions of PXP on May 31, 2013 and
of McMoRan Exploration on June 3, 2013.
Our second quarter results included a number of items associated with the transactions. We had $128 million gain to
net income attributable to common stock of $0.13 per share. That reflected a gain on FCX's initial preferred stock
investment and the subsequent acquisition of McMoRan. We had $183 million net income attributable to common
stock or $0.19 per share associated with net reductions in deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset valuation
allowances. And those were net of charges of $61 million or $46 million to net income attributable to common stock or
$0.05 a share for transaction and related costs associated with the acquisition.
As you'll see in the release, the second quarter results also included unfavorable adjustments to our provisionally priced
concentrate and cathode copper sales recognized in prior periods, that totaled $55 million to net income or $0.06 per
share and we also had unfavorable adjustments of $35 million or $27 million to net income attributable to common
stock, $0.03 per share related to oil and gas derivative instruments that were assumed in connection with the
acquisitions.
Our second quarter consolidated copper sales of 951 million pounds and 173,000 ounces of gold were lower than our
April 2013 estimates of 1 billion pounds of copper and 295,000 ounces of gold, primarily reflecting lower production
from Indonesia as a result of the temporary suspension of operations in mid-May. Our second quarter 2013 sales from
the recently acquired oil and gas operations totaled 5 million barrels of oil equivalents for the period from June 1
through June 30, which included 3. (sic) [3.4] million barrels of crude oil, 7.7 Bcf of natural gas and 0.3 million barrels
of natural gas liquids. The copper price realization for the quarter was $3.17 per pound. That was lower than last year's
second quarter of $3.53 per pound. For gold, we realized $13.22 per ounce in the second quarter compared to last year's
second quarter of $15.88 per ounce.
During June, the Brent crude oil prices averaged just over $103 per barrel and our realized price for crude oil in June
was $97.42 per barrel or about 94% of Brent crude. Excluding the impact of derivative instruments, the June 2003 (sic)
[2013] average realized price for crude oil was $97.05. Our consolidated average unit net cash costs for our mining
operations averaged $1.85 per pound of copper in the second quarter. It was higher than the year-ago period of $1.49,
primarily reflecting lower copper and gold volumes in Indonesia and anticipated higher mining rates in North America
and also the impact of lower gold prices in net by-product credits. The cash reduction costs for oil and gas averaged
$16.58 per barrel of oil equivalent in June 2013.
Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $1 billion, including $235 million in working capital sources, and our
capital expenditures totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter. We ended the June period with $21.2 billion in total debt, which
included $700 million of fair value adjustments to the stated value of assumed debt and a consolidated cash position of
$3.3 billion at the end of June. As previously reported, our board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of
$1.00 per share which was paid on July 1. The value of that dividend was $1 billion. That was in addition to our regular
quarterly dividend, which equates to $1.25 per share per annum.
During the second quarter, we'll be talking more about this throughout the call. We took a number of actions to reduce
or defer capital expenditures and other costs. We've got a progress report included in the materials which we'll be

talking more about. We're going to pursue additional capital cost reductions and divestitures as required to maintain our
strong balance sheet while preserving our strong resource position and portfolio of assets with attractive long-term
growth prospects.
I'd now like to turn over the call to Richard.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Kathleen. Obviously a very active quarter for us. We've got a lot to talk about today with the oil and gas
acquisitions of McMoRan and PXP. We're going to focus on the strong margins, cash flows, near-term and long-time
growth opportunities that we have from these assets and how that compliments the outlook for our mining business
going forward.
You will see that we really had strong operating performance in North America, South America and in Africa and we'll
be focusing on that. Our results were significantly affected, of course, by this tragic accident that we had on May 14 in
our PTFI operations in Papua. And we had significantly lower volumes of copper and gold as a result of that and also
we were impacted by the fact that a lot of our costs are fixed and continued during the period we were shut down.
After a period of grief and attention to the families and to our workforce and to the community as a result of the loss of
life in this accident, we worked on safety procedures in coordination with the government and returned to operations in
the open pit in the mill on June the 24, roughly six weeks after the accident and began underground mining operations
on July 9, almost two months later. And so that had an impact and we want to make sure you understand what that
means.
We did advance our development projects in the mining business at Tenke, Morenci, at Cerro Verde, Grasberg
underground development. We progressed with the Lucius development in our oil and gas business, a major discovery
that's looking to come on stream in the near term. We did have a $1 a share supplemental dividend paid on July 1 that
was in conjunction with completing the mergers to go along with our regular $1.25 annual dividend.
Kathleen mentioned this but you'll hear more about it today, about our commitment to achieve our debt reduction
targets. Even with lower commodity prices, which we had a lot of volatility during the second quarter and lower prices
at the end of the quarter, uncertainty about the future with the impact of the Grasberg deferral of operations with
changes in plans, we have a set of assets that's going to allow us to achieve this targeted debt reduction. And you'll be
hearing about our commitment to do that.
Before we get into the specifics on these matters I'm going to turn the mic over to Jim Bob to make some comments.
James R. Moffett
Good morning. At our annual shareholders meeting I thought you'd like to know that 15 of our directors and nominees
were elected and we had the ratification of Ernst & Young. The advisory vote on Say-On-Pay did not receive a
majority vote. Obviously, the board will continue to consider the shareholder feedback. We've been working with our
compensating people and we look at them to continue [ph] to reward and sicuss shareholder (11:18) feedback. Suffice
it to say we'll make sure that our pay is competitive and tied to shareholder return. The shareholder proposal [ph] to
have (11:31) an independent chairman received the majority of votes cast. And what this means is that the independent
directors will consider how they deal with this.
I should mention that the independent members of our board have already appointed Gerald Ford to the newly created
position of Lead Independent Director. And we think having an independent director like we've elected, which could
have been several of our board members, Gerry was chosen by the board. He has an impeccable reputation in the
financial community and our board is totally aware of our management goals and the board's goals. So we think we've
addressed this [ph] without an (12:23) independent chairman and we believe this structure is in the best interest of the
shareholders and addresses the so-called non-binding advisory proposal.

The bylaw amendments on shareholder rights to call a special meeting with 15% received the majority of the votes cast.
I won't spend any time on that but you'll find that in our bylaws in the State of Delaware that the 15% ownership has
several things that [ph] are fortuitous to us (12:55) and we'll get into that when the time comes. The Environmental
Director and the board diversity did not receive the majority of the votes cast.
Now, on the recent performance, on the next slide, we thought you'd be interested to see that since we announced the
deal in December, what's happened to the metals prices, copper, of course, being our main metal and gold, and look at
the oil 21% up. 5% natural gas. On the indexes, you have a similar indication. So we think that this already starts to
speak to the wisdom of having a more diversified asset base, including the oil and gas asset.
One of the things on top of the performance we've shown just by current prices, remember, discoveries in copper are
very rare. If you look at the recovery of copper reserves on slide six, and you'll notice that the Grasberg in 1988 and
Escondida in 1979 are really the two main, major discoveries. There have been no discoveries as major as this in 2000.
Most of the copper production really to date has been in Escondida, Grasberg, and then the most recent Chuquicamata
1910, El Teniente 1910, Los Bronces 1876, Norilsk 1935, Morenci, 1870.
What this says is because the copper reserves were all visible and found by surface geology, this has been mostly
reserves in the Rockies in the 1980s we found during the early prospecting days. So with the advent of the oil and gas
program, as you'll hear from Jim, there's a tremendous potential for us to have major discovery potential. So not only
do we have a more diversified base, we've been very fortunate since the acquisition of Phelps Dodge. We've been using
our greenfield, of course with the brownfield, and have discovered the equivalent of another Grasberg and it's been
going on for almost seven years. And as you will see, we continue to look at the greenfield opportunities in the metals
business. Brownfield will be our mainstay, but we do now have a world-class opportunity to have some new
discoveries in oil and gas.
Now, on page seven, I wanted to be sure that you know that – we got into the company on the mandate of our board
should have been the officer and chairman. We have myself, Richard and Jim Flores. As you can see, we're all on the
same page, and that's philosophically the way it should be. You'll hear from Richard and from Jim that we're dedicated
to our ultimate goal of reducing our leverage, and we're sure that we will do it in 2016. But you're going to hear some
comments to show that the end result is more discretionary with the board. We're looking at ways to position in before
that day. And again, all of us are going to be working to expand our resources, take advantage of our existing resources
and strong financial discipline and take advantage of this treasure trove of assets in which we find ourselves and as we
put these summaries together.
So with that I'll turn the meeting back over to Richard and I think you'll be happy to hear some of the exciting stuff that
we've been looking at as we look at this new asset base. Thank you, Richard.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Jim Bob. On the financial highlights page on page eight, I'm not going to repeat what Kathleen reviewed with
you at the start of the call but I want to just point out the impact of the suspension of operations at PTFI. You see that
our volumes of 950 million pounds of copper, they were roughly – that reflected the impact of having 125 million
pounds of less production. With gold of 173 we had 125 million ounces less production of gold. So that is really what
drove the shortfall in our performance together with this factor that I mentioned that many of our costs at PTFI are
fixed.
Now that works for us in a very positive way as volumes increase because we don't have increased cost that's
commensurate with higher prices but it also had an effect this quarter of having our unit costs higher because of the
fixed nature of our costs. This is further shown on page nine. You can see in North America, in South America, in
Africa where we have our unit cost at the top of the page and our volumes at the bottom of the page, that those
operations really performed strongly both in terms of having production achievement of our targets our goals and
control of our costs in today's environment. The numbers speak for themselves. The impact in Indonesia saw our unit

cost rise significantly as a result of the lower volumes and the fixed nature of our cost.
The oil and gas operations, and Jim will talk more to this in a few minutes, are presented in summary on page 10. This
only reflects one month of operations. We'll account for the oil and gas acquisitions perspectively going forward. It was
only from June in this particular quarter. But I want to point out just how strong the volume, the margins are in this
business looking at the unit revenue cost and the operation margin per BOE. Across the board, this again is a business
that has very high operating margins and that gives a chance to focus on profitable growth and disciplined growth and
achieve value creation for our company through these assets.
Copper markets, some bullet points on page 11. This was a very volatile quarter. It started out fairly strong, had a dip in
price of significance early in the quarter when some Chinese economic concerns came back. It bounced back, and then
in June, when the U.S. Fed talked about moderating their open market purchases of bonds and the purchasing number
came out in China and growth was just marginally less, the price dropped off. These are macro-economic events. They
really haven't been supported by fundamentals in the marketplace which really haven't changed that much.
China continues to remain the important demand driver in the business, consuming almost 40% of the world's copper
and accounting for the growth in demand. And within China, fundamental copper demand is really strong. It's growing
at 8% to 10% a year. The downstream business is strong, scrap is short, premiums are up. I'll just refer you to the
analysts that follow the business and you can substantiate that. But the prices are what they are because of market
sentiment in Europe and it remains weak. Our business in the U.S., supported by automobiles and a stronger
construction enlargement, is relatively strong, and longer-range supply challenges persist.
But be that as it may, the copper price is what it is. We don't run our business on any near-term expectations of price.
We're very confident about the long-term fundamentals of this marketplace, and what you'll see is we're responding to
the lower prices and to the risk of that continuing in the future and we're taking that with actions to reduce costs. We
began that during the quarter in earnest.
On page 12, within our mining business we undertook a project at looking at all of our capital spending projects and
making decisions to defer costs or eliminate costs and we could do that without really disrupting either our near-term at
this point or our long-term growth opportunities. And we've had success with that. It's a list of items that just illustrates
the breadth of scope that our team has done led by Red and Mark, Dave Thornton and our whole team to find items of
where we could achieve this goal of conserving cash.
And, we aren't finished, but he has a report today with where we are. We have capital reductions for the next two years
of $1.4 billion, and that includes $400 million in the oil and gas business, which has gone through a similar process of
looking at their capital spending and then looking at cost beyond capital. And we end up with a total of $1.9 million of
deferrals, or billion dollars of deferrals over the next two years. Now that's one element and it's continuing. The other
element is to look at our asset base and look for ways again of, as Jim Bob said, achieving this target of reaching our
right balance sheet goals for debt in light of lower commodity prices and finding ways of potentially accelerating
achieving that goal from beyond the target of 2016.
We've initiated plans to sell conventional oil and gas production on the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico and that's a process
that has started. We have a broad set of other assets that gives us many alternatives in terms of potential property sale
or innovative structures to come up with ways of achieving this goal. And it is a commitment. It is a commitment and
we're committed to do it and we're committed to doing it in whatever environment we have to deal with.
At the same time, that we're going through this process, we're continuing to date with our brownfield development
projects in the mining business. We had three major projects that were growth projects that we're targeting to add about
1 billion pounds of copper sales a year, which is a significant amount of volumes. We've completed the Tenke
Fungurume Phase II project on time, on budget. The Morenci mill project is in progress. We've incurred about $600
billion to date of our revised estimate of $1.6 billion to our interest. We have an 85% interest at Morenci. That's going
very well, very high rate of return project and one that has a very quick payback because of significant volumes that
come out of that project as we add on to the existing substantial operations at Morenci.

At Cerro Verde, we commenced construction earlier this year. The plan is to complete that in 2016. We've incurred
about $800 million out of the $4.4 billion. Good support from the government, the local community and so the numbers
that you see to date involve continuations of those projects. We have options of changing those decisions if market
conditions warrant but we can achieve this targeted debt reduction goal and do these projects at the same time. We're
also continuing the underground development at PTFI, which is necessary for us to be able to go forward with this very
valuable operation beyond the exploration of mining in the open pit, which continues to be expected by roughly the end
of 2016.
We did have this horrific accident that we talked about earlier on May 14, where we had a tunnel collapse in a training
facility and we had fatalities and injuries. This wasn't really a mining accident. It was apart from our mining operations.
It was an incredibly horrific convergence of events that came together because of the geology of the rock and the
influence of water and air on our ground support facilities and it, unfortunately, just happened just as we were having
this training meeting. And then, it was terrible and all of our organization has responded in a caring and professional
way about it, but we also undertook internally a special safety review of all of our operations, focusing on underground
operations where people gather. We worked with people with the Energy and Mines Ministry in Indonesia and an
independent team they formed. And, at the conclusion of that process we were able to resume operations on June 24 in
the open pit and the mill, and on July 9, in the underground. We are now ramping up the underground operations. You
can't just start those immediately at full-scale production and that ramping up is progressing.
In the quarter we lost roughly 125 million pounds of copper and 125,000 ounces of gold. The full-year impact will be
greater than that, we estimate 230 million pounds of copper and 250,000 ounces of gold. That resource is still there. I
mean, it's not going anywhere. We'll produce it in the future, but the impact for the year reflects a couple of factors.
One is the time it takes to ramp up underground to get back to full production levels, plus as you will recall in the first
quarter, we talked about how we were going to assess high-grade ore at the end of the year under our mine plans. Now,
some of that higher-grade ore will be pushed out into future years.
We presented this slide, which we have shown for 2012 earlier on page 16 to show just what the impact was. We're
showing the average of copper and gold production in prior years, from 2002 to 2011 and average for what our [ph]
mountain plan (29:18) shows for 2014 to 2016, which, we'll trans – at that point we will transfer from being a
combination open pit, underground operation to a full underground operation. If you can just see the significance of the
volume that we've had, the low volumes we've had in 2012 and 2013 and how that translates in the chart on the far right
to our unit cost, which average for PTFI $0.13 a pound for the 2007, 2011 period would actually be projected at a net
credit going forward. Although this will depend on the price of gold. This is at $1,300 an ounce gold. So that illustrates
the impact on current operations for that.
Page 17 shows part of our cost saving efforts. We've refocused our mining exploration expenditures, reducing about
$55 million of cost. And the bulk of our spending is on our brownfield expansion of our ore bodies. But we do have
some greenfield spending and that of course is, a greenfield discovery is the best thing that could happen to a natural
resource company. But our brownfield projects are projects that add a lot of value for us.
I'm going to turn the mic over to Jim Flores and Jim's going to be talking about our oil and gas activities.
James C. Flores
Good morning and thank you, Richard. Looking at the oil and gas development activities, first, we have several large
areas, California, Eagle Ford, deep water, Haynesville, also the ultra-deep completions we'll talk about. In California
it's been a tremendous asset on the oil and gas business for a long period of time. The fields were discovered 100 years
ago. They've been producing at high rates and high margins for a long period of time. A lot of people don't realize that
California is the third most productive state in the country and it's got a tremendous oil and gas business.
And the big thing it has for our company is a lot of free cash flow from the standpoint of very low maintenance capital
to keep very high flow rates. And obviously with our strong pricing gives us big margins as Richard highlighted earlier
in this presentation. California will continue to get its ample amount of capital to maintain that production and look

forward to a stable base going forward.
The Eagle Ford is one of our newer assets. It's been developed in the last five years. It's had a tremendous growth rate
because of the rig activity that we expanded from two to over eight rigs over a period. We're now reducing that rig fleet
and reaping the large cash flows out of our high oil price at LLS pricing in our Eastern Eagle Ford. We're in the
premium position of the play. We call it the heart of the watermelon. We're in the graben sequence that's got the thick,
oil bearing part of the shale, and our wells continue to produce several thousand barrels a day as they come on. The
near term cash flow expansion will come at the peril of our recount there. We'll be reducing our recount going forward
and this is one of the areas we're able to save a lot of our CapEx savings at the same point in time maximizing the cash
flow for the company. What you're seeing is we're taking advantage of the high oil prices in California and Eagle Ford
to generate cash flow for the overall company.
And in deep water we've made a large effort there obviously on the backs of some of our non-operated activities like
our Lucius project, which is operated by Anadarko. It's on time and on budget and contrary to a lot of the highlights
you've heard in some of the large projects around the Gulf and around the world. We've done an excellent job and we
expect that spar to be on location this summer and be established initial production in the second half of 2014.
Everything continues to look just stellar on the Lucius project.
Our large-scale infrastructure that we have in the eastern part of the Gulf at Holstein, Horn Mountain and Marlin
continue to reap benefits. We're getting very comfortable. We took over full operations May 1 from the seller. It allows
us to really weld our employees together and be able to look at all our development projects and the big growth
opportunity we have there to tie back additional leases, additional production to that important infrastructure.
Accordingly, with that we were very active in the last lease sale in March, with the [indiscernible] (34:05) lease sale
and we've now been awarded all 11 of our blocks from the recent lease sale, which will add several hundred million
dollars of tie-back opportunities for our Holstein platform. Our goals in the deep water Gulf of Mexico are to triple our
oil production over the next five years and we have the assets and we have the geology and the reserves to do it. It's a
matter of execution.
On the Haynesville, which is one of the more significant gas fields in the world much less the United States, we have
over five Tcf of gas attributable to our interests there in various forms. All of our acreage there has been drilled, been
plumbed. It's maintained under, held by our production rights there. We have not only significant Haynesville reserves
but we also have shallower Bossier reserves and the Haynesville is going to be the cornerstone of our gas business for a
long time to come. And whereas, we continue to watch gas prices and are bullish the second half of this decade, we
think Haynesville's going to be an important part of our expanding gas business.
Moving on to our gas business, our ultra-deep completions going forward, talk about that program. We're going to be
active and complete in the Davy Jones #2 well and also the Blackbeard West #1 well and of course, Lineham Creek #1
well that Chevron's continuing to test at this point in time geologically and with the drill bit and with the coring
opportunities to get all the data we need to put together a successful completion there. So we'll look for an active
production sequence. The ultra-deep with all the completions that we're going to be doing, as we get on those early in
2014 towards getting some revenues out to the royalty owners by the end of 2014. That's our goal.
All right, at the same point in time, exploration wise, we're drilling our Lomond North well. It's moving towards the
lower tertiary section, which is the primary objective. And so stay tuned on that as those results come available. We
have a large exploratory inventory here. One of our goals as a company is to look at ways of managing our exploration
expense and bringing in joint venture partners to help us participate. We have a cup runneth over of exciting
opportunities. They're all very large and we're going to continue to manage that growth in accordance with what
Richard talked about being disciplined and focused on returns and make sure that our exploration spending supports all
of those activities and adds value every single day.
Speaking of adding value from the exploration standpoint, our Phobos well, which we were basically carried on our
Phobos well through our Plains Offshore structure with our great partner EIG there, we've found 250 feet of pay.
There's a nice column over a 5,000 acre to 7,000 acre structure with Anadarko and Exxon and this is just south of our
Lucius infrastructure. So we're highly excited about the commercial aspects of Phobos and look forward to offsetting

that well late next year – or sorry, late this year or sometime next year in 2014.
So the oil and gas business, even though it's a couple months old as far as Freeport-McMoRan is concerned, it's off and
running and we've hit the ground with a lot of great support from management and the board and look forward to being
a big part of the story going forward.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Jim. Let's go to slide 20 and we'll update our outlook for the year. Our current sales outlook is for 4.1 billion
pounds of copper. That reflects roughly 200 million pounds lower than we were in the first quarter for the reasons we
talked about at Grasberg. Gold at 1.1 million ounces, molybdenum at 92 million pounds, oil at 35 million barrels
equivalent. That's 65% oil. For those, I know some of you are very familiar with oil and gas business and others less so.
Be careful with these barrels of equivalent. Because of tradition and some SEC rules, oil and gas is equated at 6 to 1
even though gas is selling today at $3.60 and oil is at $110 a barrel. 65% of these equivalent barrels are oil but oil
represents over 90%, or roughly 90% of the revenues. Unit costs are projected at $1,300 gold, [copper] at $1.58 a
pound, $19.00 per barrels of equivalent. Operating cash flows, we're now looking at $3.50 in copper as being at $5.8
billion. Each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year represents roughly $200 million and capital
expenditures of $5.5 billion, which includes $4.4 billion from the mining business and $1.5 billion from the oil and gas
business.
Our production profile as we look forward through the end of the year and into 2015 shows our growth from
completing our copper expansion projects going from the 4 billion pound level to 5 billion pound level. The gold sales
reflects the recovery of Grasberg and the access to higher grade ore because of our mine sequencing. Molybdenum
sales reflect the operations of our by-products from our copper mines as well as Henderson and Climax. And the oil
and gas sales outlook reflects the growth that Jim read with you earlier.
From a unit production cost level, we expect to continue the positive performance on volumes and growth in our mines
in North America, South America, as well as Africa. And then with the ramp up of operations in Indonesia, we're
looking at $1,300 gold at getting annual costs down to around a $1.50 level and then with significant improvements in
that as we go forward into 2014.
Page 23 shows the cash flow generating capacity of our company. EBITDA charged are shown on the top and
operating cash flows, which is net of cash taxes and cash interest, is shown at the bottom. We show this at varying
prices ranging for copper prices from $3 to $4 with $13 gold, $10 molybdenum and $100 oil. And you can see within
that range, EBITDA ranging from $10 to $15 billion a year for 2014/2015 average, operating cash flows at $8 billion to
$12 billion. And then in 2016, when we have the benefit of these higher volumes, you see 40% increases in those
numbers with 2016 having EBITDA of $15 billion to $18 billion and operating cash flows of $12 billion to $16 billion,
it just shows the strength of these assets and how much cash they can generate.
Our sensitivities that we present each year is shown, each quarter is shown on page 24. On an annual basis each $0.10
change in copper is $330 million of operating cash flows. You can see molybdenum and gold variations, our oil sales
variations. And then we've shown oil price variations net of our consumption of diesel within our mining operations. So
that's for your use in terms of your modeling purposes.
Our revised capital expenditures are presented on page 24. You can see that the mining capital has been reduced in
2013 and 2014 from previous levels. And some of those projects have been deferred to 2015. We are continuing to
review those and we will be responsive to market conditions in terms of how we spend capital and how we manage
ourselves before in light of this really strong commitment to balance sheet management, which we show on page 25.
Our total debt is at June 30 was $20.5 billion. Just point out that includes $700 million mark-to-market for some Plains
debt. That gets amortized over time before its maturity. Maturity doesn't change it's strictly just an accounting recording
thing. This excludes here on this chart though the fair value adjustments. Total debt net of cash and most of that cash
would be used to fund capital expenditures going forward, is $17 billion.

We have this commitment by 2016 to reduce this debt to roughly the $12 billion level through strong using our cash
flows, using capital, operating cost discipline. We have a large resource base. We've started a divestiture process. We're
considering other opportunities. We're going to respond to market conditions. That's the mandate of our board and we
have a number of ways to achieve that even if we have to face a period of low copper prices.
We also have some opportunities to refinance our balance sheet and to repay or refinance higher cost debt. We're going
to be looking at market opportunities and the right time to do that. At the end of the day, our financial policy remains
the same: having a strong balance sheet, which we and our board have concluded is necessary and appropriate to
manage this big resource base so we can take advantage of it to create shareholder value and we have these targeted
debt reductions that we're going to achieve over the next three years but we believe we can do it sooner than later.
We're going to invest in projects in a disciplined way and have strong financial returns. Our plan involves a
commitment to our current dividend level of $1.25 per share. The board will, as always, review financial policy going
forward and continue the Freeport longstanding tradition of working to maximize shareholder value.
We have a strong and focused organization. As Jim Bob said, we're all on the same page in terms of looking how we
run this business for creating shareholder value. We're going to focus on execution, operational excellence, achieving
production costs, managing costs and capital management, and invest for returns, protect the balance sheet and our
dividend. And that's what we are telling you today that our commitment is to. And with that, Regina, we'll open the
phone for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Hi, everyone.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Good morning.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Hi, everyone. How's everything going? Good. I was very happy to see some spending
restraint but I'm a bit surprised to not see a little bit slower approach at Cerro Verde and I was wondering if you'd just
go through the thought process again and elaborate a little bit as to why that project, why it's basically not touched here
in terms of a little bit slower approach going forward.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, Tony. Tony raises it's a good point. Just so everyone's aware of it, we have this
project at Cerro Verde that we've been working on now for a number of years. We suspended it in 2008 and 2009,
started in earnest in 2010. We own the rights to this resource because of our existing operations so it is a project that
from an ownership standpoint, would not be affected if we decided to defer it, and that is an option for us going
forward. There is several factors that lead us to want to continue with this project so long as we can achieve our balance
sheet management through other means.
One of those has to do with the very positive relationships that we've developed with the local community and with the
central government in Peru. As all of you who follow the mining industry know, that's really unusual for major projects
in Peru where there gets to be competition often around water rights, often around community issues. And there's
opposition in many cases and controversy with projects. Our team has done a great job in positioning this project to
date where we haven't had those issues.
We've worked with the city of Arequipa, the nearby city of Arequipa, second largest city in Peru where we've
developed a positive deal by providing that city of 1 million plus people with fresh water system. We're accessing
water for our expansion through a waste water collection and processing system where previously the city was just
dumping waste water into the river. Now it will be collected, treated and we'll have access to water.

We have negotiated a new financial tax royalty stability agreement that's in place. A deferral would result in us having
to give up that stability agreement and go back at some future date to deal with it. So there's obviously also cost to
mobilization, de-mobilization. You add all of that up and with the other alternatives that we have of achieving our goals
for this debt reduction and also in view of our long-term positive view about the copper market, we are currently have
our plans of continuing that project but noting that it is an alternative available to us if market conditions are such that
we need to act on it.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: All right Richard. And if I could just have a follow up, so the timing of the underground
development in Indonesia, is that being pushed out a little bit because of the unfortunate incident there? And just to
follow up there and how is that going to affect – you're talking about the transition to 100% underground in kind of that
2016, 2017 timeframe. How should we think about that now?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, our work in the underground development was interrupted for a period of time as a
result of the accident. This is one area of our operations that throughout the strike and the labor issues of 2011, 2012
progressed very well. We have a great underground development team that Mark leads and our guys on the ground lead
and that was really, that project was really in many ways going ahead of schedule for us, and so while this does
represent a period of time where we had to divert attention away from it and we suspended operations, we don't feel
that we are significantly off schedule for meeting our targets.
Now, as we get down to the last period of time of mining in the pit and so forth, there's likely to be changes as we try to
look for ways of maximizing the ore body, but at this point we feel we'll be prepared to transition to underground when
the time is right. Just for information purposes – I know, Tony, you're well familiar with this – we've been mining,
we've been block caving since the early 1980s at Grasberg in a successful way. In our current, full operating mode
there, the underground operations provide more than a third of the throughput to our mill and through our DOZ mine.
We are also expanding the [ph] deck ore body (51:28) at depth with the deep MLZ zone which is scheduled really to
start in 2015, and so all of that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to make this transition in an effective way and
we're going to be prepared for it. Mark, do you have...
<A - Mark J. Johnson>: No, that's correct. We still show deep MLZ starting up in early 2015. The Grasberg block
cave is still on schedule to be ready for us at the end of the pit. We did have some float in the schedule between the end
of the pit and the start of the block-cave, about six months. As Richard said, prior to this incident we were exceeding
our development meters. As we got the okay to start back up in those work areas, we really picked up without any
issue, so we're optimistic that we'll be ready for those projects to start up on time.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And I'll just point everybody to slide 42 in your reference slides which gives you a
schedule of how this fits together. Thanks, Tony.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. It's Jorge with DB. Just a quick question. Maybe this is for
Jim Flores. I wanted to understand. The last guidance that was published before the deal was consummated was from
December, and that showed about an oil and gas equivalent graph there showing 78 million barrels of oil equivalent for
2014 and 94 for 2015. Those numbers have been pared back significantly to an average of roughly 60 for both of those
years. I do understand that some of this may be just dropping out the ultra-deep stuff, but even on an apples-to-apples
basis it would seem that you're cutting your implied BOE guidance there by about 12% on average for 2014 and 2015
and I just wanted to understand what was driving that.
<A - James C. Flores>: Jorge, there has been a modification of the expectations. Obviously we've reduced CapEx
about 20%. The change there has really reduced the production growth rate at the Eagle Ford from a 15% growth rate
to a 20% decline rate, but we saved $400 million of CapEx, or $300 million of CapEx there specifically and we

generated $300 million of free cash flow, so a $600 million swing in free cash flow. And then these low copper price
environments, that's one of the things when you have $110 Brent and LLS oil, you can be a cash flow contributor just
showing the flexibility of our assets there. The leases are all owned by us, held by production. We can ramp back up
the drilling and ramp back up the production but we thought it was prudent from the standpoint of facing debt
reductions and low copper prices to generate free cash flow. So that's one area that happened.
Additionally, the scheduling of equipment and completions in the ultra-deep, as you mentioned right there, was another
area, and then the third area is the deep water Gulf of Mexico scheduling has been accelerated. And what I mean by
accelerated, we have three drill ships planned to be in the Gulf of Mexico next year drilling wells on all of our
properties. That requires us to accelerate the development of the tie-back facilities to our main production facilities.
And when you do that, it takes there's a bit of construction time at each one of those facilities, somewhere between 45
to 60 days.
Under the accelerated development plan, which will pay huge dividends in 2015 and 2016. In 2014, however, we have
scheduled three major platform modification periods of 60 days each which all hit in the same year, which have the
effect of reducing the volumes during that year but instead of having it spread out over three years during that earlier
forecast. So when you amplify that shut down, which is basically a positive long term – because it allows us to bring in
all the additional production and meet those goals of triple our production out in the Gulf of Mexico on the oil side and
the gas side in the next five years – it's unfortunate from a modeling perspective. But I hope that gives you some
framework between the Eagle Ford, the ultra-deep and the scheduling in the deep water to why we've modified our
volume. But however, we've been able to maintain our free cash flow because of the modifications in CapEx.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: And Jim, sorry, is the idea of not bringing forward the Eagle Ford cash flow to run as
you're saying to save cash flow to contribute something up to the Freeport holding company to help in the deleveraging
process? Or are you still standing by the idea that the oil and gas assets broadly speaking are free cash flow neutral to
the deleveraging process?
<A - James C. Flores>: Both. We're going to be sending cash flow up to the corporation that, depending on our oil
price. Our oil prices are significantly stronger than $100 a barrel price in our models and so forth. That could mean
additional – every $10 is additional $350 million to $400 million of additional cash flow. At least, it's going to be
funding its own CapEx when you talk about reducing CapEx and reducing volumes in the strong price environment we
can do that. And that's not always the case but that's what's going to happen going forward. We will cover our costs.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Great. Thanks. And sorry, if I could just have a follow-up question with Richard, just on
the Indonesian side of the fence, all these changes that again the Indo government continues to propose in terms of the
banning of concentrate and raw material exports out of the country. Can you again confirm that you are unaffected by
these potential regulatory changes there?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We have under our contracted work which is a, as you know Jorge was just for – to
make sure that I say this. The contract has – was adopted by the Indonesian government. Has a status of law. And under
that contract, it provides us the right to export our concentrates. In 2009, the government passed a law which restricts
exports of ore that a Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has adopted a regulation that extends that to
concentrates and that's where you hear this comments that come out of Indonesia which, as a democratic society, you
hear a lot of comments as you do hear in the press.
So, we are working in connection with seeking an extension of our contract, which we have the rights to have, that
extension, requires government approval to finds ways of working with the government cooperatively to reach a
mutually satisfactory answer to this. We have advised the government that we will work with any entities that seeks to
develop smelters. We have a commitment to supporting businesses in Indonesia, but doing that in a way that protects
the interest of our shareholders. And we are continuing those discussions. Recently government officials have targeted
completing our, and others' contracts of work discussions this year, and we are prepared to do that and hopefully that
will be successful and from a timing standpoint. But we have confidence, absolute confidence about our ability to
continue to operate as evidenced by the investments we're making in our underground mines which will be generating
their cash flows essentially after 2021, which is the extension period.

Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you. How is it going with the labor negotiations? You mentioned in the, press release that it
has re-started. I was just wondering if you expect it to go to the end, or do you think there will be a conclusion before
the contract is finished in September and in November?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Thank you, Sal. The labor negotiations just had their kick-off meeting in early
May, right before we had the accident on May 14. So it was suspended until the last couple of weeks when we
re-started our operations, and the preliminary discussions have begun. There is a recognition by all interested parties,
including the union, our management, the local community, the central government, that a strike would not be in
anybody's interest. And so we start out from that standpoint. We had a frame work for dealing with wage adjustment
that was part of our agreement in 2011 in the last negotiations where we had the extended strike. We're certainly
prepared to work with the union on a timely basis. The union has made public comments within the last week that they
are targeting completing the negotiations quickly. And so that's the goal right now. So we will just continue to work,
and report to you as that progresses, but that's the frame work that we're really starting the discussions right now.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Okay. And one more thing on the underground operation, the ramp-up is going to be another year,
it looks like, the middle of 2014 you mentioned in the press release. I was just wondering, is it – are you being more
cautious? Or is it normal that it takes that long from about 40,000 pounds per day to about 80,000 per ton, which is the
optimal level you want to be?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Sal, I know you've watched us for a long time. You watched us develop the DOZ
initially, and you saw that's just the nature, and block-caving operations that ramp ups take time. We're working on it as
quickly as we can safely do it. We certainly hope to be able to do it before the middle of next year, and we're making
progress now in achieving that. As always, our guys is we set these plans on a basis that we have confidence that we
can achieve them. And then we work on trying to maximize those plans as we go forward. We've got lot of success
doing that historically. And so we're tackling it. We're going at it full stream, full steam on a safe basis, and I think we
have a good chance of beating it. Mark?
<A - Mark J. Johnson>: That's right. You know, we have a number of objections in the DOZ, just not tonnage. We've
got a very high-grade section of the ore body that's in the skarn. We balance that with the diorites that are higher in
gold. And so our schedules, although tonnage is one of the measures, we have a lot of things that we're managing.
We're going at it to maximize the value of DOZ. We've got some ongoing repairs that were there pre-existing the
incident, and we're picking up and we're making good progress on that. The ramp-up to date is gone or exceeded what
we'd expected just for these last couple weeks.

business? And also what do you think an appropriate level of maintenance spending for the copper business will look
like at that time?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks. You know we're focused on these expansion projects. And the expansion at
Cerro Verde and Morenci is basically coming in on unit costs that consistent with our current operations. At Tenke, that
expansion also, unit cost is consistent with current operations. We keep working, because of that higher grades of that
ore there, we believe we have the opportunity of driving unit costs down. A lot of our costs deal with logistics and
power that are – well, we have cheap power now, but we have power supply concerns. And all of that just ties into
doing business in that particular country and that particular location. So we – we're focused on that.
At Grasberg, transition to underground period will allow that mine to continue as a world class mine from a cost, unit
cost standpoint. And that all depends on the price of fuel, the price of gold and so forth, but it'll be high volumes, low
cost. Then if you look beyond that in the longer range future for Freeport is we have this enormous reserve base and
resource base. We'll reach production levels of about 5 billion pounds a year. And at $2 copper, we have proved and
probable reserves of in excess of 100 billion pounds. And then we have resources beyond that of equivalent amounts of
identified copper with our existing mines.
Over half of that's in the United States and it's typical of our current production. Relatively low grades, large resources,
but we see those costs coming in consistent with the level of our current operations. So you need to – just like I was
talking about in the oil and gas business, you need to look at gas and oil separately. In our business, you need to look at
Indonesia as one set of assets; Africa as one set of assets with tremendous growth opportunities, very high grades; and
then in Americas, the standard of what the global copper industry has available to it, is resources that have relatively
low grades.
The thing that we have as a benefit in relation to the rest of the industry is ours are brownfield expansions. And the
projects that are challenging are greenfield expansion with low grades and big infrastructure development, lots of
pre-stripping and those sorts of things which we don't have with our operations. So we think with a positive copper
movement going forward for a very long period of time we will have a series of growth opportunities that take time,
take permitting, take resources. That's why copper prices are above and likely to continue to be above production costs.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Great. And one follow-up if I may. Can you characterize incremental CapEx or savings
opportunities? Is that going to be somewhat market dependent where if the copper price were to remain weak then you
would look to accelerate those types of plans? Or do you think that the $1.9 billion you've announced is the first layer
of that process and there's incremental savings opportunities you're going to look to pursue regardless of the market
climate over the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I can't say enough about the way Red and his team have approached this. We saw
the situation and the market volatility develop in June. We saw the need to reduce our debt and our guys went at it in a
very disciplined and quick way just like we did in 2008-2009. We don't see this situation as anywhere near the
challenges or the fears of 2008-2009, but we started this, as I said, as a first step. It's a continuing process and we'll be
looking at our business in mining and oil and gas with a continuation of doing it, and of course, if market conditions
deteriorate, we'll have to do more and we have the ability to do more both from cost reduction activities and then from
being innovative in the way that we extract value out of this broad set of assets and that could lead to lots of situations;
joint venture arrangements in both sets of assets, we've looked at MLP opportunities, we've looked at other types of
kind of financial engineering type things. We just have a lot of options to do it.
The message that all of us wanted to get across to you today is the message our board has given us. And I know we've
read some skepticism about it because of low copper prices, but we are committed to maintaining a strong balance
sheet and we've got ways of doing it.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Duarte with Omega Advisors.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Good morning, guys. On the potential oil and gas asset sale, can you give us a little more
detail around the assets, things like commodity mix and reserves associated with the asset and CapEx? And the second
question is conceptually speaking, how did you arrive at this asset as being appropriate for a sale?
<A - James C. Flores>: Adam, this is Jim. We're right in the beginning or early stages of the sales process and we've
signed confidentiality agreements with buyers in the process of getting that process started, so I don't want to give a
whole lot of, I don't want to expand on a bunch of details that are in that process. But what we're looking for is
somewhere between $500 million to $700 million worth of capital out of the Gulf of Mexico Shelf business. The Gulf
of Mexico Shelf conventional is an area that is not a primary growth target for our company. There's other companies
out there that see opportunities out there and the risk profile that more fits their needs.
As Richard talked about and Jim Bob has also expounded on is the large diversity of assets we have and growth
opportunities but the thing really – the focus on is the high quality of our asset base and the high quality of the growth
opportunities, that we're going to prune off the ones that don't fit our profile. And so that's basically what we do and in
an aspect like the Gulf of Mexico, which is so dynamic, we do have a large position there on the shelf in the Gulf of
Mexico and also in the Gulf Coast as well as deep water. So the process of trimming back in an area and then also
re-establishing based on seismic interpretation and so forth is always a possibility.
So this is basically one of the easiest places to re-allocate our manpower resources to our existing assets and still raise a
significant amount of capital in a business that just doesn't fit the new profile of Freeport-McMoRan.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Okay, thanks. So is it safe to say that sort of in the hierarchy of criteria, growth – when you
look at your oil and gas assets, growth is – or the ability to achieve growth is very, very high on the list?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well it's two forms. In this large framework of Freeport you can see where free cash flow is
becoming a big aspect for the oil and gas business but not only – we've always focused on it in our business but we've
always used it as reinvestment capital. There's a return on assets and a return on capital structure here at Freeport that
we have to adjust to and blend to and therefore some of our assets like California and Eagle Ford and so forth, if we can
find ways to maximize them through structures like Richard talked, we were looking at – seriously looking at an MLP
structure that makes – that would make a lot of sense when we're trading at 4.5 cash flow, when you can start trading it
at 8 times cash flow of your assets that qualify.
Of all those things, this new family of assets here at Freeport between the copper, oil and gas and gold has given us an
opportunity to be more flexible in structure and try to wring out that value and also accelerate not only the growth of
our volumetric assets like the deep water and the ultra-deep and assets like that but also some of our free cash flowing
assets, be able to wring out value there through the innovative MLP structure. So as we continue to research this and
start thinking about it putting together – and think about it even if that's on the copper side – I think it's going to be
exciting days ahead of real value realization. We don't need to create a lot of value, we need to get realized for the
value we've already created in these assets especially at these oil prices.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And I'll just say, just like I was talking about the growth from the resource base in
mining, these growth opportunities in the deep water from these big structures and the undeveloped, unexploited nature
of the resource there that we'll now have access to. The ultra-deep exploration leverage that we have there, this really
significant position in Haynesville and the U.S. natural gas business, which we all believe has the opportunity to have a
lot of value down the road. As we deal with this near-term directive to reduce debt we've all got our eyes on the
long-term ability to grow across our set of businesses.
<A - James C. Flores>: And just a point, everybody, remember the Analyst Day presentation. Those were not
exploratory opportunities. We have a long list of development opportunities. Our cup runneth over on growth
opportunities and the aspect of present value of those in today's market and also our, the reserves that are going to grow
is one of the high priorities, especially in this de-leveraging market. So we're totally in sync on all of this.

Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Can you just start, Richard, a clarification please, during the
Analyst Day, you mentioned CapEx and divestments and savings of about $1.5 billion. So are the asset sales in addition
to the $1.9 billion you're presenting now?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Yes. Okay. That's easy. Next, would it be possible to provide us with color on, as to the oil and
gas capital expenditures? Provide us a percentage of how much is being allocated to each one of the regions?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Each one of the regions. Slide 24 shows the aggregate oil and gas capital expenditures.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: There's also, Oscar, this is Kathleen, in the press release on page 13 shows what we
incurred in June and what the outlook looks like for the second half of the year, which was $1.3 billion in total, $400
million for the deep water, similar amount in the Eagle Ford and $200 million in the ultra-deep.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: All right. Kathleen and Richard, I'm just trying to assess how much of this, I mean Jim talked
about the decline in CapEx in the Eagle Ford. And I wanted to assess how much capital is included for each one of
those. I can check back with you if that's easier.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Good. But that's, for everybody's purposes look at that, and Oscar, give us a call
and we'll follow-up with you on it.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Great. And then...
<A - James C. Flores>: Oscar, just the Eagle Ford specific, we're cutting, we're going from about $600 million in
CapEx in the Eagle Ford down to about $300 million of CapEx, Eagle Ford specific. So if that helps you in the
meantime.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And we're maintaining capital expenditure in California to keep the production volumes
up, and then...
<A - James C. Flores>: Accelerate the deep water.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The deep water is where we have a chance of really having major incremental big hits to
create shareholder value, and that's the focus for future growth near-term and longer-term.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Now, that's helpful. Thank you. And then similarly with respect to operating costs, you
gave us a global $19 a barrel, would it be possible to – on a later date I don't know if it's possible to get a segmentation
for the different areas of oil and gas production.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: There's a slide, Oscar, in the back in reference slides which takes you through that. Just let
me check the number, here. I think it's...
<A - James C. Flores>: 31.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: 31. It shows you by region what the operating cost profile looks like.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you for taking my question. As it relates to the ultra-deep gas, could you explain how
and when you'll decide to double up versus hold your cards for the big winners and losers? And specifically, the Davy
Jones 1 and 2. And I'm not – by no means to, please don't misunderstand me that it's a bad idea. I just think that heat
and pressure and temperature varies greatly from spot to spot. So some are going to be easier to complete, and others
won't. Specifically last month when you described at 30,000 feet, the Davy Jones drill muds solidifying, it almost
sounded like the pressure and temperature is like a brick kiln, and fracking lends itself to sedimentary layers of shale as
opposed to bricks. So that's kind of my thought process. You know how the Comstock in the 1870s, the miners took ice
baths every 30 minutes because it was so hot. In other places, it's not like that and the conditions will vary from spot to
spot.
<A - James R. Moffett>: You say that's why we've been waiting on the results of wells like Lomond. Lomond is to the
north of Davy Jones. We've been waiting on the data from [indiscernible] (1:20:30). We're looking at all of that and
we're also looking at the deep water. There's some new information where you have the so-called inboard, outboard
Wilcox. And then you refine that there. The sedimentary character of the rock changes significantly as you go from the
southern end of the basin to the middle of the basin. Call it inboard, outboard. We're going to have that same thing. And
as we go onshore, as we tried to explain to you, when we're in shallower depths and our temperature is going down, our
pressure is going down. But as far as mud solidifying, bricks and all of that, it is not near as [ph] sedimentary (1:21:18)
as you described it.
So but the answer is, as I've said to you before as an example, if you look at the desk you're sitting in front of, if you
take into it the four bore holes that we have through the Wilcox on the shelf and onshore, and [ph] cover it up with less
than a quarter of your net (1:21:38). And we're trying to figure out a 200-square mile area onshore, 200 square miles,
that are on the shale, we're going to get a lot of information. But the sensitivities that you're talking about, that's all part
of the trying to pick the sweet spot. Every play in exploration, whether it's a shale play or the deep water, there's a
sweet spot. And then we're getting enough data now, about when we're going to be able to do that.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Hi, everyone. A question for Jim, I don't know if you've talked a bit about the exploration
things, but could you just maybe summarize any, a couple of two or three things where you do expect an update in third
or fourth quarter of this year, on exploration side?
<A - James C. Flores>: Sure, Paretosh. On initially the Lomond North and our plans for going forward on Lineham
Creek, those two projects and the ultra-deep will be involved in our decision-making process in the third and fourth
quarter. Other than that, it's going to be our Holstein drilling as our rig becomes active on our platform. First time it's
been active in about 10 years, that we've got a lot of great projects to drill. So we'll begin drilling our deep water
projects in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Then in 2014 you're looking at our [ph] Terra (1:23:14) project that's going to be drilled. It's a very high, high potential
Lucius look-alike project that's going to be drilled in second quarter of 2014 to start off, as well as following up with
additional projects like England and maybe Martinique. So we'll have a full schedule and calendar starting in 2014
going forward of our exciting exploration that we're leveraging into, but as far as 2013, it's Lomond, Lineham Creek
and then our Holstein development starting in the deep water.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Great. Thanks. And second and final question on Grasberg probably from Mark. Is there a total
mill rate or the DOZ mill rate that you're targeting for the year-end 2013?

<A - Mark J. Johnson>: We'll be – in DOZ we'll be up to 70,000 tons at the end of the year. The total mill rate will be
210, 220. We'll also be bringing up the [ph] Big Dawson (1:24:26). We'll likely begin to ramp up again. We took some
of the resources from [ph] Big Dawson (1:24:29) in the third quarter, allocated them to development crews and to the
DOZ, so we'll be at 210 to 220. 2014 will be roughly 225.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Great. Thanks. Really appreciate that.

Your final question will come from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Hi. Good morning. Could you give a little more color on the commentary you made earlier
about considering refinancing the balance sheet and the higher cost of debt, and in particular, talk to any updated views
on how Freeport looks at potentially calling some of the PXP bonds?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Carly, this is Kathleen. That is a priority of ours. We've got just under $2 billion in debt that
we can use equity clawbacks for and so we'll be looking to do that either with cash flow generated, or asset sales or
refinancing, but that debt will be our most economic debt to repay in the near term, so we're very focused on that.
We've also got a series of securities within the assumed debt that have calls over the next few years and so we'll be
looking at that and we're going to be opportunistic about that and looking at what makes sense economically, but it is
an objective of ours over time to refinance the balance sheet into more of an investment grade type of a balance sheet.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Great. Thanks. And is there a specific timing that we should be thinking about for at least the
call back portion of the bonds?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: We're going to be looking to do that just as soon as we can. We're looking at free cash flow
generation as well as some of these other initiatives that are underway.
<Q - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Wonderful. Thank you.
