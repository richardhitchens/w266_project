MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference
Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President Investor Relations. Please
proceed.
Jennifer K. Driscoll
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter earnings call and webcast for Campbell Soup
Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice
President, CFO and Chief Administrator Officer; Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Anna
Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Denise will kick us off today with her perspective on the third quarter.
Craig will then give you the financial and segment results for the quarter, our nine-month highlights and expectations
for fiscal 2013. After that, we'll take your questions.
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this

keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.
As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions
and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to enhanced risks.
Please refer to slide two in the presentation or to the company's most recent Form 10-K – I'm sorry, slide three, and
subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those
anticipated in our forward-looking statements.
Campbell completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms one week into this current fiscal year. The acquisition is now
included in our results and it drove most of the year-over-year changes in our first nine months. In September, we
announced a restructuring program designed to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure. Our third quarter reported
results reflect $20 million pre-tax of costs associated with that program. Last, we signed commercial agreements with
two companies in Mexico in February and our third quarter reported results reflect $1 million of associated pre-tax
costs related to those agreements.
Our remarks today for the balance of our presentation will be on an adjusted basis, including Bolthouse Farms
operating results for 38 of the 39 weeks, but excluding its transaction cost and the restructuring charges. Since our
presentation includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we've provided a reconciliation of the measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation. These
slides along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials also can be found on our website accessible
online or on your mobile devices with the Campbell IR app.
I've got one more thing to plug. We'd like to cordially invite our analysts to our Annual Analyst Day at Campbell
World Headquarters. This year's event will be held on the morning of Wednesday, July 24, and will feature
presentations by Denise Morrison, Craig Owens and several other Campbell leaders. It will also be your opportunity to
meet two of them who are new, including Luca Mignini, our new President of Campbell International; and Jeff Dunn,
Head of Bolthouse Farms.
After the formal remarks that day, we'll offer Q&A before concluding our Analyst Day with a very tasty luncheon
featuring Campbell and Bolthouse products. We hope you'll join us either via webcast or better yet live at World
Headquarters here in Camden, New Jersey. Watch for more information later.
And with that, let me turn it over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As you've seen in our
earnings release this morning, we are very pleased by our results for the third quarter. Our net sales were up 15% or 4%
excluding the impact of Bolthouse Farms, which we acquired in the first quarter of the year. Our adjusted EBIT was up
9% or 3% excluding the acquisition. Our adjusted EPS was up 11%. These results were driven by outstanding sales and
profit gains in U.S. Simple Meals, led by our U.S. Soup business whose sales were up 14%. There were also strong
contributions from Bolthouse Farms and solid sales performance in Global Baking and Snacking including both
Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's.
As you've also seen, we revised our previous guidance for the full-year. We now expect to end the fiscal year with both
net sales and adjusted EBIT at the high end of the growth ranges we previously forecasted for the year, and adjusted
EPS above our previous guidance. In my comments this morning, I'll offer my perspective on the performance of our
Soup business in the quarter and comment on the progress of our innovation program in U.S. Simple Meals. I also want
to talk about our plans for improving the performance of two businesses that did not do well in quarter three, U.S.
Beverages and North America Foodservice.

I'll say a few words about Global Baking and Snacking and Bolthouse Farms. Finally, I'll offer some thoughts on how
our results for the third quarter relate to our overarching strategy for the business. Craig will then provide a more
detailed review of our third quarter financials and then we'll open up the call for your questions. So first, U.S. Soup.
Our U.S. Soup business delivered exceptionally strong third quarter performance. Condensed sales increased 11%,
sales our ready-to-serve soups increased 18% and sales in the broth business also rose 18%. Overall, the top-line in
U.S. Soup grew by 14% for the quarter. These are clearly impressive results.
For the most part, we delivered these results by doing what we said we would do in our Soup business, focusing
relentlessly on improving our execution against the drivers of demand. We've improved product quality and packaging.
We have more effective advertising and consumer promotion and better in-store merchandising. Our new product
varieties have been well received by consumers. Our price realization has continued to work. Our Chunky Soup
franchise posted strong double-digit growth in the third quarter behind a number of brand-building initiatives, including
increased promotional spending, introduction of new varieties, improvement in quality and a return to more impactful
NFL-themed advertising.
Overall, we have maintained competitive levels of advertising while reducing less productive spending and supporting
new product innovation. There's little doubt that we had some help from the weather in the third quarter and for the
Soup season. Although it's hard to quantify the impact of that factor with any precision, colder weather clearly helped
Soup sales in the quarter as we cycled last year's weather, which is one of the warmest winters on record. We also
delivered stronger execution and laid the groundwork for sustainable growth. We are very encouraged by the progress
we've made in this business.
Year-to-date, both Campbell Soups and the wet soup category in the United States have grown 4%. We are confident
that we can now drop the word stabilize in our strategy and focus on driving sustainable, profitable growth in North
America Soup and Simple Meals.
While I'm on the subject of U.S. Simple Meals, I'd like to comment on our progress in innovation. As I just mentioned,
strong sustaining innovation has had a positive impact on the performance of our Simple Meals portfolio. Appealing
new product varieties and resolute focus on improved quality are helping us reinforce and expand the vitality of our
brands with our loyal consumer base. But as you know, we're also working hard to expand our core franchise in North
America to reach new consumer groups and a new generation of consumers. In combination, Campbell's Go soups and
Campbell's Skillet Sauces added approximately one point of growth for U.S. Simple Meals both in the third quarter and
year-to-date. While sales are still small, we're committed to these products and are pleased by the potential they've
shown. Let me explain.
Premium shelf-stable soup is a fast-growing segment of the Soup category with higher retail price points and primarily
out of the can packaging. Campbell's Go is the third entry in our premium shelf-stable soup platform following
Campbell's Slow Kettle and our Gourmet Bisques. The rate of repeat on Campbell's Go soup continues to be strong.
Our challenge with this product is to build trial, which was impacted by the timing of our marketing efforts.
Since we've turned on our marketing, which has been largely digital, we've seen improvements in sales in this line.
Campbell's Skillet Sauces are a breakthrough concept with a high potential for reward. With this product, we're
working with our customers to create an entirely new category of unique, convenient and versatile dinner sauces.
Because this is a new idea, retailers across the country have shelved the product in many different locations in the store
and those locations did not create the scale necessary to capture the attention of shoppers.
Additionally, the resets in these various sections occurred at different times of the year, so with some retailers, we had a
later start that we had planned. We now have a clearer understanding of the best way to shelve our new dinner sauces
and this will be a major thrust for us in fiscal 2014. But the good news is, is that consumer repeat is very strong, those
who try it, buy it again, and as I mentioned at CAGNY, next year we will expand this platform with the launch of
Campbell's Slow Cooker Sauces, which address another large dinner behavior. Compared with our sustaining
innovations like our new varieties of Chunky Soup, sales from our breakthrough innovations in Simple Meals remain
small, but I'm neither surprised nor discouraged by the fact that we've had some growing pains in introducing

brand-new ideas into the marketplace and we've learned a lot from the launches this year.
In fiscal 2014, we'll refine our approach to the accessibility and appeal of these product lines and we anticipate that
over time both of these platforms will contribute meaningful growth to our portfolio.
I want to turn now to U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice whose third quarter performance were
disappointing. First, Beverages. Campbell now competes across a broader spectrum of the immense Beverage category
than we did a year ago. With our acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, we are now actively participating in super-premium
fresh beverages, a fast-growing segment in which we're performing quite well with retail sales up more than 20% this
year as measured by IRI. Our historic roots, of course, are in shelf-stable juices, a category which has been and
continues to be weak in the U.S. We compete in the premium segment of the shelf-stable category with V8, 100%
vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion, and in the value segment with V8 Splash. The value segment is currently one of the
bright spots and V8 Splash is doing nicely. We will continue to market it aggressively.
The premium segment of shelf-stable juice is weaker than the total category, and that is where our issues are now. Our
core V8, 100% vegetable juice business is down and over the past few years new players have entered with other fruit
and vegetable blends that compete with our V8 V-Fusion line. Our innovation in this space has had mixed results. As I
said before, we believe that we can improve the performance of our shelf-stable beverage business by taking a page
from the playbook we've successfully used in U.S. Soup. So we're focused now on two things.
The first is laser-like attention to the basics with excellence in execution against all the drivers of demand. We've
recently improved the quality of our V8, 100% vegetable juice products and returned to a proven advertising campaign.
Next year, we'll enhance our packaging.
Second, we're focused on expansion in faster-growing spaces in this category. Our V8 V-Fusion + Energy Drinks and
new V8 V-Fusion juice boxes for kids are performing well and we're growing distribution and increasing marketing
support behind these promising new products. We also plan to launch other new products in the fourth quarter and next
year.
V8 is a very strong brand with unsurpassed credentials in health and wellness. Over time, I believe we can reverse the
declining trends in our shelf-stable Beverage business. We're taking the right steps to do that and we'll provide more
details on our plans at our Analyst Day in July.
I'll now move to North America Foodservice. Although about half of consumer food dollars are spent in away from
home eating occasions, the trends in the foodservice sector particularly restaurants, continue to be affected by
consumers' close management of their discretionary spending in the aftermath of the economic downturn. Our own
foodservice business has been challenged due to the loss of a major restaurant customer and by structural changes in
the sector that have caused us increase trade spending at the expense of margin. However, our fresh soup business in
the retail perimeter continues to be a bright spot with net sales up 8%.
Going forward, we believe we have significant opportunity to grow with national restaurant chains, especially QSRs
and to expand our retail fresh perimeter soup business. We've invested in a new manufacturing line to increase our
capacity to make fresh soup, which will enable our expansion in this space. We're also taking a close look at the
business model for our core foodservice business.
Core foodservice is becoming more complex, more expensive and more commoditized. Industry consolidation and
restaurant cost pressures have reduced profitability for manufacturers and as you'd expect, we're focused on keeping
our costs down. We're moving aggressively to improve the performance of North American Foodservice in short-term,
while laying the foundation for longer-term growth.
Before I conclude, I want to say a few words about two other important Campbell businesses. Global Baking and
Snacking delivered solid top-line performance in the third quarter with organic sales up 6%. At Pepperidge Farm there
were strong sales gains in both our Goldfish crackers and our Pepperidge Farm cookies. Sales in fresh bakery grew
double digits over the prior year. The shelf space opportunity triggered by the Hostess bankruptcy contributed to our
bakery gains in the quarter. Our improved execution also played a role.

We plan to hold on to some of the shelf space gains even after competitors return to the market by continuing to
demonstrate to customers what an expanded premium offering can do for their business. We're also pleased to see solid
sales growth in our Arnott's biscuit business with increases in both savory crackers and sweet cookies and continuing
growth in Arnott's business in Indonesia.
Finally, the addition of the Bolthouse Farms business remains consistent with our plans and the business is performing
very well on both the top and bottom lines across carrots, salad dressings and super-premium beverages. Beverage
innovations launched by Bolthouse this spring are exceeding expectations. We believe this has been a great acquisition
for Campbell and we continue to be extremely excited about the platform it provides us to expand in the fast-growing
packaged fresh category.
I'll close by offering some brief perspective on the big picture. We have said that our overarching goal is to position
Campbell for sustaining, profitable net sales growth by executing against a dual mandate to strengthen our core
business and to invest for long-term growth in faster-growing categories, adjacencies, and geographies. We believe that
we're making good progress in advancing our plan and in our efforts to change the growth trajectory of this company.
Today, we're managing our core business with a clear view of the role of each business in the portfolio and working
hard to optimize the value that each business can deliver.
Superior execution and smart innovation are having an impact on our financial performance in Simple Meals and
Baking and Snacking and we've made significant strides in U.S. Soup. And across the portfolio, we're investing for
long-term growth in faster-growing spaces from packaged fresh to premium soups in the center aisle, to beverages,
baked snacks and Simple Meals that resonate well with consumer groups that represent strategic growth opportunities
for Campbell like Millennials and Hispanics. We're also investing in faster-growing markets like Mexico and
Indonesia. We recognize that there is much more that we have to do to fulfill our dual mandate, including improving
our performance in shelf-stable beverages and foodservice. We know what our challenges are and what we have to do
to address them and we expect to deliver improved results in the businesses that have been lagging this year.
As we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2013, we feel very good about the progress of the last two years. We're also
excited about what lies ahead. We're still in the early days of executing this plan, but we believe our strategies are the
right ones for Campbell and we remain committed to them. You'll see us continue to execute against them with energy
and unsparing focus as we look forward to ongoing dialogue with you about the results, particularly at our upcoming
Analyst Day in July, where we'll provide more details about our fiscal 2014 plans.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Craig for a closer look at the third quarter.
B. Craig Owens
Thanks, Denise. Good morning. I'll spend a few minutes walking through our third quarter results and segment
highlights followed by a brief look at our year-to-date results. We'll wrap up with a full-year sales and earnings
guidance look. As Jennifer mentioned, my discussion of results will exclude the impact of all restructuring programs
for the current and prior years as well as acquisition transaction costs.
For the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.1 billion, a 15% increase reflecting the impact of the Bolthouse Farms
acquisition, which added 11 points. Excluding the acquisition, organic net sales increased by 4%, our best quarterly
growth rate since 2009. EBIT adjusted for restructuring cost, which impacted both the current and prior-year quarters
increased by 9% to $293 million. Of the adjusted EBIT increase, six points came from adding Bolthouse and three
points from growth in the base business primarily driven by a strong performance in U.S. Simple Meals. Adjusted
earnings per share were $0.62, an 11% increase from the third quarter of 2012.
As you can see on slide 22, 11 points of the 15% increase in net sales were attributable to Bolthouse. The growth in
organic sales reflected five points of volume mix growth, pricing contributions of a point and the negative impact of
increased promotional spending of two points. The favorable volume mix was from gains in our three largest segments,
U.S. Simple Meals, Global Baking and Snacking and International Simple Meals and Beverages. The pricing gains

were primarily due to our previous list price increase on U.S. condensed soup as well as increases in Canadian soup and
in Pepperidge Farm. The promotional spending variance is primarily due to higher rates of spending in U.S. Simple
Meals, U.S. Beverages and North America Foodservice.
Excluding the impact of current quarter restructuring programs, our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 210
basis points to 36.7%. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse, which
operates with a lower gross margin structure. Excluding that acquisition, the impacts of cost inflation and increased
promotional spending were largely offset by productivity improvements, the benefit of higher selling prices and
favorable mix. The inflation rate in cost of goods was approximately 3% for the quarter.
Marketing and selling expenses increased by 2% to $262 million compared to $256 million a year ago. The increase
was primarily driven by the impact of the addition of Bolthouse, higher spending to support innovation efforts and
higher selling expenses partly offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion spending. Despite a 7% decline in
advertising and consumer promotion expense, primarily due to U.S. Soup, we had increased spending in Pepperidge
Farm and we continue to support our new product introductions. Our advertising in Simple Meals remains at
competitive levels.
Administrative expense increased $28 million to $172 million primarily due to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and
higher incentive compensation cost. Net interest expense increased by $4 million, the increase was due to the higher
level of debt incurred to fund the acquisition. Average interest rates on our total debt portfolio were lower. The adjusted
tax rate increased by 20 basis points to 26.3%. The current and prior-year quarters both benefited from adjustments to
reflect lower taxes on foreign earnings. The tax rate in the quarter was lower than the previous forecast and I'll speak to
the impact on the year when I address guidance.
Adjusted net earnings increased by 8% and adjusted net earnings per share increased to $0.62 for the quarter, reflecting
EBIT growth, higher interest expense and a small decline in diluted shares outstanding.
Third quarter segment sales results and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on slide 25. Our U.S. Simple
Meals segment achieved strong sales growth of 11%. Within the segment, U.S. Soup sales rose by 14% driven by
double-digit gains in ready-to-serve, condensed and broth.
U.S. Sauce sales increased 3% compared to the prior year as gains in Prego pasta sauce and Pace Mexican sauces were
partly offset by declines in Campbell's canned pasta. Sales also benefited from the introduction of Campbell's Skillet
Sauces. Our Global Baking and Snacking segment also achieved strong organic sales growth, up 6% with increases in
both Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's.
Sales increase in Pepperidge was driven by growth across fresh bakery, crackers and cookies. Frozen sales declined. In
the bakery business we continue to benefit from the market exit by Hostess with volume gains across most of the
portfolio. The snacks business had another strong quarter reflecting solid growth in Goldfish snack crackers and a
strong sales performance in cookies. Sales at Arnott's increased primarily due to sales growth in Australia in savory
crackers and sweet cookie varieties and strong results in Indonesia.
Organic sales for our International Simple Meals and Beverage segment increased 3% compared to the prior year.
Strong sales gains in Europe and Latin America and growth in the Asia-Pacific region were partly offset by declines in
Canada. Sales in Europe increased due to volume gains in Germany, France and Belgium and Asia-Pacific sales
increased to growth in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan, partially offset by sales declines in Australia.
Sales for the Bolthouse Farms and North America Foodservice segment were $344 million with Bolthouse contributing
$205 million. Organic sales excluding the acquisition declined 10% compared to a year ago. The sales decline in North
America Foodservice reflects the loss of a major restaurant customer and continued higher levels of promotional
spending in our core foodservice business. U.S. Beverage sales decreased by 5% in the quarter, primarily due to the
decline in V8 vegetable juice.
Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals on slide 27, increased significantly, up 30% to $156 million this quarter as
we continue to improve the profitability of this business. The increase reflected strong earnings gains in U.S. Soup,

partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauces, which included investments in new products. Within the segment, the benefit
of higher volumes, increased selling prices and productivity improvements were partly offset by increased promotional
spending.
Earnings of Global Baking and Snaking were comparable to prior-year. Growth at Arnott's was offset by the impact of
currency. For the segment higher sales were offset by increased marketing spend and administrative costs. Within
International Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings increased by 8% primarily due to higher earnings in Europe.
Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages decreased by 27%, primarily due to lower volume on 100% juice varieties, cost
inflation and increased promotional spending.
Operating earnings within Bolthouse and Foodservice segment increased by $7 million composed of a $17 million
addition from Bolthouse Farms and a significant decrease in earnings from North America Foodservice. As with the
sales decline the earnings decline in Foodservices driven by a customer loss and higher trade spending. Bolthouse
Farms is delivering results that are consistent with our acquisition plan.
U.S. Soup sales for the third quarter increased 14% driven by double-digit gains in each of the three large categories.
Sales of condensed soup rose 11% driven by double-digit gains in eating varieties, which benefited from increased
promotional activity and price realization. Ready-to-serve soup increased 18% primarily due to significant volume
driven gains in Campbell's Chunky canned soups. Chunky performed extremely well in the quarter benefiting from new
varieties, increased promotional activity and the return to NFL advertising. Sales also benefited from the launch of
Campbell's Go Soups.
Broth sales increased 18%, benefiting from higher levels of promotional activity, which drove double-digit volume
gains in aseptic broth. Our measured consumer takeaway in the quarter was a robust 10% ahead of category growth.
Sales also benefited from an increase in retail inventories.
Year-to-date U.S. Soup sales increased 5% primarily driven by 9% increase in ready-to-serve soup. Sales of condensed
increased 2% compared to the prior year, while broth sales increased 3%. U.S. Soup consumer takeaway for the first
nine months was up about 4%.
On the next side we look at market share and category performance based on the past 52 weeks for the U.S. Wet Soup
category. The category as a whole rose by 4%. Our sales in measured channels rose 3.4% with gains driven by
ready-to-serve soup, condensed and Swanson Broth. As Denise mentioned, improved execution and the benefit of a
colder winter have contributed to very healthy growth. Campbell's had a 59% market share in the Wet Soup category,
which includes condensed soup, ready-to-serve and broth. All other branded players collectively held a share of 28%,
with a 13% private-label share. These figures are sourced from Symphony IRI's multi-outlet report and are based on
dollars sales.
A brief recap of year-to-date results begins on slide 30. In the first nine months, we reported net sales of $6.8 billion, an
11% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms. Organic net sales increased
by 2%. The organic sales gain was largely driven by growth in U.S. Simple Meals and Baking and Snacking, partly
offset by declines in North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverage. Excluding restructuring and acquisition
transaction cost, adjusted EBIT increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Four points or $46 billion of the increase was attributable
to the Bolthouse operating results, while two points of the growth came from the base business primarily driven by
earnings gains in U.S. Simple Meals partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice.
Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share were $2.19, an 8% increase versus the prior year. The increase reflected EBIT
growth, the benefit of a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, partly offset by higher interest expense.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined 170 basis points year-to-date to 37.2%. The addition of Bolthouse drove
most of that change. Excluding the acquisition the impact of cost inflation and increased promotional spending were
largely offset by productivity improvements and the benefit of higher selling prices. The inflation rate in cost of goods
sold was approximately 3% year-to-date. Marketing and selling expense were $813 million, essentially flat the prior
year. Our planned reduction in marketing spend, principally a 12% reduction in advertising and consumer promotion
expenses offset the impact of Bolthouse Farms and the higher selling expense for the total company. Administrative

expenses for the quarter increased by $65 million, primarily due to the acquisition and to higher compensation and
benefit cost including increases in pension expense.
Net interest expense year-to-date increased by $14 million due to the higher level of debt to fund the acquisition. The
adjusted tax rate declined nine basis points to 30.3%, primarily due to the resolution of state tax matters and recent
changes in U.S. tax law. Consistent with EBIT growth, adjusted net earnings for the first nine months increased 6%,
adjusted EPS benefiting from fewer shares outstanding increased by 8%.
Cash flow from operations was $864 million fiscal year-to-date compared with $838 million in the prior year. Higher
cash earnings and lower benefit plan distributions were partly offset by increased working capital requirements. Capital
expenditures of $205 million were up from $173 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spend
of approximately $330 million.
As we previously announced, we suspended the strategic share repurchase program at the end of fiscal 2012 in order to
reduce the debt incurred to finance the Bolthouse acquisition. However, we continue to repurchase additional shares to
offset dilution from equity compensation programs. Net debt rose to $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, due to the
acquisition partially offset by cash generation. For the first nine months, the company paid dividends of $366 million
including an acceleration of the payment normally made in late April or early May.
This morning we revised our previous fiscal 2013 guidance. We now expect to grow sales at the upper end of the 10%
to 12% range and adjusted EBIT at the upper end of the 4% to 6% range. The adjusted EPS benefiting from a lower
than expected tax rate and the improved EBIT outlook is expected to exceed the previous range forecast of 3% to 5%.
We now expect EPS to grow between 6% and 7%, in the range between $2.58 and $2.62. We are now forecasting a
full-year tax rate of between 30% and 31%. Our guidance includes the estimated impact of Bolthouse Farms and
excludes the impact of acquisition transaction cost and restructuring charges. The Bolthouse Farms acquisition is
expected to contribute approximately $750 million to sales and approximately $0.06 to our adjusted EPS, including the
impact of suspending the strategic share repurchases.
Thank you. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jennifer.

<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Congrats on wrapping up pretty solid Soup season. I wanted to focus on the rest of your business
aside from Soup. I think you've addressed some of the weakness in Beverages and Foodservice; I want to focus on the
Baking side of the business. Top-lines looked great, but year-to-date there's been no bottom-line growth. Can you help
us understand some of the drivers of the margin weakness there?

<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, in the Global Baking and Snacking segment we have continued to cycle. If you'll recall,
last year we had a very difficult year in Australia. We essentially reset trade-spending levels in that market and through
the first three quarters of this year we have been cycling against that reduction and against lower gross margins. The
Pepperidge business has performed at a stronger rate than that through the first three quarters and we are – I guess we're
probably about flat in gross margin at Pepperidge through the first three quarters of the year.
<Q - Jason English>: When are you done cycling that Australian trade spend adjustment? And also if you could
comment a little bit on sort of wheat costs, where your inflation numbers sit and what the outlook is going forward?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, so we should finish cycling the Australian trade adjustment in the fourth quarter. And if
you look at the inflation forecast, this year of course has been a tough one on flours and grains, particularly in the early
part of the year. I think as we look forward, we would expect, although it's a little early to tell in terms of timing of
crops and what not we would expect a more normal inflation rate in those businesses next year.
<Q - Jason English>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.

Our question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi. I guess in Campbell's base business excluding Bolthouse, perhaps if I'm doing my math
right, maybe the gross margin was still down a bit in the quarter despite a really strong, obviously top-line performance
from the high margin Soup business. So I know part of that is obviously trends in Beverages and Foodservice, but
trying to get a bit of additional color maybe on the magnitude of gross margin and the change in the Soup and Simple
Meals segment, just to give us some comfort that the operating leverage that one would expect from that type of sales
growth in Soup was what we'd expect it to be or wasn't compromised in any way.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, so gross margin on Soup and Simple Meals did show the positive impact of the leverage
that you'd be looking for. We don't disclose precisely, but it was up over 150 basis points in the quarter. And you're
right, the things that were depressing the gross margin ex-Bolthouse would have been NAFs and U.S. Beverage, both
of which had pretty significant declines in both – in gross margin largely related to increased promotional spend.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. Very helpful. Thanks very much.

<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess my question goes, I think Denise to maybe it was your comment about or maybe it
was Craig's, about consumption being less than shipments. Is it your sense that – is this a timing issue year-over-year
given how warm it was a year ago? Or is this have to do with retailers being a little bit more optimistic about the
category? Obviously, with your share, you've got good visibility into what's going on, on the shelf. So maybe you could

talk a little bit about that excess inventory.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, so measured consumption was about 10%, sales were about 14%. That implies, and the
tracking data that we have where we help manage inventory, would say the retailer inventories were up a bit. I think the
good news is that most of that inventory was and is on the floor and we would expect to be moving. It's always a little
difficult to forecast. You asked if it was a timing issue, difficult to forecast the fourth quarter. It's such a small quarter
and inventories are certainly going to drop in the fourth quarter and the question is how much they drop relative to what
they dropped last year. But you'd probably expect some of that to come back in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: And so you don't sense that it – because I think we've gone through several years of
inventory declines at retail as the category has shrunk. It isn't – you don't think it's a – well, I mean granted you're going
into the summer, but you don't think it's a function of the retailers becoming a little bit more optimistic about shelf
space?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, I think the really strong sales in the quarter have sort of a natural inflationary impact on
inventories. I mean sales were terrific. They were beyond our own expectations. I think they were probably beyond the
retailer expectations. As so as you went through the quarter I think you saw higher order rates and maybe some of that
will stick, Eric. But retailers have got – I think the primary reason you've seen inventories drop is that retailers have
gotten better and better at managing inventory and we've gotten – we continue to have really high service levels and are
reliable. And so they feel like they can operate on thinner inventory.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: And if I could just – last follow-up. Denise, you sounded a bit more cautious about the new
products versus the last couple of calls. Was there – like any of the inventory build in the soup-to-go line, is it that
material that it could've had an impact? Or – and maybe you could just address how much more spending do you think
is necessary to get a trial up on – or sorry repeat up on the products?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, if I came across as cautious, that's really not the right tone I was trying to set. I'm
actually very optimistic about the platforms of the pouch Go Soups and also the Dinner Sauce segment. What I was
sharing with you were some of the lessons learned from this year's season because one of the things that we do in
running an innovation agenda is we track what went right and what didn't and what can we learn from it and then how
do we reapply so we get better in the next round.
And so we've got very, very, very high hopes for these platforms and we believe they'll continue to build over time.
The thing that I really watch is the repeat rate. Because, right now, the challenge we have is just to build trial because
the repeat is really strong. So those that do try it, buy it. And what we also are seeing is that it is attracting affluent
consumers and more Millennials, which was what the objective was. And that's been highly incremental to the
franchise.

Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great. Thanks a lot. Just one follow-up to Andrew's question on the Soup margins. Can you
just say again, was it volume leverage that predominantly drove the margin expansion or was it better balance on
pricing inflation and inflation, Craig?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Largely volume, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. Then my main question is just on advertising and consumer promotion. So it's
somewhat odd perhaps to see just the incredible performance of Soup and then in conjunction with that the comments
that A&C spending are down on Soup. So, Denise, can you talk about the A&C spending on Soup? Can you reduce it

further because some of it would apparently maybe be just ineffective? So is there just A&C that we can cut out that
wasn't really doing anything? But yet this Soup business with the new products and other activities can continue to
grow?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I would largely agree with your assessment. I think that you can expect that advertising in
fiscal 2014 will not be higher as a percent of sales on the base business but we will continue to be advertising at
competitive levels, and I'm talking about the Soup and Simple Meal business here, and we will be funding and
advertising our new product innovation. We have and continue to eliminate unproductive spending and I also believe
that we have made incredible strides in terms of the effectiveness of our advertising. And the example is Chunky Soup
where we did return to the NFL-themed advertising and that resonated very well with consumers.
But I think advertising has to be viewed as only a part of the marketing mix. I mean we've made quality improvements.
We've had new varieties that have added some news to the base and excitement. And we've also had much more
effective promotion on the brands. So, I think all in all, advertising is finding its way in the marketing mix.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: But, David, I wouldn't expect to see further significant cuts in advertising as we move forward.
As Denise said, I don't think we'll restore the spending because it looks like what we're doing is working and of course
we'll continue to look for where there's ineffective spending to cut that out, but I think if you think about it in terms of
total level, probably not big reductions left.

Next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Thank you for taking the question. If I could just ask what your thoughts are right now
on the international M&A environment, just given sort of your prior commentary on opportunities to grow into
geographic adjacencies and one housekeeping item, if you could provide your D&A number for the quarter? Thank
you.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So I think the question on the international environment for M&A is, as we've said a number
of times before, we do believe that we can find opportunities internationally to get us into markets that for the
long-term sustainability of growth for the business would be good for us because they're faster growing markets than
our core markets. I think that we've also said, and it also continues to be true, there are not a huge number of targets out
there and the targets that are out there tend to be pretty hotly contested. We have a pipeline. We started working that
pipeline as Denise came in to the CEO position and we sort of shifted our focus on M&A. You haven't seen us make an
international acquisition yet and that's largely a result of the fact that we're going to be pretty disciplined as we look at
these things.
Some of them take time because they are family-owned businesses and it's a matter of building relationships and
waiting for the moment when the family is ready to exit and sell. So we keep working at it. We continue to be
disciplined. We think we'll eventually land some good opportunities, but obviously not going to comment on any
specific situation.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right, to build on that, in addition to M&A, we are also pursuing partnerships where they
make sense. So for example, our partnerships in Mexico with Jumex and La Costeña to do a distribution and
manufacturing agreement for that Beverage business and Soup and Simple Meal business is pretty exciting for us. So
we'll continue to look for those opportunities as well.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: To address your last question the depreciation and amortization for the nine months is
about $318 million and that's up significantly versus the prior year because it includes accelerated depreciation on our
restructuring programs and also includes Bolthouse Farms.

Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, Thilo.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Denise, you basically announced the Soup business stabilized to date. Where would you have to
get the U.S. Beverage business to make that same kind of announcement? Is there any kind of top-line growth rate or
margin target that you have in mind? And if so, which one would be more important, top-line or margin?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm not really giving guidance on the Soup business going forward at this point in terms of
a number. But suffice it to say that we believe that we've focused on fixing the fundamentals on better execution, on a
better optimization of the drivers of demand and a better understanding of the portfolio roles for these brands. And we
believe that we can say we've stabilized and now we're going to profitably grow as we go forward.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: And I think on the beverage business, Thilo, clearly we are, as Denise said in her opening,
we're not happy with the declines. Part of it is category, the category of shelf-stable juice has been very weak. Clearly
we're doing better with portions of that category. Our premium – super premium fresh juices out of Bolthouse are doing
very, very well. Our Splash entry in less than 100% juice is doing well, but the core of our business and the core of our
profitability, the red juice business and the V8 V-Fusion business have not done well. I guess by definition, stability
would be to arrest the decline, but we think that over time the Beverage business can grow.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. I just did some quick weather math trying to look at the number of heating
days year-to-date 2013, and it looked like the number of heating days really weren't that different from 2011, 2010 and
2009. It really was 2012 was the anomaly. So I guess – I know you said it's hard to predict or hard to estimate the
impact of weather, but would you say that this was kind of a normal weather year or was it a colder-than-usual weather
year nine months year-to-date? Thanks.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, so it is both hard to predict and to quantify the impact of weather, and frankly it's not
something that we control, so we don't spend a lot of time focused on it. But if you just look at temperature swing,
right. You're right; last year was the more unusual year. It was a very warm winter. This year has actually been slightly
colder than normal. So the swing is about an eight-degree swing as, using the numbers that we have, and it has an
impact. I mean it's undeniable that it has a positive impact.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And lastly on the dividend, have you looked at raising the dividend, and normally it
happens in fourth quarter I thought. What's your status there?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: We have not announced any change to the dividend; don't intend to announce any change to
the dividend in this call. It's an issue that the board continues to look at. If you think about over the last couple of years,

Rob, we were down on earnings last year as we went through an intentional reset. We did not decrease the dividend, we
held the dividend, and we've held it as we've sort of grown back to the prior level this year. I think I would look
certainly to next year. We would expect to continue a positive trend, and we would reconsider the dividend at that time.

Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Janney. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Hi. Thank you very much.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: I guess I just wanted to follow up on Rob's line of questioning a little bit. I know, Craig,
it's difficult to quantify and certainly not something you can control on the weather, but are there like – you talked
about an eight-degree swing like, you clearly have some methodology internally for thinking about benchmarking
performance versus weather. If I were going to try to go back and look either within seasons and say adjust, can you
think of a methodology, the best way to do that? Do you look at days below 50 degrees or days below 40 degrees? And
how does that vary across markets?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Jonathan, I mean, the question itself sort of points to the difficulty, right? You have to get
really granular. In other words, what parts of the country? What population centers? What was the weather change in
specific geographies and when did it occur? And honestly, that kind of dissection of weather is just, I mean frankly we
don't do it, right, and it's just not that useful because it's not something that we control. So again at a high level you can
look at the numbers and you can say it had a positive impact, no question about it.
We're going to keep our head down keep working on the things that we do control, and we absolutely do not believe
that weather was the primary driver of the improvement that we've seen. We think it's all the other things that we've
been talking about, you saw good share performance for example, which is independent of weather and some other
things that I think point to the fact that we're making some improvements. So I don't see the value of going as deeply as
you'd have to go and frankly I think even once you got there you wouldn't know much more than we know at the high
level.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow up if you wouldn't mind, while we're on the
topic of weather and seasonality. Is there seasonality to the margin of Bolthouse Farms or is this what appears to be 8%
or so margin a good run rate going forward at the EBIT line?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, there's not much seasonality in the Bolthouse business, I don't think. If you think about
their product line, the impact of weather I think is pretty minimal.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Excellent. Thank you.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Denise, so can you talk a bit more to the learnings you've gained during the first few
quarters of bringing Skillet Sauces to market, particularly around in-store positioning and merchandising? And you
talked about having a clearer understanding but can you give us a sense of what your target or objectives are going
forward? And just quick follow-up on that, do you feel that you still have a good first-mover advantage in that
category? Because it seems like a lot of competitors have moved very quickly and in order to maintain any advantage,
do you really need to keep the level of innovation coming very quickly?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. Well, first of all, we do know that it is more difficult to create new market segments.
And what happened in the execution of Skillet Sauces is it was shelved in multiple store locations. And what that did
was it impacted the reset timings to cut the product in. So as a result, we had a slower ACV build in some retailers than
originally planned. The other thing is because it was shelved in multiple locations it was more difficult for the
consumer to find it and more difficult for us to say where it was in our marketing. Couple that with the fact that
marketing started in quarter two, but since we started the marketing we have seen a pickup in the sales. So that's
encouraging.
So we feel that we'll be working with retailers in 2014 on building out a Dinner Sauce segment in the store and we'll
talk more about how we're going to do this at Analyst Day. There have been some others that have come into the
category. We believe that will add some scale to the segment and we believe that our execution within that segment
with Skillet Sauces and the new Slow Cooker will continue to give us the innovation to maintain the competitive
advantage.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: So this is a question on advertising spending on the new products. From memory I seem
to remember that the advertising budget overall was down a bit this year as you shifted the emphasis more into cheaper
digital advertising on the new products, and I think that was to target younger consumers. I guess going forward, are
you planning to step up the more traditional TV advertising on those products? And is it possible that by using the
digital approach you may not have reached maybe some older consumers who might not be exactly the target audience
but could still be a meaningful part of the sales base? And as a real quick follow-up if I can sneak it in, are you able to
parse apart the U.S. Soup pricing and volume this quarter? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Let me take the first part of your question first. Yes, we are planning on introducing TV
advertising into the marketing mix on the new products. And we have seen that in addition to attracting Millennials and
affluent consumers, the products are having broader appeal than what we expected and that's a good thing. So the TV
advertising does make sense. And then, I'm sorry what was acceptance of soup pricing?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So the second one on soup pricing as you remember we had a list price increase on condensed
soup coming into the year. The impact across the total Soup category for us was about 2%. In the quarter, that would've
been fully offset by increases in promotional spending, so net realized price was about flat.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Congrats on the core soup sales strength this season.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Thanks.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I was wondering if you could dig into the reasons for this a little bit more. Obviously, we've
talked about the percentage point lift to Simple Meals sales from innovation. Obviously, you also had the step-up in the
frequency of promotions this year that was, I guess, partly funded by the advertising dollar spend. There was the
weather; there was new Chunky advertising, reformulations I guess at the margin, which are more of a focus going
forward. Could you almost prioritize these things as you head – not just look back on fiscal 2013, but looking forward,
how these proportions might shift in terms of the lift that you see to the Simple Meals segment? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It was a combination of all of the above. I think that the sustaining innovation that we had
on the Chunky Soup was very impactful. It added new varieties and new news to the base and these have been
incredibly strong, and you couple that with the NFL-themed advertising, and like I said in my up-front, I believe that,
that really resonated with consumers. And I don't think it's any one thing. When we talk about optimizing the drivers of
demand that can look a little bit different by brand depending upon where that brand is. So we're going to continue on
that program.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: We're coming up on the hour here. We'll take another question.

Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the last
question that was asked, when you said one point was driven by innovation, I'm assuming that doesn't include
innovation on other products and reformulations. Can you – so first of all, am I right on that? And secondly, can you
just talk more broadly about new products as a percentage of sales this quarter? That would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, we talk about innovation in two ways. We talk about sustaining innovation, which is
news to the base. It's typically new varieties or line extensions. When we talk about breakthrough innovation, it's more
disruptive, it's harder and it's designed to capture new consumer segments, new occasions or new usages, and so we do
both and we talk about both. But in the innovation that I just talked about, it was really focused on Go Soup and Skillet
Sauces, which were more in the camp of breakthrough innovation.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Can you give us a sense of that 10% sort of takeaway growth this quarter, how much came
from the other sort of sustainable innovation? I mean are you seeing better repeat rates? Are you doing more trial? I'm
just trying to get a sense of what's driving the consumption growth, just to get a sense of why it could be more
sustainable.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: I think one thing we can say on the Chunky business where we had the most significant
number of new varieties, that that's a very impactful part of the growth of Chunky Soup. It's harder for us to measure
more broadly across the Soup portfolio what the incrementality of any specific item is on a quarterly basis. The primary
reason we don't break that out the way you're asking for it is because it's really difficult to quantify the cannibalization
of a formula change or a new product. I think we'll come back probably at the Analyst Meeting and talk more broadly

about the progress we're making and the contribution that, that is making to sales from our total innovation program.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. In total, we're measuring innovation as a percent of sales on a rolling three, so we'll
be able to share some of that by category with you at Analyst Day.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay. We'll squeeze in one last one and then we'll have to go.

Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Craig, in terms of Global Baking and Snacking,
it sounds as though there is really not a lot out there in terms of acquisition targets right now. But how much more can
you do in terms of maybe joint ventures or even leaning on your Indonesian business more to drive a larger footprint in
Snacking over in China? Is that something you are considering, or is it lesser priority right now for you?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: No. It's absolutely something that we're considering. In fact, one of the things that we have
done as we talked about broadening our footprint in emerging markets, we've been very active. Now realistically
they're pretty small, right? If you look at Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, but we've been very active. You saw us
announce a deal for our Soup and Beverage business to really restructure the way we're coming at it in Mexico and
broaden our distribution depth very significantly in that market on Beverages.
Likewise, we have been investing pretty heavily in our Indonesian business and been seeing really robust growth rate in
that business because of that investment. We're also looking at export models and the possibility and ability to move
some of that product. We already have some export out of the Indonesian business but looking at whether we can
expand that in Southeast Asia, so all of those things are on the table. I don't want to overstate them in terms of their size
because they're still pretty small. But we're looking at all of those avenues.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Great. Thanks for taking it. I appreciate it.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Sure.
