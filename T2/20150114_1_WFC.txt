I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.
John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim. Good morning and happy new year to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We just completed
another outstanding year at Wells Fargo. We generated record earnings, produced strong deposit and loan growth, grew
the number of customers we serve, improved credit quality, enhanced our strong risk management practices,
strengthened our capital and liquidity levels, and rewarded our shareholders by increasing our dividend and buying
back more shares. Our achievements during 2014 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model and our
continued focus on the real economy.
Let me share just some of our accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings
per share of $4.10, both up 5% from the prior year. We grew both revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit. We had
strong broad-based loan growth. Our core loan portfolio increased by $60 billion, or 8%. Our deposit franchise
continues to generate strong consumer and balanced growth with total deposit up $89 billion, or 8%, and we grew the
number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.2%.
Our credit performance continued to be very strong with net charge-offs down $1.6 billion and our net charge-off ratio
declining to just 35 basis points for the year. Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to
shareholders. We returned $12.5 billion to our stockholders through dividends and net share repurchases, up 74% from
a year ago.
While we serve our customers throughout the world, 97% of our revenue comes from the United States. And there have
been many signs of strength in the U.S. economy. GDP growth accelerated during 2014 and may be even stronger in
2015. Last year was the strongest year of job growth in 15 years, and December was the 50th consecutive month of job
creation, unprecedented in U.S. history.
Consumer confidence is at its highest level since the peak of the last economic expansion. Homeownership remains an
aspiration for most Americans, and recent developments such as the announced reduction in FHA premiums, GSE
clarification on repurchase rules, and changes in GSE lending guidelines should provide some benefit to the housing
market where affordability remains attractive.
While lower oil prices have created volatility in the financial markets, America, as a whole, is a net consumer of energy
and American households will benefit from the decline in energy prices, which is positive for the U.S. economy. I
believe the improvement in the economy, the strength of our balance sheet, the diversity of our businesses, and the
continued commitment of our team members to meet our customers' financial needs will provide Wells Fargo with
many opportunities in the year ahead.
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our fourth quarter results. John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplements starting on page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.
Wells Fargo had another strong quarter earning $5.7 billion and $1.02 in EPS in the fourth quarter. Our results included
continued strong loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses and credit quality continued to
reflect the benefit of our ongoing risk discipline. Our capital levels remain strong even as we returned $3.9 billion to
shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.

Slide 3 highlights our strong full year results that John discussed at the beginning of the call, including increased
revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, higher earnings, and increasing our net payout
ratio to 57%.
Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the fourth quarter. The
benefit of our diversified business model is that we have over 90 businesses that perform differently based on interest
rates in the economic environment. While the balance between spread and fee income has remained consistent over
time, the drivers of fee income have varied.
For example, over the past five years, mortgage banking as a share of total fee income has been as high as 28%, but
because of the decline in mortgage refinancing activity, mortgage banking fees have declined as expected and
represented 15% of fee income in the fourth quarter. However, other businesses have benefited from current market
conditions. Our trust and investment fees have steadily increased over the past five years, and were 36% of fee income
in the fourth quarter. These examples demonstrate the benefit of our diversification and how our business mix enables
us to focus on meeting our customers' financial needs while retaining our risk discipline.
Let me highlight some key drivers of our fourth quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective,
starting on page 5. I will discuss the drivers of our strong loan and deposit growth later in the call. Short-term
investments in fed funds sold declined $3.5 billion from third quarter due to the deployment of liquidity in the loans
and investment securities. This was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2011 that we've had a linked-quarter
decline. Investment securities increased $24 billion from the third quarter due to $35 billion of purchases, partially
offset by runoff and maturities. The majority of our purchases were U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities.
Turning to the income statement on page 6, revenue grew $230 million during the quarter with growth in net interest
income and stable non-interest income. Expenses increased in the quarter, reflecting higher personnel costs, continued
investments in our businesses, and risk-related initiatives and some typically higher fourth quarter expenses. Our results
in the quarter also reflected lower income tax expense which was down $123 million.
As shown on page 7, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter, our 14th consecutive
quarter of year-over-year growth. The core loan portfolio grew by $60.4 billion, or 8% from a year ago and was up $26
billion, or 13% annualized from the third quarter. Loan growth in the fourth quarter included $6.5 billion from
financing related to the sale of our government guaranteed student loans as well as the Dillard's credit card portfolio
acquisition. Our liquidating portfolio decreased $20.1 billion from a year ago. It is now only 7% of our total loans,
down from 22% at the end of 2008. Total average loan yields remained fairly stable, declining just two basis points
from the third quarter.
On page 8, we highlighted our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $36.4 billion
or 15% from a year ago, with broad-based growth that I will highlight on the next page. Core 1-4 family first mortgage
loans grew $14.4 billion or 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued growth in high-quality conforming mortgages –
pardon me, non-conforming mortgages primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was
outstanding with only six basis points of annualized credit loss in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $4.9 billion or
10% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down from a
year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market. Credit card balances were up
$4.2 billion or 16% from a year ago, benefiting from a combination of organic account and loan growth as well as the
benefit of the Dillard's portfolio acquisition.
Slide 9 demonstrates the diversity of businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans. Let me highlight just a
few. Asset-backed finance increased $16.7 billion, which included $6.5 billion from financing related to our
government guaranteed student loan sale. Corporate banking grew $5.8 billion, driven by new customer growth and
higher utilization rates from existing customers. And Capital Finance grew $3.8 billion, reflecting new customer
growth.
As you can see on page 10, we had over $1.1 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $22.7 billion, or 8%
annualized from the third quarter. Our average deposit cost declined one basis point to nine basis points in the fourth

quarter. Our strong growth in checking customers continued in the fourth quarter with primary consumer checking
customers growing 5.2% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking customers increasing 5.4%.
Our success reflected the advantages Wells Fargo offers, including broad-based and industry-leading distribution
channels, enhanced product offerings that make it easier for customers to do more business with us, and improved
customer retention.
We continued to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $255 million from the third quarter, reflecting
strong growth in average earning assets, up $43.5 billion, or 3%. The net interest margin declined two basis points from
the third quarter due to strong deposit growth, which resulted in higher average balances of cash and short-term
investments, and from actions we took in the third quarter which resulted in higher average balances in liquidity related
funding. The impact of all other balance sheet growth and repricing benefited the margin by three basis points due to a
larger investment portfolio and stronger loan originations. Increased interest income from variable sources benefited
the margin by one basis point.
Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive, so we're well-positioned to benefit from higher rates. But as we've
demonstrated by growing net interest income throughout the year, we're not relying on rates to increase to generate
growth. Of course, the first quarter will be impacted by two fewer days in the quarter.
Total non-interest income was stable from third quarter, as higher trust and investment fees, card fees, commercial real
estate brokerage commissions, and a $217 million gain on the sale of government-guaranteed student loans was offset
by a $396 million decline in market sensitive revenue, driven by lower equity gains, and lower mortgage banking
revenue and deposit service charges. The decline in deposit service charges in the fourth quarter was primarily due to
lower overdraft related fees resulting from changes we implemented in early October designed to provide customers
with more real-time information to manage their deposit accounts and avoid overdrafts.
Mortgage banking revenue declined $118 million from the third quarter. As expected, mortgage origination income
was down from the last quarter, reflecting reduced volume from the seasonally lower purchase market. The decline in
mortgage rates during the quarter resulted in refinancing volume increasing to 40% of originations, up from 30% last
quarter. While it's still early, the continued decline in rates could benefit origination volumes in the first quarter, and we
currently expect volumes to be relatively consistent with fourth quarter levels, despite the fact that the first quarter
usually reflects a slower purchase market.
Our gain on sale margin was consistent with last quarter and is expected to remain within the range we've seen over the
past four quarters. Servicing income increased modestly from the third quarter, reflecting lower unreimbursed direct
servicing cost, partially offset by lower net hedge results. Our total trust and investment fees were $3.7 billion in the
fourth quarter, which was a record high and increased $151 million from third quarter, driven by higher investment
banking activity.
Our expenses continued to reflect our investments in our businesses, including risk-related initiatives. As shown on
page 13, expenses were up $399 million from third quarter. There were a number of factors driving this increase.
Personnel expenses increased $272 million, reflecting higher deferred comp expense, which is offset in revenue, higher
revenue-based incentive compensation and higher healthcare costs.
A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $124 million, primarily
due to annual software license renewals. Outside professional services increased $116 million, which included higher
project-related spending on business investments as well as risk-related initiatives. Advertising expenses were also
elevated, up $42 million from third quarter. While these typically higher expenses should be lower next quarter, we will
have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits
expense. Our expenses will also reflect our continued investment in our infrastructure, our risk infrastructure, including
hiring new team members and ongoing project spending.
Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% for full year 2014 and we expect the efficiency ratio for full year 2015 to remain within
our target range of 55% to 59%. Even at the upper end of our target range, we are operating more efficiently than many
of our peers.

Turning to our business segment starting on page 14, Community Banking earned $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up
7% from a year ago and down 1% from the third quarter. I've already highlighted the strong growth in primary
checking customers. We've also been successfully adding retail bank households. Through November, our year-to-date
household growth rate was the highest since 2010. Meeting the financial needs of these new households will help drive
growth across our diversified product line.
Our debit and credit card businesses are examples of where we have had success and yet still have opportunities for
continued growth. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago, driven by primary checking customer
growth and increased usage from our existing customers. Our credit card penetration rate increased to 42%, up from
37% a year ago. Credit card purchase volume grew 17% from a year ago, reflecting account growth and increased
usage among our existing customers.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 7% from a year ago and up 3% from the third quarter.
Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $32.2 billion, or 11% from a year ago with growth across
many businesses, as I highlighted earlier. Credit quality remained outstanding with eight consecutive quarters of net
recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits up $33.9 billion, or 13% from a year ago.
Results also benefited from strong investment banking fees, up 10% from a year ago, driven by higher loan syndication
fees, high yield debt origination fees and equity underwriting. Treasury management revenue increased 11% from a
year ago, benefiting from record product sales in 2014 and repricing.
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $514 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from a year ago and down 7%
from the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest
income. The growth in fee income was driven by a 12% increase in asset-based fees as we continued to execute on our
strategic initiative of focusing on plan-based relationships resulting in higher recurring revenue.
Our brokerage advisory assets grew to $423 billion, up $48 billion or 13% from a year ago, primarily due to positive
net flows. Loan growth for WBR remains strong, up 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit
year-over-year growth. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in high-quality nonconforming mortgage
loans.
Turning to page 17, credit quality in the fourth quarter remains strong with a net charge-off ratio of 34 basis points of
average loans. The $67 million increase in net charge-offs from third quarter was primarily driven by lower recoveries,
down $54 million which we would expect at this stage of the credit cycle. Non-performing assets have declined for
nine consecutive quarters and were down $739 million from third quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $517 million and
foreclosed assets declined to $222 million. The reserve release was $250 million in the fourth quarter, down $50
million from third quarter and down $350 million from a year ago.
Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced
approach fully phased in at 10.44% in the fourth quarter. Our ratio declined slightly from the third quarter, reflecting an
increase in risk-weighted assets primarily from strong loan growth in the quarter.
We've stated that our long-term target is 10%, which includes a buffer over required minimums. Since we've achieved
our targeted level, our capital ratios may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, reflecting changes in asset levels or
composition or changes in OCI impacted by market volatility. These potential changes are why we maintain a buffer.
As shown on slide 19, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Our common shares outstanding
declined by 45 million shares in the fourth quarter, reflecting 62 million shares purchased during the quarter. In
addition, we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contract that's expected to settle in the first quarter for
approximately 14 million shares. As a reminder, our share issuance is usually higher in the first half of the year given
the timing of certain employee benefit plan issuances.
So in summary, our results in 2014 and for the fourth quarter reflected the benefit of our diversified business model
with strong growth in loans and deposits. Our loan portfolio is well diversified, and charge-offs were near historic lows.
We increased the amount of our capital and liquidity and returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and

share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 57% for the year, within our targeted range of 55% to 75%.
We believe we're well-positioned to benefit from an improving economy, an increased customer base, our diverse
product line, and our continued risk discipline. Our diversified business model has performed well across a variety of
economic and interest rate environments and I am optimistic that it will continue to produce opportunities for our
customers, our team members, and our shareholders in the year ahead.
We'll now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey. Morning.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: I just wondered if you could speak to how we should think about weighing the positive and
negative effects of the sharp drop in energy prices on the bank. While it should help out the consumer businesses, is
this enough to offset any potential credit issues or possibly a slowdown in loan growth and investment banking
activity?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, as I mentioned in my comments, Joe, since the United States is a net consumer, a net
importer of oil, we think it's a positive for the U.S. economy. Clearly, that's on average because there's going to be
some states that are impacted, some customers are going to be impacted, and some business is going to be impacted.
But we serve 70 million customers. Virtually all of them know how to fill a gas tank and go to a gas pump, and that's a
real benefit. So we think net-net, it's an opportunity. Surely, there are offsets, like we've said, but even within the oil
and gas business, and John mentioned that we are participating there. It's about 2% of our loans. There are still a lot of
opportunity for consolidation there and we'll participate in that with our customers. We're looking at our portfolio. We
analyze that. We've been through that over the past. But net-net, we think it's a positive.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay, great. I guess somewhat related to that would be it seems recently the expectations now
that higher rates are getting pushed out. We could be lower for longer, which theoretically could weigh on margins. Do
you expect to be able to offset that with better growth in the business amidst a stronger economy as you talked about?
Or do you see any need to take a harder look at expenses and what other levers might you have to pull there?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, we're always taking a hard look at expenses. So there's nothing incremental that
we would plan on doing there, but continuing to be as vigilant as we have. We've been operating at a pretty strong level
in a zero interest rate environment for a very long time. And while because of the way our balance sheet is positioned,
it would probably be – there's upside when short-term rates move, and if that happens later, then that upside might be
realized later. We're continuing to position ourselves to compete and to perform in this interest rate environment, and
so loan growth, deposit growth, redeploying excess liquidity into earning assets, as I said, being vigilant on expenses,
all of those things contribute to the performance that we've had and that we're anticipating continuing to have until that
time that rates begin to move.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay. Thanks so much for the thoughts.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thanks, Joe.

Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: I was wondering – I was wondered, John, on – just a question on credit and provision.
Asset quality clearly remains excellent, and I wasn't sure if you mentioned future reserve releases, John, but with such
strong loan growth and credit metrics now looking stable, should we expect the reserve releases to taper off? And might
you need to start adding to reserves at some point if loan growth continues at this kind of pace?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think the short answer is yes. If we have robust loan growth going forward, all things
being equal, even, that would contribute to the need for some amount of incremental provisioning. So it's going to be a
function of the amount of loan growth, the mix of loan growth, the quality of the portfolio overall and general
economic conditions. One thing I'd add to Joe's first question also is there's no specific provisioning action in the fourth
quarter for what's going on in the energy world. There's nothing anticipated, nothing necessary at the moment, but
there's nothing in that quarter either.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Did you make a comment about reserve releases, John? In the future, you've
kind of – in the past couple of quarters, you've said reserve releases could continue. I was wondering if that changed a
little bit now with credit bottoming, and if I missed it or not.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: With the size of the portfolio, the size of the allowance, and the amount of the fourth
quarter's release, the $250 million, it's close to call. We've said in the recent past to expect them to taper. Now, for the
reasons that you mentioned and I described, there could be future releases, it could be – there could be future net
provisioning, so we're at that point in the cycle, I think.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Got it. And then in terms of just the net interest income, the puts and takes, did
you say how big the Dillard's portfolio was? Or could you tell us?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We can't because of the nature of the contract we have with our customer. You can see...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: ... the amount of loan growth in the credit card portfolio from quarter to quarter, and
that's a combination of the organic growth and the Dillard's portfolio.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then any color you can offer on what opened up in terms of opportunity to
deploy the liquidity this quarter? Anything driving that in particular?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, some clarity around our liquidity framework, clarity around – further clarity
around LCR, further clarity on what kind of cash versus other HQLA we'd need to have. I think that might have
emboldened us a little bit in terms of finding an entry point. But as we've said, these are difficult times for finding
attractive entry points in the fixed income markets when we're thinking about making that switch.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, John, also we had, as you know, continued very strong deposit growth.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. Okay, great. And just one last quick thing on TLAC, John. Rules aren't
finalized. We do have our proposal. How do you feel on that? And would you have to do some gradual preparing for
that as we go forward?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. Well, just depending on where the ultimate rule comes out versus the range that's
been published, at the low end of the range, we've got less to do and at the high end of the range, we'd have more to do.
There's still a lot to know and there's some wood to chop in the regulatory realm to get to the final rule. We're on the
record as pointing out that we really don't – the industry doesn't understand the need for the magnitude of the total
buffer that's being – or loss absorbing capacity that's being talked about here. We certainly find that it lands a little bit
harder on people who seem to have less risky business models, those of us who are deposit funded with a little bit more

straightforward deposit taking and lending type of activity. We'd like some clarity on why that makes sense. But,
however, it lands within the range that's been published, the approach for Wells Fargo is going to be to add more term
debt at the holding company level, and that will have a P&L consequence that we'd have to navigate through, and it'll
be substantially more manageable at the lower end of the range and somewhat more expensive at the higher end of the
range.

Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes. Good morning. Thank you.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: I appreciate the color that you have given us so far on what you expect for mortgage
originations in the first quarter, but as we think about the full year and think about your comments earlier, high
consumer confidence, accelerating GDP, in the context of potentially lower long rates for longer, is it possible that
from an industry level the origination growth for this year could surpass the current MBA forecast of 6%?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, yes. The numbers that – the last numbers I've seen from them is $1.1 trillion to $1.2
trillion. Yeah, I mean, it could be higher based on those things. As I mentioned in my comments with what was done
recently on FHA and some of the things that the GSEs are doing, and if rates stay low or are favorable, surely, we could
see more activity and you could see actually more activity on both the refinance side and the purchased-money side.
We'll just have to see how that goes. And I don't think there's been any reduction or any update on those numbers from
MBA, but it could be the higher end of that range.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And on the flipside to that, you mentioned that you did get more clarity on LCR and
HQLA with regards to being more aggressive on liquidity deployment. But, John, you've mentioned several times that
absolute level of rates has dictated your cash deployment or liquidity deployment strategy. As we look out into 2015,
was the clarity around the rules enough to make you a little bit more aggressive about deploying your liquidity into
earning assets? Or is it going to continue to be largely rate dependent?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's a good question. I mean it's substantially rate dependent at this point and loan
growth dependent as well because that's the first call on all of our available liquidity is making loans to customers. But
if we believe that we're in a lower for longer long-term rate scenario separate that from policy rates for a moment, but
just thinking about the 10-year on mortgage rates, et cetera, at the margin, that probably emboldens us a little bit
additionally to convert what's cash today into duration over the course of the year.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: As you know, Erika, we still have a lot – I mean we have tens of billions...
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Right.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: ...available. I mean so I mean there's just a lot of liquidity on the sheet.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Understood. And just a quick follow-up. We appreciate the color that you gave in terms of
the impact of energy. Has there been a lot of questions from investors in terms of what it would take for banks to adjust
its qualitative reserve to reflect lower energy prices? I was just wondering if that's how Wells Fargo does it. Or do you
really look at the reserve at least in terms of your energy commercial exposure on a name-by-name, loan-by-loan basis?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So in the case of commercial and corporate loans, it's absolutely the sum of the parts of a
name-by-name basis and the risk rating on each loan. We have hundreds of customers in the energy business. They are
in the E&P or upstream part of the market. They're midstream companies. They're services companies. We have the
largest team in this area, very long-tenured, been through several cycles. And we're growing customer by customer and

working through each situation to figure out what this job means to them based on their leverage, based on their
hedging profile, based on their assets, based on their management capability. And that will lead to risk rating changes
on a loan-by-loan basis or a name-by-name basis as time unfolds. And it's that activity that would lead to changes in
our reserving posture for the portfolio.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And we don't want to minimize this, but this a nature of that business. If you go back just six
years, we've had $30 a barrel oil and we've $140 a barrel oil. We've seen gas, for example, natural gas, go from $6 Mcf,
$7 Mcf, to $2 Mcf and some change today. And that's just part of that business.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: On the E&P side of that portfolio, those tend to be reserve-based loans, asset-based loans
with a very interactive approach between the bank and the borrower in terms of determining the value of the collateral
and then re-margining the loan down to reflect changes in the value of the collateral. And of course, that's at our
discretion. We have our own engineers and we're very engaged in that process. So all of that ties into what the future
reserving needs or requirements are for that portfolio. And as I said, nothing obviously has revealed itself yet and
there's nothing in the fourth quarter specifically for that.

Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: A couple of questions on the fee side. John, you had mentioned some the tweaks you made
in October on the service charges side. So I'm wondering if you can help us understand what types of changes those
were and then how you're looking at your product set with regards to either payday advance and whatever pending
rules we could still get at some point next year on overdrafts, and if that would continue to have an impact on your
deposit fees?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So what happened in October wasn't a change in the product or what we charge for it.
Rather, we unrolled some incremental technology that allows our customers to have more real-time information to
manage their own banking affairs. And they've been using that information and successfully reducing the amount of
over drafting that they are doing, which had an impact on our revenue. We think it's very customer friendly and it's
good for all of us. That's distinct from any pricing approach or product approach that we have. With respect to...
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. No, go ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: You asked about short-term or payday type lending, I think it's clear that during 2014,
we discontinued a product that we used to offer that was a direct deposit advance product that allowed people to borrow
on a short-term unsecured basis with their next direct deposit paycheck as security for a source of repayment for the
loan and then some regulatory urging around that. I think most of the discussion around those types of products is now
frankly outside the banking system because it's private finance companies who are providing that. And that's how it
seems to be dealt with from a regulatory perspective. I would also tell you that the discontinued product is out of the
run rate at this point. So the impact has been fully realized.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: And then overdrafts?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hard to say much more about it other than we're not in the process of repricing or
rethinking the product capability. The results that you'll see in our numbers are a reflection of the activity and behavior
of our customers as they manage their own banking affairs.

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Another question I had was just on the kind of market-related revenues. They've
been trending a little bit lower. If I combine trading activities, securities gains, equity investment gains and that's even
with the student loan gain in that $354 million number. Should we generically expect that you'll still be able to generate
this type of market-related revenue? Or is it more likely that you see that trend down over time?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, so there's a lot of moving parts there, and I would look at a multi-quarter average
to think about how to model it. On the trading side, the customer combination, customer-facing trading revenue that we
make, which is a pretty modest part of Wells Fargo revenue profile, will probably ebb and flow along the lines of what
you're seeing in the industry just at a more modest level. The trading line also includes the impact of our deferred comp
hedging program, so it's a little noisy given the magnitude of that versus the magnitude of our trading businesses. But
those will be what they are based on industry factors. And the deferred comp program will be more revenue and more
expense in an up market and less revenue and less expense in a down market, generally speaking.
On the other elements, we've got gains from equity securities, gains from debt securities. In the equity space, you've
seen some of the businesses that we've been involved in that frankly are – that continue to be – are sources of revenue
that we would anticipate seeing if market conditions stay the same as they are today. So I wouldn't model that down too
heavily.
And on the debt side, given the levels of rates that we're at in some markets, the levels of spreads that we're at, there are
some debt securities which it makes sense for us to sell and monetize from time to time just because their market value
substantially exceeds what we can imagine is their intrinsic or certainly their carrying values. So there will be pops in
there from time to time as well. And it's the sum of those things that gets to that collection that you described.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And last one, maybe can you just talk a little bit about the momentum in the trust
business and what type of outlook you see just sort of asset gathering and after a really strong year in that part of the
business? How's the pipeline for asset growth looking?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: We're very happy and pleased with the progress we've made in that area. One of the biggest
opportunities we have is the relationship between David Carroll's Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement group and Carrie
Tolstedt's Community Banking group. We have as many assets away from customers who call us their bank as we do
under management right now, so the relationship and the work we're doing there to bring those assets home, if you will,
has been a big opportunity for us, and so – but I still view this, of all the opportunities we have in the company, all of
our businesses, probably, that is our biggest opportunity to jump a curve or to even do – to show us some incremental
growth above what you would see in other more mature businesses. So a lot of opportunity there, pleased with where
we are, a lot more to do.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: So we sold the portfolio of student loans and we provided some financing to the company who
bought those loans. And so if one item stands out in the quarter as outsized, it would be that. But those are all
commercial loans.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. And any particular industry that is doing well or is it just across the board and across
geographic that this line item picked up? Because this is one of the line items we've been waiting to see pick up in
general amongst the bigger banks.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Very broad-based, very broad.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And you're not seeing because – the questions that I get is that everybody is concerned about the
energy credits, but you're just not seeing and I know you made some opening comments about that but you're just not
seeing anything on the negative side on energy credits at this point.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, this drop in crude is very recent and that the companies are taking the appropriate
evasive actions to preserve cash, to de-lever, to reduce their expense base, et cetera. But it hasn't worked its way into
loan quality. Now, loan demand certainly be down in that area, I assume. But in the fourth quarter, you can see what
the change in gross outstanding – in net outstanding was which more than makes up for whatever reduced demand
there is in the energy space.

Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your credit card growth strategy. I think most
would agree that credit card asset yields have held up quite well in this slow rate environment relative to other asset
classes. Would you consider competing more aggressively on rates in an effort to grow your share of outstanding
balances particularly since the high return business where you arguably have room to give up a bit on pricing while still
generating returns that are attractive relative to other lower return, lower yielding asset classes?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, let me say it this way. First of all, we love the card business especially for our
community bank customers. And we have grown from the low to mid-20%s penetration to now to 42% of our
customers carry our credit card. And we like that business a whole lot not only from the balances we get but to be
relevant to our customers as far as handling their payments, providing them services that are even around payments and
so forth for them, we want to provide great value. Pricing, sure, is part of that. You've seen recently where we have
partnered with American Express. We do a ton of business with Visa on the higher end, higher value cards. So this is
really a strategy about getting more cards top of wallet with our customers and pricing rewards, the full value
proposition is part of that. I wouldn't say it's just any one thing around price per se, but it's around value.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Great. Thank you. A separate question, if I may, on municipal deposits. Can you talk about how
significant municipal deposits are to Wells? Are you de-emphasizing them given their relatively unfriendly LCR
treatment? And to what extent do you see a future revenue opportunity for holding them?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: We have a very big municipal business, and deposits are certainly part of that. It's a service
that we provide to the tax-exempt issuing community. And by municipal, it's all forms of state and local and county
government and other nonprofit types of customers. The unfriendly LCR treatment came from the fact that that
municipal deposits tend to be collateralized by us so that the municipal depositor is safer in the event of a problem with
their bank. And that wasn't being taken into account in the original approach to LCR. We think we've gotten a
favorable outcome there so that they are now LCR friendly, still very competitive. We still like those deposits. We still
very much enjoy those relationships because there's a lot of banking service that we provide to those types of clients.
But they don't have the LCR problem that they might have seemed to have in pre-clarification that came out in the third
quarter or fourth quarter.

<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay. So it was my understanding that for the purposes of the LCR calculation in the numerator,
the high-quality liquid assets would not be able to include the collateral associated with the deposits and it had to
outflow in the dominator on day one. Is that not the case anymore?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I don't think that you have it right. I think that the...
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: ...that it works fine. Incidentally, there were two issues that people were trying to address and
tweaks LCR relating to munis. The other one was whether high-quality muni bonds would be considered HQLA on the
asset side and I don't think that there's been a resolution there. And there are a number of our clients who issue
high-quality muni bonds who take exception to that. And we'll see where that goes. But on the deposit side, I think
we've cracked the code.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning. I had a question about the efficiency ratio. First, what were the drivers in higher
revenue-driven compensation and deferred comp especially with lower originations and softer trading results? And then
the follow-on question to that is you're still at the upper end of your efficiency target. What can you do to get at least
back toward the middle end?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, so the drivers of the revenue-oriented portion of increased compensation included
a handful of businesses. I'd say investment banking was one of them where we were $150 million up in the quarter.
And so some portion of the seasonal – of the elevated expense is attributable to that. But it comes from a few others as
well. And again, it's those businesses that performed better in the fourth quarter. So it can be with 90 different
businesses, it can be a little here, a little there. That was part of it. So we find ourselves in the high 58%s or now 59%
and with a lot of emphasis on trying to be as efficient as we can in how we spend our money every day. There are no
guarantees that we're moving toward the middle or the lower end of the range in this interest rate environment and as
we go through a full year, while we're tackling the things that we need to tackle.
We spend a lot of money on risk management, compliance-related initiatives, other things that have a regulatory origin.
And some of that is semi-permanent, might be around for several quarters and some of it's going to be around in the run
rate for a while. If rates begin to move up, that probably moves us down in the range, but frankly, at 59%, which is the
high end of our range, well, we can tolerate that. We think we're performing very well.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Mike, you are hitting one of the important issues for us. As John mentioned, we take this
seriously. We're looking for all those opportunities to eliminate expenses where customers don't find value and it's an
ongoing continuous process for us, reducing square footage is one of those. Looking hard at the kind of money we
spend that is not revenue producing, if you will, but also making sure that we take a look at the long-term, so we
continue to invest in things like late last year, Apple Pay and other things that we do to provide convenience for
customers. So it's always a don't waste, but also we take a long-term view. But this continues to be a big focus for us.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, I mean, you have a 55% to 59% efficiency target range and what
I'm hearing now is, well, with the rate environment we might be at 59% whereas I wasn't sure if I heard that same
message before saying, well, unless rates go up, we won't get to the middle part of the range. And you were a little bit
lower before. So am I hearing the message wrong? Or is it simply that you've done what you could for so long with the
low rate environment, and you can't do a whole lot more? Or what is it that leads you to say, well, 59% is okay?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, I think when we had the range, we knew that we would – sure, we'd love to be at 55%,
but we also recognize that that's why we gave a range. These were – think of it as guardrails and we're spending more
on cyber today. We're spending more on all things risk. On the other hand, we've not yet pulled out all of our expenses

around loss mitigation. We continue to make investments in distribution. So I guess a range is range, and I can't
guarantee you we'll be at the low end, but if we're at the high end, that's also acceptable in our mind if we're making the
right investments in the right things and eliminating expenses where we think they can be eliminated. So that's how we
feel about it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then last follow-up, the cyber expenses or the all things risk expenses, have these ticked up
some? Or is this kind of what you had expected?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: They've ticked up in the terms of we continue to make more investments there, and we're
starting to get the annualization of expenses we made last year. And we'll get more efficient in that over time, but we're
spending the money we think we need to spend, and sometimes that's hiring consultants and then over time you can
convert whatever they're doing to team members, which tends to be more efficient. You're not as efficient in every
process the minute you adopt it or employ it. But more money is being spent there.

Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: If I could just follow up on the net interest margin, it was down just two basis
points, which I think is very good in this kind of environment. But as I look at some of the underlying detail on the
yields of the securities and some of the loan yields, I guess I don't totally understand how they've been so stable and
wondering if there's anything you can add on maybe first the securities piece? You've been growing it and the yields
have been remarkably resilient.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's just math. What we've been growing hasn't been that extraordinary in terms of
its incremental contribution to the weighted average, because the denominator is as big as it is. If we continue to deploy
– as I know you know, if we continue deploying in this environment, ultimately, it will start to skew down the weighted
average returns. And also, we've been tending to invest in treasury and agency securities and just from a credit quality
point of view, that's going to bring down returns, setting aside historical book yields versus current book yields and the
shape of the curve when the investments were made. If we've got corporates and munis and some other things in the
starting portfolio, if we're just adding U.S. Treasuries, it's going to bring things down. But it just hasn't revealed itself
yet, because the numbers haven't been big enough yet.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then on the loan yields, I guess they've been surprisingly resilient as
well. I mean, do you feel like I know it's a blend 8 categories or 10 categories the way you disclose it, but do you feel
like generally speaking, loan yields have stabilized? I'm looking at the C&I that was actually up a couple bps. But
really up and down the portfolio, it feels like there's been pretty good stability the last three quarters, four quarters.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think that's right. We're in fiercely competitive markets. Not every bit of competition is
in the last basis point of spread on a loan. Sometimes it's in the structure of a loan. And but, of course, there are places
we'll back away from when that happens. But it is competitive, but it hasn't all shown up in price.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then I mean, I just, I guess, putting it all together as you think about the
net interest margin percent going forward, probably largely dependent on loan growth, but how do you think it shakes
out? Obviously, the rates where they are doesn't help, but is it just this modest pressure? Or is there more material
pressure to come?

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It depends on the pace of continued deposit inflows and how that gets redeployed. If
deposits remained steady where they are, then the loan growth and the redeployment from cash into investment
securities is going to be very supportive of the NIM. If we keep getting high single-digit or even low double-digit
deposit growth and it doesn't make – and low growth isn't happening at the same pace or redeployment into investment
securities doesn't make sense at the same pace, then the math is going to put pressure on that calculation. And as you
know, that's not a calculation we are managing to, it's an outcome of the other things that we're doing. But the driver
there is the growth in deposits and how you responsibly deploy that into either loans or securities in the same timeframe
that the deposits are coming in.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Yeah, okay. All right. It makes sense. Thank you.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Betsy.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. I had a question on investment spend and thoughts around mobile wallet. With
Apple Pay, obviously, you did a lot of work there. Is there an opportunity to take those investments and potentially
expand them into mobile wallet, real-time banking, other tokenization strategies?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, we're doing a lot of work in all those things about the so-called paperless store and
doing real-time cash letters and helping customers with real-time information, notwithstanding which channel they're
involved in. So I would say all of the above is important. What we've found, which is interesting is that our most loyal
customers today are the ones who use the channels most often and the most types of channels. So even for those
customers who are very advanced in technology and the use of technology, ease of technology who are – might be
dominant in that channel still visit stores are infrequent but regular basis.
They go to ATMs. So there's lots of things. And we're making – some of the investments we're making is to set up an
appointment with the banker using your technology. We're testing things about being able to authenticate customers,
know when they are in the stores, working on things that would authenticate at an ATM machine, maybe using your
mobile phone, mobile device. So there's just lots of things going on there. And we're actually learning a lot of those
things from retailers and other service providers outside of our industry. So pretty exciting stuff.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And do you feel this is like table stakes and will just maintain share? Or do you think
that you're doing things that could potentially drive share up, drive down that expense ratio?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, I think about it less of an expense ratio. But these are more than table – well, they are
table stakes in some cases. I mean if you don't have a mobile offering, you're probably not going to serve most
millennials today. But we think of it more than table stakes. We think it's a big reason why we're growing net new
primary checking accounts by over 5% a year. Deposit growth we've had clearly is partially a result of our distribution
model and the omni-channel view we have of these various channels; not separate businesses but combined into really
centric around the customer needs and convenience. And our growth is, I think, reflective of our commitment to that.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I guess I'm just wondering too on the Dillard's because I would expect that retailers
also want best-in-class mobile apps, et cetera. Is this part of what we should expect you will be delivering to Dillard's
and other private-label portfolios that you win?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, I don't want to speak about a particular situation, but I'll just give you this. 16 years ago,
we didn't have an online offering. Today, over 80% of our customers are actively online, some 28 million, or 24 million
customers actively online on the consumer side. Five years ago, we didn't have a mobile offering. Today, we have over

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - John Pancari>: I'm going to kick the energy horse here again, so my apologies. But, first of all, can you just help
quantify your total leveraged loan book, what the size is and then of that leveraged loan book, how much of it is
energy?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So we don't have a leveraged loan book. We have loan portfolios in various lines
of business. We have an energy loan portfolio which would include both oil and gas. And as I mentioned, it's about 2%
of our loans overall and it includes E&P companies, it includes midstream pipeline companies and it includes services
companies. It also includes some investment grade integrated oil names. But the sum of that is about 2% of our total
loan portfolio. Some of those companies will have higher leverage, some of those companies will have lower leverage
but we don't draw the portfolio line along the level of leverage.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And then separately related to that, you have the amount of bond exposure that you may
have held in your trading portfolios for any deals that you have done in the energy sector? Do you have that quantified?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes, it's a good question. So I'll quantify for you our total securities exposure including
what's in trading and also what's in AFS because we have some corporate investments in energy names as well and the
sum total of both of those is less than $1.5 billion at Wells Fargo. And it's much smaller portion in trading which of
course gets marked-to-market through the P&L everyday and somewhat larger percentage of that sitting in AFS which
we mark every day, but the value change goes through OCI.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then separately on the loan growth, I agree, good pickup that we saw in
C&I for the quarter. And as we look out into 2015, is it fair to assume that you should see some acceleration in the loan
growth that you're looking at for 2015 versus what you achieved in 2014? I think you're in the 4% to 5% range for
2014. Is it fair to assume that that accelerates from there next year or for the full year 2015?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think knowing what we know about the economy today, we'd feel better about the next
four quarters than a couple of the last four quarters. So if the most recent quarter is the continuation of a two-quarter
trend, then, yeah, we'll probably have higher loan growth or higher amounts originated. Now, if the denominator keeps
growing as we grow the size of the portfolio, at some point the rate gets impacted by that. But, yes, it feels like a good
year for loan growth.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: John, we think if you're going to grow revenues over the long run, you have to be growing
households, cross-sell, deposits and loans. And we sure plan for all of those.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then my last question, I know there's some questions around the excess
liquidity reinvestment and what you've been buying. I know you indicated you're buying treasuries and agencies. Do
you have what durations and what yields that you purchased in the quarter just to get an idea of what the ultimate
impact could be on the margin?

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, we don't lay it out quite that way. You'll see in our tables what we're talking
about, but as treasuries and agencies, you know the timeframe. And I can tell you we're in the intermediate part of the
curve. So that'd probably get you there.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Eric. Eric? Well, Regina, did the line get dropped?
Operator
Eric, your line is open.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yes. Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Hi. Hi. That was odd because I was not on mute. So – and I have used a telephone
at least once before. Just to follow up on the OpEx for a moment, I understand the discussion of the ratio, but just in
terms of absolute level, based on what I'm hearing in terms of your loan growth expectation, it sounds like we should
be anticipating an absolute level of expense that is higher than what we saw in 2014. Is that correct?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's really tough to say which is why we talk in percentages and think about things in
terms of a range. And you can see the items that we're calling out as feeling seasonal in Q4, and there's a handful of
them and they amount to a few hundred million dollars. And then, of course, in Q1, we typically have escalated
personnel and benefits expense as well. In terms of the OpEx or the investments that we're making in risk management,
et cetera, they will be elevated for some period of time, but because of all of the other drivers to the total expense
number, it's possible that we operate and there's a reasonable expectation that we operate at a lower level than we have
in the last couple of quarters because we're always pushing down on things where we can.
So that's why we give you the range. We think we're going to be in the range in 2015 like we have been in 2014. One
other item I'd mention for those that are newer to it that we do have this deferred comp element that shows up in
expense even though it's a P&L neutral item, and that creates $100 million or in some cases, a couple hundred million
dollars worth of noise in any given quarter, which is material given the differences that we're talking about here.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, Eric, even though we're at the high end of the range now, one should not assume that it's
not top of mind around here. It is. It remains top of mind, and it's always looking for opportunities to be more efficient
but also continue to invest in the future, because we do have a long-term view.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Right, right, of course. And the financing that you provided on the student loan
sale, what is the expected duration of that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So that financing probably comes down over the course of the next couple of years on a
relatively steep curve as the portfolio gets permanently financed into student loan ABS. And so my expectation, I think
the reasonable expectation is that its average life would be maybe a little bit more than a year as it comes down.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Got it. And just quickly one last thing. The tax benefit that you mentioned in the
period from the change in federal tax law, is that a permanent benefit? And what should we expect for your kind of

go-forward GAAP tax rate?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, so what happened in the fourth quarter is both the impact of the extender
legislation that came in at the end of the year as well as the resolution of some discrete matters that we've been working
on with the various taxing authorities. So for some period of time, I would look at recent prior years for what a good
expectation is for our tax rate going forward.

<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning, guys. Happy New Year to you.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey. Happy New Year to you, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: I have a quick question for John Shrewsberry. You'd noted that the investment securities
portfolio has increased quite materially over the last year. I think it's up about $50 billion. Can you tell me what portion
of that is Ginnie Mae MBS? How much is that Ginnie Mae portfolio, if you have exposure, has that grown in 2014?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's negligible.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. So the refinance activity there with that 50-basis point cut plus rates being down, I
didn't know what the impact would be perhaps on the margin. But your Ginnie Mae exposure's negligible?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Negligible.

Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Happy New Year, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Happy New Year. Two questions for you. John, you mentioned the changes at in the GSEs
and at the FHA with regard to allowable mortgages, et cetera. I mean, there seems to have been a remarkable
turnaround in Washington since the days of the financial crisis when everybody was cracking down on mortgages, and
we're in a reverse posture now. As a result of this, do you see any changes that you might make at the mortgage
company in terms of businesses that you exited, the wholesale business, et cetera, that you might want to go back and
revisit?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No. Well, first of all, I think those are positive changes that have been made, and I think
they've been largely made because it got too restrictive and customers who deserved a loan, who wanted to buy a home,
could afford it, could not get credit. And I don't want to overstate the amount of those folks, but there was that element
and I think we've come to a much better place with regulators, with the industry and with customers. But, no, we don't

have an intention of going back into joint ventures or the wholesale business. We like the business mix we have now.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Second question is this. There was a, I believe, a Heard on the Street column a few
days ago in The Wall Street Journal about the impact of the energy price drop on various banks. And, John, I think they
mentioned that the figure of 17% of revenues comes to mind with regard to your capital markets businesses related to
energy. Could you just clarify that where you stand in capital markets with relation to the energy business? And is there
going to be a big impact in revenues there?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So in that article, they referred to, I think, Dealogic information for 2014 that suggested that
we had about $280 million worth of underwriting revenue from energy-related activity. So that would be debt and
equity underwriting and probably loan syndication fees as well. So that's the order of magnitude. The 17% would refer
to that as a percentage of the U.S. investment banking revenue for full year of 2014. So in terms of at risk or where it
goes from here, that's the starting point for last year. And it's bounced around between $100 million, $150 million and
maybe $300 million over the course of the last several years.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Yeah, okay. And just one more question, John Stumpf, for you. I mean you have been very
positive on the direction of the American economy for the last couple of quarters and I think you remain that way.
Well, I don't know if you saw your predecessor, Mr. Kovacevich on CNBC a couple of mornings ago, and he was not
so positive on strength of the American economy. I'm sure you still talk to Dick from time to time and sort of what is
behind the differing views?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: What was his name again?
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: That K guy.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: The K guy. Well, I obviously respect Dick's view and there are different views on the
economy. But that being said, when I – and there's volatility, clearly. I mean today, you look at retail sales and you
might feel differently. So you can feel differently on a day-to-day basis. But when I look at the businesses that we're in
and as I'm out talking with customers, which I am every day and talking with our business leaders, and frankly, looking
at the numbers. I mean, 50 consecutive months of employment growth, unemployment in the 5%, 6% range. GDP 5%
and we'll probably have a few quarters this year that start with 3%s. So I'm optimistic. I don't think it's – again, I don't
think this is a breakout. But I think we're on our front foot and consumers' confidence is at an all-time high since the
downturn. So the way I read the tea leaves, I am optimistic.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think Dick also suggests that we could have gotten here sooner. We could be at higher
levels.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. And that's fair. I would agree with that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hello and I'm glad to wrap it up for you.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: I wanted to look at the capital deployment ratios. If you look at your total payout this
quarter, it's 72%, which is, I think, close to your stated target. You talked about around 75%. So the increased capital
deployment from here, are you going to need to see some earnings momentum? Or do you think you could push past
that 75% payout ratio?

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So our target is 55% to 75%. And you saw that it bounced around during the course of
the four quarters of 2014 for a few reasons. One of them is that we do more share issuance in connection with our
benefit plans in the first half of the year and so it drives down the net payout ratio. But the first call on our capital is to
be available to support more loan growth on behalf of our customers. So the capital deployment horse is out in the front
of the net payout cart and that's important to remember. Because we're not hoping that we have enough to support the
business growth after we think about distribution. We're making sure we have enough to support the business growth
and then we're factoring in distribution behind that. So we anticipate continuing to operate in the range
quarter-by-quarter, 55% to 75%. And the fourth quarter was a high tick on that in the 70%s.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And I was really kind of looking back towards the E part of that, which is as earnings
grow, that gives you more chance. What kind of catalysts do you see until, while we're waiting on interest rates to
create some incremental earnings momentum kind of re-igniting that that we've seen kind of slow down over the last
couple of quarters?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. Well, it's loan growth for sure. It's redeployment of excess liquidity into
higher-yielding earning assets. It'll be what the impact is on expenses that we've been talking a lot a little bit if we do as
expected there. And then it's the various sources of fee revenue, which were flat quarter-to-quarter, up year-over-year,
but there's a lot of momentum in places like card, places like investment banking, trust and investment fees overall, we
just talked about the slightly more bullish case for mortgage this year. All of those are catalysts for growth.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. Thank you.
