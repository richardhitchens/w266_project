Byron H. Pollitt
Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations.
First, Visa's 15% net revenue growth in fiscal second quarter was once again broad based, as we continue to see strong
credit and debit growth in the U.S. and rest of world, which is now supported by a return to positive growth in our
aggregate U.S. debit business.
Second, client incentives for the quarter as a percentage of gross revenue were 16.1%. Similar to last quarter, this was a
result of lower-than-expected deal activity. However, for the balance of fiscal 2013, we expect lower incentive levels
than originally projected. The new 10-year deal structure with Chase has the effect of simultaneously reducing both
gross fees and revenue incentives, with one largely offsetting the other. This contractual change, which is now signed
and in effect, in combination with deal timing and revenue mix, have caused us to lower our full-year client incentive
outlook from 18% to 18.5% down to 16% to 17% for fiscal 2013.
Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume growth turned positive in the fiscal second quarter of 2013 versus a
negative 3% in the fiscal first quarter. Of note, the month of March saw the onset of a significant positive inflection
point as we lapped last year's adoption of the Dodd-Frank routing rules for U.S. debit. While Interlink payment volume
growth was in negative mid-teen territory, Visa debit payment volume saw a 12% rate of growth.
Fourth, as a result of a more certain revenue outlook and earlier-than-planned share repurchases, we are increasing our
fiscal 2013 EPS guidance from high teens to around 20%.
Lastly, as we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders, and to this end during the quarter we
spent $1.8 billion to repurchase 12 million shares at an average price of $157. This means through the first two fiscal
quarters, we have spent $3.1 billion to repurchase 20 million shares at an average price of $152. As we begin the fiscal
third quarter, our remaining open to buy stands at $1 billion.
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction
trends for the fiscal second quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of
our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013. The payment volume
growth rates which follow are unadjusted for the leap year in 2012. Normalizing the month of February would add
about 1 percentage point of growth to the second quarter's results.
Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 9%, on par with the December quarter's
9%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions, including the U.S., which saw some incremental
benefit from the early lapping effects associated with U.S. debit regulations. More recently in the U.S., through April
28, payment volume growth was 12%, compared with 4% in the March-ending quarter. U.S. credit growth held at Q2
levels, while debit experienced improved growth rates. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10%
constant-dollar growth rate in the March quarter, which compares to 11% rate in the December quarter. The U.S. grew
9%, and the rest of world 11%. Through April 28, cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis grew 10%, with a
U.S. growth rate of 7% and the rest of world at 12%.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.9 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 6% increase over the
prior-year period. The U.S. saw a 3% increase in transactions, while the rest of world delivered 21% growth. Through
April 28, process transaction growth was a positive 15%, driven in part by the lapping of the U.S. debit routing
regulations. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior

year.
Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 15% increase year over year,
driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues, and, as mentioned
earlier, lower-than-anticipated client incentives. Hedging resulted in no meaningful foreign exchange impact on that
revenue in the quarter.
Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 10% over the prior-year period.
Revenue growth was in line with constant-dollar payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up
25% over the prior year's quarter, based on solid growth rates in Visa-processed transactions inside and outside the
U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth, as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the
restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market. International transaction revenue was up 13% to $831 million,
reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of gross
revenue for the quarter came in at 16.1%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of
deals in the quarter. Looking forward, the change in pricing structure related to the Chase contract, in combination with
deal timing and revenue mix, now suggests full-year client incentives in the 16% to 17% range.
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to
higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategies. The rate of operating expense growth should slow in
the second half. Marketing expenses were up 15%, primarily due to a low spend level in the prior year, largely related
to the timing of the London Summer Olympics. Spend will step up in the fiscal third and fourth quarters as we increase
marketing to support a number of campaigns, including the FIFA Confederations Cup in South America.
Operating margin for the quarter was 63%. While slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60%, this margin
level is consistent with how we planned for the year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 31.6% and is fully consistent
with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%. Net income at $1.3 billion was up 17% over prior-year adjusted results.
Fully diluted EPS was $1.92 for the quarter, up 20% over prior-year adjusted results, due in part to a strong
commitment to return excess cash in the form of share repurchase. As noted earlier, our full-year adjusted EPS
guidance is now around 20%. Finally, capital expenditures were $111 million in the quarter and continued to be in line
with our full-year expectations. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal second quarter
totaled 660 million. Other than the changes to our client incentives and diluted earnings per share growth, all other
outstanding guidance remains the same.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.
Charles W. Scharf
Thanks, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. We're happy with our continued strong performance, and as Byron
walked us through, it was a strong growth across the world. Economic uncertainty does remain, but our business model
continues to prove itself through all environments. And growth rates, as Byron had mentioned, have continued through
April, which makes us feel quite good.
We continue to build on some exciting partnerships around the world, both traditional and involving emerging
technologies. Just a few important examples of these I want to mention. We executed a multiyear co-brand renewal
with Southwest Airlines, one of our largest co-brands in the United States. We've talked about V.me before. We now
have 82 U.S. issuers who've agreed to participate. We have more than 180 merchants signed, 20 of which are top-100
Internet retailers, and there're 37 merchants live today, and more coming online as we talk.
During the quarter, we also announced a broad-based partnership agreement with Samsung covering Visa's payment
capabilities on Samsung devices. Samsung phones will be preloaded with Visa payWave for contactless payments, and
the Visa Mobile Provisioning Service to securely download payment account information to NFC-enabled Samsung
devices. These are just a couple of examples of some of the most important things that we executed in the quarter.

I want to turn and talk for a second about Europe. There's been a lot of discussion about a couple of items. So we
thought we would walk through each of these one by one.
First of all, let's just talk about our relationship with Visa Europe and the put. I guess I would say is we've read what
you've read. We do not know what they'll do. And just as a reminder, they have a put, so it's their decision. We do not
have a call. The way we think about it, they have three options relative to our relationship: They can keep our
relationship as is, they can exercise the put, or they can propose an alternative which is different from the put. If they
choose to exercise the put, there's a clearly defined process for that. If they were to propose something other than the
put, we would consider it, and if so inclined, we would negotiate it in normal course. But the process of the put would
not apply.
It was clear when I got here that we're always prepared, if they choose to exercise the put, to go through the process and
have our point of view on that. And having said all that, we believe that we compete effectively now, but there certainly
are clear benefits over the long term to be one company, and I've talked about that before. I think it's true both for Visa
Inc. as well as for Europe, but they need to come to that conclusion themselves. But I think the – most importantly in
all of this is we're prepared to compete regardless of the structure, regardless of which avenue they go down. And if the
situation changes, we'll obviously report back, but as of now, what you read are the facts, I believe.
The second issue is the EC inquiry. They are investigating intra-European credit interchange rates and inter-regional
credit interchange rates, which is where a non-European cardholder uses their card within Europe. They're also
investigating certain MasterCard rates as well. If the EC ultimately challenges Visa and MasterCard's conduct, we
expect that it would seek to prohibit Visa and MasterCard from setting default inter-regional interchange rates at their
current levels. In addition, the EC is investigating honor all cards, no-surcharge rules, as well as the practice of
blending merchant fees. We're in discussions with the EC and have nothing to report yet. There is a disagreement to the
extent Visa Europe has an obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. on this issue. We're confident in our position that Visa
Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc., and we're engaged in conversations with them to resolve the matter.
Let me move and just quickly cover two regulatory and litigation items that you're all aware of. The first one is the
MDL. The deadline for the opt-outs is May 28, and we're confident that the judge will approve the settlement. On the
Department of Justice, there is no update. We remain comfortable our actions are appropriate.
Let me move on now and just harken back to the last quarter's earnings call. On that call, I talked about our need to
become more flexible and the need to work more closely with merchants, and I'm going to talk a little bit more about
this. Just a reminder, as we think about our opportunity, we believe the number one opportunity for us is to move
transactions from cash onto our electronic platform, and we're confident that our assets are of the quality and the scope
that we believe we would get our fair share of transactions in the process. This really is about moving transactions
away from cash. Our focus is on helping issuers remain competitive at the point of sale. The ecosystem is evolving, and
we need to evolve as well to make sure we remain competitive at that point. So to that end, we're evolving our rules.
We've also aggressively continued to invest in new capabilities that we think will benefit everyone in the payments
value chain.
An important example of this was effective February 1, we modified one of our rules to enable issuers and merchants to
differentiate at the point of sale. This could take form in a whole series of things, but it could include things such as
discounts, offers, or incentives. We like this change because it creates an environment where all four parties –
consumers, issuers, acquirers, and merchants – now have the ability to work together to create the most robust
experience for all. And all four parties will now be able to work together to use our network to help us grow Visa
payment volume. And the rule we had in place did not allow that to happen.
Been a lot of talk about the Chase contract, and the Chase contract, in reality, is just one example of giving our issuers
and acquirers an opportunity to create an environment to actually do what we just talked about, which is deliver more
value to merchant and consumers. So we included a slide, but I thought I would walk through exactly just what it is.
First of all, it's a 10-year renewable partnership. As part of this, we will create a distinct custom platform within
VisaNet for the processing of their transactions, which I believe they're referring to as Chase Merchant Services or

CMS. This image of Visa's authorization, clearing, and settlement system will be licensed to them exclusively for their
use. The Chase transactions will still originate from a Visa-branded card but will be processed in one of two ways. The
first way would be just as happens today. The second: If the card is used at a merchant with whom Chase has a direct
agreement for CMS, the transactions will be processed over the platform provided for them by us. Visa branding on the
cards and at the point of sale remains the same. The CMS platform is customizable, but the transactions will continue to
meet our safety, security, and soundness standards, and we can offer similar functionality to any other Visa client. Visa
retains ownership and control of its technology and intellectual property, which is obviously critical for us.
Chase, like any other issuer today, can negotiate interchange directly with merchants, whether the transaction is
processed through CMS or VisaNet. Not sure that this is well understood, that issuers have the ability to do this today.
But they do in fact have the ability to do it. And Chase and the other merchants will continue to have the ability. The
pricing levels and mechanics for our deal with Chase are consistent with what would be available to clients of Chase's
size and scope who are making a 10-year commitment. And obviously important for us, we, Visa, will gain additional
consumer credit and debit volume. Looking ahead, we will continue to develop new capabilities in enhancing our
business practices because we want to help issuers, acquirers, and merchants of all sizes work more closely together to
take full advantage of the opportunities emerging across the industries.
And to that end, we are in active discussions with other partners on ways to use our network to help them differentiate.
If clients are interested, we're willing to pursue customized arrangements that make sense for their own business needs,
but we will adhere to certain core Visa principles, which is the manner in which we'd approached the Chase
arrangement. Just a few of these would be – number one is it would have to support the Visa brand. It would have to
support our safety, soundness, and security standards that we maintain. We would have to maintain control over the IP.
We would have to continue to enable clients of all sizes to compete in the marketplace. And probably most importantly,
whatever we do would have to add value to the Visa network. The bottom line is we believe that our approach here,
relative to Chase and our approach with all issuers, acquirers, merchants of all sizes, are steps that are good for the
electronification of payments, good for all of our partner, and therefore good for us.
There's a lot more we could talk about, but we do have planned for you all a complete strategic update at our Investor
Day, scheduled for June 6. At that meeting, we intend to cover plans for what we're doing both in the developed and the
emerging economies, and we intend to focus a lot on e-commerce, mobile solutions, and what we're doing in the
technology space in general. So we'll leave a bunch of the discussions for that, since we'll have plenty of time. And
with that, I think we will stop, and we'll open the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I think the revenue performance obviously very strong. I was just wondering
if you could kind of talk about how you see that progressing? Obviously, it sounded like the incentives that you were
talking about was lower incentives in the current period, and so can we take away from that that you're actually seeing
a better combination, if you will, of kind of volume coming out of debit and some of the pricing actions that you've
taken?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So let me respond to that. First, just to be clear on the incentive piece. A large contributor to
the reduction in the incentive guidance going forward, and to a certain extent this quarter – when we signed the Chase
agreement, it restructured how we price so that, as I said in my opening remarks, gross fees are coming down, along
with incentives, and it's largely an offset. So while incentives for the balance of the year are expected to come in in that
16% to 17% range, that in and of itself is not a significant contributor to the revenue performance for the balance of the
year, because we haven't changed our overall revenue guidance.

So we're well positioned within the low double-digit range, and what we're seeing underlying that is a strong, sustained
performance globally. And with two quarters now under our belt – and because of our quarter lag, remember that we
actually have visibility to three quarters of service revenue – we have a much higher degree of certainty of how the year
will flow out. And given the strength we're seeing outside the U.S., good, sustained recovery in our U.S. debit business,
as you've pointed out, and particularly as we enter into the April-May-June quarter, this will anniversary the
Dodd-Frank routing rules. Notice I said Dodd-Frank, not Durbin. And so while the debit business in the U.S. has
sustained a meaningful loss, particularly in the Interlink, we're pleased with the way that our mitigating strategies have
unfolded and the way the business has been recovering over the past several quarters.
Operator
Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, good evening. Quickly, I was wondering if you could address any material pricing
differences between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe that would have to be overcome should the put be exercised. And
although I know it doesn't materially impact your top line, I was wondering if you could just clarify what's going with
the cash volumes in Latin America that seem to be off dramatically. Thanks.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: The pricing approach that Visa Europe pursues is one that's still is very much based on a
bank-owned membership arrangement, and so it's different than what we have here in the United States or for Visa Inc.
globally outside of Europe. Having said that, Visa Europe still must price to be competitive with other competitors like
MasterCard in that arena. And so we've not done a detailed analysis of what the comparisons are, but there is a
presumption that to be competitive, you have to price competitively, and we consider Visa Europe very competitive in
that part of the world. So don't really have a comment on that. And with regards to the cash volumes in Latin America,
don't have a comment on that either. And so that's one we'll have to take a look into, and we'd be happy to get back to
you through IR.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And let me just add to Byron's response on the Visa Europe question. As I said in the
remarks, there's a very defined process that we would go through with Visa Europe where we look at the sustainable
earnings power of the company. And I would presume a big part that discussion would be what the sustainable revenue
contribution would be as the model evolved. And there's plenty of time, through that process, to have that discussion
with them if we get to that point.
Operator
Our next question will come from Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks. Good evening. So between about $1.8 billion of buybacks and over $200 million in
dividends, it looks like your payout ratio was about 160% this quarter or thereabouts. As we look ahead, would final
approval of the merchant litigation, which you expect, influence your mind-set or attitude regarding capital return,
perhaps just making you feel like you have a bit more flexibility there?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: The answer is no. We began life as a public company committed to return excess cash to
shareholders. We have done that aggressively over five-plus years. Every time there was an opportunity to, in effect,
put money into the escrow on behalf of the U.S. bank shareholders, and do that in a way that had the effect of a share
repurchase, we did that. Had that money not gone into the escrow, I'm fairly confident in saying that we would have
ended up buying back, in the open market, those shares.
And just a final point. You mentioned the buyback and the dividends for the period. If you think about our commitment
in the following way, I think this underscores our commitment to return. We have guided to $6 billion of free cash flow
for the year. Roughly $1 billion of that $6 billion will be generated in – offshore in ways that we would not bring back
to the U.S. and subject it to taxes, at least anytime in the near future. That leaves $5 billion. We have authorization to

repurchase a little over $4 billion for the year, of which we have basically bought back through the first six months $3
billion of the $4 billion. And if you take four full quarters of dividend payments, you're approaching $1 billion. So if
you add the share repurchases at $4 billion to the dividends of $1 billion, you get $5 billion of the $6 billion of free
cash flow in effect returned to shareholders, and the $1 billion that isn't is off-shore.
Operator
Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss this merchant litigation that's being threatened in
Europe that you guys disclosed in the 10-Q. It seems like you feel like you're being – you should be indemnified there
as well. But I was wondering if you could just flesh that out a little bit. I guess – would that be part of the reason that
would drive the banks to exercise the put? And then second, I just wanted to make sure I understood Byron's point
about the Chase deal. Would the gross revenue yields then come down next quarter, given the structuring of the deal?
Because if you look at kind of the year-over-year change, those were up in the second quarter. Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: You want to answer the second one first, Byron?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Yeah, let me do the second one first. Everything else being equal, yes, the gross revenue
yields would come down, isolated to that one factor in Chase. Because you still have the transactions, but the way that
they are being charged, gross equals net, no incentives. And so incentives would go down; gross yield would go down.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And on the first point, let me take a shot at that for a second. So the EC is investigating
several different things, one of which is intra-European credit interchange, so this is where there is a card issued within
Europe and it's used inside of Europe. That affects Visa Europe. It does not affect us, per se. And they're also
investigating inter interchange, which is when it is a card issued outside of Europe and it's used inside of Europe. We
obviously don't know, since we're in discussions with them, where it winds up. We have nothing to report on exactly –
the specifics of what they're thinking.
And relative to how it impacts their view of the put, I think honestly that's a question for them, whether it's for Visa
Europe or for the banks themselves. I would say what we think about is what it does to our thinking about Visa Europe.
And in the different scenarios that I spoke about, to the extent that we have to go through a valuation process to
understand what the sustainable earnings of Visa Europe would be, that whatever the conclusion of this inquiry would
be would obviously help us – point us towards what the effect of this could certainly be. And if it's something outside
of the put, we would obviously have to take it into account as well. But when it's concluded, we'll know the specifics,
and we'll be in a position to understand the impacts.
Operator
Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. The clarification – just in terms of
other future deals like the Chase deal, are you guys kind of waiting for inbound interest in terms of other issuers
approaching you, or are you actually proactively marketing this to other big issuers? And then just as my question, also
on the topic of the 10-Q, saw some language there around CFPB taking a look at currency conversion fees on
cross-border transactions. Just any comments you may have on that? Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Okay, so on the first question, we're not the type of organization that waits for our clients to
call us. I mean, in all seriousness, we talk with our clients literally day in and day out. So when this was announced,
there are certainly extensive conversations that have gone on and continue to go on with clients of all sizes. And even
before the announcement, the conversations that we've had were very consistent with the messaging that I laid out on
the last call, which is that we want to be more flexible. We want to evolve our rules. And we want to focus much more
on working with merchants. So we are actively involved in talking to institutions of all sizes. I would describe them as

very, very different types of conversations, with people having different capabilities and different desires. And when I
went through my introductory remarks, I kind of laid out what some of the principles are for us to follow. But if we can
do things with them that would help them grow business and help us grow payment volume, that's something we're
very excited to do.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Yes, let me take the question on the CFPB. As you might imagine, we have quite a bit of
experience globally working with regulators, and it's not uncommon for them to reach out in a very informational way
to try and understand how certain practices unfold within our ecosystem, and that is very much the nature of this
dialogue with the CFPB. They have reached out and asked us if we would help educate them on how the currency
trading ecosystem works as it relates to credit and debit cards. And so myself, along with a number of my colleagues,
have met with them personally. It was a very straightforward, educational-type discussion focused on the mechanics of
how currency conversion works. I would describe the working relationship as very cordial, very sound. I would say at
the same time that our engagement is ongoing, and we will, of course, keep you all informed as this dialogue unfolds.

Our next question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Charlie, since the spring is the season for this, I was
wondering how you would characterize the general tone for new fees at this point? Should we expect more or less
revenue growth coming from new fees this year than in prior years?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: I didn't realize that spring was the period of time for new fees. You know, I think I'll leave
it at the revenue guidance overall that Byron gave. I think that's – I mean, that's – for us to talk about in another level of
detail of what we're forecasting for revenues would go beyond what is our practice and not something that we would
want to get into.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: I would just add to that. When we gave the original guidance that Charlie referred to at the
beginning of the fiscal year, we said that we would deliver our revenue the old-fashioned way, through volume
increases, and that there would not be a material reliance on any sort of price -
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Pricing overall.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: – yeah, pricing overall within the business plan for the year.

Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Hey, great. So, hey, a two-part question on the Chase VisaNet deal. Can you just give us a
sense of the reaction you're getting from other banks in the wake of that deal? And also maybe the acquirer community,
how they're reacting, and if you see any major constraints on the ability of other, particularly large banks, to pursue a
similar deal, Chase VisaNet type deal. And then, Byron, maybe on the numbers, can you give us a sense on whether
you expect to be revenue positive on the Chase deal over the next year, after – clearly there's some discounting that's
going on on that contract. Will the volume gains from MasterCard at Chase offset the impact of the pricing discounts?
Thanks.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Want me to start with the – ?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure.

<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Revenue accretive.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Excuse me, revenue accretive going into the next year. And the question is absolutely yes, that
when we factor in all the elements of the deal, including those you referenced, we expect to have positive revenue
growth with the Chase relationship in the coming year.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And relative to the reaction from banks and acquirers to Chase. I mean, I would honestly – I
guess I would say it was mixed initially, and quite candidly was probably confusing, because there were not a lot of
facts, because there were terms disclosed at the point of a letter of intent, not a final contract, which is what we have
signed now. So we've been able to have much more in-depth conversations about what it is, similar to what we've
talked about here. And I think the conversations very much have moved to What is it? It's confusing. What does it
mean? And this is both on the bank side and acquirer side to what can Visa do to help them customize and differentiate
their experience? So we're having that discussion, again, from small institutions to much bigger institutions and
acquirers alike.
And as I said, I think the overriding concept here is the world is changing around us, and there are lots of people that
we compete with and people who want to compete with us that have strategies around working with merchants at point
of sale, and if we don't figure out how to evolve our model to encourage issuers and acquirers to do that, then we'd be
leaving great opportunity on the table. And so we do have to be flexible in how we do it, as long as we don't think that
it violates any of the principles that I spoke about before. And we feel very good that what we're doing actually does
that.

Our next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Thanks. Good results. I'll ask a couple modeling nerd questions. Data processing fee, that
yield or revenue per trend, that jumped up quite a bit, the biggest we've seen in a long time. What's driving that? And I
guess going forward, that will be impacted to some degree by the Chase deal. Then, secondly, the international
transaction fee line, looked like the revenue growth grew at a premium to cross-border volume for the first time in over
a couple quarters. What's driving that as well? Thanks.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So let me respond. So on the data processing yield, as you all remember, about a year ago as
part of our Dodd-Frank debit mitigating strategy, we restructured our pricing. We introduced a lower variable
transaction fee. We introduced for the first time a fixed acquirer network fee. When we first introduced those, in the
way that we bill and record revenue, we had to do that to a certain degree, with some estimates, and – since it was a
new pricing structure. And as we conclude the March quarter, we've pretty much got a year of this under our belt, and
so we're now in a position where we can start to true up some of those estimates. And what you saw in the data
processing yield line was some true-up there and a few credits. Going forward, I would say that the data processing
yield is more likely to approximate what you saw in Q1 as opposed to Q2. Still very solid, but I think that's – from a
nerdy modeling standpoint, I think that's probably the guidance you were looking for.
With regards to international, as we have talked about this particular line on several occasions before, there is always
some degree of variability between volume and [ph] reported (43:12) revenue. Part of it is revenue mix. Part of it is the
amount of volatility we see in the currency markets. And in periods where there is a higher degree of volatility, often
associated with saber rattling or conflicting claims on islands in the China Sea, anything – issues around Cyprus –
anything that roils the currency markets and creates more volatility creates a bit more – has an impact on the revenue
that we report. And so that was the case with international this past quarter. We had a step up in currency volatility
relative to what we'd seen historically, and then we also had a little bit of a tailwind with regards to the specific
currencies and their weighting during the quarter. Some currencies just naturally yield more of a return across our fee
base than others. So that's the reason.

Our next question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Thank you. Just two quick ones. What would be the strategy on funding the put, if it were to
be executed? And then, secondly, just – I'd like a little update on CyberSource. It's been growing 25% for the last
couple of years, doesn't seem to be slowing. And I just wondered if the revenue was growing in line with that and what
the operating profit margin is on that CyberSource business? And any update on strategy would be helpful.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So let me take that. So in the event that we needed to consider funding for Visa Europe, let me
just give you the following perspective. We currently – at the end of this quarter, we have roughly $2.2 billion of cash
that is in offshore accounts, not immediately required for working capital. That $2.2 billion would be available for use
in a Visa Europe put situation. Once the put – if and when the put is exercised, we have 285 days to negotiate out and
fund the transaction. During that period, we would generate, in the normal course of business, at least $3 billion of free
cash flow. So before we ever get to debt, if any were to be required – recognizing we have no debt – we've got $5
billion of cash readily available to deploy. And that's not to say that we would use all that cash, because this might –
again, if the put were to be exercised, this might be a good opportunity to actually put some debt on the balance sheet
and lower our weighted average cost of capital.
The second question was CyberSource. CyberSource was acquired, as you might remember, because it moved us closer
to the merchant checkout page with regards to Internet transactions. The fastest-growing channel we have today is
e-com, and CyberSource gives us an additional value add in the transaction and a way of directly connecting through
the acquirer to our network in a way that is very synergistic with the rest of our business. When we acquired
CyberSource, it was primarily a U.S. business. The opportunity for us was outside the United States, and so we have
invested aggressively in CyberSource to accelerate the expansion of that business outside the United States and, as a
result, have been successful in sustaining its transaction growth rate at 20-plus percent ever since we acquired the
business. And I can tell you that that transaction growth rate is slightly above the pro forma projections that we
presented to our board when we justified the purchase price. So we couldn't be more pleased with the role CyberSource
is now playing in the Visa Inc. global strategy as we zero in on capitalizing on the Internet growth opportunity, which
is absolutely global in its scope.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And I'll just add, as we – all of our work that we've got going on with merchants, as I talked
about, CyberSource and its capabilities are a tremendous advantage for us in those conversations.

Our next question will come from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Hey, guys. Not to beat a dead horse, but I guess I'll keep jumping on this Chase Merchant
Services contract. Thinking through the reaction, I guess, mostly as it relates to kind of the independent or standalone
merchant acquirers versus the bank-owned merchant acquirers, how exactly would you distinguish the benefits to each
one of these guys, especially if they don't actually issue their own cards?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Well, again, I think – I guess the way we think about it is what we're – the importance of
what we did with Chase is not specifically about the Chase structure. It's about what the intent we're trying to get at,
which is to put issuers and acquirers together to work directly with merchants. So, to the extent that a bank owns an
acquirer, it obviously allows you to have that conversation under one roof. To the extent you have issuers who don't
control their own acquirers, hopefully now they're thinking about and are in fact having conversations with acquirers
about the types of things that they could do if they worked more closely together.
The reality is I think if you go around and talk to most issuers, they would probably say that there wasn't a lot of
conversation that went on between the issuing and acquiring side, partially because of our rules that stood in the way of
them working together to do something positive for the merchant. And so now that we've given them the ability to do

that, you don't have to own your own acquirer in order to take advantage of the changes that we've made. And I think,
quite frankly, we'll see how it evolves. I think going back to Rod's question earlier, I mean, there's some people that
look at this and say, Okay, got it. Understand it, but I don't believe it. I think it's too hard. I don't think it's going to be
successful. I don't intend to change anything. And we'll wait and see. And if we get to a point of, hey, there's something
there, then we've got capabilities, and we'll go forward with that. There're others that are more interested in thinking
through how to take advantage of some of the things that we're willing to do.
And I think honestly this will evolve over the next – it'll take, I'm going to say, a couple years. It's not the type of thing
that'll be – [indiscernible] (50:55) very, very short. They involve not just conversations between issuers and acquirers,
but you have to have conversations with merchants. They have to believe that there's a real value proposition there.
They've got to do some things different, potentially, in their stores with their customers. And that's not always the most
obvious and easy conversation. But, again, we think it's the right conversation to have, but it's a thesis that has to be
proved.

Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. Listen, just to – first to clarify on the Chase deal timing, again, and then a quick
question on the stored wallet fees. First on Chase, did the deal economics actually show up at all in the quarter that was
just reported in terms of the incentives? Because you came in at 16% as a percentage of gross revenue, so it seems a
little lower than the 18%-plus. And then just a question on the stored wallet fee that MasterCard has announced. Seems
like Visa's still not committed to doing that, as far as at least we've seen. Can you just give us some idea and thought
around that fee, and really your interaction with, for instance, PayPal and some of the e-commerce players that that
could affect?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Yep, [indiscernible] (52:04) you do the first one.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Okay, let me take the first one. So just to clarify the question, did – because the Chase deal
was signed in April, actually, it did not have any impact to the quarter just reported. So this is – it has a retroactive
effect a little bit earlier, but that is all contemplated in the guidance that we gave for the balance of the year.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And on the staged wallet question. So, first of all, just on the actual staged wallet fee that
MasterCard implemented, that's not something that we're currently contemplating. But we're actively thinking through
what has changed in the ecosystem and how we have to react to that. Our relationship with PayPal and people like them
has evolved. It's complicated. They specifically are a very important customer of ours, but they have their own
ambitions. And we're mindful, I think, first and foremost, of the impact that they have, both positively and negatively,
potentially, on our issuers, because that ultimately will be what determines our success. And I think we are actively
thinking about the right way to restructure the ecosystem in a way that works for everyone. And we've got nothing to
announce now, but we will at some point.

<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Byron, do you want to talk about those changes we've made here over the past year?

sophistication of the platforms that you bring to bear to service corporate clients. It's a very
information-reporting-intensive business. And we have made significant investments over the last several years in a

Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just turning to U.S. credit, clearly you've
had a great run recently, even posting above-market growth. But what's important for us is to get a sense of how much
longer this can continue. So in that vein, is it possible, just roughly, to parse your growth into maybe three buckets –
sources of – three buckets, like just having faster-growing clients because of client-specific reasons, clients that are
growing Visa volume faster because of the things you're doing with them, and then finally just share gains overall. I
mean, can you roughly bucket that for us? And then, maybe, sum it up with some texture of how much pent-up
above-market growth do you have in the backlog and the pipeline here to give us confidence this can continue for
several more quarters or even beyond that.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: I'll just start, Byron, then – and you can chime in. I mean, obviously, it's very hard, right, to
put things into the buckets numerically the way you spoke about. But I think when you look at our issuing base, we've
certainly benefited from the partnerships that we have with the faster-growing issuers out there. And you can say that
that's luck on our part historically, or it's that Visa targeted the right population of customers, and I think it stands for
itself. Things don't happen by chance, and we do have a very fast-growing set of customers that we certainly benefit
from. And the same thing is true relative to the co-brands that we have. The co-brands, again – just like anything else,
not all co-brands are equal, and we think we've got the premier client base out there. And we've been clearly very big
beneficiaries of that and would expect that to continue.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: I would just add one other component to this. In addition to the quality and the growth
delivered by the issuer, that's also impacted by the quality of the cardholder portfolio, as measured by affluent income
levels. And we are very well positioned in the affluent portfolios. And if you think about it, what has driven the credit
card payment volume growth, certainly over the past two years, has been predominantly affluent. And so being well
positioned as the economy recovers, this is an area where we are well positioned to sustain this kind of growth. It
should be less volatile in that sense. And so we certainly feel it has strong legs. Relative to the delta, that's a much
harder one to frame.
Operator
Our next question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Yeah, hi, guys. Just a couple questions. I guess first on the EC inquiry, does that have any
potential impact on Visa's fees, or are we talking about Visa Europe fees? And then on the Chase Visa deal, I guess two
questions. One, are we talking about a material amount of volume that you guys expect, the consumer credit and debit?
And I'm just trying to get a sense if that's new cards just for new business or will that be some of the existing business?
And then finally, on the – I've heard you say, Charlie, before, that the – Chase could have done this on-us transactions
before, so then the question comes out, then why are they using Visa at all, and is Visa getting any money at all for
allowing on-us transactions? Thanks so much.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That was – let's start there. What we said they could do
historically was enter into pricing arrangements directly with merchants relative to interchange. And, again, anyone can
do that today, and that's not specific to on-us transactions. So I'm not sure, then, the rest of the question flows. So if we
didn't answer it, maybe come back and ask us the question again. But they and everyone else have the ability to go
negotiate interchange, and they've got the ability to do that in this agreement in a different format, in a different

structure.
On the size of the Chase commitment, again, I think the best way to characterize that is what Byron said, which is
net-net, all in all, we think that we're still in a position to grow revenues, and how we get there and whatnot is not
something that I think is appropriate for us to talk about.
And back on the first piece, on the EC inquiry, it is on interchange, and so that would be the direct impact of what it is
they're looking at today.

<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Thank Moshe.
<A - John R. Carsky>: Thank Moshe.
<Q - John T. Williams>: I will. So I had a follow-up. I hate to beat the dead horse on Chase Merchant Services, and
forgive the basic nature of my question. But I think it's reasonable to say JPMorgan's not paying you guys very much in
the way of assessment fees, and so as you considered doing this deal, what was lacking in the relationship that made
something of this magnitude necessary? I mean, obviously, you're locking up a large customer for a while, but how
does Visa actually benefit in an incremental way? Because it sounds like on the one hand you might get more
transactions, but on the other hand, the on-us transactions will stay on-us. So if you could give a little more color on
how you guys specifically benefit in an incremental way, that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Yeah, I mean, I'll give you our point of view, but again, why – some of those questions, I
think, are important for them. So specifically from our point of view, we don't believe that this structure was necessary
to accomplish what the end goal is. The structure is something that we worked on together, because it's something that
was important to them, but that's – which is why we believe that this structure isn't specific to them, that we could go
accomplish the same thing by working with issuers and acquirers separately without this kind of structural transaction
that occurred.
The benefit in this, if we're successful at this, is really related to the rule change that we made, which encourages and
allows the issuers and acquirers to go talk to merchants directly and to ask the question, What can we do for you? Or to
propose an idea of We can do the following thing for you to help you drive more sales, drive more volume into your
stores, and in return for that presumably there will be additional transactions that get directed to the Visa cards. Again,

this structure, we don't believe, is necessary to do that, but it certainly allows that to happen, and that's what was
important to us.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: And I would just add, on the economics, John, that this business has always been built on an
economic business model that says the larger the client, the larger the portfolio, the better pricing you get. And this was
one of our largest clients, one of the largest portfolios. We had the opportunity to enter into a 10-year arrangement that
has a set of economics that are consistent with how we have been doing multi-year contracts with other clients over the
years, including Chase. And given the size of this portfolio and where we expect it to be over the next five and 10
years, is there margin compression? Yes. But that margin compression is consistent, in the same ZIP code, as what we
would normally have expected to have put on the table given the size of the portfolio and the kind of growth that we're
expecting this partnership to produce. So from that standpoint, we're very comfortable with the economics of this deal.
