Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely
to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement
disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for
disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning. Let me begin today by acknowledging the families and loved ones of those
aboard the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. All of them, and everyone affected by this horrific tragedy, are in our thoughts
and prayers at this time. For the men and women of Boeing and others throughout our industry who are passionately
committed to ensuring the safety and security of passengers and aircrews, this is a particularly unsettling and painful
moment in the history of civil aviation. We are providing technical assistance to the investigation at the request of the
NTSB, which is supporting international authorities in the important work they have under way.
Turning back to the subject at hand this morning. I'll start with some comments on the quarter and our business
environment. After that, Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook.
Now, let's move to slide 2. Boeing delivered strong second quarter operating performance across our production
programs and services businesses, with solid revenue, double-digit core EPS growth, and healthy cash generation. Our
strong positive performance through the first half of the year has allowed us to continue returning cash to shareholders
and increase guidance for our full-year EPS by $0.75, which includes approximately a $0.50 tax benefit. Greg will
discuss guidance in more detail in just couple of minutes.
During the second quarter, we did record a $272 million after-tax charge on our fixed-price U.S. Air Force tanker
program engineering and manufacturing development contract. The charge was driven by higher spending needed to
complete systems installation on the tanker test aircraft and maintain the schedule for delivering this vital capability to
the warfighter. As you may recall, we noted in our investors conference that we were beginning to see some challenges
in the build and systems installation process. The increased spending is primarily related to additional engineering and
systems installation rework required mainly to meet wiring specifications.
The issues at hand are well defined and understood, which in no way mitigates our disappointment in having to take
this charge. But the actions we have taken to keep us on path to the next major program milestone, which is to begin
test-flying fully provisioned tanker aircraft in the first part of next year. With a long-term potential market for the
KC-46 tanker of up to 400 airplanes worth $80 billion, it remains a franchise program for Boeing, and we expect to
realize strong returns over decades of production and in-service support.
With that said, let's discuss our core operating performance during the quarter. Revenue at Boeing Commercial
Airplanes was $14.3 billion, and operating margins increased to 10.8%, a result of both the higher volume and a
favorable delivery mix. We delivered 181 commercial airplanes in the second quarter, including 37 '87 Dreamliners,
and we added net new orders of 264 airplanes. So far in July, we have booked another 282 orders, including those
announced by customers at the Farnborough International Airshow, bringing our current net order total to 783 for the
year, already a book-to-bill greater than 1.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the second quarter of $7.7 billion. During the period, BDS
captured numerous key contract awards, including a $1.9 billion order for 44 U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air
Force EA-18 and F/A-18 aircraft, a $700 million order for five years of AEW&C in-service support from the Royal
Australian Air Force, and a $200 million order for our ninth 702MP Intelsat satellite. Significant program milestones
included a successful missile-defense system intercept test, delivery of both the fourth P-8I aircraft to India, and the
100th EA-18G Growler to the U.S. Navy.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. Global demand remains high for the superior fuel efficiency
and economics provided by our family of commercial airplanes, as recognized in the order totals I mentioned earlier.

Global passenger traffic trends continue to be healthy, and air cargo traffic is still gradually improving. In addition to
growth-driven demand, we continue to experience and foresee sustained high replacement demand where newer, more
efficient airplanes offer compelling economics and a rapid return on investment compared to keeping older, less
efficient airplanes in service.
Combining growth and replacement needs over the next 20 years, we forecast global demand for nearly 37,000
commercial airplanes, a 4% increase over last year's forecast. Deferral requests from customers are still running well
below the historical average, while requests to accelerate deliveries remain brisk. This ongoing strong demand, coupled
with our already-sizable and diverse backlog of more than 5,200 airplanes, reinforces our planned production rates and
outlook for sustained growth in the years ahead.
In the twin-aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X, which continue to outsell
the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to transition between the two airplanes. As part of
our focus on that transition, we are looking to maximize production efficiencies with existing best practices from other
programs, as well as advanced new manufacturing technologies. For example, last week we unveiled a new robotic
system for building 777 fuselages. This automated approach will increase first-time quality, reduce build times, and
improve workplace safety for our employees. On the 787 program, we achieved major milestones with certification of
330-minute ETOPS and the on-schedule certification and first delivery of the 787-9 to Air New Zealand. Development
of the 787-10 also is progressing to plan, with the first delivery in 2018.
In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high, with cumulative orders
exceeding 2,100 airplanes from 43 customers. The production bridge from today's 737 to the MAX remains solid, with
the first MAX delivery in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. We continue to see solid support for our major programs in the FY 2015 budget
process. We are encouraged by the actions taken in both the House and Senate appropriations committees with regard
to additional P-8s, Apaches, and EA-18G aircraft.
International Defense, Space & Security business represented nearly 30% of BDS revenues during the quarter and
remains at approximately 35% of the BDS backlog as we continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global
advantage. Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial
derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber-security, and the few but
critical future large scale programs identified as priorities by our customer. Like long-range strike, UCLASS, and the
T-X trainer.
The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven, and
affordable – and is being delivered on budget and on schedule. We remain intensely focused on driving further
efficiency, quality, and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth.
Defense, Space & Security continues to make great progress on our market-based affordability initiative as we strive to
take out another $2 billion in operating costs. Along those lines, benefits from our enterprise Partnering for Success
approach with suppliers continued to accrue. For example, in collaboration with our partner Japanese (sic) [Japan]
Aircraft Industries, we are reducing the cost of producing various 777 parts through value engineering, a great joint
effort that will help ensure the continued competitiveness of the 777 airplane in the marketplace.
In summary, notwithstanding our disappointment over the charge on tanker, our team delivered another strong quarter
of core operating performance, captured meaningful growth through new business, and made great progress on further
improving productivity and achieving important program milestones for us and our customers.
Now, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith

Let's turn to slide 4 to discuss our second quarter results. Second quarter revenue of $22 billion was driven by a 7%
increase in commercial airplane deliveries and higher commercial services volume. Core operating margins of 9%
reflect solid productivity gains on production programs and across the services businesses, offset by the impact of the
tanker charge.
Second quarter core earnings per share increased 45% to $2.42 a share on additional tax adjustments, higher
commercial volume, and continued strong operating performance on core production programs. During the quarter, we
recorded a tax benefit of $116 million for the 2007 and 2008 tax settlements that we discussed in April, as well as an
additional $408 million tax benefit related to the 2009-2010 tax settlement and a tax basis restoration.
The $425 million pre-tax charge, or $272 million on an after-tax basis, for the tanker program largely relates to
additional engineering and manufacturing labor associated with challenges we encountered in the wire installation as
we moved into the systems integration stage of final assembly on the initial test aircraft. As we've said before, given the
significant long-term tanker market opportunity that Jim discussed, we bid the EMD phase of the tanker program
aggressively at zero margin, with plan profitability generated during the production phase. Looking at our overall
performance to date on the program, we have met all customer milestones and are proceeding with functional testing, to
be followed by the start of initial tanker flight testing in early part of next year.
As Jim noted, despite our disappointment in encountering these challenges, the issues are well understood. No new
technology is required to resolve them, and we believe the program is sufficiently provisioned and has a solid path
forward. We are confident that we're taking the right steps to fulfill our promises to our customer. Excluding the tanker
performance encountered in the quarter, we continued to make great progress across other areas of the business.
Let's now turn to Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. For the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business
increased revenue 5% to $14.3 billion on 181 aircraft deliveries, including a record 124 737s and 30 787s. The business
also increased operating margins in the quarter to 10.8%. Higher volume and our focus on efficiently executing on our
rate increases and continuously driving productivity led to strong operating performance during the quarter that more
than offset the $238 million pre-tax charge related to the EMD tanker contract at BCA.
Commercial Airplanes captured $17 billion of net orders during the quarter, and backlog remained very strong at a new
record of $377 billion over 5,200 aircraft, equating to approximately seven years of production. In the second quarter,
while at a declining rate, 787 deferred production increased $1.1 billion to $24.2 billion, largely driven by increase in
our rate of production on the 787-9 and inventory pull-ahead to efficiently optimize our production and minimize
dash-8 disruption as we introduce the aircraft into our production system. Based on further production stability, planned
contracted higher step-down pricing, and continued overall productivity improvements, we expect the quarterly change
in deferred to improve over the remainder of the year. The cash flow profile of the 787 continues to improve as we
drive productivity throughout the production system.
We continue to see good progress on key operational performance indicators and unit cost as we further implement
production efficiencies and increase 787-9 production. As we continue our efforts to optimize the production system
and maximize efficiencies at the 10-per-month rate, team continues to make progress in reducing 787-8 unit costs by
approximately 13% and improved final assembly flow times by more than 10% over the past year.
Travel work has also been significantly reduced, declining by greater than 30% since this time last quarter. We're also
continuing to see good progress in the 787-9 productivity, where we've seen 50% improvement in unit cost and a 25%
improvement in flow time from the first aircraft to the seventh aircraft to roll out the factory. Overall, we've made solid
improvement on the 787 program. However, great deal of work ahead of us as we increase dash-9 production,
introduce the dash-10 into early stages of our production system, and continue to optimize to drive further productivity
and profitability on the program. We remain on track to deliver approximately 110 787s in 2014. And, again, the team
remains focused on day-to-day execution and improving long-term productivity and profitability on the program.
Let's now turn to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Second quarter revenue for our defense business was
$7.7 billion, and operating margins were 7.5%, a strong performance on production programs and favorable delivery
mix, offset by the $187 million pre-tax charge on the EMD tanker contract. Boeing Military Aircraft's second quarter

revenue declined to $3.5 billion, reflecting delivery mix and operating margins of 4.7% in the quarter, again impacted
by the tanker charge. Global Services & Support revenue of $2.3 billion reflects slightly lower volume in the
maintenance, mod, and upgrade business. And strong operating performance across that business drove operating
margins to 11.6%. Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.9 billion on lower commercial satellite volume
and generated operating margins of 7.8% in the quarter. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $63
billion, with 36% of our current backlog now from international customers.
Now turn to slide 7. Boeing Capital's net financing portfolio declined to $3.4 billion on runoff that exceeded new
aircraft volume.
Now look at cash flow on slide 8. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $1.8 billion, driven by solid operating
performance and timing of receipts and expenditures. With regards to capital deployment, we paid $530 million in
dividends to shareholders and repurchased 11.4 million shares for $1.5 billion in the second quarter. We continue to
anticipate completing the remainder $6.8 billion repurchase authorization over approximately the next two years.
Returning cash to shareholders, along with continued investment to support future growth, remains a top priority for us.
Moving now to cash and debt balance on slide 9. We ended the quarter with $11 billion of cash and marketable
securities, and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward.
Turning now slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2014. We're increasing our core earnings per share guidance for 2014
by $0.75, to now be $7.90 to $8.10 a share, reflecting the $408 million tax benefit and strong core operating
performance that more than offset the impact of the tanker charge. Guidance for revenue, operating cash flow, and
delivery remain unchanged. Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance for 2014 is increased to now be greater
than 10% on continued strong operating performance. Over the remainder of the year, we anticipate BCA margins to be
impacted by higher 787 deliveries, some additional fleet support, and additional investments in productivity initiatives.
Defense, Space & Security operating margin guidance for 2014 is unchanged at approximately 9.5%, with lower
margin guidance in BMA, offset by higher guidance in the GS&S business.
In summary, second quarter performance reflects the strength of our backlog, the strong demand for our products and
services, and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise. And furthermore, as
evidenced by the meaningful dividend increase and the higher share repurchase activity, we continue to expect to
deliver solid growth, productivity, and strong cash flows going forward.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jim for some closing comments.
W. James McNerney
Thanks, Greg. With a strong first half behind us and a team that is focused on sustained strong business performance,
we are ready and committed to deliver on our strengthened outlook for the remainder of 2014. Our priorities remain
clear: the profitable ramp-up in production on our Commercial Airplane programs; executing on our commercial and
defense development programs, with the emphasis on tanker; driving productivity and affordability throughout the
enterprise; continuing to strengthen and position our Defense business with investments in growth areas amid further
international expansion; and all the while providing increasing value to both our customers and shareholders.
With that said, we'd now be happy to take your questions.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Despite the admonition, it's going be sort of a two-part question. So there's two parts to it. If
we think about it, the tanker, you probably missed the program costs by about 10%. Can you help us understand why
you've killed all the bugs in the program? And then, second, if we adjust margins for R&D and maybe exclude what
appears to be 787 revenues, your margins on the core business continued to improve. So the question really is, with that
kind of improvement, why aren't we seeing some of that translate into even better numbers on the 787? Because if
you're getting the core business there, some should spill into the other business. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Thanks, Howard. Let me address your second question first on margin improvement. You're
right. I mean, I think, again, the continuous focus on productivity, whether it's within our four walls or through the
Partnering for Success initiative, is driving a lot of that. And there has been improvement on the 787. We're certainly
not at the levels that we expect. So we have high expectations on driving margins further on that program. But we have
seen improvements on that program, as well as, I'd say, on the core programs – in particular the 37 and the 777. So
continuing to focus there, Howard. Big priority for us. Big priority within Partnering for Success certainly is 787.
With regards to the tanker program, certainly as we worked our way through the integration on that first aircraft and
learning from that and understanding some of the challenges we were faced with, we certainly understand the scope of
work that needs to be done on the balance of that aircraft, as well as aircraft two through four. And that's giving us the
confidence to understand, again, how to get to completion. This is not new technology or innovation. This is basic kind
of blocking and tackling as we work through the redesign and the engineering effort, primarily around the wire
harnesses, and then the manufacturing labor to work through installing those. So we've got some of that activity
completed on the first aircraft, enough to move into first flight, which will be late in the third quarter this year. And
then the balance will obviously be scope that will be applied on those other airplanes.
If you look at kind of some of the things that are done on this program, maybe versus some of the others – labs. So we
have a wet-fuel lab, we have a lighting lab. And those are all been put in place, and right from the beginning of the
program, to de-risk the program. So we have a very functional wet lab where we're actually running fuel through
pumps and valves to validate that on the ground so when we get in the air, that minimizes that risk. And so there's
things like that, Howard, that have been put in place that we're continuing to make our way, making progress on, as
well as working our way through the functional testing on that first airplane.
So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Again, we're comfortable about the path forward. We're committed to
meeting the customer milestones through the balance of this contract. And that's what the team has been focused on.
And the long-term profitability, I should also mention, on this program and that objective, is unchanged as we work
into the production phase of the contract.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.

<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Greg, just a question on the BCA margins, which, ex the charge, look like they were very
strong at 12.5%. Given the 787 mix, that's a pretty high number. And I wondered if you could help us with that a little

bit. The universe's program differences were about $2 billion. And I wondered if you might give us some color on that
and let us know if there's any – were there negative differences on any of the mature production programs, and did
those programs on the '73 – and 777 you mentioned they were better. But were those at record margin levels, or was
there something else going on in terms of period expenses? I know the R&D was a little bit lower. But any color you
can provide on how those margins compared to the historical trend?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, program to program, they varied slightly. I mean, certainly '37 and 777
continue to have solid margins. We did have a slight increase on the 787 as well. And the team is doing a very good job
managing the period expense, whether it's the G&A, or the R&D, or the fleet support.
Now, when you look in the back half, obviously we got more 787s in there, so we'll have some dilution on the margin
from that perspective and a little bit higher period expenses. I talked about I think on the last call where we got more
new customer introductions going on. So we're going to spend a little bit more on fleet support to ensure that our
customers have a smooth transition of entering that airplane into service. But that's predominantly what's driving the
back half. But, again, we're staying very laser-focused on looking for further opportunities there and continuing to drive
productivity. But I would tell you, the BCA programs are running very well, and they're doing a very good job
executing on these rate breaks, at the same time continuously focused on productivity.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And were the '37 and 777 differences negative?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Negative? I'm sorry. I don't quite understand.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Meaning, did you subtract from those programs? Meaning, was their unit profitability better
than their program profitability in the quarter?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: You're welcome.

Our next question's from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Troy J. Lahr>: Hey, Doug.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: When you look forward over the next, I would say, four to five years and think about how
you're investing in BCA, and you go through completing the 787 and MAX models, and then you're moving toward the
777X, how should we expect R&D and CapEx to go over that time period? What's the trajectory we should think about
for those?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, let me – maybe I'll start with CapEx, and then we could talk more about R&D
collectively. But certainly on CapEx I think for next year you're going to see levels similar to this year. And that's
predominantly, almost all of it, really, investing in the future. So this is all about the additional rate breaks coming up,
along with productivity. Jim talked about the 777 automation, so we are making some investments in the production
system as well. But, again, a lot of that is driven on the growth. So after that, Doug, I think we'll start to see the CapEx
moderate at, I'll say, kind of more normal levels at a stable production rate going forward.
On the R&D, certainly on – we'll peak out here on R&D on the MAX in about 2015. Obviously 787-9 ramping-down,
but dash-10 ramping up. Then feathering in 777X and then dash-10 in there. So we're continuing to look at those

profiles over the next couple of years and how they will play out in meeting our entry into service dates. But we'll see
slight increases into next year, but, again, we're managing it very tightly. And I know Jim's talked a lot about how we're
managing development. And we talked about that a lot at the investor conference, and we're continuing to do that to

<Q - Doug S. Harned>: But should we think about it as, as these sort of ebb and flow here, that things should be
somewhat flat but then would we expect with the 777X, as we've seen in programs in the past, some kind of a ramp-up
out in the 2018, 2019 timeframe? Are we looking at that type of a typical trajectory?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I'll jump in here. Greg's tired, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: No, I mean, listen, this development program, the two design pillars of the remaining
part of the decade were avoiding major pileups of engineering with concurrent work being done. And the second pillar
was not absorbing as much risk in each development. I mean, in other words, capitalizing on some of the hard-fought
technology gains we'd had and not adding risk to that. And so I think those comments imply a design of some upward
pressure, but nothing like your question implied. I mean, our plans do not have big pileups in R&D along the way. It's
more characterized by very manageable, no major year-over-year spikes. Now, we'll report on that as we get closer to
these, but the design of this is – "moderation" would be a word that I'd use rather than "precipitous" in any given year.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yep.

Next we go to John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Hey, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Jim and Ray (sic) [Greg], I was hoping you guys could maybe reflect a little bit on
Farnborough and what transpired there – particularly just given the A330 Neo announcement – and how you think it
might affect the competitive balance a bit. And as well as 777. I think some of us had hoped to see a little bit more
order activity there, but I understand that these campaigns can take a while to pull off.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, we did have 150 777X orders the week before Farnborough. But, look, the
competitive question – and I know that's way you're really driving at here – one way to look at the A330 Neo is that it
replaces an ambition to have a second A350-800 model. So in some respects it's a trade of older technology re-engined
for newer technology. And I'm not sitting with the Airbus guys as they make these calls, but that's one way to look at it,
old technology for new. And whereas we've got, in the wide-body space, five new airplanes, all of which exceed the
competitive performance of what we've seen from our competitor. And so I really like that lineup.
And I think if you look at year-to-date orders, wide-bodies for an example, I think you'll see a very healthy dose of –
and I forget exactly, somewhere in the mid-200s of wide bodies, and I think with the Emirates cancellation, our
competitor may even be negative for the year. So that is a more strategic timeframe than what happened during three
days at Farnborough. But I really like the relative strength of our wide-body offerings, those five airplanes, all new, all
selling briskly, with a sort of a mix of new technology and re-engined old technology that our competitor has.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: There's a little bit of a concern among investors that book-to-bill might start to slip. I was
hoping that you could offer a little bit of perspective on that just given your comments there.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I mean, I think – we continue to see brisk demand, as we've said. I mean, as I
mentioned in my remarks, deferral requests are well below historical averages for our company. Hey, move the airplane

up; accelerate the delivery far above what we have historically had. And the reason for that is this new technology that
we're offering pays back so quickly, even when compared to airplanes that haven't reached their full life out there. I
mean, you can – for the lease rate you have to pay, or for the incremental capital you have to deploy, the payback is so
quick – with oil prices that don't promise to come down, with the geopolitical world that we're in – pay back so quickly
that this replacement demand is half or in some segments more than half of the demand, not just underlying GDP
growth or growth in air traffic.
And our book-to-bill, for example, in July is already above 1-to-1, and we're halfway through the year. So we haven't
seen signs of it yet. I realize that it is a professional sport to call the cycle in this industry that we're in. But this industry
has not seen this kind of replacement economics since the 707 – and that was in the mid-1950s – where the payback
was so dramatic and the performance was so different. And so we're seeing no signs of it yet.

We'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Cai.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yeah. So your deferreds on the 787 went up by $1.1 billion. Maybe give us some color on
how much of that was the rate increase and how much was the inventory pull-forward, which is essentially a
discretionary move on your part to improve.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yep.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Give us color on the pattern in the third and fourth quarter. Are we going to get to zero? And
the impact on the deferreds from the fact that while the A330 Neo is probably not as efficient as the 787, it certainly is
priced lower given the orders they've received. And what response are you going to make? And what impact does that
have on 787 deferreds? Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay. I'll talk about the deferred, and then I'll hand over to Jim. He can talk more about kind
of pricing on the 787. But you're right. Our airplane is much more efficient. So on the 787 on deferred, Cai, about a
third of that growth we saw there was inventory pull-ahead to support dash-9. And as I talked about in my opening
remarks, I mean, seven airplanes and we've seen a 50% increase in unit costs, so it really gives you a sense of the
cadence and the work that people are focused on to improve productivity on the program.
As you think about kind of the path forward to the end of the year, certainly learning curve. We've got to continue to
come down the learning curve as we have. And that includes, obviously, on the dash-8 but obviously with more dash-9s
in the flow. So got to continue to work that. We do have some supplier step-down through the balance of the year.
There's some model mix movement that will take place in the balance of the year that should be favorable for deferred.
And then as you mentioned, I mean, quarter over quarter, I'd say month over month, we are making inventory decisions
to pull forward components if they're ready, get them into the fixtures, and do as much pre-work as we can. And,
frankly, that's why you've seen us being able to stabilize that production system.
So that's kind of the give and take that's going to take place through the balance of the year. At the same time, we're not
doing as much pull-ahead as we have because we're more stable at 10 a month. It's really, really around dash-9. And
then again continue with a focus on stabilizing the production system in all positions of assembly.

So that's kind of, I'll say, the moving pieces as you look through the balance of the year, Cai. As I said to you, certainly
this is a big focus area for us, but the day-to-day focus on that program is on unit cost and cash. That's the focus. Which
ultimately I recognized in deferred, but that's what that team is executing to. Again, good progress, but again we got to
continue to come down that learning curve through the balance of the year and going forward to drive profitability and
ultimately impact deferred.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, Cai, your question about A330 Neo as compared to – the most comparable
airplane would be the 787-10 in terms of emission. Look, our strategy is to produce the most capable airplane and then
share the value with our customers that that value produces. And obviously the value's two components. One is
efficiency. That's all about fuel. Big advantage dash-10 compared to the A330 Neo, in the neighborhood of
mid-double-digits kind of advantage. And also performance. I mean, I think the reach of the airplane's a little greater.
And so we feel very comfortable, even under scenarios where, as your question implies, they'd have to accept less price
for a less capable airplane. We feel very comfortable when we sort of model that all out that our returns are good. And
the capability of our airplane sustains value for both us and our customers. And so I think I understand why they made
this decision. It's a far less capable airplane, and they'll have to make decisions on how they price it and how they
market it. But these aren't pancakes we're dealing with. These are airplanes – major investments that produce a lot of
value when they're good.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.

Our next question's from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I was intrigued with the comment that you increased by a small amount the accrual rate for
787. I think that's, if I'm not mistaken, the first time you've done that except for the time that you extended the counter
quantity by quite a bit. And I was wondering if you could give us any detail on what gave you the confidence to do
that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, certainly again coming back to Partnering for Success. That was one of the bigger
elements of the movement within the quarter, Joe, and like we talked in the past, on the Partnering for Success efforts,
787 is the big – our number one priority. So started to see some of that come together with our suppliers, and reaching
agreements, and we booked it. And that's essentially what drove the change quarter over quarter.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Greg, do you feel like that there's room for small steps if things keep going in that direction in
the coming periods, or that 787 margin is something we're going to have to wait a while for? Or is this something –
how do you feel about, I guess, the prospects?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to take time, Joe. There's no question about it. I mean,
quarter over quarter I wouldn't expect a lot of movement, but we have a plan – by supplier, by component, and working
with those folks, so it really kind of gets to how we can accelerate those discussions or negotiations and reach an
agreement. Certainly the more time we spent on Partnering Success, the more mature we are getting with those
discussions, and we expect to do that. But it's going to take some time. But clearly, again, it's the number one priority
and focus, and we have a plan, and so we got to continue to execute with that and work with our partners, because the
long-term certainly prospects of this program are extremely beneficial to everybody, including our suppliers. So we're
continuing on the journey that we started here.

And next we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Myles.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Hey, Greg, maybe a question for you on cash flow.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yep.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: It's been a pretty strong year-to date when you consider the headwinds from the '67 and the
union bonus, and I look at the full year, and there's been no raise there and I'm assuming the tax benefits or no cash. But
it still would imply the second half of 2014 cash flow is half of what it was in the second half last year, despite lower
deferred production growth. So can maybe you just walk us through how much conservatism is there or other puts and
takes?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, remember last year, too, we had a lot of timing benefit very late in the fourth
quarter, which I don't expect at the same level as we're going to experience this year. We got more cash taxes by close
to $1 billion this year compared to last year. And, again, some of that is back-loaded when you compare. But, Myles, I
would just tell you, I mean, very focused obviously on generating cash. We're comfortable with our approximate $7
billion of cash flow, and if we see that improving through the next quarter, then we'll update our guidance going
forward. But, at the same time, when you look at the long-term prospects on cash flow for the company, that is
unchanged.
I mean, delivering on this backlog and executing to our plans is going to generate a significant amount of operating
cash going forward. And we're going to deploy that in the most efficient and effective way possible. So continue to
focus on it, Myles. It's, again, hard to compare last fourth quarter or third quarter to this one, because there's a lot of
moving pieces within the quarter. But, again, if we see opportunities to improve that, we will. But we're comfortable
with where we are right now.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. All right. Thanks. I'll stick to one.

mean, your backlog continued to be very strong. Book-to-bill was a little under 1, but you gave some comments in your
opening remarks about the longer-term outlook there. I mean, you think that we're going to be able to sustain kind of
this $30 billion-plus revenue number given your outlook?

<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, yes. Yes, I do. I mean, I think the math for that business is over time tanker
replaces C-17. Actually a little more, when you look at the numbers. There's a couple of big development programs
coming up, three that I mentioned in my remarks. There's a couple other ones. Our opportunity to win those – a couple
of those – is good, which would mitigate risk on the fighter side as the F/A-18 and the F-15 over the next decade face
some sunsetting.
And then the upside is international. I mean, one of the unique things Boeing has is strong company-to-country
relationships built over the years, largely in our commercial business, that has broad industrial base in cooperation in
many of the world's key countries that help us in campaigns both on the BDS and the commercial side. And there's a lot
of action out there. I mentioned the 35% of our backlog. I would probably say somewhat more than that as a percentage
of our discussions of the pipeline out there. And historically we've done well.
So that adds up to an equation – with the helicopters and space and some of the other things staying flat or slightly up –
that adds up to an equation of flattish growth with maybe some upside. But with the U.S. defense market being what it
is, I think we want to keep our feet underneath us, our costs under control, because there's an unpredictability about
that. We think we've got that risk covered. We think we understand it. But it remains a bit of a wildcard, and we want
to be ready if there is a wildcard, and I think we will be.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, you talked about improvement on the dash-9s in terms of the unit cost. As you look
out, when would you – I think you've talked about the dash-9 being better from a cash perspective long-term than the
dash-8. When do you see the dash-9 kind of catching the dash-8 from a cash perspective? And what are you assuming
in terms of the dash-9 as a percentage of the production mix kind of over the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I would say, David, you'll see that probably around the 2016 timeframe when you look at
what's in the production flow and the mix between dash-8 and dash-9. That's probably where you'll really start to see
the benefit of the dash-9 in the system. I'm sorry, I lost you on the second question. Oh, on the mix.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Just what you're assuming when you talk about deferred coming down per quarter, what
you're assuming for the dash-9 as a percentage of the production mix kind of over the next 12 to 18 months?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, well, I could tell you over the cost base, you're looking at more about a 40% of that
cost base is assumed to be about dash-9. Now, some of that obviously is already done. And then there's some
assumptions in there about key customers that we will convert from dash-8 to dash-9. But generally that's kind of the
profile you see over the entire cost base.

And we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Sam.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hey, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could just address the situation that got a lot of press around the
Ex-Im Bank and the financing? And just trying to think about if that were not to get renewed, should we start to see
BCC's portfolio start to turn in the other direction? Or what would it take for BCC's assets to start to go back up?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, first of all, Sam, I think the chances are good. My assessment is that the bank will
be reauthorized. Now, there's risk it won't, okay? But I just wanted to give you my view. And so addressing that risk.
The Ex-Im Bank has come down as a percentage of our customer base in terms of what percentage relies on them. And
that has reflected a lot of liquidity in the capital markets, but there are times, when the markets are less friendly, that
Ex-Im Bank does go up and becomes a significant percentage.
I think the issue is more about level playing field with our competition than it is Boeing goes under without the Ex-Im
Bank. Okay? I mean, I think this idea of unilaterally disarming U.S. manufacturers while European manufacturers
continue to get copious kinds of Ex-Im type support is something that – and that traces back to – I don't think the
political infrastructure will do that. So it's more an issue of that, of losing some campaigns out there where that is
important if we didn't have the Ex-Im Bank, scrambling, using our balance sheet somewhat more. And we've worked
the net earning assets in BCC down significantly over the last few years, so there's some room there. But it would be
more an issue of competitiveness than it would be an issue – and that's a big issue. Okay? It's a huge issue. Than it
would be the balance sheet of Boeing and the credit rating of Boeing being threatened.

itself -
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: – and your view on how this cycle plays out. We don't have any production rate increases per
se in front of us for a couple of years. How long do you think we can sustain production rates over the course of the rest
of this decade? What other growth drivers might you have if we are plateauing in production per se? And are there
plenty of opportunities out there to drive earnings growth through margin expansion, if you have plateaued from a
production perspective?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I mean, just starting at the highest possible level, I mean, one of the reasons we
like being the world's largest aerospace company, participating in many sectors, some commercial, some defense, some
space, is there obviously is some risk-mitigation value in diversification. Some things are up; some things are down. So

that's an overall thought, and we still like that thought. But I know your question is more centered on the commercial
part of our company. And again, we are in a – driven by Boeing – in a big technology change-out cycle here that is
responding to oil prices. You and I could argue whether it'd be $90 or $130; these airplanes pay back at any
conceivable oil price in this unfriendly world we all live in.
So starting with the 787, and it's now flowing through the rest of our wide-body product line, promises to flow into our
narrow-body product line sometime in the next decade, end of next decade. We don't know yet. These offer huge
efficiency and maintenance advantages that do encourage people to retire planes earlier than they would were these
alternatives not available to them. And they pay back. So every sign I see is that this technology change-out is going to
– just look at our airplanes; 777X is going to keep going over the next decade or so that I can see right now. And so
that's the difference compared to normal, quote, "cycles." And so that supports the argument that says it's extended and
it's really hard to call. And we have a lot of confidence in our production rates. They do go up a little bit in 2017 and
2018 and in the '37 and in the '87 that we've talked about. So we see it – we see an extended growth market here.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. And then on the earnings growth side in that context, and the focus on margins, just
maybe a little bit about the big drivers you see there.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think the big drivers are going be – in our Commercial business we tend to have
lumpy earnings when we take too much risk in development. And I think – which is why the mantra of de-risking the
decade in front of us has been something that we've all – after having gone through the 787 experience – we've all
thought a lot about. And so flowing the right amount of technology into the 787-9, the 787-10, the 737-MAX, the
777X-8 and -9, enough to capture enough of this technology advantage but not more than people are willing to pay for
or more than would drive risk that we're not willing to absorb. We've tried to think a lot about that.
And as I implied and I think it was – I forgot who asked the question; it might have been Doug – on R&D, by design,
we've sort of got stability both in our research and development spending and in the amount of associated risk we're
taking during that. And when you have stability in this business and you get these programs driving margins, you can –
as we've, I think demonstrated over the last three or four years – you can make money in this business. And I think
you're going to see more of that.

And next we go to Christopher Drew with The New York Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Jim and Greg, can you talk a little bit more just in simple terms on the tanker of how the
design went off in terms of the wiring harnesses and – seems like a pretty straightforward problem. What caused the
issue?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, well, just like, I'd say, any development program, once you've reached the point of
integration, whether you're integrating the structure or the systems or wiring, I mean, that's where you really see the
capability of how things are coming together and the efficiency. The structure of all those airplanes came together
extremely well. Where the challenges lied were really around the wiring and the wire harnesses themselves and the
redesigning effort to either move those wires or do whatever rework was required is really what we were dealing with.
We started experiencing that when we started the integration on that first airplane. And that continued, which really
required us again to put some additional effort in place to go back and do redesign on those harnesses, along with that
system installation and the manufacturing labor associated with it. But that's basically what it is. And, again, it's well
understood, as I mentioned prior to one of the questions. It's not a technology leap. We know how to do it. We've done
some of it already on that first airplane, so we're building off of that experience.
And, again, we're looking – continue to de-risk the program and drive performance through the balance, which is again
a reason why we put those labs or made the investment in some of those technology labs. And we're already seeing the
benefit of making that investment today. So team's very focused. They know what needs to get done. And it's all about
focusing on meeting our customer commitments, and that is our priority at this point. And we've got a plan to go
execute to do that. And it's day to day, hour by hour, and the team is very focused on, again, the task at hand.

And we'll go to Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Cameron>: Hi.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Cameron>: Hello. Going back to the Ex-Im issue, you seemed to imply a little bit that you might be
prepared to use the balance sheet if you had to. But given that we know the arguments on both sides, Jim, would you be
prepared to support some reform of Ex-Im going forward that perhaps restricted or limited either the type of aircraft or

the type of customer that had availability to it, which would at least preserve the broader competitive position, even if
perhaps Ex-Im fell a bit behind what the ECAs offer? But would you support some sort of reform?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think we have been supportive of reform over the last number of cycles. I mean,
as you know, the terms and conditions are a function of a treaty that basically the OECD nations debate and sign. And
we have supported over the last couple of cycles increasing rates, increasing fees, making both of those more
commercial term in nature. And do it in concert with the other ECAs around the world. And we will continue to
support this move toward more close alignment with commercial terms. And so we'll continue to support all kinds of
efforts like that done in concert within the treaty. I think where we get uncomfortable is when we say, oh, tractors, you
can't lend against tractors. Or gas turbines. Or wide-body airplanes. I mean, why do we pick certain elements that some
raise as not in need of support, where the rest of the economy is? I support none of that.

And we'll go to Steve Wilhelm with the Puget Sound Business Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Hi, gentlemen. In terms of the robotization of the 777X line, I wonder if you could talk about
plans to expand that throughout other production lines in the future. And also what has that to do with competitiveness
in terms of Europe and maybe China way in the future?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think automation is – and I know you're aware – is we are starting with the 777
fuselage. A lot of good work being done. Hope of expanding it to both improve the quality of our airplanes, the cost at
which we produce them, and the safety for our work force. And, yes, I think it is fair to say that over time we would
anticipate expanding that capability. There are other examples besides automation of the fuselage. There's the paint
shop, 777 wing. I was out in Seattle recently and toured that. A terrific job being done using automation to paint major
structures. So we're focused on that to improve our cost quality and the lives of our workers. And we will expand it
over time.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have time for one last question, please.
Operator
And that'll be from Stephen Trimble with Flightglobal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen Trimble>: Yes. Hi.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi.
<Q - Stephen Trimble>: On the tanker issue, we've seen a couple of warnings from [ph] BOC&E (1:04:34) and the
GAO that the program could run six to 12 months late. And they haven't said anything about wiring harnesses or
problems with the wiring. They've talked more about concerns about software and the aggressive [ph] flight test brake
(1:04:49). Can you address those issues? And are those things under control? Or is there a risk of further delays and
further costs increases?
<A - W. James McNerney>: We don't see that today. I think on the flight test, we have, from the very beginning, as
part of the fixed price development contract, proposed a more commercial-like flight test program. Our customer has
agreed with us. When viewed parametrically, it seems shorter than other flight tests that are done in other ways, not as
efficiently. So we disagree with that assessment. And other than the problems that Greg described on the wiring, wiring
separation, wiring bundles, some of that detail design, the rest of the program is moving along well, in part because of
these laboratories we've set up at our own cost to de-risk systems, particularly the fuel system, before installing it on
the airplane. So doesn't mean that something can't crop up in the future, but we don't see it now.
