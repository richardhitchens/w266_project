Thank you.
I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lisa DeFrancesco, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Darla, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to the Actavis first quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. Earlier this morning, Actavis issued a press release reporting its earnings for the first quarter ended
March 31, 2013. The press release, together with additional materials reconciling our GAAP and non-GAAP financial
results and forecasts, are available on our website at www.actavis.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast

Paul M. Bisaro
So, thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I know it's a busy day. But before we begin talking about the quarter, I
just wanted to make a few comments on the recent news and analyst speculation about the reported discussions of a
potential merger.
As you know, as a matter of corporate policy, we do not discuss business development activities until we have
something concrete to report to our investors and the media. I know this policy can be frustrating, but we do not intend
to comment specifically on the current speculation. Just know that as a matter of ongoing business, our management
team is in what I would describe as routine and exploratory discussions about a variety of business development
initiatives, including product transactions, business combinations and even large-scale mergers and acquisitions. All of
these business development initiatives are focused on two things; achieving our publicly stated objective of building a
leading global specialty pharmaceutical company and creating shareholder value. As always, if and when we have
anything of substance to announce, we are committed to announce that news to all shareholders and employees
globally.
So, we remain focused on driving growth for our company and our shareholders, and now turning to the quarter, the
new Actavis is off to a great start. And as a result of the strong performance of our global businesses to-date, we are
increasing our forecast for 2013. But before we get to that, I want to briefly review the highlights from the first quarter.
First quarter net revenues increased 24% to $1.9 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 21%, to $1.99.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% to $464 million.
In our Actavis Pharma segment, net revenues increased 37% over the prior-year period. In the U.S., highlights included
the first quarter launch of generic version of Suboxone. Since the quarter ended, we have launched an authorized
generic version of Zovirax ointment and relaunched Vestura, our generic version of Yaz. We also received a favorable
ruling on our generic Pulmicort patent suit on April 1. We're awaiting a ruling from the federal circuit on a preliminary
injunction that is currently keeping us off the market.
Outside the U.S., key launches in our international markets included generic Singulair, which launched upon patent
expiry in multiple European markets; and a successful patent challenge of generic Crestor in Australia, which we
anticipate launching mid-year. In February, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or
CHMP, adopted a positive opinion recommending the granting of marketing authorization for Actavis' generic version
of Glivec. We have launched Glivec in one European market and expect to launch it across Europe upon patent expiry.

In March, we amended our agreement with Sagent Pharmaceuticals to achieve accelerated termination date, which
allow us to take back our portfolio of generic injectable products in the U.S. by the end of 2014. When combined with
the applications for generic injectable products that we have currently pending on file with the FDA, we are on our way
to becoming a player in the U.S. generic injectable market by the end of 2014.
We have recently announced settlements in several patent challenges. These settlements remove the inherent
uncertainty of litigation as well as FDA delays, and provide for date certain launches of generic versions of OxyContin
in 2014; Exalgo 32-milligram dose in May of 2014; Intuniv in December of 2014; Crestor in the second quarter of
2016; Ziana in July of 2016; and Zyclara in January of 2019.
We've also made great strides on our Actavis Specialty Brands segment during the quarter. In this segment, we
experienced growth in key promoted products including Generess Fe, RAPAFLO, CRINONE, and Androderm in the
U.S. On January 23, we announced the acquisition of Uteron Pharma, which includes three potential near-term global
commercial opportunities in contraception and infertility, including one novel oral contraceptive. Several additional
products in early stages of development are also included in the acquisition.
In April of 2013, we signed an agreement with Valeant that will maximize the commercial value of Actavis' Cordran
Tape and Valeant's Zovirax cream 5% by capitalizing on the commercial reach of our respective Specialty Brands sales
forces. Earlier this week, we acquired worldwide rights to Valeant's Metronidazole 1.3% Vaginal Gel, further
expanding our women's health pipeline. We completed our Phase III program for progestin-only patch in the U.S. and
filed the NDA during the first quarter. We also made significant progress on our Phase I program for our biosimilar for
FSH and through our Amgen collaboration, initiated our Phase III for a biosimilar of Herceptin.
Finally, the Actavis integration is progressing according to plan, and we remain on track to achieve our estimate of
$300 million in expected annual synergies within the first three years. We've also determined that the legacy Actavis
group achieved the full value of their earn-out based upon year-over-year growth in cash EBITDA as defined in the
acquisition agreement.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd, who'll take us through the financial results.
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis. GAAP net revenues for the first
quarter were $1.896 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our Actavis Pharma and
Actavis Specialty Brand segments, partially offset by decreased revenues in our Anda Distribution segment.
For the first quarter of 2013, Actavis Pharma net revenues were $1.534 billion, up 37% year-over-year as a result of the
acquisition of the Actavis Group and new product sales in key markets, partially offset by lower U.S. sales of the
generic version of Lipitor due to the loss of exclusivity in May of last year. Ex-U.S. net revenues were $608.6 million,
up 254% from the first quarter 2012, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Actavis.
Actavis Pharma net revenues during the quarter consisted of product revenues in the Americas of $965 million; Europe
product sales, which include Medis, of $483 million; and MEA product sales of $85 million. Actavis Pharma adjusted
gross margin was 50.7%, up 5.7 percentage points year-over-year, due in part to higher margins on generic Concerta
under our contractual arrangement with J&J and sales of Lidoderm under our agreement with Endo. The prior-year
margins were negatively impacted by sales of the authorized generic version of Lipitor at lower margins.
Moving to the Actavis Specialty Brands, net revenues were $131 million, up 19% on higher sales of promoted
products, including Generess Fe, RAPAFLO, CRINONE and Androderm, and the addition of KADIAN, which we
acquired with the Actavis Group. Adjusted gross margin increased to 77.2%.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution segment were $231 million, down 23% due to lower chain sales and
fewer new third-party product launches relative to the prior-year period. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was
15.8%, up 430 basis points as a result of lower chain sales.

Consolidated operating expenses have increased significantly year-over-year as a result of the addition of the legacy –
of legacy Actavis. Consolidated GAAP Research and Development for the first quarter was $132 million, up 49%
year-over-year. Consolidated GAAP SG&A for the first quarter was $413 million, up 46% over the prior year.
Amortization expense for the first quarter was $158 million. Our GAAP results include $270 million of charges related
to the acquisition of the Actavis Group. This includes a $150 million charge related to the contingent earnout.
During the quarter, the company agreed to pay out the full 5.5 million shares associated with the earnout.
Consequently, the value of the additional 1.65 million shares to be paid pursuant to the earnout, compared to our
assumption at year-end, is reflected as a charge for GAAP earnings purposes. The company also incurred $120 million
in other acquisition-related charges, which consist primarily of the amortization of the inventory step-up recorded in
connection with the acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 25.3% in the first quarter, down from
35.5% in the prior-year period. The non-GAAP rate was favorably impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credit in
January of this year.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and acquisition-related charges, as well as other items detailed in
table four of our earnings press release, earnings for the first quarter were $1.99 per diluted share, up 21%
year-over-year as a result of growth across our Actavis Pharma and Actavis Specialty Brands segments. As a result of
acquisition-related charges, we incurred a loss for GAAP purposes of $0.79 per share. Again, this includes $270
million pre-tax, or $1.77 per share, of charges related primarily to the acquisition of the Actavis Group in November of
2012.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $464 million, compared to $367 million in the prior year, as a result of the
addition of legacy Actavis and growth across the businesses. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $219
million, and cash and marketable securities were $337 million at the end of the first quarter, after using $150 million in
cash to acquire Uteron in January. Our total debt at quarter-end was just over $6.4 billion, and our leverage ratio on a
pro-forma basis was approximately 3.8 times. We still expect to generate cash flows sufficient to reduce leverage to
under 3 times by the end of 2013.
We remain well-positioned financially, following the acquisitions of the Actavis Group in 2012 and Uteron Pharma in
January of this year. We will continue to focus on rapid pay-down of debt and maintaining the strong financial
foundation to support strategic growth initiatives within our global businesses.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2013 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. I will now provide an update of our 2013 forecast. For Actavis Pharma, our forecast includes a launch of
generic Pulmicort, with competition, in the second quarter. No change in our generic Concerta estimates from the
previous forecast, which includes one competitor on generic Concerta beginning in Q1 and a second competitor 181
days after launch of each strength. No additional competition in 2013 for generic Lidoderm and generic Adderall XR.
For generic Suboxone, we assume a successful conversion of the tablet market for generic Suboxone. No additional
competitors on generic Zovirax ointment. We have included Vestura, our generic version of Yaz, from the second
quarter. And we continue to assume mid single-digit price erosion in the U.S. on base business and high single-digit
ex-U.S. For Actavis Specialty Brands, our forecast includes continued growth of our core promoted products,
successful approval and launch of Esmya in Canada, and no revenue contribution in 2013 from the Uteron products.
Our updated 2000 (sic) [2013] (15:12) forecast is as follows. Our estimate for full-year net revenue is approximately
$1.8 billion. We expect Actavis Pharma revenue to be between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion, with slightly better
adjusted gross margins in the range of 50% to 52%. For Actavis Specialty Brands, we expect net revenues of $550
million to $600 million. For the Anda Distribution business, we anticipate third-party distribution revenue to be
between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.950 billion to $2.030 billion. We expect – we
continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 27% and 29%. We expect our non-GAAP earnings
per diluted share in the range of $8.10 to $8.50 per share, reflecting a full-year estimated shares outstanding of

approximately 134 million.
In summary, this year is about execution. The first quarter of 2013 was a very productive quarter, laying the
groundwork for yet another year of significant achievement and growth, as well as increasing investor visibility to
growth drivers for 2014, 2015 and beyond. I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work
and dedication to the growth of our global organization.
And with that, let's turn the call back to Lisa for the Q&A.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Hi, Darla, we'll go ahead and take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Morning, David.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Good morning. My first question is, are you asking for $150 or $200 for the stock?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: As you know, David, we were not going to comment on any speculation. But listen, we
continue to remain focused on our business. We have a lot of things going. A lot of activities under way, as you can
see. It was an extraordinarily busy first quarter. Our growth strategy hasn't changed. Our acquisition strategy hasn't
changed. We're going to continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions to help us continue to grow our Actavis Pharma
business, as well as our Actavis Specialty Brands business. We're going to remain focused, in that Specialty Brands
area, in urology and women's health. Many of the transactions that we accomplished this quarter, some of the
transactions at least, reflect that commitment, and we're going to continue to stay focused on that.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Okay. And then, with respect to my two real questions. First, with respect to Pulmicort,
could you just walk us through the timeline here and the different scenarios? And then second, with respect to
OxyContin tamper resistant, could you speak to what you've currently assumed in your press release, and then what the
potential upside scenario would be?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. I'll take Pulmicort and I'll turn it over to Siggi to talk about OxyContin. On Pulmicort,
we're awaiting a decision. And David, by the way, is here to correct me if I make a mistake. But we're awaiting a
decision. We expect it any day. We continue to maintain high hopes that this product will be, well, we'll be launching
the product shortly. We have built inventory. We did launch the product briefly, we were, we kept and then we had to
stop because of the injunction. But we're very hopeful that we will – during the pendency of the appeal, we will be
marketing the product, not sitting on the sidelines.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: And, David, on the OxyContin, our settlement with Purdue. As we mentioned in the
press release, we gave, I think for 2014 and 2015, approximately $100 million of gross profit between the two years. A
little stronger in 2014. We assume competition during those years. If there will be less competition, there could be an
upside. We don't expect a big downside to that number. In the outer years, 2016, 2017, 2018, and on the outer years, the
number is less than $100 million, but they will get tail on that products for the remaining three, four years after 2014
and 2015. So, I think we have assumed the right competition and give you a pretty accurate number on the gross profit
as we expect them.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: And then, just to follow up on both of those, so quickly on the Pulmicort, could you just tell
us how much you shipped, or give us a sense for how much you were able to get out the door before you were stopped?
And then second, could you talk about the upside on OxyContin TR if Actavis itself gets an approval and manufactures

the product using a supplied authorized generic?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. So, if we talk about Pulmicort first, we are very quick to react in this company,
but we got the TRO in about three hours after we started shipping. So there was very, very little that went into the
marketplace of the product, so it didn't affect our revenue or outcome at all. I think, with regard to OxyContin, we gave
you a best case as we see it. The difference between an [ph] AT (20:40) and our own approval is not significant in that
term. So, we built it based on our own product assumption, but the big driver in chains would be the competition in the
market, not if it is an [ph] AT (20:53) or our own application.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Paul and Siggi, just a question for each of you. First, Paul, can you
just talk about your own ability to do larger transactions yourself as we think about the back half, and where your areas
of interest are relative to going out and doing branded deals versus more product collaborations like the one that we
saw yesterday with Valeant? And then I have a question for Siggi.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sorry, caught me right in the middle of a drink of water there. With respect to larger
transactions, I think in the short term, we have to continue to focus on paying down our debt. We've committed to
achieving below 3.5 times debt to EBITDA this year. We'll certainly do that. However, the larger transactions are
something that you always have to be watchful for, because they don't always come up – they don't come up all the
time. It's not ever clear when assets will become available, and so we're constantly looking and constantly participating
in discussions and processes around the world looking at these kinds of things.
Our preference would be, one, a deal that would give us more depth and breadth in our Specialty Brands franchise, but
we would use those assets to drive value in many of the markets that Actavis Pharma operates in around the world.
Remember, our Actavis Pharma division outside of, say, Western Europe, has significant sales presence in Russia,
Central and Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and even in non-emerging markets like Australia and Canada, where we
can leverage those assets in those marketplaces. So, we're looking for something that can help drive – continue to help
drive growth for the company in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: But the Brands side is clearly where the focus is right now. Is that correct?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: For a significantly – for a large transaction, I would say yes, that's where our head is at. If we
are presented with an opportunity on the generic side, we would look at it and try to evaluate the strategic value of it, if
it was compelling. We would have to – we'd have to look at that, but right now our drive is on Specialty Brands for big
transactions. Doesn't mean we won't continue to do what I would describe as tuck-in acquisitions around the world.
There's OTC product franchises we're looking at right now. There's small generic opportunities around the world. The
world's a big place.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: And defining big, is $2 billion a fair definition of big?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: That or larger, yeah.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay. And then a follow-up for Siggi, there's been, obviously, a lot of very positive
product announcements over the last several months. As people are looking, for the next 6 to 12, months additional
opportunities, either from settlements or launch, can you maybe outline some of the ones that we should be focused on?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. I think the big opportunity for the next six to nine months is obviously Pulmicort.
I think Pulmicort is – the outcome of the trial is very important for us. As Paul mentioned in the forecast for the year,
we have built in Pulmicort, but with a competition in second quarter. If there's less competition, that has a significant
effect on that number, of course. So, I think that's the big one to watch out, in the U.S. for sure.

<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hi. Thanks. Paul, certainly I think you guys have done an incredible job making acquisitions in
your own right. What do you think the market's missing with this Actavis transaction? Do you think the synergies
longer term will be more significant than what you think you can generate today?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I hope that we've been clear with our – regarding the legacy Actavis acquisition – that the
$300 million of synergies that we've included and talked about did not include revenue synergies and did not include
operational synergies like plant rationalization and the like. We know we're going to get those kinds of synergy. So, I
think if people haven't factored that in to their equation for the out years, then they probably have missed something.
And as I think as we look at this over time, we also know that with the legacy Actavis acquisition, we've now increased
our ability to improve our tax rate. We're going to continue to drive intellectual property into tax-benefited
jurisdictions. As the intellectual property starts to generate profit, we should see a lower tax rate. And I've been talking
about this for a long time, we know we've got to do something about our 27% to 29% tax rate. And that's a big key.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Maybe, Tim, if I add to it. I think the two things that investor missed in our Actavis
acquisition is probably the strength of the Actavis Group R&D. We tell people that we have 49 pending first-to-file. I
think the new number is that 33 of the 49 are now exclusive first-to-files, and the remaining are shared. But we also
have a significant number of potential first-to-files waiting for acceptance at the FDA. So, the R&D pipeline coming
from Actavis Group have a significant synergy in output with the R&D at Watson.
And last but not least, I think it also, I think investor underestimated the strength of Actavis in the emerging markets. In
Eastern Europe, if you look at the IMS data for Russia, for example, for January to January, there was a over 20%
growth from January 2012 to January 2013 for Actavis in Russia. Just as an example, it's the same story in Ukraine, in
the CAS market, in Southeast Asia, even – many of the Eastern European markets. So, I think the investors missed that
point, how strong the R&D was, and the strength of the company in emerging markets.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay. Great. Thanks. That's very helpful.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Just a couple, and I apologize if you've addressed this, since I'm toggling between
a couple of calls. So first, on generic Adderall XR, thinking longer term, what's your expectation regarding Sandoz and
whether or not you think they'll eventually enter the market? And then secondly, regarding the metronidazole gel
product, can you just talk about how you think about the peak sales opportunity there, and any plans to present any
detailed clinical data on that product later this year or next year? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey David, maybe I start with Adderall XR. I think, as we said in our forecast for the
year, we don't expect additional competition. I think it's not appropriate for me to make comment on the capabilities of
our competitors to bring product to market. We know for sure that many of our competitors are working on this product
and have been working for some years. This is a very challenging product and speaks highly of the capability of the
R&D we have in-house today to deliver products to the market. But I think, at least for this year, in our forecast, we
don't assume any additional competition.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: And we – it's Fred Wilkinson regarding metronidazole. We actually probably
will not be reporting clinical information throughout the year. Valeant will be prosecuting the NDA. So, they'll be
working through the filing process – the transfer of the asset actually does not occur until the product is approved. So,

they'll be in charge of the activities from there. The way we look at the marketplace, though, is, it's a very, very large
vaginal infection marketplace. There has been no product that is a single-use therapy for at least four years, with
Clindesse out of the marketplace. We think, if those conditions stay the way they are through the time of the filing and
ultimate approval, this is a real nice opportunity to take a base compound that's well-known by our audience and be
able to put it into the marketplace as a single-use therapy.

Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few. First question I had was just on your 2013
EPS guidance. You're suggesting, at the high end of the range, almost 42% year-over-year growth, which is great. But
I'm wondering how we should think about the following years. You still intact on the double-digit EPS growth that
you've given in the out-years?
And then second question I had was, how we should think about your North American generics business now that the
U.S. brand patent cliff is coming to an end, and you're a larger company that needs bigger P4 opportunities to move the
needle. Is this still an area of high growth for you? What do you think on that front? And then, just on the generic
injectables business, there's obviously been some issues on the manufacturing front with your competitors, and also on
pricing pressure. I'm just wondering where you think your competitive advantages are to take advantage of those
opportunities? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Louise, I'll start with the first question. Yeah, we have – looks like we're heading toward
a very strong 2013. That's always good news, and we expect to be able to carry that momentum – a lot of that
momentum – into 2014. We continue to maintain our objective of achieving double-digit growth on a year-over-year
basis, on EPS – adjusted EPS basis. And that will be our target going through 2014, 2015 and 2016. And what we've
tried to do – and just happenstance, some of these things all hit at the same time is, we've given, I think, some clarity
and visibility on opportunities that will be coming in 2014. Don't forget, we'll be launching Loestrin 24 in 2014. We
will have at least a portion of the year remaining on our 180 days of exclusivity on Lidoderm. We'll believe significant
continued contribution from Concerta; INTUNIV now in 2014. So, you can see that we have a lot of growth drivers
remaining in the franchise. Not to mention, we would continue to see continued growth of the core Specialty Brands
promoted products, as well as potentially up to four launches of new products in 2014. So 2014 is also going to prove
to be a very interesting year.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Maybe if I talk a little about the U.S. business. I think when we talk about the patent
cliff is, in my mind, the patent cliff is more for the branded companies because, as I mentioned before, we have 49
potential first-to-files being reviewed at the FDA, 33 of them are exclusive. And you're absolutely right in saying that
these are not multibillion dollar first-to-file opportunities from the brand side, but these are hundreds of million dollars
opportunities, and we have many of them.
So I think, how we think about it, there's still a significant growth in the U.S. market. We need to continue to invest
significantly in R&D and IP and litigation to continue the pipeline. But the growth is still there. The opportunities are
there. They're not $5 billion or $6 billion dollar brand products we are going after, but we are still going after a strong
portfolio of product that will allow us to grow the company for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. You have seen the
settlements even into 2019. So, we feel good about the U.S. market, as long as we continue the invest into both R&D
and IP to grow the business.
And I think on the generic injectable business, we will be focusing more on the oncology and even into the 505(b)(2)
area. We strive for a higher-margin products and maybe a niche opportunities, which not everybody are in. Today, the
prices of the injectables is quite high ,due to the quality issues that some of the competitors have in that market, but that
could change when we come to the market by the end of 2014. So, we are not going into a significant investment in

buying an injectable companies. What we are doing is, we have focused our resources in R&D for the more complex
injectables. We are focusing on slow-release injectables. We are taking the approach of 505(b)(2), because that is a
good opportunities for the U.S. market. So, we are focusing not on the overall injectable space, but to be a player in the
niche oncology and the more complex area.

Your next question comes from the line of Ami Fadia with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Hey. Good morning. It's Marc Goodman.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Marc.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Hi. So, Siggi, maybe you could talk about Europe a little bit, how the markets have played out
in the first quarter of the year and how you've done relative to the market, and just go through some of the key ones.
And then, is there any way we can quantify the tax rate and where it can go, Todd, maybe four, five years from now, if
you can give us a sense? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes. Hi, Marc. I think, if I take a few markets, first of all, UK, we had a very good first
quarter in UK. We have combined the Arrow UK and the Actavis UK operation. We have also, because we have a
manufacturing plant in Barnstaple, a very good manufacturing plant in Barnstaple, we have been able to respond
rapidly to market shortages in the market. So, many of our older product have seen a significant increase in sale in that
market. So, UK was probably one of our best markets in Europe in first quarter. Russia, I mentioned before, significant
growth, 20%year-on-year. We are introducing new products in Russia later this year. We are bringing big products to
the market. As we mentioned, 50-plus OTC and 50-plus prescription medicines.
Germany still is a problem. We think German market is challenging. We have won quite a few tenders, and that is
what's keeping the top line up, but we are looking at options, how we can improve our bottom line in Germany. Our
hospital business is the best part of the business. We have an injectable business, a wide range of injectables in
Germany. But clearly, the prescription business takes our attention now, how we can improve our business in Germany.
Nordics, a very good market for us, a good growth in OTC. We are launching a new OTC line, a dental OTC line now,
in second quarter in Nordics, as we have seen a growth. We are still number one in Norway, Sweden and Iceland;
number five in Finland; and number three in Denmark. We remain number one in Bulgaria.
Until France, I think, maybe if I take that, that's the last country we have seen a significant growth in the top line.
There's clearly a much better usage of generics in France. This is continuing from fourth quarter and this continuing in
second quarter of this year. But the growth in the bottom line is not following, because the price erosion is also
significant in that country. It's in the high single-digit at the same time. So, we are not seeing the same growth on the
bottom line as we are seeing on top line. So, to summarize it there, I think Eastern Europe is performing extremely
well. Nordics are very good; UK are good. But Germany, maybe Holland and France, even though there's a growth in
top line, I'm not satisfied with the growth in the bottom line.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Hey, Marc. This is Todd. Going to the tax rate question, our current guidance is still 27%, 29%
in the current year. As we look out over the next three to five years, I think growth of earnings offshore will help
provide an advantage to us from a tax rate perspective. As Paul mentioned, IP migration, that's very much something
that we continue to do with our existing portfolio, is look at ways in which we can develop that IP offshore and, when
those products hit, that will enhance our tax rate longer term. And then on the business development front, I think that's
where we're really going to see the opportunities from a tax rate perspective. And where could it go? It depends upon
the scale of that BD activity and the growth in some of the markets that we have offshore, but we can see anywhere
from 3% to 5% very easily, from kind of what we have planned today.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just had three quick ones here. First, can you talk about the
Amerisource-Walgreens partnership and what you see that meaning for generic industry pricing over time? The second
question is on Concerta dynamics with Mallinckrodt now in the market? Just how's price holding up here, and do you
have any updated views on KUDCo and the ability of further generic competition to enter the market this year? And
then the final one was on Suboxone, just talking about any opportunity and what you can do here to help convert this
market back to tablets relative to the film? Thanks very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Hi, Chris. I think on the Amerisource-Walgreens, I think we're all sort of waiting and
watching to see what happens. We don't expect any major impact in 2013. 2014, of course, is yet to be seen. We will be
watching very closely to see how things go. We have very close relationships with both of those companies. We're a
major supplier to both of those companies, and we just met with the senior leadership of both of those companies at
NACDS about a week ago. So, stay tuned for more on that, but we'll be in close contact with them and try to work
through their issues and our issues for 2014.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: And Chris, maybe on Concerta, I think the Concerta is behaving exactly as we
explained it before. It's a very complex product. It takes time to get the quota to take the market share. As it stands
today, I think Mallinckrodt is at roughly 8% and we are at roughly 87% market share, but they are growing. They will
grow over time. The price is stable in a two-player market. But – we – the market is behaving exactly as we expected in
a two-player market. But clearly, Mallinckrodt is growing their market share week by week, in time, when they have
enough supply to take more market share.
With regard to KUDCo, we don't know. You heard previously that KUDCo is clearly in our forecast for the year. We
expect KUDCo to come to the market 181 days after the launch of Mallinckrodt on each of the strengths. So, we
haven't heard anything differently to change our assumptions on additional competition on Concerta.
With regard to Suboxone, it's a very interesting thing, is that we have a – we compete with Amneal in the market, and
we are getting a good market share on the tablets. There has been very little or none movement from the thin film to the
tablet at this point in time. We are looking into a marketing campaign, because there's a significant saving for the
patients to use generics versus the thin film. Many of the patients using these drugs don't have health insurance. So, the
opportunities might be for them, if they are out-of-pocket, to move patients from thin film to the tablet. We are working
on that, so stay tuned how it will go. But at this point in time, we haven't seen any thin film movement to the generic
tablet.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, one for you, Paul. I know you said you wouldn't
comment on any speculation, but can you just help us understand how you are thinking of the various options available
to you? Specifically, under what circumstances does it make sense to grow organically versus acquire a company or
brands versus M&A? And then on the tax rate, can you talk us through the mechanics of how you could bring this
down as a stand-alone company, and how important M&A is for you to really bring the rate down over the next few
years? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Well, Shibani, you guys – I think you all know that I've always believed in strong organic
growth as the main driver of your business. We have shown that we are committed to R&D spending in both the
generics and the brand franchises, and we will continue to do that. I think that's consistent with being a pharmaceutical
company, and that's, I believe, everyone's who's in our space have that same notion. Nevertheless, we generate a lot of

cash. And we know that we need to put that cash to work. We have obligations to pay down debt, which we will
obviously do. And we will do so appropriately and meaningfully, so that our bondholders are in a good spot, and
remain in a good spot. But we have excess cash to put to work. And we will continue to put that cash to work in the
way we've always done it, looking for the right kind of opportunities.
With respect to looking for things that help take down our tax rate, that does have an added benefit. We do pay very
high taxes compared to other companies in our space, and we need to find a way to manage that. We've looked at all
kinds of options to address it a meaningful way, in a sort of a one fell swoop move, and that's really not easy to do. It's
very challenging to do that, and we're not really in a position, at this time, to be able to do that. So, we have to look for
the singles and doubles to drive down that tax rate, and we'll continue to do that. But this strategy hasn't – our strategy
hasn't changed. That's very consistent with what we have been talking about for the last five years, since I've been here.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Just, Paul, if you would; the question is also, under what circumstances would M&A, like a
merger of equals, make sense to a company like Actavis, which has strong growth on its own?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think you have to – you always have to look at every opportunity that's presented. As I
said, there's constant routine and exploratory discussions going all the time, from all kinds of areas. And I just don't
think I can comment on, what is the right time to pull a trigger on anything. It's about specifics, it's about timing, it's
about all of those factors. So, for now, I think, I'll just leave it with, we're going to continue to pursue our business
transactions as we've always done. We're going to continue to talk to people, as we've always done. And at the time we
make a decision to do something, we'll pass that along.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein with Susquehanna.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we can just talk – as the integration gets more
underway and the synergies seem to be on track, where you're looking to invest, particularly on the R&D side, and
where that should be going over the course of the year and into next year?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, maybe, Andrew, if I take it. It's Siggi here. I think, as you said yourself, the
integration is on track, where we're getting the right synergy numbers. We have integrated all the sales unit. We sold
from a single unit. There's one point of contact in the U.S. from 6 of February. So, all the basic part of the integration is
done.
So, where are we going to use the money we get? The investment in R&D is that we are moving a little bit towards the
more complex products. So, we have set up a special department on developing respiratory product. We have set up a
small team in UK, led by Stefan Sveinsson, who was the head of R&D in Actavis, which focuses only on the complex
respiratory product. We have had a few under development at this point in time. We are investing in that, even though
the payback on these products is 2016 and later. But that's a important area which I think the generic industry hasn't
been able to get into, or penetrate, as I would hope to do later on.
I think also we are investing a lot in the semi-solids, creams, ointments, where you have to do a clinical equivalence
studies. These are more complex. The development of a cream and ointment is in the $10 million range, roughly, years
of the development, where an ordinary solid oral dose tablet is maybe in the $1 million to $2 million. And the last but
not least is the complex injectables, where we are investing in slow-release injectables, very complex clinical studies to
do. So, we are moving a lot of the synergy dollars into R&D to allow us to grow for the future because, as I mentioned
in the previous answer, the patent cliff of a big product is not there, but there's so many opportunities of the complex
generics, which we are tackling now, to allow us to show the double-digit growth going forward.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yes. This is Fred. The other area that we, obviously, we're making investment is
in the small-molecule brand business and then eventually into the biosimilar space. With the collaboration with Amgen,

obviously we've made a bet on four biosimilars in the oncology space. Those are progressing very nicely with, of
course, one going into Phase III during the quarter. Our FSH program is moving nicely and on track for appropriate
launch time when markets are being made. And then the small-molecule business, we continue to look
opportunistically for both the mid-sized products and some larger opportunities that we're working through our pipeline
as we go.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: And so, is the level of activity on the R&D side expected to ramp up over the course of
the year?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. How it is, when you look at the year, we were a little bit low on first quarter, but
there will be a continuous investment. It depends a little bit where the clinical studies fall into the year, but we will
have a continuous investment and a little bit ramp-up during the year in the R&D segment.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Ours is a little spotty because it'll go based on when we drive into Phase III. So
that's the big spend. We've tried to always keep ourselves in a position where we have at least two products in Phase III
at any given time.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot H. Wilbur>: Hey, Paul. How are you?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good.
<Q - Elliot H. Wilbur>: First question, I guess, would be for Siggi. With respect to full-year guidance, and specifically
thinking about some of the key U.S. product drivers, are you still expecting a launch of all strengths of Oxymorphone
ER non-tamper-resistant formulation mid-year, and do you think there's any read-through from the FDA's recent
decision around Oxycodone ER tamper-resistant formulation, and what that may mean in terms of actually being able
to obtain approval?
And then, just a quick one for Paul. Certainly not evident by a lot of your recent activity, but just wondering if you
think the forthcoming Supreme Court decision around pay-for-delay decisions will have any real practical impact on
generic industry behavior, or certainly the kind of leverage generic companies have going forward in terms of being
able to negotiated favorable settlement agreements? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Elliot. Let me start on the generic Opana. I think, from our side, and we mentioned
this on – in our Investor Day. We remain not to include the Opana ER, the non-tamper-resistant formulation. That is
not been our guidance for the year. We are monitoring the situation as it is. We don't know if the guidance that came
out from the FDA on the OxyContin directly affects the Opana product. There's clearly a difference between
OxyContin TR and Opana TR in development. But overall, we feel it's prudent not to include it in the guidance for the
year, for all the reason you mentioned before, and how the market has formed since Impax launched in January, how
the market has reacted to the non-tamper-resistant formulation. We are still watching out what will happen, but it's not
included in guidance.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. And Elliot, as to the Supreme Court case, as you know, we're waiting a decision from the
Supreme Court on this matter. I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will do the appropriate thing and keep the law as it
currently is. I would – for all those people who keep pounding the table about pay-for-delay, I would point them to the
Pulmicort decision as the perfect example as to why they always miss the most important point, and that is, litigation is

inherently unpredictable.
I will remind you that we won on both patents in the Pulmicort case, and the judge who issued the opinion granting us
the case issued an injunction during the appeal. So, yet again, there is no certainty in litigation. And again, it's always
about certainty. And what we do is, settle cases that guarantee early entry to a product prior to patent expiry and
provide value to consumers and to our shareholders. That should be allowed. It's perfectly appropriate. And we will
continue to enter into these agreements as long as I'm here. But I don't feel strongly about it, Elliot.

And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Morning. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. Hi, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Paul, you can add Nuvigil's ruling to that list of...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, exactly.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: So, I'll wrap up with a few here. First, Paul, I think that you, as well as investors, feel pretty
good about the short- and long-term growth outlook. And investors understand that that growth will be driven by
internal and external factors, and I think you and your team have done an excellent job executing on the business. So,
no reason to believe that will stop. So I guess what I'm getting at here is, if I'm Actavis board and management, I feel
pretty good about my own prospects, and it would probably take a meaningful premium to make me a seller, and that
premium would come with some near-term certainty. Am I missing any parts of that equation, or do you think the
Street is naïve about the things it doesn't consider, that can make a company a seller – other than price?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I like the first half of your question a lot, because I agree with everything you said.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: I'm trying to butter you up, Paul.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, that was good. But the second half of the question, again, Gregg, I'm going to have to –
I'm going to pass on sort of addressing that directly. Every board, every company, everybody who's faced with any sort
of discussions regarding anything, that has to look at the long-term value for its shareholders, and that is our obligation.
And we will continue to look at long-term shareholder value as a key driver to our decision-making at, not just the
management level, but also at a board level. I think you need to remember that we are, I think, a good, solid
management team. We believe in our growth prospects. We believe in the long-term growth of the company. Our
employees are committed to that growth. And we believe we have a bright future. So, that is where I stand.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Fair enough. Siggi, I wanted to ask about generic Exalgo, are you still on track to launch those
strengths you settled on in November, and have you filed on the 32-mg strength? And then I have one last one for Paul.
I'll ask it now. How confident are you that Amgen's interests are aligned with yours, in terms of where you'd like to see
the regulatory and legal landscape end up on biosimilars? I just want to make sure, for my own edification, that they're
not a biosimilar spy. Thanks.

patent lawsuit already. So we have filed, and we are ready to launch. I think we feel very good about the approvability
of our product. The review at the FDA is going well. So, we are ready to launch at the settlement date.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And as to the Amgen interest, I believe Amgen's interests are aligned with ours on biosimilars.
They have certain things that they believe strongly in, that we talk to them about. But I don't see them as a spy. I think

they're actually a fantastic partner. We've had a great relationship. They're driving products with us to conclusion. They
believe in the biosimilar opportunities that exist, not just in the U.S., but around the world. And so we don't find
ourselves at odds with them. Fred, did you want to add something?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Probably the best statement to add to this is that the cornerstone of this
agreement is the quality side of it. And they've driven the need to make sure that quality is driven into the biosimilar
space, just as they have into the originator brand space. So, we see eye to eye on that. We work very aggressively
together on trying to work on advancing the biosimilar space, but I think it's with a quality background. And I think
that's going to help the American public as these biosimilars come to market in the future.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Great. Thanks. Just don't join Bio. Thanks, guys.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I don't think we're going to get invited.

And our final question for today comes from the line of Michael Tong with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Thanks. Morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Todd, you talked about business development bringing down tax rate. Are you thinking more
a geographic revenue mix, or are you thinking more structurally-oriented, where you can bring down the tax rate in a
more permanent way? And then secondly, as you consider obviously, borrowing cost is not high at this point. As you
consider paying down debt, would you consider, or can you, use stock as part of an acquisition?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Basically, we're looking at both ways of reducing the tax rate, both looking at it geographically,
which markets, and enhancing the profitability in certain markets. But also, we're evaluating BD opportunities that may
be able to more significantly achieve a much lower tax rate. The tax rate is a problem for us competitively, and we're
looking for all alternatives to reduce that rate.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. And Michael, I'll take the question about equity. I think, as we've done in the past, as we
did with the legacy Actavis acquisition, we will use equity as appropriate in a transaction. Oftentimes, it is the
difference between completing a transaction and not completing a transaction. And I think that's one of the tools that
you have to use in your arsenal as you look at acquisitions to make them, in many cases, more palatable for the seller to
be part of the organization. So yes, equity could be part of it, but you're right – certainly, cash is quite inexpensive at
the moment.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Thank you.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
