Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call
is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2013 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.
During our call, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2013 and comparing them to the same period
in 2012 unless otherwise stated. References to volumes or to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the
latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding
acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating company's income, or OCI, is defined as operating income
before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You'll find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit,
and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to

Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for review of the various
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?
Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick. And welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As previously foreseen, we had a challenging second quarter.
Our adjusted diluted EPS was up slightly excluding currency. Cigarette volume declined by 3.9%, due principally to
lower industry volume in the EU region, Russia, Turkey and the Philippines, as well as inventory movements in Japan
and Russia. Pricing remained strong and we had solid share gains particularly in the EU region. However, this was not
sufficient to offset the impact of unfavorable volume mix, additional investment, notably in Indonesia, the Philippines
and Russia, and higher clove and tobacco costs in Indonesia.
Our business fundamentals remain solid, and we are confident in our ability to achieve the ex-currency guidance that
we established in February and reaffirmed in May. However, the evolution of tax-paid cigarette industry volume will
remain a key variable and our main challenge for the remainder of the year, notably due to the global [indiscernible]
(3:30) situation.
We anticipate better results during the second half of the year and in particular a strong fourth quarter. This is based on
the expectation that our volume declines will moderate as adult smokers adjust to the higher prices implemented earlier
this year, our strong market share performance in the EU region will continue, margins will improve thanks to recent
price increases, and we will have favorability with respect to the timing of investment in infrastructure and marketing.
Since April we have witnessed a sharp decline in the value of certain currencies relating to commodities and emerging
markets such as the Australian dollar, Indonesian rupee, Mexican peso, Russian ruble and Turkish lira. Accordingly, at
prevailing exchange rates, our guidance now includes a full-year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.31
per share versus $0.19 in our previous guidance.
Our revised reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is therefore $5.43 to $5.53 compared to $5.17 in 2012, the change
solely reflecting the currency impact. Excluding currency, this continues to represent a growth rate of approximately
10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012. This is in line with our mid to long-term
currency-neutral annual adjusted diluted EPS growth targets.
Let me now discuss our second quarter results in more detail. Our cigarette volume was down by 2.6% excluding the
Philippines. This reflects three main factors. First, cigarette industry volume in the EU region continued to decline.
Second, industry volume in Russia was impacted by the large tax-driven price increases that were implemented at the
beginning of this year, as well as the weakening economy. Third, our second quarter volume reflected a difficult
comparison due to the inventory replenishment in Japan in Q2 of 2012 as well as a lower market share.
There were, however, some favorable developments. First, the decline in our volume in the EU region of 5.9% was
significantly less than the 10.1% decline that occurred in the first quarter. Second, we again achieved volume growth in
the Asia region excluding the Philippines. And finally, the volume growth continued to be strong in the Middle East
and North Africa.
Pricing continued to be the key driver of our income performance. It helped offset the impact of unfavorable volume
mix on net revenues excluding currency. However, adjusted OCI declined by 3.4% excluding currency. This was due to
unfavorable volume mix, higher production costs, notably in Indonesia where higher clove and tobacco costs have to
date only been partially passed on, investment in business infrastructure and marketing in Russia since the second half
of last year, and additional spending in the Philippines in the second quarter of this year to seek to achieve more
sustainable price gaps.

Our ability to take pricing remains solid, including in the EU region. During the second quarter, we achieved a
favorable pricing variance of $499 million, bringing our June year-to-date total volumes to over $1 billion. In May, we
increased the retail prices in Germany by €0.20 per pack across our portfolio. In June, we announced a [ph] further
(7:10) price increase in Russia of 4 rubles per pack across most of our key brands. We have also increased prices
recently in Belgium, Canada, Egypt, France, Greece, Indonesia, Spain, Switzerland and Ukraine. These price increases
will help us achieve another strong pricing variance during the second half of the year.
Let me now review a number of our key geographies, starting with the EU region. We have seen some signals as
politicians recognize that further spending cuts to try to rein in budget deficits are not going to help Europe turn the
corner. However, a few concrete measures have been taken so far to stem the continued rise in unemployment, which
reached a seasonally adjusted rate of 12.2% in the EU in May this year. This is compared to 11.3% a year ago.
In the second quarter, regional cigarette industry volume was down by 8% and the regional fine cut industry volume
declined by 0.8%. During the quarter, weakness continued, adult consumer down trading to lower priced products,
including illicit cigarettes. Due to the continued deterioration in the economic situation and the resulting growth in
illicit products, we are now forecasting a decline of cigarette industry volume in the EU region of 7% to 8% for the full
year 2013 compared to our previous forecast of around 6.5%.
While industry volume declined slightly faster than previously foreseen, we were able to achieve a better than expected
market share. Consequently our cigarette volume declined by 5.9% and our fine cut volume grew by 12.3% during the
second quarter.
On a regional basis, our cigarette market share increased by 0.7 points in the second quarter to 39.3%. The gain, was
driven by in particular by Marlboro, which grew by 0.5 points to 19.4%, with L&M, Chesterfield and the Philip Morris
brand also performing well.
In the fine cut category, we gained 1.2 share points to reach a regional share of 14.9% as we continued to successfully
extend our cigarette portfolio into this category.
Let me focus on three of the key markets in the EU region, namely Germany, Italy and Spain. Cigarette industry
volume in Germany declined by 7% in the second quarter and fine cut industry volumes decreased by 0.7% following
price increases in March. However, it should be highlighted that the underlying decline in cigarette industry volume
was 2.8% after the elimination of estimated trade inventory fluctuation. Our cigarette share grew by 1.2 points in the
quarter to 37.6%, driven mainly by the strong performance of Marlboro, which achieved its fifth consecutive quarter
year-on-year share increase.
The economic downturn in Italy continues with unemployment increasing from 11.9% in February to 12.2% in May.
Italian cigarette industry volume declined by 7.2% in the second quarter and the fine cut industry volume was down by
10.5%, impacted by the reduction in the price gaps between fine cut products and cigarette that followed the large fine
cut price increases mid-last year. The underlying fundamentals of our business in Italy remain strong. Our cigarette
market share grew by a factor of 0.4 points in the quarter to 53.3% thanks to the continued momentum of Marlboro and
the success of the Philip Morris selection in the international low-price segment.
We also gained share in the fine cut category with an increase of 7.9 points in the second quarter to 37.9% following
the successful introduction of Marlboro FINE CUT. We were encouraged by the decision of the Italian government to
postpone to October the one point increase in VAT that was due to be implemented in July. We believe that such a
measure would reduce consumer spending and hope that it will be further postponed or canceled.
At the end of last month, the Spanish government modified their excise tax on tobacco products in order to enhance the
predictability and stability of excise tax revenues, which had been undermined by adult cigarette smokers downtrading
to lower tax alternatives. The specific excise tax on cigarettes was increased while the ad valorem rate was reduced. At
the same time, the relative excise tax burden on fine cut was increased. The resulting reduction in the price gap between
cigarette and fine cut should help address the recent market imbalance, whereby cigarette industry volume declined by
12% in the first half of the year while fine cut industry volume increased by 26.4%. Our cigarette market share was up
by 2.3 points in the quarter to 31.9% as Marlboro, Chesterfield, and L&M all grew.

Let me now turn to the EEMA market, starting with Russia. In Russia, we estimate that cigarette industry volume
declined by about 6.4% during the second quarter as adult smokers reacted to tax- driven price increases of 6 to 7
rubles, equivalent to 9% for above premium, to 22% for super low-priced brands, and to a weaker economy. Our
volume declined by 11.4% during the same period as our distributor reversed its first quarter inventory buildup. For the
end of May, our quarterly market share remained resilient and was just 0.2 points lower at 25.9% despite delayed price
increases by several competitors following the January tax increase.
Parliament, L&M and Bond Street continued to gain share, but this was more than offset by the decline of Chesterfield.
We expect higher profitability for the full year 2013 than last year due to our pricing strategy, so we are forecasting that
cigarette industry volume will decline 6% to 7% on a full-year basis.
In Turkey, there was a resurgence of illicit trade during the second quarter when it reached over 20% of total
consumption due to the government's focus on other priorities. As a result, cigarette industry volume declined by an
estimated 11%. It is difficult to forecast the full-year performance due to the uncertainty surrounding future trends
illicit trade. However, unless the government acts quickly to address this issue, cigarette industry volume could be
down by as much as 7% to 9%.
The premium and mid-price segments continued to perform well. Our mix improved, driven by the strong momentum
of Parliament and Muratti. However the low-price segment which includes Lark and L&M priced at 6.5 lira per pack,
was impacted by the expansion of the super low 6-lira per pack segment. This led to a slight erosion of our overall
market share in the second quarter through May of 0.5 points to 44.8%. We have addressed this issue through the
relaunch of Chesterfield at 6 lira per pack.
In Asia, we are continuing to strengthen our business despite the disruptive tax increase in the Philippines. Our
cigarette volume grew by 1.5%, excluding the Philippines, with Indonesia the key contributor. In Japan, cigarette
industry volume decreased by 2% during the second quarter, and we continue to forecast a similar decline for the full
year. However, due mainly to the inventory replenishment that occurred in Q2 of 2012, our volume was 10.2% lower
than this year.
During the second quarter, we witnessed continued intense competitive activities and the successful launch by Japan
Tobacco of its first [indiscernible] (15:31). Our market share declined by 0.9 points to 26.9%, driven by lower shares
for Lark, the Phillip Morris brand and primary the menthol variant of Marlboro. We expect our market share to remain
under pressure in the second half of the year, but we believe that we will make progress over time thanks to the
continued resilience of Marlboro and a strong pipeline of innovative new product.
Indonesian industry volume grew by 3.5% in the second quarter, while we outperformed the industry of a volume
expansion of 6%. For the full year, we now expect an industry growth rate of approximately 4%, which while below
the exceptional growth rates of the last two years is consistent with the historical average for the market.
Our market share grew by 0.9 points to 36.1%, driven by Sampoerna A, U Mild and Marlboro, partly offset by the
decline of Dji Sam Soe, which moved above the favorable 1,000 rupiah per cigarette or stick price point. Premium
Sampoerna A is the clear leader in the growing but increasingly price competitive LTN machine-made [indiscernible]
(16:45) segment. U Mild is the leading mid-price brand in this segment, while Marlboro continues to strengthen its
position in the white cigarette segment, where it reached a segment share of 76% during the second quarter.
The final market that I will cover is the Philippines. The decline in the tax-paid industry volume moderated
significantly during the second quarter, with volume down by 7% despite the continued high prevalence of local
non-tax-paid cigarettes that are not included in this data. We increased our investments behind Fortune and
lower-priced brands to seek to achieve more sustainable price gaps. However, despite the very large tax increase, local
competitors, Mighty and Marvel brands, have remained at last year's attractive price point of one peso per stick. This
gives the competitor a clear price advantage in the market where stick sales account for about 70% of the volume.
With only limited improvement in tax enforcement, a widespread availability of non-tax-paid domestic cigarettes
remains a critical issue. It is driving a greater level of downtrading than originally foreseen, and has impacted our

volume, our mix and our market share, which declined to 82.9% in the quarter. We are continuing to work with the
Bureau of Internal Revenue to achieve a level playing field.
Our volume increased from 13.5 billion units in the first quarter to 19.1 billion units in the second quarter. For the full
year 2013, we forecast that our volume will be down around 20% to 25% but that the decline in consumption should be
significantly less.
In conclusion, we remain confident that we will deliver solid financial results in 2013. Industry volumes remain the key
challenge. However, we expect to continue to achieve solid market share as well as higher prices. There is no change to
our guidance attributable to business reasons. Our revised 2013 reported diluted EPS guidance reflecting prevailing
exchange rates is $5.43 to $5.53. Our guidance continues to represent a full year growth rate of approximately 10% to
12% excluding currency compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22.
We anticipate strong free cash flow growth excluding currency in 2013 and remain steadfast in our commitment to
reward our shareholders through attractive dividends and substantial share repurchase programs. Our dividend yield
last Friday was 3.8%, and our target dividend payout ratio remains 65%. During the second quarter, we spent $1.5
billion in share repurchases and have now repurchased close to 25% of the shares outstanding in the time of this period.
Thank you, and I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning. I guess my first question is in terms of the quarter, where did it fall relative
to your expectations? I'm curious, since your volume and overall business has to improve quite substantially to hit even
the low end of your 10% to 12% currency-neutral EPS growth, what gives you the confidence that you can hit these
targets? And then what are the key drivers of this?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, to start with the quarter, second quarter, I mean nothing, frankly speaking, came in the
second quarter as a surprise to us. I mean, we knew that we will have inventory adjustment in Japan, and maybe at this
stage I can give you a little bit more details of the magnitude of that adjustment. If our shipment went down in Japan by
about 10%, if you take the market decline down, it's about 8%. So on a shipment, you're talking, well around $1 billion
of the adjustment, or around $1 billion of adjustment. You know that Japan is a pretty profitable market to us, the
volumes are [ph] expensive (21:19).
And in Asia, we also knew that we were going to scale up the investment behind defending the price points in
Philippines, so just these two countries, these two market, put a drag on the results. But as expected, we knew it.
As a surprise, I think, came a bit weak share in June in Japan, and I think the sudden resurgence of the illicit trade in
Turkey. I mean these were the things that at the beginning of the quarter, we didn't have in our mind.
When it comes to second half of the year, as you have seen, we had a very strong pricing in the first half of the year, $1
billion, I mean it clearly gives us – and the pricing is, pricing environment supported by the tax environment. We feel
pretty comfortable about delivering strong pricing in the second half of the year.
Second thing is there was just the timing of the annualization of our investment from last year to this year. If you look
at our total cost variance, which you'll have on a cost of goods sold and the total cost of the company, essentially the
negative variance which we have for the first six -- half of the year, that's it for the year. So in the second half of the
year we should be essentially cruising flat versus 2012.

So as I said, we have a strong pricing. The tax environment is reasonable. The cost comps is going to be definitely
easier for the second half of the year. And needless to say, the business performance measured by the performance of
our brand, in essentially most of the geographies, I mean we're doing pretty well. So this gives us the confidence that
we can deliver the results for the full year.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. As you mentioned, pricing has been strong,
and you expect that to continue in the second half. So I'm trying to understand how your volume could be impacted for
the second half and the full year? You suggested last quarter that your volume growth ex-Philippines would be positive
this year. I'd like to know if you think that's still possible given, again, how weak the volume has been last quarter and
this quarter, then certainly especially given the Marlboro volume?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Sequentially, we see the improvement in the volumes in most of the geographies. So when we
were revising the guidance outlook for the full year, it's much more to recognize that some of these improvements are
not as good as maybe initially we expected. But there are improvements. So clearly the volumes over the quarter three
and quarter four, it's going to work a little bit better. But clearly the total market volumes for us is a key challenge for
the year.
I think maybe what will help you, if you look at how we see ourselves, how we're going to do in the quarters Q3 and
Q4, and you know that it is our practice not to give any specific guidance for the quarters, I would expect that the EPS
level for quarter three to be somehow comparable to what we had in quarter one. And then we will have all alignment
of the revenue and the cost comps fully materializing at the back end of the year.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. Thank you, I appreciate it.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Just to be clear on that last point, you think you're going have an absolute level of earnings
per share in the third quarter that's comparable to what you earned in the first quarter of this year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I said, that's been our practice, and this is what I said to Bonnie, right, our practice is not to
be very specific on the guidance on a quarterly basis. I was just trying to give the outside community a little bit of color
on what will be the pacing of the growth. On ex-currency basis, my EPS in the Q3, growth rate should be comparable,
maybe slightly above what I had in Q1. So clearly you see...
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. A comparable growth rate, not a comparable level of earnings, just to be clear?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Jacek, can you help us understand sort of the magnitude of the change in the
enforcement of the non-duty paid volumes in the Philippines? In other words, if it started and the level of enforcement
was at a zero and 100 is sort of standard and optimal, where are we as we're going through month by month?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well the 100, the last year -- I have to, I think start with the last year. I think the last year the
under declaration from that particular competitor we estimate was in the range of 80% of the entire volume. We
brought it down, or the government somehow brought it down to say about 20%, 25% under declaration. But just the
magnitude of the tax burden, which is at the new rate, is that you still can sell the product profitably if you declare 75%
of the volume and under declare 25%. So the issue is now, and therefore is presumably that particular competitor still

sitting on a one peso price point, which if you pay the full tax, economically is completely not doable.
So the question is now will the government continue or will there be enough willingness on the government side to
make sure that 100% of the volumes are being declared, as is my case and some other competitors in the market. So
that's the market. So yes, there is an improvement, we about to reach that tipping point in the Philippines, but we have
not reached the tipping point. And any sort of relaxation, if you like, on the tax collection, tax administration from the
government and we might be going back to square one.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: As it does improve, the hope and expectation would be you would in effect buy down
Fortune at a lower rate, correct, and improve the profitability in the market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. And this is what I referred to with our increased spending in Q2, it's going to continue into
Q3 behind Fortune, the buying down the price at retail so these sales allowances and other forms of supporting the
brand, to bring it to closer to this ideal price of say $1.50, $1.60. And at the same time we have introduced,
reintroduced two brands at one peso [indiscernible] (28:09) which clearly put the pressure on our financials, you can
imagine.
But we're all doing -- our strategy was a two pronged strategy, bring down the price, don't lose the volumes and in the
meantime work with the government so they bring up the bottom of the market but making sure that everyone pays
taxes. Now we I think delivering pretty well on our part but I have to admit it is financially expensive strategy, but we
also have to make sure that the government delivers on the second part of the strategy. So these two things have to
work in synch, otherwise we can't win the game.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then last question, Jacek, on cash flow. You reiterated again you expect a strong
increase in free cash flow for the year. It was down in the first quarter versus the year ago first quarter. You mentioned
on the last conference call that had to do with the phasing or the repatriation of profits to the United States and the
related taxes you paid. But it's down again even on a currency-neutral basis in the second quarter. What's -- why?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's nothing structural. It's just the timing of the foreign income tax payment [ph] in our strategy
(29:15). We just had it in the second quarter. I think as of quarter three, quarter four, you will see that these things will
level out. So what we initially said is still valid, that we expect the free cash flow to grow faster than earnings for this
year.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And actually, Jacek, one last thing. Do you feel – the growth of the illicit trade that
you've mentioned in a number of markets, do you think – is that getting to a point where it's perhaps inhibiting or will
inhibit your future capacity to take pricing?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Not really. I mean, as you can see, we had a very strong pricing first half of the year, we expect
strong pricing second half of the year. So I think what is more behind the illicit trade is not just the pricing which we
are taking, but the whole macro situation, okay? I mean, the pricing without the erosion of the consumer purchasing
power is one impact, and the pricing where you have erosion of the consumer purchasing power is the other impact.
And I think EU is exactly that sort of a situation, that the pricing is pretty moderate, as is the tax environment. So that's
good on that side, but if you have a continuous growth of unemployment, various austerity measures, et cetera, that
puts a dent on the consumer spending.
Russia is, frankly speaking, also like this. You have a reduction of the increases of many utilities in Russia well above
inflation, well above the rate of the increases last year, because utilities in Russia went up by about 10% in the first half
of the year. Last year was only 5%. Pricing, yes, it is pretty high pricing, but we had to pass on the prices and obviously
improve our margins. So therefore we see a little bit of a softness on the market. But this is not pricing. It's much more
the macro, the illicit -- sorry, the unemployment and other governmental measures to improve the state deficit.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Judy. Good morning.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Just a couple of questions from my end. First, just I'm looking at your Asia margins, and clearly
you had a pretty significant decline in Q2, and I know that there are sort of big buckets of the drivers of the margin
decline. You had the negative geographic mix with Japan being down 10%. You have the Indonesia margin pressure
from higher costs, and then you've got the Philippines step up in the investment. So, but I just wanted to just see if you
can actually quantify thinking about these big buckets? Can you quantify the drivers of the margin decline in Asia?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well. I think you pointed in – oh, I mean Japan, which is more the one-off in the quarter, and I
said that the magnitude of the adjustments in inventories, you're talking in the range of $1 billion. $1 billion times the
margin which we have in Japan, that clearly puts a dent on the performance of the region. And the spending in
Philippines, working on, putting a pressure on the costs. Now Indonesia is still, about this time, Indonesia is in the
situation when we fully passed on the tax, plus also we have a lap on the clove prices and the leaf prices. So the
pressure is being released from Indonesia. Japan was as I said, was a one-off. Philippines going to continue.
All in all, actually, Judy, I think Asia is going to have – we expect Asia to have a nice growth of the margin, strong
growth of the margin actually in the second half of the year as are all the regions of PMI. And we expect for the full
year that the operating margin for the entire PMI will be up versus last year. So we expect the margin growth on the
total PMI, and as I said the second half of the year, you should see the improvement in all regions.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So when you think about Japan and then outside of Japan in Asia, so is Japan margin down also
because you're spending more given the competitive pressure? And outside of Japan, is the Philippines really the only
region where you're seeing just at the country level the margins being down year-over-year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I think it's more to the shipment distortions which I had in Japan. There was, we continue
spending in Japan, we're launching our products. There is support there, but this is more due to this one-off inventories
and Philippines, which is a support of Fortune and our lower price [indiscernible] (33:59). So these are two items which
essentially drag the margins in the second quarter, of Asia region.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And just on Japan, so it sounds like you are not expecting much of a market share
improvement in the back half of the year, even though you have stepped up a bit of the spending in that market. Can
you just talk about sort of what you're seeing competitively? It sounds like really the intense competitive situation
continued in the second quarter. Do you think that just from a new product perspective you don't have enough to really
deal with some of the competitive pressure? I'm just curious why you think that the market share doesn't necessarily get
better in the back half?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean as JT continues with the promotional spending, and the new product offering. I
think especially the [indiscernible] (34:46) of our share for June, is mostly attributable to the successful, I have to
admit, at least initially, free product variance, capsule product variance from [ph] margins (34:56). As you know,
Marlboro, Philip Morris and Marlboro was the leading of that part of the menthol segment in Japan. We've been very
successful. So we get a lot of share in the past. Mevius, or Mild Seven at the time, was one of the big brands, which
was not participating.
So the whole competition is a little bit a campaign to about a quarter of the market, which is the menthol, and we have
our nice share there, we're actually over-represented in that segment. I think it's going to continue. We will be under
pressure with share, but we also still have a couple of initiatives in our sleeve for the second half of the year, plus, we
have very good performance from the brands which we launched in the first half of the year. So there will be a pressure
on the share, but you lose share, you can gain share. So let's remain optimistic.

<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And lastly, just in Russia, I think you called out some of the competitors were lagging in
terms of the pricing in that market. JTI took pricing recently. So is your view from a pricing perspective at least, the
competitive situation has become a little bit more rational in that it's really just more about the volume situation? And
are consumers starting to react to the pricing increase in a more modest way now that you've had the six months of
pricing in place -- or the tax increase in place?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well the consumer, if you look at the smoking [indiscernible] (36:28) daily and it's, maybe it's
too early to read it, but we don't see much of the movement, if at all. But as I said, maybe it's too early to read the
impact of this price increase. Remember, that Russia was taking the prices year-on-year, and every year, twice a year,
the prices used to end up, used to go up in Russia. This year is different, because the size of the tax increase was larger,
so obviously the price increase is a much more – is larger as well. I think if I look at my portfolio that I came with just
0.2 losses, knowing that my brand lost a price gaps of 6 to 7 rubles because this was the price increase from the
beginning of the year versus competitors, I feel very strong about the portfolio and actually I start seeing a good payoff
of the investment which we had in Russia this year and continuing this year, because it's demonstrated the strength of
the portfolio that I called at least temporary, but the [indiscernible] (37:25) showed that despite these advantages in
pricing.
Now you have the lagging in some other markets as well, so I don't think it's something which is systemic. It happens
that some other, gets the focus on something else. For us, we've been very clear, for us, Russia is getting into maturity.
I mean, the volumes are very exciting, but we are much more excited about growing the top line and growing the
bottom line. And I think for us the focus on Russia is, generate the value out of the market rather than contemplate too
much a bit of the volume or market share losses.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Gentlemen. Yes, apologies, but going back to Bonnie's question with regards to the
guidance, clearly no change to the EPS guidance, except currency. But volumes do appear to be quite substantially
worse than probably initially thought. Can I just push you – is there any sort of number you can give for full-year, ex
the Philippines? And presumably the swing factor in the second half, you mentioned you have pricing and costs. Does
that mean the second quarter increase in costs in the Philippines and Indonesia are dropping out again? Was the price
moves on Fortune in the Philippines a temporary item, or is that going to be a permanent reduction?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I said on the total costs, in answering one of the questions before that on the total cost for
the company, the variance which we have ex-currency on the first half of the year, that's essentially for the full year.
Then I will have a much better clearer cost comparison in the second half of the year. Pricing, $1 billion, I would say
will qualify this is a strong pricing. We don't see any much, as any sort of a headwind at this stage to our pricing. I
think we're going to continue with the strong pricing going forward. You have heard, we have announced prices
recently also in Germany, France, a number of other locations.
So this obviously is going to help there. And volume, and total market volume, not our performance, our market share
is pretty strong and we growing our market share in a number of places. I think the single biggest challenge which we
have this year, is the total market size. And this I have to admit, with, there are a number of the factors which play into
this one, which makes a little bit, forecasting more difficult, than maybe in other years. But this is a year when we have
significant challenges on a total market.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: But it's safe to say, therefore, that the response of the company has been to ramp pricing
probably more than they expected in the second half to offset that volume, the market volume declines?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, but we're always, we're focused on growing revenue and the bottom line. So I think we don't
have any major switch in our -- or change in our strategy.

<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Just a totally separate subject. The famous e-cigarettes. Is the strategy of the group
remains as it was in July 2011 with it sort of very much focused on heat, not burn products rather than e-cigarettes? Or
is that something which is flexible depending on the way the market develops?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. It will be flexible because we said we're working on three platforms. I mean, two platforms
which are based on heat versus burn and a third platform, which is essentially, one could say [indiscernible] (41:15)
e-cigarette. So we're making progress on all three. We're also watching what are the developments in the market. So I
think our three platforms, I think what we see today in the market, should be able to address all opportunities which
may exist in that market.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: But I mean, given the way in which the market's developed, would you be emphasizing
more the e-cigarette now rather than heat not burn, or has that not really changed, because originally I think the first
couple, the first two platforms that you thought you'd bring to market were heat not burn?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think e-cigarettes as they are today, I don't think the situation has changed much in regards to
our assessment. This was some time ago. You need to have a product which is palatable to the consumer. The product
has to be liked by the consumer. I don't think e-cigarettes today are delivering on that promise. Heat versus burn clearly
addresses both the element of the hard reduction and delivers on the taste expectations of consumers. I think heat versus
burn in our opinion is closer to this idea of sort of a product which you should have in the market. E-cigarettes, as I
said, [indiscernible] (42:30) every day of the category development, so the more focus and investment is needed in
order to bring the palatability again of this product into some level of acceptance by consumers.
I mean, we see the e-cigarettes in some markets, it's essentially in the EU in some markets, not in all EU, but there is an
awareness. It confirms that there is some need for the consumers, but we also have to remember that the early days of
e-cigarettes are in the environment when there is no tax. So what I see in some countries is much more a phenomena of
the pricing rather than the phenomena of the hard reduction or taste. I mean, people are compromising because they get
a discount versus the cigarette going in the 40%, 50% or 70% range. It's nothing substantial. I don't think we could call
it substantial at this stage, but it's early days of the category. So we continue working on our three platforms, and we
are making progress as per plan. And I think when we will be ready we'll go to market.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with the CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Hello. Just looking at your business in Indonesia, the volume growth in the first half was
about 2%. If it's 4% for the year, obviously that's a pretty sharp acceleration that you would expect. I know the comps
get easier, but you've also got some potential consumer headwinds with higher fuel prices and those getting passed
through to other products and then some big competitive launches. So what do you see driving an acceleration in
category growth there?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we expect 4%. But I mean, one can say that, I think a quarter ago would have been more
closer to the 6% of the growth. So we lowered a little bit our expectations for the market. 4% is about the historical
average growth of the market if I take out the last, very exceptional, the last two years, which were very exceptional. I
think the fuel subsidies, I mean, part of that thing was mitigated by the government by returning some subsidies in
other forms to the lower income people. I think the opening of the year was a bit slower. 1% I think was the growth rate
of the market in the first quarter. It was presumably more impacted by some spikes in the put prices in Indonesia.
So no, I think it's pretty doable and it's actually, somehow reflects the pricing of the -- the seasonality, if you like,
pacing of the developments in the market. I think 4% for the market should be doable for the total market. Our volumes
and our market share is pretty strong, not as strong growth as the last year because we're leaving some attractive price
points behind us. But still, for the first half of year, in the second quarter, first quarter, we've had a nice share

advancement so I think we can expect some share growth, moderate share growth going forward in the year.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: And then at the category level, is it the easier comps that are the big driver for the
acceleration in the second half? Or is there anything else to that?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I think the market is slowly going to the historical growth rate. It's just the pacing of the
quarter --
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: And then just for – back to Japan, for what you expect that's factored into your
guidance, would you need to regain share there to be on track for what you're expecting that's reflected in your
guidance? Or do you have it where you just need to hold? Or, I realize the pacing in this past quarter had an impact. Is
your expectation that that's going to swing back? Or do you not necessarily need that to happen?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I mean we put into our guidance or we include it in our guidance some understanding that
the share in Japan is going be under pressure. We won't give you the number, what is the exact share we're targeting for
the year, but we do recognize that there is a pressure on the share, on the market share in Japan. As I said, we still have
a few initiatives to be launched in the market. Let's see how the whole thing unfolds. And then Q3 we presumably will
have a better position to say what is the realistic share expectation for the full year.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: And I realize it's early in the quarter, only just a little over a couple of weeks, but in
Japan, say, specifically or any major markets, have you seen trends so far that look like an acceleration, or specifically
in Japan, has there been, from the consumer retail share, trends that look more promising that suggest you'll see the
shipment share regain some ground?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. No, but as I said earlier, I mean the biggest challenge which we have this year is the total
market, and total market you need a little bit of time to estimate properly. I mean not on a weekly basis or bi-weekly
basis. So we're pretty confident in our share, as I said, we're pretty confident about the pricing, but we'll have to see
how does this unfold in the remaining two quarters of the year relative to the total market sizes. So this is what it is, but
nothing at the beginning of this month which would, forecast from a perspective that, in our guidance or outlook for the
second half of the year would change versus what we just announced.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just had two questions for you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about Europe and
just understand, through the quarter, this is a better volume performance than I expected actually. It seems like it got
sequentially better given you had a pretty soft April. So the expectation where you've increased your estimate for the
decline for the division for the year, do you expect conditions to worsen in the second half of the year or remain about
the same? I guess what I saw in the quarter was an improvement throughout the quarter.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, there is. We had, total industry was, if I remember, 10% down, in Q1, is 8% down, so you
had a blended 9.2%, 9.3% for the first half the year. So yes, even with our revised outlook for the full year, we do
assume that there will be some improvements going forward. It's a little bit of comps, but yes, sequentially we see that
the volumes – we had an exceptional low quarter first quarter, okay. So this is already in the books, so you can't change
this one. But yes, there is some sequential improvement in the quarter.

But also if you look at our shipment it is much better than market because EU has very, very fabulous market share
performance first quarter and the second quarter, and it's very much on the back of Marlboro. So you remember, Chris,
in the past I said EU is definitely much more total market than a mix problem for us.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But at least a part of a positive news about EU performance this year.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just one follow-up question for you which is on the investments that you
made over the last year in Russia or in Indonesia, those kind of markets, or even behind the Marlboro brand overall.
We'll be lapping a lot of those in the second half of the year. Do you expect that those investments then are going to
remain at the same level or do they start to come down on a year-over-year basis? Is that a benefit to the second half or
is it just less of a drag, I guess, is the way to say it?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, this is what I'm saying, the second half of this year is going to be more comparable to the
second half of last year. Therefore my variance is going to be flat. So yes, on the full 12-month basis this year, you will
see that we have increased year-on-year. However, the pacing of the thing was that we started or accelerated, or
increased the investment in the second half, third, fourth quarter, in some places, of last year and therefore I'm lapping
this now in the second half of this year.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And have you quantified the degree of investment you've made over the last
year, let's say, of what your increase was overall, say, in marketing, distribution and those kind of areas?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I wish I could, and I know the number, but I am afraid so many people are on the call and I
cannot reveal it.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Understood. I thought I'd try. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: My first question has to do with Indonesia. Your guidance for 4% volume growth has come
down pretty sharply in just a little over a month. So what gives you comfort that that 4% is the right number to the
extent that you see continued food inflation in that market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we got the reading now of the second quarter, so yes, I mean the second quarter came
nicely and the volumes grew by, total industry volumes grew by 3.5%, so once you have two quarters, it's a little bit
easier to forecast the full year. So this is due to this. I think there was some impact in the first quarter of the food price,
food inflation. There was some flooding in some regions, territories in Indonesia. I think all that together, I mean it
might have put the market on a bit of slower opening of this year. So the quarter sequentially now should be better, but
I think we'll, to be more realistic we should rather put an estimate of the total market in this range of the 4% rather than
stayed with the previous one. And we, frankly speaking, 4% is a very solid, nice growth rate for this market, so we're
okay with it.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Sure. In the EU, you'd previously stated that you'd hoped to hold your local currency EBIT
flat with your prior volume assumption. So can you give an update on that outlook for local currency EBIT growth in
the EU?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, EU again, they improved sequentially. The total industry improved in the Q2. I would say
maybe initially we thought the improvement was going to be more than just 8% decline, and I think once you have a
10%, an 8% in the pocket already in actuals, then you have to – again, you're in the same situation that you better can
predict what the forecast, what the full year is going to be. There's not much improvement on the contraband. I mean
we don't have the full reading for the EU where the illicit trade stands. However, when I talk to the markets, when we
meet the markets, many markets indicate that the contraband illicit trade continues to grow, all is not easy.
So France, I think, is one of the recent examples and the illicit trade spike continues to grow. So all in all, I think to be
more realistic we decided to revise the outlook for the industry. Maybe it's going to come better. I don't know. Our
biggest challenge, I'm repeating, [indiscernible] (54:03) biggest challenge we have this year is the total size of the
industry. It's not our business performance. It's not our ability to deliver strong pricing. It's not our ability to manage the
cost of the investment, et cetera. It's essentially the total industry volumes.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough. And my last question has to do with e-cigarettes as well. Do you have an
estimate on what impact e-cigarettes could have had for the total EU or maybe specifically for some of the markets
where it's bigger? You just called out France where you've seen a sequential acceleration in the market declines on a
substantially easier comp and, as I understand it, that is one of the bigger e-cigarette markets in the region.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I wouldn't give a number. We're looking at that carefully because, as you know, one of our
platforms is of course e-cigarettes, so it's not that we're not closely looking at this category. It's difficult to give
estimate. You have this, some places information, somebody traveled to Italy, to Rome, and have seen now in France,
seen the e-cigarette. You go 100 kilometers outside [indiscernible] (55:12) and no one's heard about the e-cigarettes. So
we have to look at this anecdotal sort of information with a little bit of a caution. I don't think -- cautiousness. I don't
think today it's the size of the market of e-cigarettes in EU, this is in a range higher than a 1%. And presumably, that
might be even on a high side. I don't have a number. I mean it's pure speculation. You would have to – I think we need
more time to really assess the effect. I don't think it's comparable to what you have, for example, in the U.S.
But yes we observe it. There is a little bit in London, but you go in a few other towns outside of London, not
necessarily is the case. I mean I had historically in Greece, and this was just another alternative to smoking at
significantly lower price. Then the dissatisfaction came, and the market disappeared, okay, whatever was the market at
the beginning. So this is the early stages of the category in Europe. As I said, we're very closely watching the thing, and
looking at where is the right moment when the market can create opportunity for us. But I wouldn't volunteer today to
any solid number with regards to the impact of e-cigarettes, the size of e-cigarettes in Europe.

Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Thanks. Jacek, is this the most challenging environment that you've operated in since the spinoff?
Or is it too much a pessimistic interpretation of your results?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's challenging. The whole year is challenging. It's a different challenge in a different year. I
mean at retrospect, presumably – we're much more focused, we keep an eye on the ball, quarter two is quarter two. We
reported quarter two. I am glad it's over. We focus on quarter three, quarter four, and into 2014 and into 2015. So at
retrospect we will just treat it as a quarter. We are not managing the business at a quarterly basis. So for us it's much
more how are we confident about the full year, what is in front of us for the 2014, 2015, et cetera, 2016, 2017. We have
a lot of exciting things in front of us. So I wouldn't – I understand the interest around the quarter, but we wouldn't be
over excited about the quarter.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. It's a challenging environment. This year, the challenge is the total market sizes. There's
some other years you had other challenges. I mean the business was not performing. If you go back to the spin time, I
mean are we today much more confident, much, much more confident in our ability to grow market share, to grow
Marlboro, to be innovative, et cetera. I wouldn't think – I don't think we were that strong, had such a strong feelings
about that part of our business in 2008 or 2009. So listen, business is business, you always have some challenges. No
point in --
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Fair enough. We don't want you to get bored, right? The other question I had for you, Jacek, is
can you give us an update on the impact of plain packaging in Australia?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, if you look from the total market perspective and the market share, the market was slightly
down, was the mature market. So I don't think we can really give you more of the insight what's the impact of a plain
package. There is some acceleration of the downtrading. Is it attributable to plain pack? We will have to see. But there
is some downtrading. But also market is pretty expensive market in terms of level of the prices. Prices went up. We've
seen the downtrading before the plain pack. Can plain pack in the mid to long-term accelerate our trading? Yes. There
is a risk. We always are pretty open about it. But I wouldn't conclude that sort of a statement just based on the one
quarter. [indiscernible] (59:25) in Australia is developing nicely, strong.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Right. Any changes to the illicit trade in Australia that you can see?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. No. No.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. All right. That's all I had for you. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: I would like to circle back to Russia and just, firstly, the reason for the decrease in the
outlook for Russian volume, it sounded like from your previous comments that's really due to a change in the macro
environment and the effect that is having on consumer disposable income. I was hoping you could help clarify that.
And then secondly, I was wondering if there's a sense that the Russian government with this greater decline in volumes
now will be taking that into account as they look at tax rates going forward at the end of the year.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think when it comes to the markets what we see is we have a slowdown in the economy.
So Russia has still the quarters, reporting the quarters of GDP growth but the growth dynamic is different than it used
to be in the past. So there is a slowdown in the economy. There is clearly less governmental spending which
presumably also goes back into that overall stage of shape of the economy. There is clearly a lower wage dynamic. The
wages are going up in Russia but not at the rates of last year or year before. And for the first half of the year I think the
utilities prices – prices for utilities – water, gas, fuel, et cetera, went up I think in the range of about 10%. I think Russia
is in inflation of about 7% – 7% to 8%, so clearly above inflation, and above the rate of the growth which we observed
last year because first half last year utilities were up by about 5%. So there is something around the consumer
purchasing power, or disposable income, which we are confronted with.
Now Russia as you know – good thing about Russia is we have a good tax structure and we have a visibility of the
taxation for the next three years. Next year there is still in front of us quite a sizable tax increase which we would like
to pass onto consumers. It's slightly above this year because the impact of this year of the pure tax was about five
rubles, if I'm not mistaken, and we have in front of us about eight rubles of the tax increase, just tax increase, for the
market. So I don't think the government will change this one. In the outer years of the long-term tax plan the
government may take a different view on taxation. But anyway in the plan there is a moderation because from 2015 to
2016, at least what we understand, the taxes should go at a lower rate than this year and the next year.

One thing which we have to watch for Russia, because this is our experience from other places, and I hope the
government also will carefully look at that, is the illicit trade, because usually such a situation may open the door to
illicit trade. But I hope the Russian government and the Russian administration will defend strongly the legal market in
Russia.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay. Thank you. And then my last question was with respect to the evolution of the TPD
as you see it at this stage given the various entities have had a first go at it. And then related to that is what looks to be
the risk of plain packaging in Ireland given the U.K.'s decision to abandon that policy? Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, logically Ireland should follow the same thinking as the U.K. Let's wait for the evidence
and only then you can make sure that the legislations you propose is sound from the evidence, science perspective. The
process in Ireland has not started. We just heard that they have an intention to look into plain packaging. How that's
going to materialize, I can't say.
On the TPD, I think the whole debate about the Tobacco Products Directive will happen at the plenary sessions of the
Parliament around mid of September. Now it depends how the outcome of, how the directive's going to be for, at the
end of the Parliament versus what the Council has decided and then it will go through the reconciliation process. I think
we will know the final shape of the directive say before year-end, maybe early next year – around the year-end. And
then you'll have about two years for the transposition into member states law. We'll have to see what transition periods
the member states will give in the domestic markets and the domestic jurisdictions. So it's difficult to say.
Now as you see you have the number of committees in Parliament, the opinions are highly divided. It's not that there
was a unanimous support for the ban of slims or menthol, et cetera. But I don't know. It's difficult to speculate at which
year the directives are going to now – is going be finished.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Rogerio S. Fujimori>: Hi, everyone. I just have one quick question. In the context of the proposed EU TPD
changes, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Poland. We know that 20% is menthol and nearly 30% is slims.
Would you expect some smokers to switch to other cigarettes if and when the ban is in place? Or is it more likely that
we'll see a surge in illicit volumes from Eastern Europe? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: [indiscernible] (1:05:40) put at risk the illicit trade. I think some consumers can go and find a
similar product in the illicit market already today, and this was one of the arguments which we were bringing to the EU
officials at the member states, that first of all, there is no scientific base upon any of this product. It's pure
discrimination in the market without any scientific base, and it is difficult to argue that the super-slims are more
harmful or less harmful than the regular cigarettes. Yes, there is a risk of illicit trade. Some consumers, this is
speculation, but some consumers will go back to regular cigarettes, and in some countries in Europe consumers also
know how to mentholate cigarettes themselves. So I don't know in which direction it's going to go. [indiscernible]
(1:06:31) designed the policy, if it stays like it is, will not improve, will not deliver on the stated objective. But yes, it
will create a distortion in the marketplace. So let's see how that will unfold.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hello.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Now that we're two quarters into the year, is there any change in the contribution from pricing
variance for the full year versus expectations when we started the year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, the pricing variance, the $1 billion which we hedged has indicated we're looking for the
pricing variance for the full year, so no.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Okay, great. And then in the release you comment on lower industry volume, and I understand
that's reflecting excise tax increases, trade inventory movements, illicit trade, et cetera. But is there any fundamental
change in consumption patterns in any markets that's contributing to that lower volume for total industry?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. It's presumably that, as I said, that the biggest challenge we have this year we have on the
total industry volume. I think the pricing which is taking place, there is not something significantly higher than in the
previous years, if you used averages, et cetera. I think what we confronted is that in some geographies, we have, we are
confronted with the slowdowns of economies, the difficult macros, et cetera. So whenever you have an erosion in the
disposable income that has an impact. The illicit trade obviously starts playing more important now. This is a challenge
we have, illicit trade in the form of typical contraband crossing the borders. But also in some places like Philippines the
very low law enforcement which results that some people don't pay the taxes which they should pay. And that's another
phenomenon which we are confronted with.
But in terms of the consumption part or smoking incidence, if you look at the mature markets, yes, there's a natural rate
of a decline, but nothing which we would today attribute that this is a year when people – that the incidence goes down
faster, the daily consumption rate declines faster. Actually in many countries, take southern Europe, et cetera, the
smoking incidence in many countries stays flat and the daily consumption stays flat, of the total tobacco product.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: That is great. That helps. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Good morning. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just in terms of picking up on a comment you
made earlier about the price lags by some competitors, you mentioned Russia and some other markets, you'd seen that.
I guess two questions on that. One is, is that something you feel in terms of that price lagging is a bit of a growing
trend? And then secondly, is there any market apart from the Philippines, which you called out, where you've actually
reversed pricing, haven't taken pricing during the year? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The price lagging, it happens every year in different places, okay. I think sometimes it's a month,
sometimes it's a couple of months. I think Russia was a little bit on the longer side, so that's clearly something which
puts the pressure. But finally prices were implemented. It's more of the tactics rather than the sort of a strategy. And
second question, no, no, it's just Philippines when we had the very specific situations when we had to react with the
pricing.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Okay, thanks. Just picking up on e-cigarettes and coming back to some of those comments
earlier, our understanding, my understanding at least is that your plan is to come into e-cigarettes/next-generation
products commercially 2016/2017. Is that still the right understanding? Or are you saying that if the market develops
further you're positioning yourselves to come in with other products ahead of that chronological process that you talked
about in the past?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, to be precise we have said that the 2016, 2017 it was focused on the two platforms – the
first two platforms...

<Q - David H. Hayes>: Sure...
<A - Jacek Olczak>: And this is where we will start constructing the factory this year, et cetera. But we're working
essentially at the same time on three platforms, in the different stages of development, but even the platform third –
third platform, which is as I said close to [indiscernible] (1:11:04) can be treated as a cigarette, is also on our agenda.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Okay. So you could come to market with something commercially in that area earlier than
2016 potentially?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: When we will go to the market, we will announce when we'll go to market.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Okay. And then my final question, just to clarify, I guess, just in terms of the guidance and
some of the trends that people have highlighted, I guess you talked about the fact that these markets, Indonesia, Russia,
EU, Turkey, obviously the volumes have lowered since the beginning of the year in terms of outlook. But then you just
made the point that pricing-wise you've not changed your outlook since the beginning of the year in terms of the
pricing you expected to take through the year. So I'm just still trying to equate why the guidance is unchanged, what the
moving part is that offsets that volume declines that you've seen in a number of key markets that you've mentioned
today?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, listen, the guidance, we're taking into consideration all element which we knew at that
time. There were, the pricing at the beginning of the year, if I'm not mistaken, we had about 75% of the pricing
realized. So we knew what we're going to have in the pricing. There were some prices also changed more recently,
some a little bit earlier for different reasons, and the timing of the target increases has changed, et cetera. So and the
whole guidance is a blended number of the factors.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: But is it fair to say that there's also maybe a little bit less expenditure planned since the
beginning of the year or more cost savings potentially? Is that an area where the $300 million could actually be higher
to help delivery?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, no. The cost saving in terms of productivity to plan for the $300 million – we're delivering
on schedule so we had it already in our guidance. And no, the comp – we knew that we would have a comp in the
second half of the year much better than the first half of the year. All factors were in the guidance.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo Gardner.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Hi, Jacek. Two quick questions. One involves the pension liabilities in light of the rise
of the long-term interest rates. You're fully – your funded status might lead some restatement upwards or downwards
with the liability. I'm curious about that. Second, in Spain, what steps can you take? It sounded like the cigarette
volumes were down 12% and the roll-your-own were up 26%, I think you said. That's quite a staggering direction. Any
steps underway to reverse those trends?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, starting with the first one, it's very short. All our pension funds are well-funded – well
above the [ph] statute (1:14:11) limits. So if I read your questions properly we don't expect any prices on the front
when it comes to Spain. Yes, clearly the government going into, finally recognize that there was too much of the gap
between a taxation of the roll-your-own and a manufactured cigarette is very helpful. So in a few quarters, we should
see very hopefully some improvement. I think we've seen it in Italy when the government taxed roll-your-own fine cut
products a little bit more, you could see already now that you have some reverse of the trend which is obviously helpful
for our cigarette – manufactured cigarette category.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: In Italy the numbers seem to indicate that. That was good. What is the level of market
share for roll-your-own in Spain at this time?

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Chris
Burritt with Bloomberg News.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Hey. Thank you for your time. I wanted to ask, are you surprised by the volatility and the
movement in currencies, and are there new steps or additional steps that you are taking because of this?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think I am surprised as everyone else is surprised, because the whole markets these days
are pretty volatile. And people are reading every announcement from every central bank, and they're reacting to the
[indiscernible] (1:15:52). I mean, you've seen our announcement, our outlook for the currency is revised by, mainly for,
because of the Russian ruble, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, et cetera. And actually on the Japanese yen, and on the
euro, we already were pretty well hedged at the beginning of the year, with always some opportunities during the year,
because the currency was very volatile, and we used this opportunity. So we feel much more confident about the yen
now and the euro impact on us, but the rest of the currencies, yes, there is a volatility in the market place.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Okay. May I ask you one last question on electronic cigarettes? Could you give a little color on I
guess how they fall short to the taste and the feel of a consumer? And would you go as far as saying that the popularity,
that the demand for e-cigarettes may actually falter over time, they may not become as big as some project?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, what [indiscernible] (1:17:08) and also myself if you like, are testing the product. So I
think the product is not a product which is very close to the conventional cigarette. And I think the consumers are
looking for something which is at least similar. So the product has its own taste deficiency. But on the category side,
everyone is working on how to improve it. And a year from now the situation might be different.
But today I don't think that the product is performing well on the taste side. Okay? It's pretty tasteless [indiscernible]
(1:17:38). There's also the question of a good manufacturing process, practices. The product is not regulated. I don't
think the consumer has a confidence that what they're buying is really something which they would like to use. And as
I said earlier, I think today it's much more the phenomena of the price than anything else. And when price comes to
play, here our consumers are willing sometimes to compromise a lot. Will it last long? I don't know. This remains to be
seen.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Thank you for your time.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
