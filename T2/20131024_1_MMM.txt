Please turn to slide number 3. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements to reflect our
current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions
and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists
some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.
So let's begin today's review. I'll turn the program over to Inge, and please turn to slide number 4.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As always, I appreciate you joining us today. I'm pleased to report that
Q3 was a strong quarter for 3M. We posted an all-time record for quarterly sales, and every business grew sales
organically. All five business groups posted margins above 20%, while we continued to advance our strategic priorities
and investments.
Let's take a look at a few third quarter highlights. Sales rose 5.6% to a record of $7.9 billion. Organic local currency
growth was 5.8% in the quarter, led by Safety and Graphics at 8%, Health Care at 7%, and Industrial at 6%. Our
consumer business grew 4% organically, as did Electronics and Energy. This quarter's organic growth of 5.8% was a
significant improvement versus the 2% growth in the first half of 2013. Industrial, Safety, and Graphics, as well as
Electronics and Energy, showed the most improvement.
On a geographic basis, developed economies such as United States, West Europe, and Japan also showed substantial
improvement. On a year-to-year basis, we posted positive organic growth in all geographical regions. Latin
America/Canada led the way, with double-digit organic growth of 11%. Asia Pacific rose 7%, the United States was up
5%, and Europe, Middle East, Africa increased 4%.
As expected, currency was a headwind to sales, reducing worldwide sales by 1.7%, and acquisitions added 1.5 points to
third quarter growth. So, all in all, a very strong quarter, with organic local currency growth of 4% across all developed
markets and 10% in developing markets. Operating margins were again strong at 22%, or 22.4 % excluding the
first-year impact of acquisitions.
All five business groups delivered margins above 20% while also growing their top lines, proof of continued
broad-based effectiveness and efficiency. Earnings were $1.78 per share, up nearly 8% versus third quarter of 2012.
Finally, we returned $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchase, or $4.8 billion
through nine months of the year. In summary, it was an excellent quarter for 3M on many fronts, and our businesses
continue to grow very profitably. I thank the 3M team for their outstanding effort to deliver these very good results.
Let me review the outlook. Please turn to slide number 5. With one quarter remaining in the year and the business
performing to our expectations, we are narrowing our full-year guidance to $6.65 to $6.75 versus a previous range of
$6.60 to $6.85 per share. On organic local currency growth, we are also narrowing the full-year 2013 range to 3% to
4% versus a previous expectation of 2% to 5%.
We continue to expect that currency impacts would reduce sales for the year by approximately 2%, and we look for
acquisitions to add about 1.5% to sales for the year. As for the 2013 tax rate, we now anticipate a range of 28% to
28.5%, and free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 90%.
Now David will take you through the details of the quarter David?
David W. Meline
Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with the review of sales growth. Please turn to slide 6. Organic local currency growth was
5.8% in the third quarter, which was a significant acceleration versus the 2% we saw in the first half of the year.
Volumes contributed 4.8% to third quarter growth, and we continued to see good pricing power, with selling prices up
a full percentage point year on year. Acquisition added 1.5 points to sales growth in the quarter related to Ceradyne in

our Industrial business and FSTech in Safety and Graphics. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.7% points in
the third quarter. Currency impacts were negative 6% in Latin America/Canada and negative 5% in Asia Pacific, while
EMEA had a positive 3% currency impact year on year. Third quarter sales rose 5.6% in dollar terms.
Looking across geographic regions, Latin America/Canada led the way with strong organic local currency growth of
10.5% in the quarter. All five business groups contributed to growth in the quarter, including double-digit organic
growth in Industrial, Health Care, and Safety and Graphics. Asia Pacific grew nearly 7% organically in the quarter.
China/Hong Kong grew by 11% in Q3, with notable strength in Safety and Graphics and in Health Care, followed by
Electronics and Energy. Organic local currency growth was 5% in Japan, led by Industrial, Health Care, and Consumer.
Organic local currency growth was 4.5% in the United States. Health Care, Industrial, and Safety and Graphics led U.S.
growth in the third quarter. In EMEA, organic local currency sales growth was 4.3%. West Europe was up 3% year on
year, continuing a positive trend. This was our strongest growth in West Europe since the first quarter of 2011. Middle
East/Africa increased double digits, and Central and Eastern Europe also posted good growth in the quarter. Organic
local currency growth was 4% across all developed markets, a positive step-up versus recent quarters and 10% in
developing markets.
Let's turn to slide number 7 for a discussion of the third quarter income statement. Sales rose 5.6% to $7.9 billion,
which is the highest quarterly sales result in 3M's history. We generated $3.8 billion in gross profit, and gross margins
increased 10 basis points year on year to 47.6%. SG&A and R&D investments rose 8% and 6%, respectively.
Operating income increased 3.6% in Q3 to $1.7 billion. GAAP operating margins were 22%, down 40 basis points year
on year. Included in these results was a 40 basis point impact from acquisitions; therefore, underlying margins were
equal to last year's third quarter result. Leverage on organic volume growth added 40 basis points to operating margins
in the third quarter, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices added 1.2 percentage
points.
Strategic investments and one-time actions reduced margins by 80 basis points year on year. This represents
incremental investments in disruptive R&D, our ERP system and restructuring actions. Foreign exchange impacts
reduced margins by 30 basis points, and the combination of the U.S. medical device tax and other factors negatively
impacted margins by 50 basis points year on year.
Third quarter earnings increased 8% to $1.78 per share. Foreign exchange impacts hurt EPS by $0.04 versus the third
quarter of 2012, and a lower tax rate added $0.02. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% year on year, which
added $0.03 to EPS.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Turn to slide number 8. We generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow in the third
quarter. Working capital investments were higher year on year, largely timing related, and we expect that they will
reverse in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $404 million, an increase of $46 million versus last year's third
quarter, and we expect full-year CapEx will be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Free cash flow was $747
million, and we converted 61% of net income for the quarter. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow conversion
will be around 90%. We paid $431 million in cash dividends during the quarter, or $1.3 billion year to date.
If you looked at our balance sheet in today's press release, you would see that the worldwide cash and marketable
securities are $1.6 billion lower today than one year ago. We are managing the business with lower cash levels, the
U.S. in particular, for several reasons. First, the business continues to grow and generate significant cash flow. Second,
rising interest rates are positively impacting our already well-funded pension status. And, finally, our capital structure
remains very strong, which is an important component of our business model, but we do not intend to strengthen it
further.
Gross share repurchases during the quarter were $1.5 billion, and for the reasons cited above, we are increasing our
expected range to $4.5 billion to $5 billion versus a previous range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for the year. And as
Matt mentioned, we'll provide a full planning update at our upcoming Investor Meeting in December, including capital
structure and capital allocation.

Now let's review our third quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to slide number 9. Our
Industrial business had a good third quarter, with sales of $2.7 billion and 6.2% organic local currency growth. The
growth was broad-based, as all operating divisions and all geographies posted positive growth. Our aerospace and
automotive OEM businesses generated double-digit organic local currency growth, and we also saw strong growth in
advanced materials, liquid filtration, automotive aftermarket, and industrial adhesives and tapes.
On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 13% in Latin America/Canada, 8% in EMEA, 6% in the U.S.,
and 3% in Asia Pacific. The Ceradyne acquisition added 4.1% to growth in the quarter. Integration is going very well,
and profits continue to exceed expectations. Nine different 3M divisions have launched development projects that
leverage Ceradyne technology. First-year sales are bit short of plan due to U.S. troop drawdown efforts, but we are
winning new business with customers. In September, for example, we earned an $80 million contract to supply
enhanced combat helmets to the U.S. Marine Corps. Third quarter operating income was $568 million, and reported
margins were 21.3%. Excluding Ceradyne, Industrial operating margins were 22.2%. Margins were also impacted by
negative FX and strategic investments in growth programs and our ERP system.
Please turn to slide number 10. As expected, our Electronics and Energy business rebounded nicely in the third quarter
compared to the first half of the year. Sales were $1.4 billion, up 4% in organic local currency terms, and operating
income rose 3% to $300 million. Margins were 20.7%, up a bit versus last year's third quarter and up 3 percentage
points sequentially. Electronics-related sales increased 4% on an organic local currency basis. Market demand was
stronger year on year, and we were specced into a number of newly introduced electronic devices. Most industry
sources are projecting flat demand for electronics this holiday season. As a result, we are planning conservatively
through year-end. On the Energy side, organic local currency growth was 3%. Electrical markets led the growth,
boosted by record sales of our ACCR overhead power conductor. Communications and renewable energy were both
slightly positive year on year. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 6% in Asia Pacific, 3% in
Latin America/Canada, and just slightly in EMEA. Organic sales declined 1% in the U.S.
Please go to slide 11. We saw growth accelerate in Safety and Graphics in the third quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion, up
8% organically, a significant increase from the 2% in the first half of the year. We generated double-digit organic
growth in personal safety products and in roofing granules. Our Commercial Graphics and Building and Commercial
Service businesses also posted good organic growth in the quarter, and Traffic Safety and Security rose slightly. Sales
in Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic regions, with strong double-digit growth in both Asia
Pacific and Latin America/Canada. The FSTech acquisition added 0.9% to growth in the quarter. Safety and Graphics
generated operating income of $315 million, an increase of 7% versus last year's third quarter. Margins were up slightly
year on year to 21.8%. Excluding FSTech, third quarter 2013 operating margins were 22.1%.
Now let's look at Health Care, found on slide 12. Sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up 7% in organic local
currency terms. As was the case in Industrial, we generated positive organic sales growth in every division and in every
geographic region within Health Care. Organic sales growth was strongest in food safety, health information systems,
oral care, drug delivery, and critical and chronic care. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased
11% in Latin America/Canada, 9% in Asia Pacific, 6% in the U.S., and 5% in EMEA. And across all of the developing
markets, Health Care generated 14% organic sales growth. This was very similar to recent quarters. Operating income
was $426 million, up 7% year on year, and margins rose 40 basis points to 32.1%. Margins were helped this quarter by
a gain on the sale of a small, nonstrategic asset, offset in part by the U.S. medical device tax, the net of which added 1
percentage point of margin. Our Health Care business continues to post strong and consistent sales growth and
excellent profitability. This helped stabilize the more cyclical elements of our portfolio. The business generates
tremendous value for 3M.
Finally, let's review the Consumer business, found on slide number 13. Consumer also posted a strong third quarter,
with sales of $1.2 billion and organic local currency growth of 4%. Operating income was $247 million, up slightly
year on year, and operating margins were 21.5%. Organic sales growth was strongest in our consumer health care,
home care, stationery and office supplies, and DIY businesses. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales
growth was 9% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia Pacific, while EMEA increased just slightly. Organic growth was
3% in the U.S., helped by a good back-to-school season. Developing markets within Consumer grew 10% organically

in the third quarter. Similar to Health Care, the Consumer business is a very steady grower with excellent profitability
and is a stabilizing force within the 3M portfolio.
That concludes our discussion of 3M's detailed third quarter results. I'll now turn the call back over to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I want to highlight our progress on three important strategic levers:
portfolio management, investment in innovation, and business transformation.
First, portfolio management. We continue to strengthen and prioritize our portfolio. The Electronics and Energy
business is a good example of where we are making progress. In the third quarter, we consolidated the Infrastructure
Protection division into the Electrical Markets division, giving this business a lower cost structure, improved market
relevance, and greater international reach. Also, earlier this year, we integrated Tech Systems into the Electronics
Solutions divisions to align these businesses to better serve our customers. There is more portfolio work to be done
here, and we continue to look at other structural opportunities. One of the primary reasons for forming the Electronics
and Energy business was to present a single 3M voice to the electronics industry. Now we are easier to work with and
more relevant to large, fast-moving electronics customers, and I'm happy to report that we are receiving very positive
reaction from customers on all these changes.
Second lever, investment in innovation. Innovation remains the center of our plan, and as I hope you remember, last
quarter we shared some details about how we're investing in long-term disruptive technologies with significant growth
potential. We are now founding 20 new product platforms, several of which are expected to be introduced to the market
in 2014. We're also investing in a new, state-of-the-art laboratory facility at our headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota,
which I announced last year. We broke ground in August, and construction is well under way. This new laboratory will
be an important heart for 3M's global research network.
Finally, the third lever. We continue to make good progress with respect to business transformation and ERP
implementation. We successfully went live in Taiwan, Russia, Indonesia, and Philippines, and in October we went live
in Canada. Next up is our European/Middle East/Africa supply chain center of excellence in Switzerland in November.
Twenty more countries are scheduled for 2014. We expect to achieve benefits in many areas, including supply chain,
working capital management, customer responsiveness, improved business planning, and faster decision-making.
In closing, we delivered a strong third quarter with good, broad-based performance across all businesses. We remain
focused on expanding our business, driving productivity, and executing our plan with strong discipline. I thank you for
your attention, and we will now take your questions and comments.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Inge, I mean, the top line growth is really coming through, and I think that supports what you've
been trying to accomplish. Can you give us a sense of how you think of this quarter as a bit of an anomaly in that
margin – your incremental margins, at least, based on some higher costs, ERP, things like that, that came through –
would you anticipate that going forward you'd show us maybe a little bit better incremental margins? Or is this

something that the cost of the higher growth is going to impact margins for a while until these investments really
normalize?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, on the growth side, I'm pleased. We are pleased with the acceleration
we saw to 5.8% in this quarter versus 2% in the first half of the year. And we need – and I need – to give some credit
here to the 3M team for doing a very good job in order to work very hard to take market share and have very specific
programs in all business relative to competitive conversion. So I think that's an important element as we see the growth
coming here.
And just to describe the growth, in a way, if you think about it, we have had steady growth in Health Care and
Consumer now for several quarters in a row. Very steady; it's working very well. And this quarter you saw Electronics
and Energy turn up, and as I mentioned that in my comments, and David commented on as well. And as we saw growth
rate in industrial-oriented businesses turning up in Q3 versus first half, and that was broad-based. So it was very
interesting to see. It was industrial tape and adhesives, it was abrasives, was the automotive OEM, and it was in
personal care. So it was broad-based, and we saw it very much also in developed economy, which was very good for
us.
So, as you know, in terms of moving forward, our plan is not margin expansion, by definition. So we are committed to
the plan we laid out. I think as you think about the balance of the portfolio, with more growth in our biggest business,
which is Industrial, that had a slightly tougher comparison also versus last year. They had a very good Q3 last year and
had a peak performance in Q2 of last year. I think you have to look upon it, when Industrial also grew, as they did in
developed economy, I think you will see these type of shifts in the mix. But I think as you move ahead, we are
committed to our plan, and overall I'm very pleased that we now are able to see top line growth and maintain margins.
If you think about it, we are delivering 22% bottom line here, 22.4% excluding first-year impact of acquisition. That's a
very strong quarter, and I'm pleased with that.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Makes sense. Just as a follow-on, if you could help us understand, we can see the progress on
the top line. I just want to ask the question in a slightly different way. I mean, if you think about 2012, you finished the
year with about 6% EPS growth. 2013 seems to be tracking around 6% EPS growth. I mean, when you think about the
longer-term focus of 3M, and you've turned around the growth side, and I understand you don't necessarily need to
show a higher margin per se, but is there a chance that you – I mean, can you envision a 3M that can be a double-digit
EPS grower? Or is it really explicit in your model that you're going to be a lower-risk but higher-quality growth
company? I guess I'm trying to figure out how you think about EPS growth as it relates to top line.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. If I could, Scott, this is David Meline. I would say, what you've asked is very much –
our thinking is aligned to what we talked about last year in November, which was we laid out a plan where we had 4%
to 6% annual organic growth, 1.5 times IPI. We think that is certainly something that is reasonable for us to continue to
expect to achieve. You look at it – we said 9% to 11% EPS growth, which is a combination of both top line organic
growth as well as the earnings growth that we would expect to get from other activities of the business. That would
include acquired businesses, which we continue to believe are relevant to our model. That includes the impacts of also
the non-operating items, such as the continuing reduction on share count. We expect pensions to certainly contribute to
our earnings going forward in the future years, and we'll continue to balance. We'll look at where the best opportunities
are.
And, to the point on this quarter, we think certainly at the present time where we can create the most value right now is
to continue to invest towards the long-term health and growth in the business. So, as you point out, we are quite
significantly investing in places like R&D innovation, towards more disruptive technologies; improving our systems,
which is a very important initiative for the company; and taking the opportunity to also, as we see areas where we need
to maybe rebalance and restructure somewhat, which is part of the normal course of our business, we invest to improve
our competitiveness there as well.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the top line, guys. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning, Ajay.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: So the organic growth rate, clearly much better than expectations and much better than what we
are seeing from other industrials in the quarter. So – and that's great. So maybe talk about how much of this
performance is end demand? I know you talked about share gains, market penetration, but maybe a little bit color
between end demand, share gains, and then how much restocking might have contributed to the performance?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, thank you, Ajay, for the question. When we look upon it, I assume you're also
talking a little bit of channel inventory and so forth. First of all, overall, the channel inventory levels appear to be
balanced across businesses and geographical areas. But what we have to be, we have to be watchful relative to the
consumer electronic markets, particularly in the mobile and handheld smartphone segments. So I think that we had a
good lift for that business based on specing on platforms and building for the holiday seasons. So I think you saw a
little bit of inventory build in order to be prepared for that. Now, all external fact that we see is saying that the holiday
season for that segment will basically be flat. So that's one of the reasons why we are very cautious as we go into the
last quarter.
Now, we had a very good – so you're right. We had a very good uptick here, specifically in the industrial-based
businesses, and you have to assume that there is a slight improvement in the segments there. But to be honest, we don't
see any differences versus any of our competitors. So what is happening here, the execution from our team relative to
competitive conversion is working very well. So, overall, I would say that the channel inventory levels appear to be
balanced, only for us to be watchful, which is based on external data relative to the consumer electronics market.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: And that's very helpful. And you're getting really nice pricing, especially in the context that
some industrials are reporting pressure, and I guess that reflects the pricing power of your brands. My question is how
should we think about pricing for you in a benign inflationary environment next several quarters?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. In terms of pricing, Ajay, certainly if you look at the performance in Q3, we were
pretty pleased. We saw price performance was good pretty broadly across the portfolio, with perhaps the exception in
the Electronics business where you, of course, have structural price declines. What I would say in terms of what we see
of course geographically, we do have – most significant price actions are going on in locations where you've either got
weakening currency and/or inflationary pressures as a result. So if you think about Latin America, again we saw
significant price movements. We've also been working in Japan, where they've had obviously a significant devaluation
of their currency as well. And then of course right now, our comps are a little bit easier in the second half on a pricing
basis versus the second half of last year.
So at the end of the day, the issue for us is to continue to offer good refresh products, which give us strength in the
market to be able to command price that reflects the value we're offering to the market. And as we do that, that tends to
provide also a very nice halo effect for the entire portfolio.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you. Very helpful. Nice quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Could you just – maybe just again go little bit more through the cash flow and the fact that
that recovers towards the end of the year but still you're going to end up a little bit lower than you expect? I mean, to
what extent is that still kind of driven by any additional growth?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure, Steve. Yeah. So if you look at cash flow, certainly year to date we're running about the
same level as we did last year, which is I guess 76% year to date versus 75% last year. Obviously it bounces around
some quarter by quarter. And typically, for example, in Q4, we would expect better conversion, which is why we're
expecting 90% for the year. And what I would say is very much the 90% would be reflective of the fact that we are
investing in the business. And at some level, as you get an inflection in demand as we're seeing, that tends to put some
pressure on the working capital cycle. So nothing unusual but just a reflection of seasonality really.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And more inventory and receivables-based or than the CapEx side?
<A - David W. Meline>: Typically, yeah.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay.
<A - David W. Meline>: Typically, inventory and receivables are impacted as you're ramping up towards a higher
level of demand, yeah.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And then on the strategic investments and actions, you talked about the European
implementation and such. How do you see that progressing? Are there any other – when you think about those, are you
qualifying also kind of feet on the street, additional? Or what are some of the other actions that we can kind of get
better sense of how that money's getting invested?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think when we talked about strategic investments here in this section, it was about
investment in disruptive technologies that we talked about earlier. It's about ERP investment and then some
restructuring on some – a couple of places around the world. And if you think about our model – 3M models is we are
basically working on this the whole time. I think one other thing here that we have stepped up is around the disruptive
technologies when we announced in November last year, on November 8, we announced that we have in the plan
moving from 5.5% closer to 6%. So that was a step up. And ERP is, of course, also something that we're investing in
that will very much improve our efficiency and effectiveness and productivity as a company. Restructuring is piece that
we do as we go, right? We typically look into that, and we finance that quarter by quarter, as you very well know, and
that's part of the business model.
In terms of acceleration of growth, and you talked about the feet on the street in terms of commercialization, we have –
as I took office now almost 24 months ago, we made a big effort in terms of marketing excellence and sales excellence
and appointed individuals in order to lead that initiative, type of more centralized, in order to help with tools and so
forth, but execute locally. As we go, we make investment, you saw here when David talked in terms on investment,
both in research and development and in SG&A, we do that but in a careful way. We also have to look upon different
models in terms of commercialization as we move ahead. We have to adapt and make sure we do it in the right way.
But you have to look upon it, every business group, by definition, are working towards their objectives in terms of
margin expansion and growth, and that is where they ask for additional investment. That is in addition to the three
David and I talked about this morning. When that layout is type of normal business procedure and as you grow your
business.
But we feel good now. We've started to see the growth. We have made investment, as you know, in Health Care
specifically. We built out our capabilities in international some time ago, and we continue to see that delivering, which

is very good for us. We take market share, we improve our penetration, and we have good margins in that business. The
same with Consumer. So we look upon it and balance it all together. Those two businesses, Consumer and Health Care,
steady, continuing to move forward, and then we had the three other business groups really ticking up this quarter,
including Safety and Graphics. As you saw, had a very good quarter for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: I just want to follow up on what Scott was asking you. So as I sort of think about the quarter,
you're getting fantastic pricing. The emerging markets, which is high margin, is outgrowing. Health Care margins are
going up, and it's outgrowing. You seem to be making very good progress on Energy and Electronics, and your
framework is top line growth of 4% to 6% and EPS growth to 9% to 11%. But it just seems, in a quarter where sort of
everything has gone right, we still can't get over double-digit EPS growth. And the question I'm asking: What would it
take for you to get over double – what set of circumstances would get you to get over double-digit EPS growth, if we
can't get it in a quarter like this?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so I would say, Andrew, certainly we think, as we look at it quarter by quarter and year
by year, we think it's very reasonable from a planning perspective to expect to deliver our 9% to 11% EPS growth on
the kind of growth that we're laying out here. And at the end of the day in one particular quarter or another, you'll have
more or less impact of whatever it is, the medical device tax, the ERP spending, some restructuring acquisition. So I
don't view this as something that causes me to think that we don't have the ability to deliver on our plan, quite honestly.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Okay, so just a follow-up question. You sort of addressed the gross buyback, but what is the
change in net buyback for the year?
<A - David W. Meline>: We would expect at $4.5 billion to $5 billion that our net would be around $3 billion to $3.5
billion for the year.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And the previous was? Sorry.
<A - David W. Meline>: The previous would have been about $1.5 billion less than the gross, so that would have
been, what, $2 billion to $3 billion.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Oh, so it's not options, it's all going to net buyback?
<A - David W. Meline>: The increase that I'm talking about today would largely be reflected also in the net.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Well, thank you very much.
<A - David W. Meline>: So the gross increase – pardon me?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yeah, our outlook on the redemption side has not changed, so the whole change would go to
net.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey, on the Industrial side, that was one of the few businesses that showed operating margin
down year over year, and you showed nice organic revenue growth in the quarter. Was the margin hit mostly from
Ceradyne, or were there any other items that would have created that pressure?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure, Deane. So just to frame the performance in Industrial, first of all, we were quite pleased
with the way the growth inflected up for us to 6% in the quarter. And if you look at that, first of all, it was a
combination. It was both developing markets, which grew 7%, and we saw quite a strong improvement in our
developed markets, where we grew 6% in Industrial. So point number one.
Point number two is, if you look at last year, we were at a 23% margin. So it was certainly an exceptional quarter we're
comparing to last year. If you look at our core operating margin in the quarter, we were a little over 22% excluding
Ceradyne. And the other impacts that brought us from that 22% down to the reported 21% were basically the same ones
we talked about elsewhere. So the impact on Industrial's margins of the disruptive R&D technology investments,
because those get spread through the businesses; the impact on their business of the ERP investment, which is about 30
basis points; FX impacted them negatively.
And then one thing we haven't talked about today, but it's impacting across the enterprise this quarter, is we've ramped
up now. We're in the process of putting in place – well, Inge mentioned it – our new European supply chain activity.
And so that's having some impact on us here in the third quarter, as we ramp that up and get ready to go ahead and go
live.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. And then, Inge, I was really interested in hearing that this promise that you made a
while ago when you closed on Ceradyne, you were very excited about how many different divisions across 3M
leveraged ceramics, and here we are seeing – I think you said nine divisions -
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Correct.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: – will be launching products that leverage Ceradyne in some way.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Right.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: So just give us a sense of where are those products? Will those be 2014 events? Are there more
to come? Because there are certainly more divisions that leverage ceramics at 3M and potentially for that technology.
But just provide us more color there would be helpful.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think from a business group perspective, you will see it mostly in the Industrial space,
but you will also see it in some businesses in Health Care in the orthodontic piece. We say now that there is nine that
are ready to commercialize. If you recall my – on our call last time, I talked about 13 to 15 divisions that are looking
into it, and they are continuing to look, and it's actually expanding. So the answer to your question, more to come, yes,
more to come.
In terms of the nine that we called here today, they will roll out different type of activities during 2014. So when we
look upon that acquisition in total, we are very pleased. First of all, the integration is fully completed now – so we're

pleased to report that – fully integrated to 3M. And, as you have seen now, we have taken a couple of sizable orders.
We announced last quarter an order around $40 million U.S. and, as David talked, we got another one this quarter of
$80 million that will start to be delivered next year. We will not deliver that this year. So we got the order, we are now
qualifying it, and it will roll out next year.
So I think – and on the bottom line, as David said, we're meeting and exceeding our blue book on bottom line. So in
terms of both get something in the front end around $400 million U.S. and then get technology in the back office that
we can leverage. It's a fantastic thing for us.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Yeah. Just to put an exclamation point on that, I know there've been a lot of skeptics at the
time of Ceradyne's closing that some of the military orders were in jeopardy. And since then, that looks as though that
was not the case, and that $80 million order here came through. Are there others like that?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, you can say it's actually $120 million, because we had $40 million last quarter, $80
million this quarter. So that's $120 million. And that is one of the segments for that business. So I cannot comment on
orders that we are negotiating that is not finalized. But we are very encouraged at what we see.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Could you give a little bit more detail on two end markets? With the
Electronics growth you're seeing, can you parse how much of what you're seeing is because of your own pivots or share
gains as opposed to the health of the underlying market? And then in the Safety and Graphics architectural coatings,
can you talk a little bit about sequential trends that you're seeing there?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all on the Electronics and Energy, the Electronics piece grew 4% for us, and the
Energy piece grew 3%. And in the Energy segment, it's due to the ACCR that David talked about, that's clearly we're
taking market share. So we are now taking quite a number of orders, and very much back in West Europe, which is
encouraging for us. As you probably recall when we talked earlier, that's a relatively long – I would say not relatively
long, it's a long sales cycle for that product. And that's now start to be qualified, speced in, et cetera. So we see orders
coming in many countries in West Europe specifically as they're interacting with us. So I think in that piece, you can
clearly say that we are taking market share in the Energy piece of the segment.
On Electronics, I will say for us, as you know, we will be speccing on platforms, and we are, and that's one of the
uptick we see. And then I would say generally speaking in that segment, we have a strong position. We have always
had a strong position, and what is working well for us is that we are both able to provide technologies that will enhance
those products for our customers, enable to drive down cost as fast as possible. In terms of real market share data there,
I think that will be more a result of how the sales tool will come in the end of the day, because as I said, take it very
easy now as we go into Q4 and make sure that we sell through in the channels.
On Safety and Graphics, what was your question there relative to?
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Just the weakness you cited on architectural construction markets. If you could maybe
talk a little bit about what you're seeing sequentially.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: And I guess, and then again, if you can parse your own performance like to the degree
think you might be losing share? Or if you think you're gaining share relative to the market.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. No, first of all, that is a relatively small business for us. We started that a couple of years
ago. The base for that business was actually Japan from the beginning. Japan have done very well building out that
business, and we took the Japanese model and adjusted it and tried to build it out first and foremost in United States
and also in some selected places in West Europe, with Italy being the center of it relative to design. So I would say that
when I look upon that, it's not a losing market share. I think it's temporarily a shift in the marketplace and so forth. It's
not a concern generally speaking that business was in terms of we are losing market share.
<A - David W. Meline>: No. More project-based, so [indiscernible] (52:29).
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. It's a project-based business. You will see a little bit of that going in and out of quarters.
But we are doing very well there with some of our films that is coming out from our film technology laboratories, and
we're doing very well in lighting generally speaking. So look upon it more as project based, can go up and down a little
bit. The business is relatively small for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Inge, could you maybe just give a little more flavor on these 20 new product
platforms you're funding in terms of these disruptive technologies? Kind of general areas you're talking about and
maybe the rough size of the opportunity you see?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. I can. I will not talk about all 20, but I can talk just to give you a flavor of what we're
doing there. So you have to go back to the background. This is based on that we step up investment in research and
development from historically 5.2% to 5.5% closer to 6%, and that those monies should go into the – what we call
Class 5, more disruptive technologies. And I say couple of products and I would just talk about them that this may be
closer for us because there is a couple of them that are in the first stage, very close to the first stage development of
completion, and that will be rolled out in 2014, maybe in the middle of the year to later in the year. But we are
encouraged around them.
And I say couple of them. You know, barrier film for building constructions is one that is based on something where
we believe we should be able to capitalize on some growth relatively fast. There is a protective film for electronics and
appliances, which is very encouraging, that can be used for OEMs that are into appliance and electronics. There is light
management constructions that are both into residential and commercial, and that's very – so if you think about those
three are all coming out from our film technology platforms. The Smart Grid sensored cables that we believe will be
something we should be able to commercialize fast and effectively, and West Europe is a target for that specifically.
And then we have the Quantum Dot Enhancement Film that is just on the way to be rolled out.
So if you look upon it, you can see it's much around our base in technologies. From platform perspective, it's going into
businesses that are everything from Electronic and Energy to the Safety and Graphics and Industrial businesses. So you
will hear more about them as we go, but they start to be real. And at least for me and for us, to see, as you saw, it's type
of five platforms that start to come to life and that we believe that we should be able to roll out during 2014 is very
encouraging. So we're very pleased the way the organization took this initiative to heart, moved it forward, and we are
focused a lot and make sure we give the bigger program more resources and type of some of them, that was good
initiatives and maybe dreams that you always should have. We maybe reprioritize them.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And, David, if I could take one more crack at this kind of EPS thing.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Putting the quarter-to-quarter variability and things aside, I mean, the high end of the
organic range now for this year is 4%, which should probably, in your framework, at least, flip to 9% EPS growth, and
it's not this year in the guidance. So is there – I mean, you're getting a little hit from FX; is that it? Or is there anything
else this year that's not converting, making the 4% equal 9%, that would in the broader framework?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So if you look at over a long period of time, acquisitions we have, certainly top line
contribution, we're not seeing a significant at the moment bottom line this year. Pension, we had a contribution this
year, we had about $100 million, so that's contributing. Tax, I think, is pretty much carryover year over year, and that's
a contributor. If you recall, in our five-year bridge, we've got a couple points of tax, so that would be something that's
not present in the current calendar year. And then the last one would be we're – frankly, we are investing quite heavily
in the front end, for example, with this R&D innovation initiative, which should contribute in the future, so it's kind of
pay now in terms of long-term investment with future results. Same is true with the ERP system.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: So 2013 is sort of a heavier-loaded investment year. I mean, would that be the main
difference?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Correct.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So just following up there on Shannon's question, moving from 2013 to 2014, it seems like
you have had a lot more of a heavier year this year, both on the ERP spending, the R&D spending. Talk us through
maybe some offsets into next year, or is it possible if we do get an acceleration and start to see 5% to 6% growth, that
the incremental margins on the business will get a lot better and so there'll be better pull-through in 2014 versus 2013?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So if you look at 2014, obviously, we'll come out with that here in December. But if I
kind of frame how we're thinking about 2014, I would start, which is, we certainly are constructive on the overall
macroeconomy. We think we will see some improvement in both industrial production and GDP, although we think the
improvement's going to be slow. But directionally, we are encouraged. We will continue to invest in 2014, so the
investment, if you look at, we talked about going to 6% on R&D. We're on that path and incrementally that we'll invest
more next year in R&D. Same with ERP. That will be likely our peak year of investment in the ERP system, and so
that'll be part of the plan next year.
We do expect – in terms of the things that are in view, we do expect pensions now to be certainly $100 million or more
of expense benefit next year. And then, finally, based on what we've been doing with the reducing the share count
through the year, you can expect that'll be additive to EPS again next year as well. So I would say we feel quite good

about the momentum that we have right now going into 2014, and we'll be able to share more detail here in December.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: That's a helpful bridge, David. Just clarification on the incremental spending on ERP, I think
I had it at roughly $50 million incremental next year. Am I ballpark or you guys have a better sense?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. That's still in the right ballpark.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. And then one last question on growth for 4Q, just implicit in your 4Q guidance.
I'm just curious, from a year-on-year perspective, you had really nice growth organically this quarter at 5.8%. Does
your guidance essentially imply that there will be a step down sequentially on a year-on-year growth perspective, just
given some of the commentary that you've had on the Electronics business?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, if you look upon the 3% to 4% for the year, that implies roughly 2% to 6% in the
last quarter, which is in line what we have done for the year. So I think the way we look upon it, we are very focused
now to make sure we end the year strong here. And I think the business that we're just cautious, as you call out yourself
based on what I've talked about, is the Electronic and Energy as we move ahead. Talking about that business, you think
about it, generally speaking for us, you think about the margins for that, we have gone now through a couple of
quarters. We went 15.3% in Q1 to 17.7% in Q2 and 20.7% in Q3. So constant improvement on the margins. And we
have said from the beginning of the year that we will deliver high teens for the year for that business, and that's what
we believe we will do.
So I think that Q4 will be a little bit more of a challenge for that business. But very pleased with the progress, both in
terms of growth and the way they have been driving productivity in the underlying operation and taking the portfolio
management to heart and really improving that business.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Thanks, Inge. Thanks, David.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: On the Health Care gain that you guys had, in the total company bridge, where is that
discounted? Is that under organic volume or the med device tax/other line?
<A - David W. Meline>: That would be in med device/other.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. That's in there. And then on Ceradyne, it was a little bit more of a headwind to margin. It
looks like it was kind of breakeven this quarter relative to – I think it was mid-single digit margins last quarter. Is that
seasonality? Or further acquisition charges? Or investment? What's going on there?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. It's a combination, Steve. So, one, the booking of orders tends not to be – there's some
lumpiness in terms of those projects. So we had a pop-up in Q2, which was a little bit less in Q3 now. And then,
secondly, there's been quite some integration activity, which has impacted expenses here in the quarter. So that also is
part of what contributed there.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then just one last question. For the year, the margin, you guys have given sales
guidance I guess just to kind of baseline people on the fourth quarter. What's kind of a good range for the total

operating margin for the fourth quarter, or just for the full year?
<A - David W. Meline>: For the full year. We -
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: For the total company.

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Good morning, and thanks for going long here.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Nigel.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, so, Inge, you talked about the pickup in investment for some of the Class 5 initiatives, yet
R&D has been pretty flat year to date, about 5.4%. So I'm wondering if you're getting better base productivity within
R&D, and do you still see 6% as the true long-term target?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: You said the 6%?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, it's clear for me that we start to see more productivity out of the
laboratories. And I'm pleased to see that. To get both investment in R&D and productivity on the same chart is fantastic
when you do that at 3M. And we start to see that. And we're just ending up our strategic planning cycles here. And I
can tell you when I looked upon every business group, when I looked upon international and I look upon the total
company line up and investment and productivity target for research and development, I was very pleased, right? So
there is more effort on that. So the answer to your first question is yes.
Is 6% right as we go? I'm not changing that at this point in time. I think it's important – we're staying the course relative
to making investments relative to research and development because I believe and we believe and it's the DNA of the –
that is the heartbeat of 3M. That is where we really make a difference as we move ahead. But, again, we are very
focused on making sure we get productivity out from every programs that we put in place. But we're not changing the
target for the plan. Productivity is improving, and so overall we feel good about it.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then switching to David. Obviously the free cash conversion has been
depressed by CapEx running well ahead of tangible D&A. And I'm just wondering, given the ambition to raise CapEx
to $2.1 billion over the five-year plan, when do we start to see tangible depreciation stepping up? And we've had a lot
of questions about the 10% plus EPS growth, and I'm just wondering to what extent that step-up in tangible is a
headwind to your EPS growth over the next five years.
<A - David W. Meline>: Tangible. You're saying a step up in depreciation? Is that the point?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, as depreciation catches up with CapEx.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. We don't see – I don't foresee a significant step up in depreciation if you measure it as
a percent of revenue. So we expect to be pretty steady in terms of CapEx percent of revenue. If you look at – assume
the profile of the CapEx is not dissimilar to the past, that would imply that depreciation would track with revenue

growth. So I don't have that pegged as a headwind in the business. And, if anything, we're expecting with the
completion of both the globalization of our capacity, and secondly as we get in place this ERP system and get better
visibility on data, we think we'll have a chance to run our supply chains more efficiently.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
