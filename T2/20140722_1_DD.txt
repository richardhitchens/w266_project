MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the DuPont conference call. My name is John, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all
participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this
conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl, you may begin.
Carl J. Lukach
Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's second quarter 2014 performance
conference call. Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO;
and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President responsible for our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments. The slides
for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website, along with our news
release.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide two for
our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements
provided with our earnings news release and today's slides posted on our website.

For today's agenda, Nick will review our second quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. I'll provide a brief
business segment highlights, and Jim will provide insights into agriculture markets. We'll conclude with Ellen's
comments, followed by your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Carl. Turning now to slide three, we have the highlights for our second quarter. The quarter played out
about as we expected in our June 26 pre-announcement, with operating earnings per share of $1.17, 9% lower than the
prior year.
Let's turn now to slide four. I'll cover the results for our reporting segments. We ended the second quarter was solid
momentum in our industrial-facing businesses and delivered strong earnings growth in many segments. We did,
however, experience lower operating earnings in our Agricultural segment, primarily due to lower volume in corn
seeds. Jim will talk about this in greater detail in a few minutes.
We delivered exceptional quarterly results in our Nutrition & Health, Safety & Protection, and Industrial Bioscience
segments. Volume gains and margin improvement across these businesses delivered substantial operating earnings
improvements, and each of these segments improved their operating earnings margins 300 to 400 basis points in the
quarter.
In our Performance Materials segment, sales were up in our performance polymers business, reflecting strength in auto
markets. However, this did not overcome the expected lower revenues in packaging and industrial polymers, due
primarily to the planned maintenance shutdown at our Orange, Texas ethylene unit. This six-year turnaround went
mostly as planned, and the unit is now operating at capacity. The duration of the scheduled outage was 58 days, nearly
two-thirds of the quarter.
In Performance Chemicals, lower prices for refrigerants resulted in lower segment operating earnings in the quarter,
and in Agriculture, the earnings were lower due to lower corn seed volumes, impacted by shifts in planting area and
higher seed inventory write-downs versus the prior year. Year-on-year variance in currency rates had a negligible
impact in our segment results for this quarter. We therefore are revising our previous estimate of $0.08 per share
headwind for the year to about $0.04.
Turning now to slide five, from a regional perspective, developing Asia volumes were up 8%, led by China, where
most businesses realized volume improvements during the quarter. The volume increases were partially offset by
currency and price. Developed EMEA benefited from solid demand in autos, construction, and a favorable currency.
Sales declines in the U.S. and Canada and developing EMEA were driven by the lower Ag results.
Additionally, the Orange, Texas ethylene shutdown for Performance Materials negatively impacted sales in the U.S.
and Canada, as expected. Sales in Latin America declined, reflecting weaker industrial production compared to the
prior year.
Turning now to slide six, I'll cover some additional variances in our operating earnings per share. You see that the
largest variance on this slide is from exchange gains and losses, or EG&L, attributable to our currency hedging
program. Through this program, we aim to protect the U.S. dollar value of our net monetary assets around the world
from the effects of short-term swings in currency rates. Normally, the program costs us about $0.03 per share per
quarter. In the second quarter of 2014, however, we experienced increased currency rate volatility and higher costs,
principally in emerging markets.
In addition, we had a currency devaluation in the Ukraine, which along with the cost of the program, drove our actual
net result to a $54 million loss. By comparison, in the second quarter last year, we had several favorable currency
settlements and other adjustments that resulted in an EG&L net gain of $19 million. Year-over-year, we swung from a
$19 million net gain to a $54 million net loss; hence the $0.08 negative variance you see on the slide.

Turning to slide seven, our free cash flow for the first half of 2014 compared to 2013 has improved by about $600
million. This is due primarily to the absence of tax payments related to the sale of Performance Coatings, which
occurred in the first half of 2013. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate strong seasonal cash flow in the fourth
quarter. Net debt at June 30 reflects our normal seasonal flows, and is up slightly from the prior year.
As we indicated in April, we started an ASR program in the first quarter and completed it in the second quarter.
Coupled with open-market share purchases, we have retired nearly 17 million shares in total this year. As of June 30,
we are more than halfway towards our commitment to repurchase $2 billion in shares during 2014, and we intend to
complete the remainder in the second half of the year. As we've said, share repurchases are one way to return value to
our shareholders, and we use them to complement our strong dividends.
As we noted in our release this morning, our board authorized a $0.02 or 4% increase in our quarterly dividend to be
paid to common shareholders of record on August 15, 2014 in September of 2014. As a result, the third quarter
dividend will be $0.47 per share. This is the third dividend increase in 27 months. In total, we have returned nearly $12
billion to our shareholders since 2009 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Moving now to slide eight, I'll just reiterate that our redesign initiatives are underway and will begin to deliver benefits
this year. Ellen will go into more details on these initiatives. Additionally, as we said in late June, we're still on track
for our Performance Chemicals separation in mid-2015, and our plans are moving ahead there. We currently expect to
file SEC Form 10 in December of this year.
Today, we are reaffirming our updated full-year operating earnings per share outlook of $4.00 to $4.10 per share. We
anticipate a strong second half based on continued growth in global industrial demand, resulting in operating earnings
per share of $1.25 to $1.35. While the seasonal cutoffs in our Ag business are sometimes difficult to size between the
third and fourth quarter, we currently anticipate about 40% of our second-half earnings will occur in the third quarter.
On that note, let me turn it over to Carl. Carl?
Carl J. Lukach
I'd now like to provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, our slides, with complete segment commentary, are
posted on the Investor Center website under Events & Presentations, along with the other materials for today's call.
Nutrition & Health, on slide nine, recorded a strong second quarter, building on momentum established in the third
quarter of 2013. Sales were 7% higher, primarily due to broad-based volume growth, aided by improved product mix.
We saw a strong recovery in enablers and sustained momentum for probiotics and cultures. Volumes grew in all
regions, and we continued to grow in emerging markets.
Operating earnings of $105 million increased 72% from higher sales, lower raw material costs, productivity gains, and
the absence of one-time costs in the prior year. Operating margins for the quarter improved by over 400 basis points.
This was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement.
In the third quarter, we expect modest sales growth, with continued broad-based volume gains. Operating earnings are
expected to be significantly higher due to increased sales, mix enrichment, and continuing productivity actions. We will
continue to make strategic investments in research application development, and customer-facing resources to drive
future growth. Operating margins are expected to continue the trend of year-over-year improvement.
In Industrial Biosciences, on slide 10, we continued to deliver strong results. Operating earnings of $59 million were up
37%, primarily driven by mix enrichment, improved margins associated with new products, and volumes in
bio-refineries and bioactives. Favorable ethanol industry fundamentals are driving increased enzyme demand, as
ethanol margins are attractive and production is near capacity.
Enzyme volumes in the grain ethanol market are also being driven by the rollout of DuPont's Total Performance
System, TPS, using novel enzymes and other functional bioproducts designed to increase customer earnings through

increased production rates, yield, and efficiency. Since introduction in late 2013, TPS has been adopted across a diverse
set of ethanol production plants, and further adoptions are planned. We are implementing TPS as our standard offering
for the industry, with next-generation versions already in preparation for launch.
Bioactive sales in the quarter were also higher on strong demand for Axtra PHY in animal nutrition markets and strong
enzyme demand. For the third quarter, we expect modest sales growth, aided by continued enzyme demand for ethanol
production, and stronger sales of Sorona polymer. Third quarter operating earnings are expected to be up substantially,
driven primarily by higher volumes and improved margins. For the first half, segment operating earnings were up 37%,
and operating margins were up 440 basis points from the prior year.
When we created the Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences segments through the Danisco acquisition, we
envisioned future top-line growth coupled with cost productivity, and we are delivering. The research and development
and capital investments we made following the acquisition in key enzyme spaces and in probiotics capacity are yielding
dividends now, and we have additional growth runway in front of us.
In Safety & Protection, on slide 11, sales were up 1% on higher volumes in industrial markets. Improved Nomex and
Kevlar demand was partially offset by lower revenues from clean technologies offerings, as fewer sulfuric acid
recovery plants were built. Kevlar demand growth was driven by increased sales into law enforcement, transportation,
and wire and cable sectors, while Nomex demand improved in energy solutions and thermal industrial applications.
Regionally, sales volume growth was most notable in Europe and Asia-Pacific, partially offset by lower prices.
Second quarter operating earnings increased 22%, and operating earnings margins increased over 300 basis points.
Segment operating earnings are benefiting from improved margins, increased demand from industrial markets, and
continued benefits from cost productivity initiatives, coupled with improved plant operating results. For the third
quarter, we anticipate segment operating earnings will be up about 20%, driven by higher margins and sustained
operational productivity.
In Electronics & Communications, on slide 12, sales were essentially flat, excluding the impact of lower metal price
pass-through. Volume growth in most product lines, led by gains in consumer electronics, was offset by lower price
due to metals, product mix, and competitive pressures. Operating earnings declined $6 million, as volume growth and
productivity gains were more than offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED licensing income realized during the
second quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of last year's licensing income, operating earnings increased 19%.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we continue to expect global photovoltaic module installations to be up for the year,
with mid-teen growth rates. We expect a strong second half in photovoltaics, driven by installations in China and good
demand for our products in consumer electronics markets. Third quarter sales are expected to be slightly higher, with
operating earnings slightly lower due to a decrease in other income.
In Performance Materials, on slide 13, we had another solid quarter. Volume for engineering polymers grew 6%, fueled
by strong automotive demand in China, Europe, and North America. Sales of our high-performance engineered parts
were up 10% due to improved demand in electronics, oil and gas, and aerospace. And in consumer, construction, and
food packaging markets, our specialty resins volumes were stable. As expected, sales and earnings were below last year
due to our scheduled ethylene outage and the sale of GLS/Vinyls, but the fundamentals driving our sustained business
results remained intact.
Operationally, we are well-positioned for a strong second half following the successful restart of our ethylene unit. In
the third quarter, we anticipate sales revenue will be essentially flat versus the prior year, as continued volume growth
in performance polymers is offset by the impact of portfolio changes. Despite a prior-year $30 million benefit from a
joint venture, we expect operating earnings will still be up modestly due to improved demand and strong execution.
In Performance Chemicals, on slide 14, segment sales were down 8% due to a portfolio change and lower prices.
Slightly higher TiO2 volumes were more than offset by lower volumes in Chemicals & Fluoroproducts. Second quarter
refrigerant prices for mobile and stationary applications were lower than expected, and TiO2 prices were flat
sequentially but down about 3% on a year-over-year basis. In refrigerants, demand for Opteon YF, our new low-GWP
[global warning potential] refrigerant for mobile air conditioning, continues to grow. In 2014, we anticipate sales will

double to reach approximately $100 million as automotive OEMs increase their rate of adoption of this new product.
In TiO2, volumes were up slightly from the prior year, marking six consecutive quarters of year-over-year volume
growth. We believe our customer inventories are normal and producer levels remain essentially unchanged. For the
third quarter, we expect Performance Chemicals operating earnings will be up moderately on improved volumes and
margins.
In Agriculture, on slide 15, second quarter results finished in line with the update we provided in late June.
Supply-driven impacts on commodity prices led to reductions in corn planted area in the North America and Brazil
safrinha seasons. Second quarter sales were essentially flat, as higher seed prices and higher insecticide and soybean
seed volumes were offset by lower corn seed and in herbicide volumes. Operating earnings for the quarter were 11%
lower, as higher seed prices and lower seed input costs were more than offset by lower overall volumes and higher seed
inventory write-downs.
As we turn to the second half, we expect sales to be modestly higher, with operating earnings substantially higher, for
the Agriculture segment. Rynaxypyr is expected to continue to drive growth in insect control, aided by new launches of
Cyazypyr and Lumigen seed treatments, including Dermacor for use on soybeans in Brazil. In Seeds, we expect lower
corn sales in Brazil's summer season, as growers continue to shift hectares from corn to soybeans.
Corn seed price in Brazil is expected to be modestly lower, reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance to the
Herculex I trait. Herculex, combined with leading Pioneer germplasm, continues to offer control of a broad spectrum of
pests. We also expect early seed shipments for the 2015 Brazil safrinha and Northern Hemisphere seasons to be similar
to the prior year.
While the cutoff between third quarter and fourth quarter sales comes at an important time in the Latin American
season, we expect the third quarter to result in a similar loss to last year, followed by a stronger fourth quarter. In
addition, the third quarter comparison will be impacted by the absence of a $26 million equity re-measurement gain
from the acquisition of Pannar, which was recorded in the prior year.
That concludes our segment commentary. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will add additional perspective on
Agriculture. Jim?
James C. Borel
Thanks, Carl. This morning, I'd like to provide some perspective on the environment we're currently seeing in
Agriculture and our expectations for the future. We understand the importance of timely communication with investors
and continue to improve our forecasting as we navigate today's dynamic agricultural markets.
Today, agriculture globally is in a period of transition following recent supply-driven peaks in crop commodity prices
and planted area following the droughts of 2011 and 2012. As stocks have begun to rebuild, we have seen prices
decline for key commodities like corn, soybeans, and wheat. On the demand side, we see encouraging signs, as ethanol
and livestock demand are recovering after declines driven by high feedstock costs.
While total planted area in the U.S. and globally remain near historical peaks, we're currently experiencing a shift in
crop choice from corn to soybeans. This shift began last summer in Latin America and continued through Brazil's
second season and this spring's planting season in the Northern Hemisphere, as global corn supplies have been rebuilt
more quickly than in soybeans, and we expect this bias towards soybeans to continue in Latin America this summer.
At the same time, we're transitioning our soybean seed product line in North America over the next few years as we
introduce new T Series genetics and varieties containing the Roundup Ready 2 trait and we are building an emerging
soybean business in Brazil. This contributed to lower seed sales in our Agriculture segment in 2014, as additional
soybean volumes did not fully reflect the shift in acres.
While the robust environment of the past few years has been supportive of our growth, our Seed and Crop Protection
businesses have also executed well. From 2008 to 2013, we grew sales in our Agriculture segment 12% on average per

year, well above our long-term trend-line growth target and higher than the competition.
During that timeframe, we grew North America corn share by about seven points and soybean share by about 10 points;
launched several innovative new technologies, including Rynaxypyr, AQUAmax, and AcreMax; and grew in key
growth markets including Brazil, Eastern Europe, India, and China. We improved operating margins by about 600 basis
points, while making investments in R&D, supply chain, and our go-to-market strategy, and we continue to sharpen our
investment focus. These past and future investments position us well for continued growth.
Despite the normal year-to-year ebbs and flows in grain ending stocks, planted area, and local product performance, our
ability to continue to innovate will be the force that drives our growth over the long term. Our pipeline in Agriculture is
as strong as I've seen it in my 36 years at DuPont. We have continued our growth in Crop Protection in the first half of
this year and have additional runway for Rynaxypyr, Cyazypyr, penthiopyrad, and picoxystrobin across a broad range
of crops and markets.
And we are extending the application of these technologies with Lumigen seed treatments. In the second quarter, we
recorded our first sales of Dermacor, bringing growers in Brazil an important new seed treatment tool to manage
resistance and control insects in soybeans. In corn seed, we are expanding our current AQUAmax and insect control
offerings in North America, and expect to launch DP 4114 within the next few years, pending regulatory approvals.
I'm also pleased with the progress we're making in Decision Services, our newest service. Encirca Yield Nitrogen
Management is now available to growers across the U.S., expanding on a successful pilot program. In 2015, we expect
to launch Optimum Leptra in introductory volumes in Brazil, pending regulatory approvals. Leptra will offer three
modes of action to help farmers manage a broad spectrum of insects.
And we continue to develop and advance new high-yielding genetics around the world. As we make the product
transition in soybeans, the Pioneer brand remains the leading soybean brand in North America. I'm pleased by what I
see in customer fields this summer and in our pipeline, with T Series genetics and new varieties with the Roundup
Ready 2 Yield trait.
As we begin to look forward to the 2015 and 2016 seasons, we're keeping a close eye on agricultural markets. The
USDA estimates corn yield will be a new record. And as we near the end of the key pollination period for corn, the
crop overall is in good health. Another strong harvest in North America, if realized, will continue to pressure overall
economics for corn and soybean farmers. We're closely watching the development of the corn and soybean crops and
the impact on commodity prices, planted area, cropping intentions, and grower sentiment.
If the current supply dynamics persist and corn planted area remains under pressure, it will temper short-term growth
rates for the Agriculture segment, particularly in our Seed business. However, I'm confident the fundamentals for our
long-term sustainable demand growth remain intact, influenced by trends in population, rising incomes, and desire for
improved diets. We remain committed to continued investment in Agriculture. I'm also confident in the
competitiveness of our Seed and Crop Protection businesses and in our ability to achieve our long-term sales growth
and operating margin targets in Agriculture.
Now let me turn it over to Ellen for her closing thoughts.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Nick, Carl, and Jim highlighted our segment quarterly
performance, so let me focus on our key second-half and long-term strategic objectives which are central to the
significant transition we're driving to become the Next Generation DuPont, a company with a focused and robust
portfolio centered on high-potential commercial opportunities where DuPont science and technology can create
step-change solutions and deliver significant value to customers and shareholders.
As you know, we've been solidly on this path since 2009, and we've been taking large steps forward to transform
DuPont. We sold our coatings business last year and have pruned several non-strategic businesses from our portfolio,

all in line with our plan to create a higher-value company for our shareholders.
Last October, we also announced our decision to separate our Performance Chemicals segment. Multiple work streams
are completing this significant work to establish legal entities around the world, to carve out financials, and to develop
and install standalone IT systems. Most importantly, we're finalizing the right organizational and leadership teams to
ensure we maintain and build upon the premier global positions we've developed in both Titanium Dioxide and
Chemicals & Fluoroproducts markets.
Overall, we remain on schedule for a mid-2015 separation, which will create two industry-leading companies with
distinct value-creation strategies. For DuPont, the separation is a catalyst that will further unlock the value of our
strategy to build and strengthen world-leading positions in agriculture and nutrition, bio-based industrials, and
advanced materials by further leveraging our integrated science capability on a simplified, leaner operating model.
Less than four weeks ago, we also highlighted the broad related redesign of the company's operating structure. This
work will align our operating model with the company's more focused post-spin portfolio and deliver significant
improvement in the way we work, yielding better return on invested capital, speed in decision-making, improved
service to customers, to name a few of the planned outcomes.
Businesses are leveraging this work stream to drive changes that improve their competitiveness as well. This reset of
the operating model is a central plank of our transformation, ensuring that the DuPont of 2015 and beyond delivers
further growth and value, with a simplified, streamlined support structure and a smaller cost base.
There's no doubt that, following the Performance Chemicals separation, DuPont will be a different company in many
ways, and we are taking the key steps forward now to be ready. We've transitioned from the planning phase to the
execution phase of our redesign, and now expect to deliver initial benefits starting in the second half of this year. As
I've said previously, we believe that as we implement these changes, we will identify further savings opportunities, and
we expect to incur future charges under this initiative.
As a reminder, the redesign scope we have defined to date is expected to generate savings in core DuPont of about
$625 million, and we forecast the elimination of an additional $375 million of cost to be realized at the time of the
Performance Chemicals separation in mid-2015. In total, we expect to achieve about two-thirds of the $1 billion annual
savings on a run rate basis by the end of 2015, with the remainder by 2019, all from a 2013 baseline.
It's important to note that this program is distinct and separate from past productivity initiatives. Our current redesign
initiative is broader than just our global supply chain. It's centered on optimizing our corporate business and asset
infrastructure. While the redesign certainly includes removing residual costs associated with the separation of
Performance Chemicals, the scope is far more expansive. All business segments and functions are included.
For example, we've identified opportunities to streamline our asset base in multiple segments without reducing our
capacity to meet end-use demand. We're taking advantage of opportunities to consolidate production capacity into
fewer sites or through the use of tollers to maintain our service and growth capabilities while reducing costs. We're
realigning and rationalizing staffing in many corporate functions to take advantage of centering opportunities that
create greater leverage while enhancing productivity.
In our manufacturing operations, we're focused on reducing plant overheads and fixed costs to enhance our
competitiveness throughout our global footprint. These are just some of the steps we are implementing in the redesign
to generate savings and enhance our productivity. Bottom line, we will be a stronger, more agile growth-enabled
company as result of this initiative.
We're capturing value from Danisco and continuing to look for more acquisition opportunities aligned with our
strategic priorities. As we look ahead to the separation of our Performance Chemicals segment and its impact on our
balance sheet, we are actively engaged in evaluating acquisition ideas that would augment our organic growth plans.
These programs, in concert with sound execution plans, make me confident we'll deliver on our second-half
commitments in the short term and position DuPont for higher growth in the long term. We will reduce complexity and
improve our speed and agility as we advance our strategy and become the new DuPont, a higher-growth higher-value

And you're already taking a good cut at it here, separating technology intensive from non-technology intensive. What
other dimensions can we think about simplification on?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, I think, John, we've taken tremendous steps, a very large steps towards the new
DuPont with the separation of the Coatings business, the separation of the Performance Chemicals business, and then
with that, really taking a look at all aspects of the support to our businesses. Our line is our businesses. That's how we
create value, both top-line and bottom-line. All the rest of us are here from a governance standpoint, risk management,
or to support them. So the operating model really hasn't been recast in a while. And so we're basically questioning and
understanding every part of it and how it supports the company that DuPont will be post-spin.
And so it's simplification of decision-making, it's clarity on those rights and accountability, and it's all to drive the
top-line growth, the innovation pipeline that's going to deliver in the marketplace. We've made a lot of steps in the
individual businesses. You see the performance in N&H and IB and S&P, and I think it's a continuation on that. So
we're very much driving in that direction. I'm really excited about how the organization is stepping up and sees this as a
real opportunity, and I think that you will all be pleased with the results that come from that.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then as a follow-up, Nick, during the quarter, you got asked a question at a conference
about the potential for a Reverse Morris Trust for Performance Chemicals. It seems like you're clearly on the path for a
straight spin here, but didn't know if you wanted to clarify your earlier response.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, sure, I'll say my earlier response. We are on the path for a spin, which is what I
said. We're continuing down that path. We've always said that if there was value creation greater than the spin path that
we're on, that we would explore any of those other value-creation opportunities, but the path we're on is a spin right
now.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks very much. There were a lot of good commentary on 3Q and your
expectations, but I just would like a little more clarification on why 4Q is going to be up so much year-over-year. I see
you have big expectations in Agriculture for Cyazypyr and Dermacor, but what are the other drivers in 4Q that we
should make sure we have modeled right?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, first, Jim, why don't you touch on the Ag second half and how you're viewing
that, and then we can fill on the other businesses.
<A - James C. Borel>: Okay. First of all, fourth quarter has continued to become more profitable over time based on
the growth of our Crop Protection business, in Latin America particularly, and then also the Seed businesses globally.
Our growth in second half in Ag is going to be led by Crop Protection. You mentioned Cyazypyr and Dermacor in
Brazil. Those are exciting. Last year's insecticides business was strong, benefited by some heavy infestations of
Helicoverpa. We're positioned well with supply if the market has similar outbreaks this year. So Crop Protection is set
for a strong second half.
We're expecting lower seed volumes in Brazil's summer season based on an expectation of lower planted area and, as
we've mentioned before, modestly lower seed pricing based on the fall armyworm resistance that we're seeing. We're
expecting fourth quarter seed shipments for the 2015 Brazil safrinha and Northern Hemisphere seasons to be similar to
last year. So all of that combined is what gives us confidence around a strong second half.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, and I think if you look across the company, continued improvement in
industrial production across global markets. Automotive demand remains strong, led by China and North America.
That certainly helps our performance polymers business. PV installs are growing, and it looks like they're going to
come in in the mid-teens, supporting our electronics and communication growth. The momentum we've seen from
Industrial Biosciences, Nutrition & Health, is continuing, and as we enter the second half, those segments are going to
continue to perform there.
And, remember, the first-half results were impacted by the ethylene shutdown, lower refrigerant prices, things like that
that will not be factors in the second half. And then Fresh Start is going to add – or the redesign is going to add some
opportunity because we'll see the costs start coming out through the third and into the fourth quarter. So when you pull
all that together, that's why we have the outlooks that we had talked about for the third and fourth quarter.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Okay. And just as a follow-up on the Ag piece, for Cyazypyr and Dermacor in 4Q,
is that sort of a normal level of demand, or is there some type of channel trade loading that's going to take place there?
<A - James C. Borel>: These are both launches, so they're really just entering the market, so most of that will be used
in season as it's moving out. The Dermacor we expect to be put on seeds that'll get planted in the season that we're
going into, Cyazypyr we'd expect to be used. Because the season extends into the early part of next year, I don't know
very ounce of it'll be used in the fourth quarter, but yeah, it's for an active season.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Jim, want to go back to some of your comments on Ag, because I know corn seed is about half
of the segment sales and it's also – corn is an important end market for Crop Protection as well. So, as you noted, as
growers shift to soy in reaction to lower corn prices, what are the implications for Pioneer seed volumes and pricing
growth next year and overall growth in Ag earnings, which you mentioned will be below trend? And are there any
offsetting margin benefits? Clearly, you'll be paying growers a lot less this year to produce seed that you'll be selling
next year.
<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah, thanks, Don. First of all, it's too early, I think, to try to predict or give guidance for next
year. As you know, there are a lot of different variables. You mentioned a few of them. Certainly, if the current market
environment persists, shift in acres towards soybeans, that can temper volume in the short term in the Seed business.
But as you mentioned, we'll get the benefit of lower input costs – or cost of goods. Crop Protection continues to have
strong growth trends. Corn is one market, but to be honest, much bigger business in specialty crops around the world.

But that's all if that persists. It's probably important to remember that we're coming off a really strong crop last year and
what looks like it could be a strong crop this year, but the crop isn't harvested yet, and you go back two years, we were
coming off a couple of years of drought and record high prices. So these things can change pretty markedly. So I think
we need to get a little farther down the road and see what this crop really ends up to be before we're going to have more
visibility around the outlook for next year.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And just to follow up on soy, since you don't have as much RR2 as the rest of the market, did
you lose share this year, and are you at risk of losing share as growers do shift to soy next year?
<A - James C. Borel>: It's too early to try to predict or comment on share based on – let's see where the final acres
come out and let the dust settle as we normally do. But that said, as we've talked about, we are in a transition both of
introducing the T Series and the Roundup 2, and that'll take us the next couple of years to get that in place. So, too early
to comment on share, but we feel very confident about our overall competitiveness in soy and expect that, over time,
we'll reestablish the strong leadership position that we've had. Pioneer is still the largest soybean brand in North
America.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. Jim, with corn commodity futures well below $4 a bushel, would
you comment on what impact, if any, you would expect that to have on prospective corn seed pricing in North
America? Or, put differently, is there a level below which you think prices would be impacted?
<A - James C. Borel>: Good question. A couple things to remember – first of all, as we've talked over time, we price
for value, and as we come out with new hybrids and new trait combinations that deliver more yield or more value to the
farmer, even at $3.75 a bushel, if you can give them extra bushels, that's still more value. So there's still this pricing
opportunity for innovation, even at the prices being lower than they have been over the last several years. The other
thing to remember is we've got a lot of new technology that we've launched over the last few years that's still working
its way into our lineup. So a fair bit of the price that we're expecting to get in 2015 is going to come from mix, as the
penetration of those products go into the portfolio. So there are a couple of reasons why we're still confident that there's
pricing opportunity that we'll realize next year.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: And as a follow-up, if I may, on a different subject, slide five indicates that your sales in
developed EMEA increased 5% while developing EMEA declined 5%, kind of a counterintuitive disparity there. I was
wondering if you could explain why that might be the case or some of the key drivers.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, certainly, currency was a positive factor in developed Europe. I think it was
about 4%. Performance polymers, things like that, had low-double-digit sales increases; Crop Protection, protection
technologies, kind of mid-teens growth, and N&H and IB both had high-single-digit growth. So we had good growth in
developed Europe. Ag, outside of crop, was a drag on that, and Ukraine certainly had an impact there. But there was a
difference between positive currency impact in developed Europe and negative currency impact in developing Europe
that created some of that dichotomy there.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Good morning, Bob.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Ellen, I'm curious, on the PC spin, obviously the refrigerants and TiO2 businesses aren't
as robust as they might become in future periods. Is there any flexibility around your timing there to maybe defer or
delay that to get a bigger profit number so you might be able to apply a little bit more debt and bring more cash back to
the parent company?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, obviously, that's something that we continue to watch and understand, but Nick,
why don't you talk about the offset to that.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. So, Bob, when you look at that, obviously it's impossible to time anything
exactly at the peak, so you go through the spin, we're pushing and driving for closure in the mid-2015 time period.
When we go through the decisions on the debt structure and the debt load and the dividend load and other things, a lot
of that is going to be determined based on the projections as well, where the entities are going to be going. So we'll be
dialing that into the thinking around that load that's put on those entities. And then obviously, as the value then is
created in the market, as they continue to come back out of the cycle that they're stabilized in right now, the
shareholders get the benefit of that value as those increases occur.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, and let me tell you, our modeling to date doesn't show a big dislocation between
what the original values were and where we are today. We continue to look at it. But we do believe that the sooner we
can get this done – mid-next year is the timeline – I think it's going to be better for both companies going forward.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: And can you update us on the 200,000-tonne expansion at Altamira, when that might
come on and if that could be an appreciable benefit to your margin?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, the current timeline on that is end of 2015 for startup, and we're talking late
2015, fourth quarter.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning. Jim, question for you. In Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, this year you had a
limited launch with only 13 new hybrids. How quickly can you ramp up there? And what's happening to Roundup
Ready 1 seed pricing in the meantime?
<A - James C. Borel>: First of all, it'll ramp up – based on performance, what we're seeing in farmers' fields this
summer looked good, et cetera, but it's going to be driven based on that. We have strongly performing Roundup 1
varieties already out there, so. But it'll take a few years as it rolls through and as we continue to ramp up.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: And question for Ellen – overall, your top line was flat in the quarter, and the top line is growing
maybe only 2% or 3% for the last two-and-a-half years. So was the redesign driven by slower top-line growth, that you
needed cost cuts in order to improve earnings?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so obviously you've seen improvement in our top line in several of the
segments. Ag certainly, as we've all been discussing, is probably going to be a little lower growth than the previous
performance. You take a look at the productivity that we continue to drive, it's there to enable operating leverage and
hence gives us the ability to make sure that we're returning appropriately to our shareholders. So, in a timeframe where
externals are changing, you've just got to use every lever you have, right? P-Chem, it's an opportunity to reset the
model. It's an opportunity to start in a very thoughtful way in terms of how do you create that top-line momentum more
fully.

I'm very happy with the pipelines we have. If you look in Ag, in both Pioneer and Crop Protection, if you look at
Protection Technologies, you look at Nutrition & Health, I'm really happy with the pipelines we have. I think we're
starting to see results of a lot of these efforts. And we continue to understand that we're on transformation path to create
a higher-growth higher-value company, and I think we're making a lot of progress here, emerging markets and what
we're seeing there in terms of penetration. So we continue to drive all aspects of the business in order to create value.

Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning. Ellen, on the redesign, you mentioned you've identified further
opportunities for savings. How should we think about that in terms of timing and the amount? Will that be during or
after the current plan, and could it be as large as the current plan?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I don't think it – well, so it's hard to know what to think when I don't know what I
don't know, right, Dave? So, every month, we continue to make progress, every month, as we understand what our
opportunities are. We're not waiting, because as we roll this out, we're learning and understanding things, and where,
let's just say intersections are that need to be streamlined and driving them. So, you might hear – hopefully, by the end
of the year, we'll have an update on it, and I'm hopeful that it'll be larger than what we're seeing today. But I'm not
going to be shy. It's going to be obviously north of $1 billion, and we're going to go after it very rigorously and in a
disciplined process. So I don't want to conject about what it could be. I'm going to bring it out to you, as we understand
it, and let you understand how it's going to create real value for DuPont.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Understood. And just on Performance Materials, could you size again the size of the impact
of the ethylene outage? Was it roughly $50 million? And also what is the underlying growth of this business, in your
view, over the next two to three years on a top-line volume basis?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: The outage itself, which was 58 days in length, was sort of on the longer side than
what we expected, so that did impact the top line by a few percent in the second quarter. Obviously, we were prepared
for it so that we could keep our firm customers going through that. Size, ballpark, it's about what you had said. Going
forward, though, what I'm seeing is driving growth from an application development standpoint and driving it from the
standpoint of new product, new applications, emerging markets. You've seen how well the performance polymer
business is doing in automotive in Europe and Asia. Food and other packaging is going very well; we're in the midst of
a transition there. And I think that we continue to see – the top-line target we have for that segment is 3% to 5%, and I
think that's eminently achievable.

Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning. My first question is for Nick. In 2014, is working capital changes, net,
going to be a use of funds or a source of funds, and by how much, if you can tell?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Early on, we said that our cash flow from operations was going to be returning to the
more normalized levels, and we were projecting around $3 billion, Jeff. We're still on track to be in that same ballpark
right around that $3 billion mark from our cash flow from operations.

<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Key variable there is obviously going to be within the Ag business and the year-end
collections there and the market conditions that would allow for what extent that year-end collection would be versus
deferred payments later.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: All right. And then my second question is for Ellen. Agricultural volumes are obviously
lower than one would have expected, and if corn yields continue to be relatively good, volumes will probably be, again,
lower than one would have expected next year. If that does turn out to be the case, do you think that your capital
expenditures for Agriculture, as you've planned them, will decrease in any material way, and do you think that you
might take a look at the agricultural cost structure in order to make it more efficient under those demand conditions?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think if you take a look at the restructuring charge that we announced in the
second quarter, you'll see an Ag component on that, so obviously we comprehended the trend and are taking steps and
aren't going to wait on that. Any kind of distribution of capital we rigorously scrub based on market conditions and
productivity. I'm very proud of the team at Pioneer and what they've done from a productivity standpoint to get more
out of their existing assets. I think the investments that we've made in Latin America are serving us very well. And I
think, regardless of what's happening there now, I'm hopeful we'll still like the Ukrainian assets over time. It continues
to be an important part of the world from an agriculture standpoint.
So these are decisions that we make based on the opportunity and the reality of the marketplace. Jim, I don't know what
you want to add to that?
<A - James C. Borel>: I think that that's a good summary. The key thing also is the long-term fundamentals under the
market and the long-term potential of the businesses in Ag. Crop Protection is continuing to perform well. So the
volume question on seed is one component that over the next year is unknown around where acres will go, but the big
picture is still for a lot of growth.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. With regard to the M&A outlook, can you give us your
thoughts, Ellen, as to how we should be thinking about the pipeline, whether it's a target-rich environment? And then
also, given that you are in the process of getting out of the Performance Chems business, do you see an ability to make
acquisitions while that's still in the work in process, or is it something realistically it would muddy the water too much
and you'd rather just get of that business first before really initiating any major M&A?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so our M&A process continues, right? We're continuing to look in Ag and
Nutrition, Industrial Biosciences, and Advanced Materials, where there's commercial logic, where there's strategic
rationale, does it align with our priorities, our growth, and what does it enable? You've often heard me talk about the
fact that acquisitions have to create momentum, not bulk, and add to the science portfolio and/or the penetration
portfolio, for instance, in emerging markets. It takes a while for any deal to get completed. These aren't things that
happen quickly. So we haven't stopped our activity there. Do I think we could take a mid-size one and integrate it today
– sign, pay, and integrate today? I think it'd be very tough for us. But I think as we come into the spring, we're going to
have that opportunity, so that's why we're continuing to look and understand where there could be real value created.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great. And then just a quick question with regard to the cost-cutting program, are there
specific business segments that should see a larger benefit and maybe bigger margin lift as we think about modeling
them out over the next year or two?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. No, I think it's pretty much what you're going to see – since a lot of it is in the
support functions to the businesses that you're going to see that the lift is going to be pretty across the board. There's
going to be specific actions that we've asked the businesses to consider. The 8-K, which is out today, depicts the

restructuring by segment, so that'll help you. But, for instance, consolidation of production and hence creating lower
costs and higher operating margin is something we're constantly looking at doing. So I think you can see what the 8-K
says, and from a standpoint of the corporation or the corporate costs, that's pretty much across the board.

<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Love the way you save the best for last. Thank you so much. Also, Carl, I wanted to thank
you, very informative call. You forced me to Google GWP, so I now know what that stands for, so thank you for that as
well.
<A - Carl J. Lukach>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Good. We're glad we're making you smarter, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Absolutely, absolutely. A couple follow-ups, just coming back to the European question, the
dichotomy between Western and Eastern, what percent is Ag of your Western European business, and what percent of
your Eastern European business is Ag, roughly?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Okay, now you're taxing my – let's see, Nick, can you come up with that pretty
quickly? I think it's just higher – obviously, Ag is much higher in Eastern Europe that in Western Europe because
there's not much of an industrial base there. But we'll have the IR team connect with you and see if they can get you
more information there, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right, great. I thought that that probably was the case and was part of it. And, Jim, while
we have you, Crop Protection obviously seems to be doing well, new products, et cetera. How should we think about
the one- to three-year growth rate for the Crop Protection side of the house? And I guess, lastly, precision Ag has been
generating a lot of press. Where does DuPont stand in that area? What could we expect from DuPont in that area over
the next couple years?
<A - James C. Borel>: Yeah, first of all, on the Crop Protection side, we are expecting continued growth. They have
been growing a point or two ahead of the market over the last number of years. We expect that to continue based on the
new products and the expanded markets. So growth will continue, based on that, in Crop Protection. In terms of the
services, Encirca is – we're really pleased with the launch so far. We've been an industry leader in many ways around
decision services for the last 10-plus years in terms of mapping fields, 12 million harvest acres mapped, 8 million as
planted.
But the launch of the new brand of Encirca is going well. We've had a very positive grower response to Encirca View
and Encirca Premium, which is in partnership with DTN. There's over 1,000 weather stations in our proprietary
network. We have new collaborations with eight land-grant universities. We talked about a goal earlier of 500,000
fee-based variable-rate seeding prescriptions, and we exceeded that. And as we mentioned today, we've launched the
Encirca Yield Nitrogen Management module now in July, so that's out there. So it's good farmer acceptance, good
success so far, everything is going very well.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you.
