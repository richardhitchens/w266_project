Thanks, Elena.
Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell had a good second quarter capping off a strong
first-half, which puts us well on our way to achieving the full-year guidance that we set back in December.
Normalizing for tax, EPS was $1.22, up 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis and in line with our guidance of $1.18
to $1.23. Sales of $9.7 billion were near the high-end of guidance and if you exclude Defense, where the headwinds are
well known and as we expected them, we saw sales growth in each of the four businesses. We also continue to benefit
from margin expansion up 30 basis points to 16.1%.
The positive driver here has been the savings from the proactive repositioning actions we've taken in prior periods. As
we continue to face an uncertain macro outlook, we think it's prudent to keep that pipeline full. So, we funded over $60
million of incremental restructuring this quarter, more than offsetting an OPEB curtailment gain and bringing us to
approximately $100 million of repositioning actions funded this year. Dave is going to take you into more detail on that
later.
However, while investing for productivity is important, it sure is a lot easier to expand margins when sales are growing.
So, even in this tough environment, we're planting the seeds that will drive future top-line growth. Some of the
lowest-risk, highest-return projects available to us are organic, so we continue to invest in R&D, new product
introductions, and capacity expansion.
Our long-cycle businesses, including Commercial Aerospace, Process Solutions, and UOP, continue to benefit from a
strong backlog, which ended the quarter at roughly $15.5 billion. The businesses are also winning in the marketplace,
and some examples in Aerospace, we announced that the newest version of our HTF7000 series engine, the HTF7350,
will power the new Challenger 350 super-midsize business jet. As we've said before, we think the super-midsize and
longer-range segments represent an attractive space for growth, and we're excited about this most recent win.
Additionally, if you were at the Paris Air Show, you may have noticed an awful lot of excitement around an A320
sprinting along the tarmac. This was a demonstration of our electric green taxiing system or EGTS, developed in
partnership with Safran, which uses the APU rather than the main engines to taxi during preflight operations. This can
provide operators up to $200,000 a year in fuel savings per aircraft.
We also had another important win with Airbus, though not from the business you were probably expecting. Honeywell
Building Solutions was awarded a $37 million project to build, operate and maintain a power facility for Airbus' new
assembly line here in the U.S. The project, which will be done to LEED certification standards, is a great example of
One Honeywell cross-selling between businesses to the benefit of both Honeywell and our customers.
And finally, because there are a lot to choose from, I'd like to highlight one UOP win. Our Oleflex technology, which
converts propane into propylene, was selected again, this time by Ascend Performance Materials Operations, the
world's largest on-purpose propylene production facility. As you've heard us say before, petrochemical makers are
installing additional capacity to meet growing demand, and to make up for the shortage of propylene production from
traditional sources.
Once again, order rates were mixed in the quarter, with the U.S. stable, Europe trending slightly positive in both shortand
long-cycle, and a notable turnaround in China from the first quarter with sales up mid-teens.
The inflection point in China occurred in June, with broad-based performance improvement in all businesses. ACS
short- and long-cycle businesses, along with stellar growth in UOP, added to a much stronger performance in China
than Q1 and last year, while Transportation Systems continued its growth momentum from Q1.
We also continue to progress with our key process initiatives: the Honeywell Operating System; Functional
Transformation; and Velocity Product Development. That focus on making sure that the machinery works for our
employees to get their jobs done effectively and efficiently every day makes us better at delivering both growth and
productivity.

With these things in mind, we continue to be confident in our 2013 outlook. First-half EPS was $2.38 when
normalizing for tax, which based on our historical linearity is trending toward the top half of the $4.75 to $4.95
guidance range we gave you back in December, despite continued soft end-market conditions.
As a result of this continued strong execution, we raised the low end of our guidance by a nickel in the first quarter, and
we're doing it again this quarter, giving us a new EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $4.95, or up 8% to 11% for the year.
We just concluded our strategic planning reviews with each of the four businesses, and while we're preparing for
near-term underlying macro conditions to be much the same, what was particularly impressive was each business's
innovation pipeline and growth opportunities. We're looking forward to sharing this and more with you early next year,
when we publish our new five-year plan. But you can expect our continued evolution in everything to drive
out-performance over this timeframe.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave to talk you through more of the details. Dave?
David John Anderson
Thanks. Thanks.
Good morning, and welcome, and appreciate your participation this morning. Let's start with slide number 4, and let me
walk you through the summary financial results for the second quarter.
Sales of $9.7 billion were up approximately 3% year-over-year on a reported basis, near the high-end of our guidance
range, and up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally on an organic basis, the Americas were roughly flat, really driven by
lower Defense & Space sales; while Europe as Dave said was good overall, up 1%; and China was up 14%, driven by
improvement in our short-cycle businesses, namely ESS: the Energy, Safety, and Security business of ACS; and also
Transportation Systems. In addition, we had continued good long-cycle growth in China.
Segment profit for the quarter was up 4%, with segment margins expanding 30 basis points to 16.1%. Now, it's
important to note we had margin expansion of 60 basis points or more in every business other than PMT. And you'll
recall from our guidance that we gave for the quarter that PMT's margin rate was unfavorably impacted by a number of
items, but most notably the lower UOP licensing activity this year compared to the record levels that we had in the
second quarter of 2012.
So again, PMT's margin decrease is largely explained by that, and important to point out that the absolute level of PMT
margins in the second quarter was 19%. Very impressive. We need to keep that in mind.
Below the line items were mostly as anticipated. Importantly, we recognized an OPEB curtailment gain of $42 million,
which was more than offset by more than $60 million of restructuring actions, which we're going to discuss in more
detail in a moment. And obviously, that's another highlight for the quarter.
Moving to EPS, similar to the first quarter, we had a tax rate in the second quarter that was favorable, relative to our
guidance, both for the quarter of 26.5% and our full-year guidance of 26.5%. So, we had 23.1% effective tax rate this
year in the second quarter versus 26% even in the second quarter of last year. However, while the timing of certain tax
items will continue to be lumpy, we continue to expect that full-year rate of 26.5% for the year. That means, that the
roughly $0.11 of favorability that we've experienced in the first-half, we had $0.05 in the first quarter, $0.06 in the
second quarter, will be offset in the second-half.
And importantly, we've assumed that will occur in the fourth quarter for planning and guidance purposes. And I'm
going to come back to that and cover that in a little more detail when we talk about the second-half.
So, for the second quarter reported EPS of $1.28, up 12% versus prior year, however, normalizing at the 26.5% rate
both last year and this year, EPS would have been $1.22, up 8%. Finally, free cash flow was $1.1 billion, up 10%
versus prior year and represents a conversion rate of approximately 112%. So, a very good cash quarter also.

So, with that summary, let's go to slide number 5. Let's start with Aerospace on slide 5. For the quarter, sales were
down 1% as commercial growth of 5% was more than offset by declines in Defense & Space.
In the Commercial side, OE sales were up 8% driven by continued strong OE build rates in large air transport and
continued healthy demand in the mid-to-large cabin business aircraft segment, where we've got such a strong position.
Moving to the Commercial aftermarket, sales were up 3% driven by commercial excellence, improved flight-hour
growth, and the continued uptake of repairs, modifications, and upgrades or RMUs in the BGA segment, partially
offset by fewer maintenance events.
Now, if you look at utilization rates for a moment, global flying hours were up roughly 4% year-over-year compared to
the first quarter, which was up less than 2%. So, we've seen a steadily-improving trend in the flight hours.
Spares growth was slightly ahead of utilization rates in the quarter and would expect these improving utilization rates to
support the aftermarket growth outlook, we're going to talk to you about that more in a little bit, in the second-half of
the year.
Defense & Space down 8%, revenues with the U.S. Defense sales unfavorably impacted by planned ramp-downs –
project ramp-downs, as well as some program delays, partially offset by growth in international markets.
And again, while sequestration headwinds continue to be a challenge for the business, we still had a number of key
program starts in the quarter, and we continue to believe we're on track to our full-year expectations for D&S of down
revenues 4% for the full-year.
Turning to segment profit, Aerospace margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.5%, driven by commercial excellence,
productivity net of inflation, and partially offset by lower Defense & Space sales.
Let's now turn to ACS; Automation and Control on slide 6. ACS sales for the quarter were up 3%. They had growth in
all three of their sub-segments and in every region. On an organic basis, sales in the U.S. were up 2% driven by
improving residential and market conditions, offsetting tougher industrial comparables last year.
In non-res, construction remains suppressed, although the orders pipeline does appear to be improving. Europe was up
slightly, outperforming the overall market with good growth in ESS, partially offset by Building Solutions as a result of
soft economic conditions. In China, sales were up 6% with good growth in both the short and long-cycle businesses in
ACS.
Now transitioning and just going through a couple of the high points of each of the ACS sub-segments. ESS, Energy,
Safety, and Security, sales were up 3% globally. We had particularly good performance in ECC, in Security as well as
Fire, with organic growth in all of these pieces, 5% or better as a result of new products, continued good geographic
expansion, and also evidence, continued evidence of the U.S. residential strength that I referenced earlier. And we'll
come back later and particularly give you a little more color in terms of those segments.
Process Solution sales were up 4% for ACS, supported by continued good services growth and the uptake in our
Advanced Solutions software offerings. And just like the first quarter, we had strong sales conversion as a result of
higher margin in the backlog. For BSD, for Building Solutions & Distribution, sales were up 1%, driven by higher sales
in the Americas Security Distribution business and also in Building Services.
Moving to segment margins, ACS was up 110 basis points in the quarter to 14.4%, representing over a 50% sales
conversion, much of it reflected in higher gross margins. Commercial excellence, a number of operational
improvements, particularly notably in Process Solutions, and strong productivity net of inflation, including the
repositioning benefits that are flowing through, all of these contributed to the ACS margin performance in the quarter.
Now let's go to slide 7 and look at the highlights for PMT, Performance Materials & Technologies. Sales for PMT were
$1.7 billion, up 9% in the quarter, driven by continued growth in UOP. UOP saw almost 40% top line growth, 11% on
an organic basis, primarily driven by the addition of Thomas Russell, increased catalyst shipments, also higher
equipment sales reflecting strong petrochemical as well as gas end markets. Now the UOP backlog continues to be

robust, up 10% organically, with strong customer adoption of new UOP technologies and investments in new capacity.
On the other side, Advanced Materials sales were down 6% versus prior year, reflecting soft end-markets overall.
Fluorine saw a slow start to the cooling season, resulting in delayed purchases by customers, presumably that's
beginning to pick up now. As well as lower production volumes from the continued Metropolis plant shutdown, which
resumed operations at the site in July following approximately 12-month shutdown for structural upgrades.
Now, Resins & Chemicals experienced lower production volumes year-over-year, primarily related to plant outages
and also soft market conditions in China. As I said earlier, segment margins for PMT were down 360 basis points,
consistent with our expectations in what we communicated to you back in April, primarily driven by the impact of
lower UOP licensing sales versus last year, lower Advanced Materials volumes, growth investments that we continue to
make in PMT, as well as the impact of inflation.
We also continue to see dilution in the margin rate for PMT, and again, as expected, from the Thomas Russell
acquisition, which we will lap in the fourth quarter. So, for the full-year, we continue to expect PMT margins in the
range of 18.4% to 18.6%.
Let's finish off the segment highlights by going to Transportation Systems, slide number 8. So TS in the quarter, sales
up 5% year-over-year. The first gain importantly since 2011, with turbo volumes up high single-digits as higher turbo
gas penetration in all regions, strong growth from new launches, and improving China commercial vehicle sales more
than offset slight declines in European light vehicle production in the quarter.
Now, we're really encouraged by what's been a relatively stable production environment, although, the possibility of a
second-half inventory correction still exists, as new car registrations continue to be weak in Europe. And we've planned
accordingly, which we'll cover in a moment when we talk about TS in the second-half outlook.
Segment margins for the business were up 60 basis points to 13.3% in the second quarter, primarily driven by strong
productivity in volume leverage, partially offset by unfavorable price.
And just as a reminder, in June, we completed a one-year anniversary of the closure of the FMs – or the initiation of the
FMs closure of Condé, the friction material closure of Condé. We completed that this June, and that facility and the full
closure of that facility will provide meaningful productivity benefits beginning in the second-half and of course flowing
through to 2014.
Now, before we move to our third quarter expectations, I just want to take a moment to update you on the status of our
restructuring pipeline, because as Dave referenced earlier, that's going to continue to be an important element of our
continued margin expansion efforts.
So, on slide 9, starting with the left-hand side of the chart, what we've done here is walk you from our restructuring
balance at the end of the year to where – at the end of 2012, to where we are today. And as you can see, while we
successfully executed on roughly $70 million of outstanding projects, we funded approximately $100 million of new
projects, adding to the projects in process through the first six months of the year.
Now, moving to the right side of the page, just to help you a little bit in terms of understanding this chart, the blue bar
on the right-hand side of the chart reflects the cumulative repositioning funding that we've done in 2012, as well as year
to-date 2013.
So, the blue bar represents over $200 million of gross repositioning over six quarters and delivering savings shown in
the red bars of $130 million in 2013 and over $220 million, or an incremental $90 million in 2014. So, many of our
projects, we're very pleased to say, have between a one to two-year payback; so, we're being proactive here, and it's a
big reason again we've been able to continuously expand margins in this slow growth environment.
Further, we continue to identify and drive cost saving projects across the company. Funding projects to realign
resources and regional footprints to reflect the current global growth outlook and our market opportunities. And we're
also executing against our acquisition integration plans to drive cost synergies delivering further benefits in 2014 and
obviously beyond.

So, now let's go to slide 10 and let's discuss our outlook for the third quarter. For the third quarter, we're expecting sales
to be in the range of $9.8 billion to $10 billion, up 2% to 4% on an organic basis. EPS is expected to be in the range of
$1.20 to $1.25, up 5% to 10%, when you normalize for the tax rate of 26.5% in both years.
So, let's just do kind of a quick recap on our – kind of the revenue outlook and – as well as a couple of references to
margin for the third quarter by business.
In Aerospace, we're expecting sales to be up low single-digits, approximately 1% to 3%, driven by commercial growth,
including mid single-digit growth in the aftermarket as a result of easier comps and improved utilization rates, partially
offset by mid single-digit declines in Defense & Space.
Now, we expect ACS sales to be up 2% to 4% in the third quarter on an organic basis and incremental sales growth
resulting from the Intermec acquisitions, which we now expect to close in the third quarter. It's also important to note
that the Intermec and RAE Systems acquisitions will have a dilutive impact on ACS' margins in the third quarter of
approximately 100 basis points. So, ACS' reported segment margin will be down slightly year-over-year, likely in the
range of 20 basis points to 30 basis points a result of the acquisition headwind.
In PMT, we're expecting sales to be up 13% to 16%, which equates to mid single-digit growth organically. As we've
seen before, UOP can be lumpy; and as a result, we expect our organic growth to be mid single-digit in the quarter as
we lap higher catalyst and service sales.
Advanced Materials in the third quarter is expected to see an improvement in organic growth with sales up mid
single-digit, reflecting improved production levels at Hopewell in the rest of the chemicals business and also the restart
of Metropolis, as I mentioned earlier, in the Fluorine's Products business, both of those in the third quarter.
Finally, in Transportation Systems, we're expecting sales to be up 2% to 4% reflecting strong uptake of new launches
and also the growth in turbo penetration globally. The growth is against the backdrop of lower EU, light vehicle
production rates expected to be down 3% year-over-year, contemplating a slight inventory correction in Europe as we
move into the summer shutdown season.
Now, we expect a lift in the TS margin rate year-over-year, helped in part by the footprint transition that I mentioned
earlier; although, we expect, given their strong margin rate performance in the second quarter, that TS sequentially,
their margin will be flat to slightly down now in the third quarter.
So, with that in mind, let's turn to slide 11 and we'll walk through some of the second-half drivers that could push us
toward the lower high-end of our guidance range.
So, looking at slide 11 entitled, 'second-half 2013 guidance framework', let me just give a couple highlights. In terms of
our key assumptions, again for our commercial aircraft, we expect growth will be an important contributor to the
second-half outlook. We're lapping a relatively easier, which is to say, a more normal year-over-year comps.
At the midpoint of the range, we've assumed the aftermarket sales are largely in line with utilization, with the likely
case that airlines continue to aggressively manage inventory levels, but that improving flight-hour growth will equate to
more normal buying patterns consistent with what we saw at the end of the second quarter.
For ESS, the business was up roughly 2% organic in the first-half driven by, again, ECC security and improvements in
light safety; and while the composition may fluctuate a little bit in the recovery, we're still expecting low-to-mid
single-digit growth overall for ESS, with no change in the overall economic backdrop.
Now the composition of PMT growth is expected to be different. UOP sales will be up organically, but at a slightly
lower rate, with lower petrochemical catalyst shipments sequentially in the second-half, which would create an
unfavorable mix dynamic. And as we referenced earlier, we should see a meaningful improvement in both R&C and
Fluorine Products in the second-half for both those businesses. Pricing will also continue to be an important variable
with our midpoint based on stable prices at today's levels.

For Turbo in the third – for Turbo in the second-half, we'll be watching obviously the note – that summer shutdown
plans of the OEMs, with our base-case assumption best described as stable, which would translate into second-half EU,
light vehicle production down just slightly on a year-over-year basis.
Finally, rounding out the list, we have China sales which we can be thought of more broadly as a barometer for a
high-growth market. And the euro and FX rate which will continue to plan for at the $1.25 at the midpoint.
So, taking these elements into account, complemented by continued assumption of strong cost controls, strong
execution by the businesses, we think this gives us a balanced range of plus or minus $0.05 around $4.90 at the
midpoint for the full-year.
So, now let's turn to slide 12, where we'll put it all together from a full-year perspective. Now, the slide is a little
different than we've given you in the past, but we think it will be helpful for you to understand the dynamics of our
second-half outlook.
First, full-year sales reflect our first-half performance, and no change to the second-half outlook, with sales for the
full-year expected to be up 3% to 4%, or 1% to 2% on an organic basis.
Now on a reported basis, we can see an impact based on the timing of the Intermec close, but we feel it's incorporated
into our range at this point, and we're re-working to complete the transaction in the third quarter.
Segment margins are estimated to be 16% to 16.2% for the full-year 2013, up 40 basis points to 60 basis points
year-over-year. Now, as we've discussed, you can see the estimated impact in the third quarter's segment margin due to
the dilutive impact of Intermec, RAE Systems and the Thomas Russell acquisitions. Roughly a 50 basis point headwind
in the third quarter, in terms of our margin rates, which translates to $0.02 to $0.03, think of that as $0.03 of EPS
headwind for the quarter.
Now, obviously, on the subject of M&A, as the integrations occur and the cost synergies are realized, the M&A will be
a benefit for us in 2014 and beyond. However, even with that headwind, you can see that our full-year guidance is
roughly at or above the low end of our 2014 margin targets, with significant contributions coming from Advanced
Materials and Transportation Systems in the fourth quarter.
Finally on EPS, we're raising the bottom-end of our guidance by $0.05, making the new range $4.85 to $4.95. And as
we've referenced earlier, we continue to use a full-year tax rate of 26.5%, which will be flat to 2012, so no impact
year-over-year. However, as we think about the linearity within 2013, again the first-half ETR of about 23% was below
the full-year rate, so we've guided now to 26.5% for the third, and we're – for modeling purposes, we're expecting a tax
headwind in the fourth quarter, which works out to be approximately $0.11 versus our 26.5% full-year planning
assumption.
Now, we think this updated range captures our strong performance in the first-half. It's appropriately balanced for the
remaining risks and opportunities we've talked about in the second-half. And as for the takeaways, it's important to be
clear that we're not counting on a macro lift in the second-half.
So, now let's turn to slide 13 for a brief wrap-up before we turn it over to you and Elena for Q&A. In summary on slide
13, the second quarter results put us another step closer to delivering on the high expectations that we set out for you
last December.
As expected, the environment has remained challenging, but Honeywell has continued to see strong execution
supporting its results. And consistent with our prior views, we're not expecting, not counting on a big second-half
recovery. We've seen pockets of short-cycle improvement. The comps are getting easier, and the investments in
residential construction do seem to be improving. And again evidence of that in our ESS businesses.
However, while we have seen some signs of improving quote activity, non-residential investment remains weak, and
we'll be watching the customer demand signals in Aerospace and Automotive obviously very closely in the
second-half. Emerging markets are not likely to accelerate in the near-term, so probably the best way to summarize our
end market expectations for the second-half is really just stable.

With that in mind, we'll continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity, including delivering on the strong
project pipeline we've already funded, and new product introductions which are the lifeblood of our growth, will
remain on overdrive, helping to deliver next quarter, next year, and beyond. You'll see evidence of that in the wide
range of exciting new wins that Dave highlighted at the start of this call.
So with that, Elena, let's go over to you for Q&A.
Elena Doom
Thanks, Dave. Zack, we'll now take our first question on the line.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, Dave, Dave, Elena.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Nice productivity. What was the pricing in the quarter?
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't know off the top of my head, but pricing or commercial excellence is one of the things
that we have focused on for a long time, and it gets geared towards the value that we provide with a lot of our new
products and services. But I don't have the number off the top of my head.
<A - Elena Doom>: It's up 50 basis points to the margin rate expansion in the quarter.
<A - David John Anderson>: I think another way to say it is – and it's a theme, Steve, that we talk about a lot is
pricing and productivity more than offset inflation.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Right.
<A - David John Anderson>: And that's what we're just going to continue to do.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, I'm just trying to get a sense for the unit versus pricing impact. But that's helpful.
And on Defense & Space down 8%, I know you mentioned it's in line with the planned ramp-downs and expectations,
but I recall from the Defense & Space day, a plan that was just close to full sequestration, but not at full sequestration.
Are you planning on – are your planning numbers now incorporating kind of a full sequestration impact over the
remaining next – on a multiyear basis?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, the way we planned it, and I think I said this before, but we assumed about 80% of the
sequestration impact, and had contingency plans for the remaining 20%, just assuming that that was probably the best
bet. It's unfolded that way. We launched the contingency plan so, yeah, everything we are reflecting and the way we're
looking at the company going forward is to assume sequestration stays.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - Elena Doom>: And with that, that basically gives you about a 4% decline in D&S sales for 2013 versus 2012.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And I know you can't say too much about it, but on the ELT topic that's come out
in the – and your announcements on that, I'm just still trying to get my head around something that doesn't seem to have
enough power to generate the heat that would be required to melt the frame in kind of a non-rechargeable

self-contained basis. Any kind of color you might provide that this may be more than that? Or I just don't get – I'm just
struggling with the kind of physics of the issue.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I guess a couple of comments. First one is my biggest learning from going through a
number of these kinds of investigations in the past is to wait to find out what the final result is before opining on
anything. And as these things just – they go all over the place. Media loves it, so any little snippet they pick up
anywhere, they report. And I've just learned to wait. Wait until they've done the job and when you look at the AIB and
the FAA, they'll do a good job sorting this whole thing through. So, we'll just wait to find out what the actuals are and
respond to it then. In the meantime, with any things that have been discussed, we could say there's no significant
financial impact to Honeywell in any way.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, all right, let me hand it off. Thanks.

And our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: The one thing that there wasn't a slide on was really cash usage. And can you give us a sense of
– and maybe on a forward look really, I mean, next 6 months, next 12 months, if – given the M&A pipe you have out
there, what kind of cash opportunity you have to put things to work?
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, I'll just talk a little bit about the quarter. We bought back shares in the quarter. I
think it was 6 million shares in the quarter, so that was an attractive I think use of cash. We closed on the RAE
Systems.
Due to regulatory review, the close on Intermec was pushed into the third quarter. We'll close on Intermec in the third
quarter. You know, that's mid-$600 million in terms of acquisition. And I would say, Scott, right now just on a
forward-looking basis, Dave, get your views on this, I think the acquisition pipeline is relatively attractive.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.
<A - David John Anderson>: It's always a matter of the distance between the cup and the lip and seeing the whites of
the eyes of these opportunities, in terms of the full due diligence and valuation and the very disciplined approach, Scott,
that we take to M&A. But I would continue to say to you that I think that we're very, very well positioned for inorganic
growth to complement our organic growth in this environment.
And the other thing we'll continue to do is, we'll continue to look at, from a dividend standpoint, we'll look at doing the
right thing there in the context of growing earnings and what makes sense in terms of dividend payout. Don't you think,
Dave, that's the best that we can do?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, the strategy remains the same, Scott, and we'll continue to be very disciplined, as Dave
said, with – when it comes to acquisitions. We haven't lost our mind there, and I'd say the nice thing about having a full
pipeline is it allows you to be more disciplined in what you go after.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yes. Agreed. I mean, since you've done a nice job in the past, I think there's always an interest
in seeing more of it, but that's a high-class problem.
<A - David M. Cote>: We'll continue to be smart about it. I can promise you that.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yup. Guys, I want to talk a little bit about UOP and then I'll pass it on. I mean, this is a business
that I'm not sure – I know I've never been able to forecast and I'm guessing that a lot of other people struggle with it. I

mean, it's been outgrowing the end-market for quite some time now and with less volatility than we used to get and it
used to be – it was always a great business, but it used to be much more volatile. It scares me only because we're –
we've had so many good quarters in a row here. I mean, what has changed in this business that makes it so much of a
better business now or a less volatile business now or maybe even more predictable now than what we used to get? Or
are we going to get blown up one of these quarters on this thing and not see it coming?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, I can see where you were going. Well, at the end of the day quarter-to-quarter, it's still – I
mean, lumpy is the word we've always used.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: Some don't like it, but it's true. Quarter-to-quarter, it's always going to be lumpy. Year-to-year,
though, the forecastability, if that's a word is pretty reasonable, and should continue to grow. It's not just the end-market
goodness that we've seen, but you've heard me talk about it before when it comes to UOP. But we've done a significant
amount of seed planting here.
If you go back to when it was a JV, you've heard me say before that when one partner wanted to invest, the other didn't,
and that was true for us too. And as a result of that, there was 20 years of just kind of ambling along, just terrific
technologies, people, culture, everything, but it was really ambling along more than anything else.
We really invigorated that when we took over the whole thing and put a lot more money into R&D and horizon-free
spending. You don't see it right away, but over the course of that ensuing 6 or 7 years, man, it has started to pay off
really well. And that's what you're seeing the benefits of, which allows us to put even more money back into it to
develop new things. You've seen it happen in some of the cultural changes as they've expanded globally, improving a
reach that used to be more mental than physical. And we just have more people out there now than we ever did before.
And all those things taken together, the technology, the money we've put into it, the people outreach, the customer
outreach, is just really paying off very well.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: It looks like it is. Thank you, guys. Good luck.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: First, I want to go to Aerospace for a moment. Just two things. One is could you characterize
where you're spending research and development and how you look for that? What were the numbers, Dave, this year
versus last? And how do you characterize it, please?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'd characterize it as, we like all the businesses that we're in, in Aerospace, so we support
them all with R&D. In terms of big programs, they're all the ones that you're familiar with like the A350 and the wins
that we've gotten over the last 4 or 5 years. In terms of the overall spending, growth investments continue in Aerospace.
I don't know, do we disclose the specific numbers?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yes, we spend just under 8% of sales on R&D that's funded from the company.
<A - David M. Cote>: As I – I would say, Howard, one of the things that we've tried to do is, consistent with that seed
planting point is we're still investing in all the businesses when it comes to the growth investments that we've talked
about, because we don't want to just make this quarter this year. We want to make it next year, 6 years from now, 10
years from now. So, all the businesses are doing a really good job of reinvesting.

<A - Elena Doom>: And that spending level is up about $75 million, $80 million, on a year-over-year basis for
Aerospace.
<A - David M. Cote>: Per year.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So, that's on the quarter or – that should be on...?
<A - Elena Doom>: For the year.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: For the year. And it sounds like you're putting a little more emphasis on mechanical, based
on some things that Tim seemed to have said lately. There – is there some incremental opportunities there?
<A - David M. Cote>: We – I like both, both the mechanical and the electronic side. And increasingly, we're seeing an
interplay between mechanical and electronic, and that's what you see with, like the electric taxi. We do like the
components business, the mechanical components business as we've discussed, because there's a place where you can
truly differentiate with technology. And I think, Tim mentioned that we – at Investor Day that we had about $4 billion
in wins on mechanical components that we had not anticipated in the past. So, I like the whole thing.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just to change, Dave, to talk about ESS, I mean, there's clearly – either it's a
change in the market or some product differentiation. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on some of the
successes that you've achieved there and address the momentum please?
<A - David John Anderson>: Maybe I could just start there, Howard, and just give you a couple numbers, just to add
a little bit more color to what we talked about in the second quarter, and then I'll ask Dave to talk a little bit about some
of the innovation, some of the things that are really going to continue to drive ESS growth going forward.
We saw, as I mentioned in my comments, we saw good growth in the second quarter, in ECC, in Security, and in Fire
particularly. Fire was up 6% globally, ECC was up 5% globally, and HSG, the Security business, was up 7% globally.
And the numbers are all better in the U.S. for those businesses. So, whether it's – call it retrofit – residential retrofit, or
some benefits of improved housing starts, there's a little bit of evidence as well at that when you look at the ECS – ECC
homes business, it's clearly – and the momentum has been building. You can see it, it's not like it spiked. You actually
can see the momentum building. And as Dave said, kind of back to the broader team, we completed our strap reviews
last week. I mean, there's just a lot of good stuff, Dave, that's going on within that group of businesses.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. I would – going back to the seed planting point, Howard, it may seem like an overused
message here, but, man, it is the truth. It's – the money that we've put in, in the past to just developing products that
people want that help to develop adjacencies where people maybe didn't even realize there was a product that could
solve their problem. We're doing that in every single business across the company, and what you're seeing in ESS is a
function of that. I'd say the only business that has continued to be a little bit slow is the Sensing and Control business,
largely driven by a weak industrial environment. But same thing there. They've got some great stuff coming that's
helping to mitigate that, and I think portends a pretty good future.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you all very much.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.

And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Can you guys just maybe walk through, if there's been any change to the – to any of the segment
revenue forecasts for the year? That doesn't seem to be many but are there any kind of tweaks up or down? Obviously,

it didn't change sales but within that, the segments?
<A - David John Anderson>: Elena, do you want to talk about that from a guidance standpoint?
<A - Elena Doom>: Sure.
<A - David John Anderson>: We tweaked slightly up our overall revenue guidance for the year. Maybe you can talk
about that by segment.
<A - Elena Doom>: Sure. We raised it by $100 million, and we're reflecting the second quarter of revenue coming in
at the high end of our guidance.
When you look at the businesses, for Aerospace, there's really a little bit of a change upward relative to the midpoint by
maybe $50 million. If you look at ACS, ACS is still on track relative to their – call it $16.4 billion or $16.6 billion for
the year. So that's up again at the midpoint slightly versus our prior guide.
PMT is looking potentially a little bit lower, so $6.8 billion to $6.9 billion versus – so maybe at the midpoint, about
$100 million less. And then TS is – we're still continuing the outlook there, given, as Dave referenced, the potential for
some inventory correction in the third quarter, given the strength that we had in the second quarter.
<A - David John Anderson>: So really, just refinements, I think you would say, to those numbers.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yup, exactly, on the midpoint, plus or minus $50 million to $100 million.
<A - David John Anderson>: Right.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I'm doing good, Mr. Cote. How are you? [laughter]
Hey, can we talk about China a little bit?
<A - David M. Cote>: Why does it sound funny when you say it?
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: If I think about what seems to be playing out, right, from a macro standpoint, it sounds
worrisome. And you are now the third or fourth company this earnings season that sounds actually better and more
confident. I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on – from your vantage point what do you think really is
going on. And is it CapEx driven? Are people catching up on maintenance? Any impact from this whole shadow
banking question? I'll just ask for your collective wisdom on what's going on there?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I mean, the collective wisdom may still assemble here. But at the end of the day – as you
know, long-term, I'm very much a believer in China and what I think they can accomplish. And it's going to endure its
ups and downs for a variety of reasons, but I do think that, that kind of 6%-to-7%-GDP-type planning is the way to go.
We have seen some downturn, as we talked about, in – I guess the first 4 or 5 months of the year. I think that was more
– let's say correction than anything else, responding to tightening money.
We still see the impact of some of that on something like airline spares, where in China I think the fourth quarter was
up like 30% or 40% to the anticipation of what was going to come. So first 6 months continued to be low. That's
another one that I do think comes back some at some point. So I'm a believer long-term, and I think we're going to

continue to do well there.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I was actually – yeah, I was actually also a little surprised – I think you said China was up
14%...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: ...overall, I would have expected that would have been driven largely by ACS. But I think the
comment was ACS China up 6%. So where did it really come? It was TS or was it somewhere else?
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, we had good growth – let me talk a little bit about that, Jeff. We had good growth
kind of across the board. We had good growth in Aero R&O. We had good growth in the ACS short-cycle – you cited
the number we mentioned earlier – but also in the long-cycle businesses of ACS.
We had good growth in UOP, particularly at two projects that completed that where there was revenue conversion. And
HTT in the Turbo business -
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.
<A - David John Anderson>: – what we've seen is kind of a rebound now in the commercial vehicle business sales,
and our penetration there, as you know, is good. So we saw good growth in Turbo as well. By the way, we expect that
to continue into the second half, which is a nice tailwind for that business and into 2014.
So it's not an individual business. It really is kind of – I mean there's a few exceptions that go the other way. But in
general, when you look across the Honeywell portfolio, China looks pretty good.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. And then just on restructuring, I mean obviously the story is well-understood on
Honeywell operationally. It's a much better company today than it was 8 or 10 years ago, to all of your credit on the
line.
It seems like you continue to find a lot of restructuring opportunities. I mean intuitively, I think they'd get harder to find
and they're longer payback. And instead, you continue to find them, and the paybacks are decent. Is it actually because
of HOS and other things that it was actually getting easier to find stuff to do? Things that maybe weren't obvious are
now jumping out? How do we get our head around that?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I would say we're never going to be devoid of ideas. And we were getting some of the
same kind of question, if you recall, Jeff, even 5 or 6 years ago.
And I think as long as we keep focused on those key process initiatives – so the Honeywell Operating System, as you
mentioned, where we're just getting to the point where we're 70% or 80% bronze, and we've still got silver and gold to
go, and there's big benefits in each of those cases. Functional Transformation – you've heard me say we expect another
1.5 to 2 points of margin expansion over time, just coming from that. And Velocity Product Development, which helps
to reduce the overall cost of R&D, and that frees up additional resources for us to be able to do more in new programs.
So, I'm going to point to all three of those and say every one of those initiatives helps us to come up with more and
more ideas as we go forward. And it's not like we're scraping the barrel to find ideas. There's still plenty more out there
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right, thanks.
<A - David John Anderson>: One thing maybe just to add to that very quickly is, Dave, kind of underpinning all of it,
is the continued investment that we make in the ERP -
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, exactly -
<A - David John Anderson>: – PPS implementation, which is a big enabler and foundation that's really supporting the
efficiency productivity across all of the items that Dave mentioned, Jeff.

<A - David M. Cote>: I think that's a good point, Dave, because that's particularly true in ACS. If you take a look at –
that's the business that has been the – I guess the most complicated to get SAP installed. And we're finally getting to a
critical mass there with – was it 60% or 65% -

And our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi. Just a question on Aerospace aftermarket. Could you give us more color by region as to how
this 2% improvement was across the globe?
<A - Elena Doom>: Sure. Andrew, so I guess the color I would start with is that, if you look at the large Air Transport
& Regional market, which is really the big commercial jets, the aftermarket there was up 2%. And what we really –
what we were looking at there is an indicator versus flight hours is the spares growth. So spares were up 4%. R&O was
down slightly.
From a regional perspective, I'd call out that China continues to see the same phenomena that we had in the first quarter
with spares down large double-digit, partially offset by about a mid-teens-percent growth in the R&O business.
So for total China, which again, we've been watching because the dynamics there have really shifted in 2013, the
overall aftermarket was down slightly, but significant – some good improvement versus the first quarter.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah, and that R&O growth, which you cited. And we had good numbers in the U.S.,
and we had good numbers in EMEA.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah.
<A - David John Anderson>: So that's what really supported it.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just to follow-up on the question on China, your strong performance there, can you guys
separate your strategy where you are taking market share, you're going to later markets versus the underlying markets?
How much of it is do you think macro on the ground versus how much of it is your – the company-specific strategy?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'd say that's a tough one to ever sort out. But I would say you're right about the focus on
becoming a Chinese competitor. It does make a difference. It's not the easiest markets to measure when it comes to
what the overall size is, but I do know that's making a difference. I'd be hard pressed to be able to say how much of the
growth is because of the market versus what we're doing specifically.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey. Just first a clarification on the comments on Defense, being down 8%, and kind of your
expectations in the second half of the year, heading into 2014. Is it still the expectation that 2014 still would look better
than 2013, given the international programs, or has that changed with sequestration?
<A - David John Anderson>: I think you'll see likely decline, Peter, in 2014 for D&S, but at a lesser rate than 4% that
we're forecasting guiding to for 2013.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay.
<A - David John Anderson>: We see some improvement in the rate of decline for D&S in 2014 I think would be our
current thinking.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. Thank you. And then back to...
<A - David M. Cote>: That's a positive statement, Peter. [laughter]
<A - David John Anderson>: It takes years to develop that. [laughter]
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Back to Jeff's question on the restructuring comments, in particular, I guess to Defense &
Space. Given the softness you're seeing, you've made a lot of progress already on all the enablers that you have across
all the businesses, but in particular, Aerospace. How do we think about restructuring opportunities as Defense kind of
softens here?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'd say for us, it's less of – whatever Defense decline we run into – I mean I think you've
heard me talk about this some in the past – it's not that big a deal for us when it comes to what's kind of the impact on
restructuring. Because Defense is more of a sales channel than it is a, let's say, specific market with specific products.
It's really just kind of similar jet engines that we make for commercial – go into military, APUs, the electronics.
So it's pretty easy for us to just shift the engineering resources and plant production from working on Defense to
working on Commercial. People don't need to move. You don't need to rehire anywhere. So it's pretty straightforward
for us.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And just if I could squeeze in one last one. On the electric taxi, which was a cool demo
in Paris, but how do we think about there – can you give us any sort of color on the customer interest that you saw?
And when will we expect to see some of those customers sign up? I know entry into service isn't until 2016, so...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. This one has been pretty cool, because when we first came out with the idea, there was a
lot of interest – more than I have to admit I really expected right from the beginning, because usually it takes some
time.
And the interesting part is that interest has grown, and the amount of publicity that we got for that electric taxi and the
increasing speed – so that it outraces a human today, and will do even better in the future – is pretty exciting.
So there's a huge amount of interest. I can't predict when the first order comes in, but I'm pretty confident in this
product. This really looks like we jointly have a winner here.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks.
<A - Elena Doom>: Zack, we have time for one more question before we hand the call back over to Dave Cote for his
final comments.

All right. We'll take our last question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, a couple things. First on Europe, you guys have been seeing some improvements
in Europe for the last couple quarters. What's better there? What's not?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, it's been – I'd say the short-cycle side has actually been showing improvement. And we're
not ready to declare victory on this one yet because it's kind of – it's tough to see the end-market or macro conditions
supporting a big bounce there. But it's been encouraging to see so far. The new product introductions that we've had do
help. Our expectations were low, and we've planned pretty conservatively.
But it's been pretty much across the board on the short-cycle side. Turbos, did better. The ACS businesses did better.
So it's been kind of across the board.
<A - David John Anderson>: And I mentioned earlier, Peter (sic) [Shannon] (59:34), we talked about the fact that -
<A - David M. Cote>: Shannon.
<A - David John Anderson>: I'm sorry – Shannon. We talked earlier too about the Aero business, and we saw good –
recently good numbers in terms of the EMEA or the European aftermarket for Aerospace, as well. So it's – as Dave
said, it's no single item.
But I mean the good news is when you look at our short-cycle businesses, to your point, Dave, against the backdrop of
the macros...
<A - David M. Cote>: Macros.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...it's really very good performance.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And then just on CapEx, we haven't really seen that go up yet year-to-date. I mean, is
that – is there any change to your plan there or is that going to ramp more kind of second half of this year and into 2014
and any color there?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say the plans haven't really changed, to your point. But, both the UOP and Fluorine's
plants, we need to build because we have the orders for them already. So, this is just more a matter of timing than
anything else.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah. And you would anticipate, given the point you make, Shannon, that's a good
observation that the third quarter, for example, we're going to see cash flow probably a little lower than prior year as a
result of that ramp-up in CapEx. So, we'll probably give back a little bit of that favorability that we've got on a
year-to-date basis, because we've got very nice cumulative free cash flow favorability going into the second half.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks.
David M. Cote
Okay, well, we continue to be confident in our ability to outperform even in this weak macro environment, and all the
seed planting we've done and continue to do for growth and productivity around the world and in every business makes
a huge difference for us. So, thank you for listening, and have a great summer. See you.
