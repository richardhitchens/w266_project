MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day. And welcome to the Altria Group Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled
to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator's
Instructions] Representatives of the investment community and media on the call will be able to ask questions
following the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Miss Sarah Knakmuhs, Vice
President, Investor Relations for Altria Client Services. Please go ahead ma'am.
Sarah Fitzgerald Knakmuhs
Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Altria's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We're here this morning
with Marty Barrington, Altria's Chairman and CEO, and Howard Willard, Altria's Chief Financial Officer.
This morning we will only be discussing Altria's business results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013.
And we will not be discussing the status of tobacco litigation. Our remarks contain forward looking and cautionary
statements and projections of future results. And I direct your attention to the forward looking and cautionary
statements section at the end of our earnings release for review of the various factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from projections.
Time periods referenced in these remarks are to the relevant 2013 period unless another year is identified. Similarly
comparisons are to the comparable year ago periods unless otherwise stated.
For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website,
Altria.com. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that

Thanks Sarah. Good morning everyone. In the first nine months of the year, Altria continued to execute against our
long term objectives of delivering consistent, adjusted diluted EPS growth in the range of 7% to 9% and maintaining a
strong and growing dividend.
Strong third quarter results driven by contributions across our businesses helped produce adjusted diluted EPS growth
of 9% for the first three quarters. Also during the third quarter we increased our dividend by 9.1%, marking the 47th
dividend increase in the last 44 years.
Overall our businesses are on track against their full year objectives and Altria remains focused on creating long term
value for shareholders. During both the quarter and the first nine months, our strategies and diverse business model
continued to produce strong results. Our tobacco operating companies grew adjusted operating company's income
behind their leading premium tobacco brands. And our alcohol assets also delivered income growth.
Additionally we used our capital structure to reward shareholders through share repurchases. And we expanded our
buyback program.
In the smokeable product segment PM USA balanced income growth with share gains in a competitive environment.
Higher pricing helped drive income growth in both the quarter and for the first nine months. PM USA grew its total
retail share in both periods and held Marlboro's retail share flat versus its strong performance in both periods a year
ago.
The Marlboro Black family continues to contribute to the brand's success and later this month, PM USA will expand
distribution of Marlboro Edge nationally. Marlboro Edge offers adult smokers bold, smooth, flavor.
In the third quarter PM USA benefited from stronger shipment volume as volume declines moderated versus the
previous quarters of 2013. PM USA's reported cigarettes shipments grew 1.2% for the third quarter. After adjusting for
calendar differences and changes in trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its third quarter domestic cigarette
shipment volume was down approximately 3%, less than the estimated 3.5% decline rate for the total cigarette
category. Also after adjusting for trade inventory changes, PM USA estimates that both its cigarette volume and total
category volume declined approximately 4% for the [audio gap] (4:45 – 4:48) with the 3% to 4% category decline rate
we've seen for the last couple of years.
Altria's smokeless product segment continued to perform well as higher pricing and higher volume drove strong
adjusted operating company's income growth for both the quarter and first nine months. USSTC grew Copenhagen and
Skoal's combined volume and retail share for both reporting periods.
In addition to producing strong results in our core businesses, we're developing innovative tobacco products for adult
tobacco consumers. In August Nu Mark introduced Mark Ten e-vapor products into a lead market in Indiana, and we're
pleased with the results so far. Further, Nu Mark [audio gap] (5:34 – 5:47) and our expectations for the rest of the year,
we're reaffirming Altria's guidance for 2013 full year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $2.36 to $2.41. This
represents a growth rate between 7% and 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.21 in 2012.
I'll now turn things over to Howard who will discuss our business results in more detail.

Thank you Marty. Good morning everyone. In the smokeable product segment third quarter reported operating
company's income grew by 11.5% primarily due to higher pricing, previously disclosed NPM arbitration panel decision
and higher reported shipment volume. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments, higher
resolution expense, and higher selling, general and administrative costs, due to the timing of spending.
For the first nine months of 2013 the smokeable product segment's reported operating company's income grew by 16%,
primarily due to PM USA's NPM adjustment settlement, the NPM arbitration panel decision and higher pricing. These
factors were partially offset by lower reported shipment volume and higher resolution expense.
Excluding the special items identified in our earnings press release, adjusted operating company's income for the
smokeable product segment grew by 3.1% to approximately $1.7 billion for the third quarter and increased by 2% to
approximately $4.8 billion for the first nine months. PM USA grew its total retail share by 0.2 of a share point to 50.7%
for the third quarter and by 0.3 of a share point to 50.6% for the first nine months.
Marlboro's retail share was unchanged versus both prior year periods at 43.7% for the quarter and 43.6% for the first
nine months. PM USA's discount share was 3.9% for both periods up 0.3 of a share point for the third quarter and up
0.5 of a share point for the first nine months. L&M contributed to PM USA's discount share gains in both periods.
Cigar shipment volume increased 6% for the third quarter and decreased 6.6% for the first nine months. Black & Mild's
retail share decreased 1.1 share points for the third quarter and 1.6 share points for the first nine months.
Turning to the smokeless product segment, reported operating company's income for the third quarter increased 12.6%,
primarily due to higher volume, higher pricing, and 2012 restructuring charges related to the current cost reduction
program. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional investments and higher selling, general and
administrative expenses.
For the first nine months of 2013 the segment's reported operating company's income increased 13.4%, primarily due to
the same factors that drove growth for the quarter, partially offset by higher promotional investments and unfavorable
mix due to the growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price. When adjusted for the special
items identified in our earnings press release, the smokeless product segment's operating company's income grew 9.1%
for both periods.
For the third quarter USSTC and PM USA's combined reported domestic smokeless product shipment volume
increased 9.5%, primarily due to one extra shipping day and volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal.
For the first nine months USSTC and PM USA's combined reported domestic smokeless product shipment volume
increased 6% due to volume growth for Copenhagen and Skoal, partially offset by declines for the other portfolio
brands. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined reported shipment volume increased 10.5% for the third quarter and 7.2%
for the first nine months.
After adjusting for an extra shipping day, trade inventory changes, and other factors, USSTC and PM USA estimate
that their combined domestic smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 4% for the third quarter. After
adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined domestic
smokeless product shipment volume grew approximately 5% for the first nine months, in line with estimated volume
growth for the smokeless products category over the 12 months ending September 30, 2013.
For the third quarter and first nine months, Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share increased 0.1 and 0.4 of a
share point respectively. USSTC and PM USA's combined retail share for the third quarter and first nine months
decreased 0.3 and 0.2 of a share point respectively, as retail share losses for Skoal and other portfolio brands were
mostly offset by retail share gains for Copenhagen.
Ste. Michelle grew operating company's income by 7.7% for the third quarter due to improved premium mix and higher
pricing, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower shipment volume. For the first
nine months Ste. Michelle grew operating company's income by 15.9% due to higher shipment volume, improved
premium mix, and higher pricing, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

Ste. Michelle's shipment volume decreased 2% for the third quarter, primarily due to changes in trade inventories. For
the first nine months Ste. Michelle's shipment volume grew 4.7%, primarily due to increased distribution to 14 Hands.
During the third quarter Altria paid $883 million in dividends and purchased shares valued at approximately $156
million.
Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. As a
reminder the tobacco product pricing and retail share figures are from the tracking services we introduced in the first
quarter of 2013. We'll also provide you with restated figures from the third quarter of 2012, so you will be able to
compare the periods.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 34% in the third quarter of 2013 and 35% in the
third quarter of 2012. Marlboro's net pack price in the third quarter of 2013 was $5.86, while the lowest effective priced
cigarette was $4.36. For the third quarter of 2012, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.77, while the lowest effective
priced cigarette was $4.27.
The cigarette discount category's retail share was 25.3% for the third quarter of 2013, flat versus the third quarter of
2012.
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax as of September 30, 2013, was $1.47 per pack, an increase of
6 cents per pack versus the third quarter of 2012. This includes the $1.60 per pack increase that took effect on July 1 in
Minnesota, the $1 per pack increase that took effect on July 31 in Massachusetts, and the 10 cent increase that became
effective August 1 in New Hampshire.
For the third quarter of 2013 Copenhagen's retail price was $4.06, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand
was approximately 36%. For the third quarter of 2012 Copenhagen's retail price was $4.02, and its price gap versus the
leading discount brand was approximately 37%.
CapEx was $49 million for the third quarter and $90 million for the first nine months of 2013. Ongoing depreciation
and amortization was $52 million for the third quarter. We estimate that 2013 full year ongoing depreciation and
amortization will be approximately $215 million.
Thank you for your time this morning. Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the
question and answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes
from the line of David Adelman from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Good morning everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Morning David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Marty, I was surprised in the discreet third quarter that the smokeless division's margins
were down with volume and pricing up. Can you just speak to that? What the factors were? And there was this allusion
to the timing of expenses. What exactly is going on there?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah it's just that costs come in and out of the quarter at different times, David. I think
the better number to look at the margin question is really the nine month period. You can see there that actually the
margin for that segment is up 0.6 of a percentage point to 42.2%. So that's how we look at it over time.
Again for sort of a larger reference point, if you look back to the period 2008 to 2012, as you know the segment really
grew its margin quite substantially by more than 7 percentage points. So I think a quarter's really too short a period to

look at this. There's nothing particularly significant except for timing.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then on e-cigarettes I'm curious having Mark Ten in the marketplace, what do
you know now about the product, about consumers' reaction to it in terms of consumers' overall view towards
e-cigarettes that you might not have known prior to actually being in the marketplace?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. That's a terrific question. Thank you for asking that. We're having a very
successful lead market in Indiana. It's too early obviously to be rummaging around I think in the numbers.
But here's what we know. It was very enthusiastically received by the trade. We were shooting to get coverage as you
know across where our cigarette volume is. We've got coverage in more than 3,000 stores covering about 85% of
cigarette volume. We've gotten very good consumer feedback about the product.
And we had a learning plan, the particulars of which I won't go into as you might expect for competitive reasons. But
we had several questions that we wanted to ask about our offering. And I think the lead market in Indiana has given us
excellent insight into the consumer, into the offering we have, its competitive position, how it's being received at the
trade.
And so as our announcement says this morning, it's on to Arizona. We've taken those learnings. We've incorporated
them into our offering that we will have in Arizona. Our aspiration there is to cover about 2,000 stores. And that's how
we're trying to learn our way in this emerging category. We have new consumers, new products. And we think that's
the right way forward. But we're really pleased with what we've learned in Indiana.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede from Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning everybody.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Morning.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Marty, your competitors this week have talked about the promotional environment in cigarettes
being less promotional. Is that a view that you share?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I think I would refer to what we typically said about the segment. It's a competitive
space. It has been competitive. It remains competitive.
I think what we've observed obviously as new products come in and out of the market and people try to get consumer
awareness of those, you see promotions from time to time. And that's what we would observe.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: So I interpret that as that you don't see much of a change then?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I think it's about what it has been, which is to say competitive.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Given that environment is there any opportunity for you to accelerate your price increases
in smokeables?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well that's our strategy always is to improve our profitability in the smokeable segment.
We look at that regularly as you know. That's done through a combination of factors including, this price increases and
changing our promotional levels as is appropriate.
As we discussed previously we can do that, not necessarily on a national level, but we can go into regions and states
and even markets to adjust those promotional levels. That's certainly our strategy. We're trying to maximize income,

And our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just want to ask first of all, on keeping the wide range of EPS for the year and
therefore has implications for the fourth quarter. Is there any unique to the fourth quarter we should consider, be it at
the low end or the high end of the range, anything unique to the comparisons?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: There's one that I would mention Chris, which is that there's one fewer shipping Monday
in the smokeless business. As you know a lot of volume goes out on our Mondays. And there's one fewer of those in
the fourth quarter than there was in the third quarter, so that's a factor. We're investing obviously in our e-vapor
business. So those are two factors I might bring to your attention.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then I wanted to ask, with a stronger volume performance this quarter not
only on an adjusted basis but on a reported basis, the OCI for smokeable – the smokeable segment came in a little
below my expectations. So I'm just curious if again there was anything unique to the costs this quarter? Or maybe even
the phasing of the cost savings? Are there any factors you can help us understand sort of the margin performance for
that division?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah again I think the best way to understand that Chris, is that this comes – is best
understood over time. We're trying to maximize income. We look at that over time. If you look back at some other
figures again for context, you know that they're higher in the – 2012 I think was 4.2.
So we are making investments in Marlboro. We continue to roll out the Marlboro architecture. We've improved the
website. We've got digital technology for our marketing platform now. So I think that's the way to understand it.
Howard, you may want to say more?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah. I mean I think just two comments on the third quarter. I mean when you look at year
over year pricing, I mean the price realization was affected by the comp from last year. And then there were more
expenses in the third quarter from a year over year trend perspective than there were in the first half.
But I don't think that that is particularly a change in trend. It's just that they just happened to fall more heavily in the
third quarter. And certainly part of that is related to the phasing in the cost reduction program. We got more of the cost
savings earlier in that program. But I still think to go back to the nine-month number is probably more reflective of the
overall trend.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay that's very helpful. If I could, just one quick follow up to that, to the e-vapor
question that David asked about, the change – in your comment how you've made some changes. Are you – some
learnings, especially from Indiana. Was there any change to the actual physical product that you're selling in Arizona?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I'm not going to kind of get ahead of what we're going to do in Arizona. But I can tell
you that we're always looking at the product. I think we've talked earlier that for this product Chris, it's on the earlier
part of the technology curve probably than the later part of the curve. So we're consistently looking at that product to
see if we can improve its acceptability to the adult tobacco consumer.

And there are – as you know the way we think about going to market is through our value equation with not just
product or price and promotions and packaging and the like. We're looking at all of that to make sure that our total

And your next question comes from Vivian Azer from Citi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: I wanted to circle back on the timing of the investment spending. I mean I heard you loud
and clear that more investment to come on the e-vapor business. Should part of the investment timing that we saw drive
the increase in SG&A reverse out in the fourth quarter? Or is there more incremental spending to come in 4Q?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Well I think specifically looking at our investment in e-vapor, there's been a ramp up in
the back half. And I think probably a further ramp up in the fourth quarter. Obviously with a new test market being
opened up. I think as it relates to expenses in the rest of the business, I think that that is more of a third quarter
phenomenon.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Okay understood. And on your smokeless business, it looks like maybe Copenhagen is
finding its footing from a price gap perspective. Kind of holding steady at 36% and potentially finding an inflection
point in the average price per tin. Can you comment how you view Copenhagen from a price gap perspective today?
And where it can go from here?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well I guess I'd start again with the strategy, which is we're trying to make sure that
Copenhagen and Skoal are growing together. And you saw that in the numbers both for the quarter and the nine
months. Together they're growing their volume quite nicely. They're growing their retail share.
Copenhagen as you know we put some SKUs there Vivien, that really have taken off. That includes products that
compete at the popular price level. And it's that mix I think that you may be referring to. We're pretty happy overall
with Copenhagen's performance in the marketplace. It's a very highly differentiated product, and we like its
performance.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Terrific. And one last one on the smokeless business. It looks like Skoal's market share
declines are accelerating. Can you dive a little bit deeper into what's driving that?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. I think as we've discussed previously, we've been working hard at Skoal. That's a
brand that required some further work on its positioning at the time that we acquired that brand. We've been hard at
work at Skoal.
Obviously we started first with Copenhagen. Copenhagen has really taken off as we've given it its SKUs and gotten it
positioned correctly in the marketplace. The strategy I think continues to work quite effectively because of the
combination. But there's no denying that we would like to see Skoal's share stabilized. And we're working very hard to
make sure that that happens.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough. Thank you very much.

<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. In terms of Edge you mentioned you're rolling it out nationally later this month. So could
you talk about this national rollout relative to your recent roll out of Marlboro NXT? And what are the similarities and
potential differences of your rollout plans? And which line do you believe has the most upside potential?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Good question. I think it's best understood in the context of expanding the
Marlboro Black family. And so we know how we do this right? We look for places in the market where there may be
an unmet need. Or there's a place in our portfolio to look for attracting competitive smokers to our brands.
Edge is but the latest of that. It's very similar actually to the approach with NXT, which is we try to put the market in
front of the consumer. We try to learn. If successful we try to expand it. We try to raise awareness through some
introductory pricing. And then we try to move it onto the promotional platform that's best. But I think it's best
understood as part of the Marlboro architecture, and in this case Marlboro Black in particular.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And then Marty, I'm curious how you think broadly about line extensions? And
maybe what the right number of line extensions there should be on any kind of – or any of your brands? And if there's a
point where there might be too many extensions that could possibly hurt Marlboro's brand equity? I just want to
understand your thinking there.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: It's a good question. You always want to be thoughtful about your brand portfolio and
we examine that rigorously. We never bring an SKU to market simply for the sake of bringing it to market. We have to
satisfy ourselves generally speaking that there is a consumer need for it, and that it fits in with our overall brand
strategy.
And in Marlboro's case in particular, we always want to make sure that any SKU we bring to the market is going to
enhance its equity and its premiumness. And we don't bring anything out on the Marlboro portfolio until we've gone
through those filters. And Marlboro Edge is a good example I think where we have satisfied ourselves. We have high
expectations for Edge to add to the overall portfolio, as well as to contributing to Marlboro's equity.
But you're right. You have to be thoughtful about your portfolio. And we try to do that particularly on Marlboro but
certainly on all our brands.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay then just my final question on Mark Ten. Just a bit of a follow on question. How did it
perform relative to your internal expectations? And what have your repeat purchase trends been in this state? And then
I'm curious if you're seeing quite a bit of dual usage with cigarettes? Just any other consumer trends.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Again I think it's too early to talk about the numbers, because I just don't think that
they're well developed enough to share and to be confident in them.
But I can tell you that with respect to who is trying the products in e-vapor generally, we do know that there is dual use.
And in particular as adult smokers try e-vapor products, we know that some of them mare satisfied. Others are not.
Some of them use them situationally.
We have a pretty robust as you might expect consumer research program into who adult vapors are, their patterns of
use, how they may be segmenting the products that we want. And that's all part of our learning plan in Indiana, And
again for proprietary reasons I'm not going to discuss that at this time, but I can tell you that we've learned a lot. It's
informed our judgment about moving forward in Arizona. And we're very excited about being able to move this
platform forward.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Thank you.

And our next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: First just I just wanted to get clarification on the wholesale inventory level at the end of the third
quarter. I think some your competitors have also noted a movement to really limit inventory loading in fourth quarter
ahead of the price increase speculation. So just wondering if you expect a similar limitation to put on wholesalers and
that potentially limits some of the volatility this we continue to see on a quarter to quarter basis on the inventory
movement?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well we have an allocation program that we've had for a long time. So that's hardly
anything new to us. And with respect to the third quarter inventory levels I think we referenced there's a bit of a build,
but there's nothing that's very significant in cigarette inventory levels from third quarter to third quarter a year ago in
our observation.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then a couple of questions on the e-cigarettes. I think this is more of a broad category
question. And now that you have participation in the category, I'm just curious to your observation about the pace of
category growth that you're seeing at this point versus maybe a year ago? Sequentially it looks like the pace of that
category growth is a little more modest.
Just curious to what you think is driving that? And whether we really need something, a bigger innovation or better
consumer acceptance to really accelerate a category growth? And then related to that just in terms of how your dialogue
with some of the regulators both at the FDA level and at the state legislators are evolving as you now have a stake in
the category with your product?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks. Those are all excellent questions.
Let's talk first of all about the category. Obviously the category has grown very quickly off a very low base. Whether it
will continue to grow at that trajectory of course no one knows yet. We've identified I think the factors that are likely to
be contributing to that. We've run scenarios against these. We've talked about these previously I think.
One is the product itself. As the products get better and become more acceptable to adult smokers, you would expect
for perhaps greater transition to the product.
Second is regulation. If they're regulated very heavily by the FDA in ways that don't encourage adult smokers to try
them or to switch to them, depending on what the FDA says about that, that certainly is going to have a big effect on
the category growth. And then of course we have to deal with excise taxes.
We have engaged with all of the stakeholders in those questions for some time now, including I would say before we
even entered Indiana. We have strong views on this. We think that the FDA should regulate on a scientific basis. And
we have been communicating with FDA regularly about both the category and our product.
The same has been true with respect to excise taxes. I think you know we have a robust government affairs
organization. We have a lot of experience there. We're trying to help legislators think about the correct excise tax
approach, which in many ways is bound up in the same question as the regulatory approach. And so we're fully
engaged on this.
And I think as to how fast it grows or how slow it grows, those will be the factors in our view that will determine that
largely.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Filippe Goossens from Mitsubishi Security.
<Q - Filippe Marcel Goossens>: Yes good morning Marty. Thanks for taking my call. A couple of questions...
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning.
<Q - Filippe Marcel Goossens>: ...as well on e-cigs if I may. One of your competitors stated yesterday they see e-cigs
as actually a global opportunity, hence their acquisition of a player in the UK market. Is there an understanding
between yourselves and PMI as to your ability to enter that space as well globally, if that is what you would decide to
do at some point in time?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well I think you refer back obviously to the spin-off of PMI. And there were
arrangements in place of course dealing with the existing businesses at that time which was cigarettes. Obviously
e-cigarettes and e-vapor as a category that has emerged since that time, so the answer is no.
<Q - Filippe Marcel Goossens>: Okay and then secondly probably still too early to tell, but based on your current read
with regard to the potential of e-cigs now in the U.S., do you think that at some point in time this could start
cannibalizing the smokeless category as well?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well we'll have to see I guess. We haven't really been – the question usually comes in
the form of whether it's going to take some volume away from cigarettes. And what we've said there of course is that
it's still small. It's hard to tease that out. We know that some adult smokers are certainly trying e-cigarettes. And so it
will have some affect on volume. But you can't tease it out. We haven't seen very much about that on smokeless, but I
guess time will tell.
<Q - Filippe Marcel Goossens>: Okay great. Thanks very much, Marty.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thank you for calling in.

Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Good morning. When you're launching Marlboro Edge now, does that have any impact
on the rest of how you think about discounting and promotions on the rest of Marlboro Black? And has it allowed you
to dial back any of the discounting levels on other SKUs there?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well Marlboro Edge is a premium product, and it's in the premium family of Marlboro.
What we try to do there is to offer introductory pricing to try to attract competitive adult smokers to it. So that's I think
the best way to understand that, which is it's a premium offering. We do offer some promotions to try to get some
awareness and certainly trial because we think if they try it, they'll like it.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Yeah I guess what I'm getting at is you've had some of these similar launches over the
last couple years now, and some of these ones that are one or two or more years old. How long does introductory
pricing last? I mean is there some color you can give on what the discount levels are doing on these ones that have had
introductory pricing? Is that sort of passing the baton to Marlboro Edge now? Or do some of those still have more
extended periods of an introductory pricing level?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well I think the way to think about it is, is the total competitive set. So you want to have
introductory pricing to try to make sure that the product has awareness that it's out there, that it's a new product, and
that it's available.
We also offer, as you grow brands and as you know in this category, brands don't grow overnight. And particularly
when you have a big share like we do in Marlboro, bigger than the next 10 brands combined, these are trends that take

place over time. And so we have promotional plans in place for them that we evolve over time. But it's always designed
to how we're doing against the competitive set of adult competitive smokers. And that's how we think about it. As
you've heard us discuss many, many times, we take the long view in this business and with this segment. And we're
patient.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay thanks. And then just looking at the other segment, there was the help in the what
used to be PMCC plus other line from what looks like an asset sale. Can you give any sense of how much impact that
might have had? Or what that run rate would have looked like without that there?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah I mean we're not breaking out the other between the various contributors. But
certainly within the third quarter you had a contribution from PMCC, and then the other item in there is our
investments in the e-vapor category. And so that results from combination of the two.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: All right. And then you mentioned on 4Q, it is just one less shipping day specifically for
the smokeless segment? Or is that for everything?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Smokeless only.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. And just kind of following up on Judy's question on the inventory, is there a
build? It looks like you might have had a modest build into or at the end of 3Q? Is there much of an impact you would
expect that to have on 4Q shipments to kind of make up for it?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah. I don't think that – we did have a modest build in the third quarter and that compares
to the prior year when there was a modest drawdown in inventory. But I don't – I wouldn't expect that it's going to have
much impact on the fourth quarter. But it's too soon to tell. I think we're going to have to see how things shake out in
the latter part of the quarter.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. Thank you very much.

And at this time we have now reached the media portion of our question and answer session. Your next question comes
from Chris Burritt from Bloomberg News.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Marty I wanted to ask about e-cigs, kind of a
broader question. As they gain popularity around the country, I'm guessing that companies are beginning to look into
whether to allow vaping in the workplace. How do you see that playing out? And what are the factors, FDA regulation
and others, that's going to direct or considering – I'm sorry what factors are going to guide how vaping in the workplace
plays out?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay. Thanks for your question. Our view on that is it should be guided by the science.
As the science develops around vaping and in this case your question really goes to the heart of is there any risk from
secondhand vaping if you will.
And as FDA looks at all of these questions, I think that there you need a scientific and an evidence based approach to
that. What we would like to see in the short term is that regulation should have a good reason for its basis. And in the
absence of a reason or knowledge about that, we would like obviously to have FDA to have an opportunity to do the
work that's required. So I think it will follow from the science. It will follow from the evidence. And we're engaging
with FDA and other regulators about that.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Thank you very much.

And your next question comes from Thomas Russo from Gardner Russo.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Hi good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi Tom.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Hi good morning. Couple of questions on excise taxes. At cigarette excise tax level,
any upcoming planned increases? And if not what are the prospects for any federal excise tax activity?
Second, as for the smokeless category, where do you stand in the process of converting states from ad valorem to
specific? And what's the general level of excise taxes looking out for the next 12 months for the smokeless?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay let me take those in turn. Let me start with the FET. Tom, as you know there is a
proposal that was floated in the budget. And there is some activity trying to persuade people to get behind that. We
oppose that as you know.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Yeah.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: These taxes are regressive. There was a huge increase in 2009. So far there has not been
a lot of traction on that, but we're monitoring that carefully with our federal government affairs team.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Good.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Second question Tom, was about smokeless and ad valorem. We continue obviously to
advocate where it's appropriate to do so to move to weight base. We think that's a much fairer system. There are
opportunities that present itself into states from time to time to advance that argument. And we do that forcefully when
we have opportunities to do that.
I would say the FET outlook generally is – Howard in his remarks I think covered what we've seen so far, both with
respect to – really with respect to cigarettes. And we're always guarded. The state budgets are better than they were, but
they're – still have gaps in them, and we're watchful. You may have seen there was a media report on a proposal for an
excise tax increase in the city of Chicago. So these things pop up from time to time. And our approach to them is to try
to get in there and advocate for why they're unfair on our adult tobacco consumers.
<Q - Thomas Adrian Russo>: Good. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.
