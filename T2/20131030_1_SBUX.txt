Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I am very pleased to discuss the record Q4 and fiscal
2013 results that Starbucks reported today. Q4 capped off what was without question the best year in Starbucks'
42-year history, driven by robust innovation and disciplined operating, and financial performance across each of our
business segments, and virtually around the world.
Continued strong comparable store sales growth of 8% in each of our Americas and China/Asia Pacific regions in Q4,
combined with positive comps of 2% in EMEA to produce global comp store sales of 7%, marking our 15th
consecutive quarter of comp growth in excess of 5%, despite continued challenging economic and consumer headwinds
in many of the global markets we serve.
Starbucks consolidated Q4 revenue rose 13% to a record $3.8 billion, while operating leverage and the continued focus
on controlling expenses enabled us to expand our operating margin to a full 220 basis points over last year to a
quarterly record of 17.6%. And outstanding execution across the company enabled us to deliver a record Q4 EPS of
$0.63 a share to our shareholders, a full 37% over last year's Q4, and the highest EPS of any single quarter in the
42-year history of our company.
For the full fiscal 2013, Starbucks increased revenues by 12% to a record $14.9 billion, expanded its operating margin
150 basis points to a record 16.5%, and drove a 26% increase in EPS to a record $2.26 per share.
Noteworthy and immensely gratifying is that each one of our business segments contributed to our remarkable
performance in fiscal 2013. Equally significant is that each segment contributed to growing the equity and trust of the
Starbucks brand around the world.
With over 3 billion customer visits to our more than 19,000 stores in 62 countries around the world in fiscal 2013,
Starbucks is literally firing on all cylinders like never before.
Let me tell you, we're just getting started. I believe that fiscal 2013 will prove to be an inflection point and a
springboard to even greater opportunity and success in the future. Because of the strategic flywheel we introduced to
you in July, through which we leverage our global store footprint growing CPG presence in world-class digital and
mobile assets is driving performance and gaining increased momentum.
I'll provide a brief overview of segment performance in Q4, and then turn the call over to John Culver, Group
President, Starbucks Coffee China, Asia/Pacific, and Channel Development and Emerging Brands to provide detail in
those key businesses. Then Troy will take you through the financials in detail and provide you with an update on our
fiscal 2014 outlook.
Let me pause and congratulate Troy, as I look to him, on his promotion to Group President, Global Business Services,
in addition to his ongoing role and responsibility as CFO. Thank you, Troy for your leadership, our 20-year partnership,
and for the tremendous contributions you have made to the business as CFO over the last 5 years.
Now turning to the Americas. The momentum we reported in Starbucks Americas segment in Q3 continued in Q4, with
a stunning 8% comp growth driven by a 5% increase in traffic, and a 3% lift in ticket.
Noteworthy is that the 8% comp growth we recorded in the U.S. in Q4, an amazing accomplishment given the size and
maturity of the store base we are comping against, representing our 15th consecutive quarter of U.S. comp growth in
excess of 7%, and that many of our over 2,000 new renovated or relocated U.S. stores were the strongest performers.
Strong performance in both our U.S. and rapidly-growing Latin American businesses contributed to 11% increase in
total Q4 Americas revenue to a record $2.8 billion.

Having just returned from a market visit to Canada, a great Starbucks market with over 1,300 stores, where I witnessed
firsthand the deep passion and sensitive mission that our partners were bringing to their customers in the communities
they serve, and the strong leadership provided by Annie Young-Scrivner, President of Starbucks Canada is bringing to
the market. In Q4, we recorded the strongest comp growth in Canada in 13 quarters, helping us exceed $1 billion of
full-year revenues in that market for the first time ever.
Building on a the strong summer sales in September, the Americas region kicked-off for its fall promotional calendar
with what has become our most popular seasonal beverage ever, Pumpkin Spice Latte. 2013 marks the 10th anniversary
of PSL with customers having purchased more than 200 million PSL beverages since launch.
Despite the proliferation of knock-offs and copycat, sales of Starbucks PSL beverages are as strong as ever, and once
again exceeding expectations as customers continue to embrace the quality of the original Starbucks PSL.
Also, in September, we debuted a new single-origin coffee from Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, and in recognition of
our 42-year history, are purchasing Colombian coffee, and our plans to open our first store in Colombia next year, we
introduced Colombia Caldas, a wonderful Starbucks Reserve.
Recently, we launched a national marketing campaign around coffee entitled Starbucks Higher Arabica Standards that
will benefit both our retail stores and CPG businesses. These initiatives underscore Starbucks' ongoing commitment to
bring in the world's most rare and exotic coffees to our customers, and to constantly re-affirming our coffee leadership
and authority worldwide.
In Q4, we also made solid progress against our plans to expand our La Boulange baked goods platform. La Boulange
products are now available in more than 3,500 Starbucks stores in the U.S., and we are now on track to offer La
Boulange in all 7,000 company-operated stores in the U.S. by the end of fiscal 2014.
Food continues to be an important component of our growth strategy, and we are extremely encouraged by both
customer response to La Boulange, and the sales lift we are seeing over the food products La Boulange replaced.
Building on this success, we have begun testing new La Boulange lunch concepts in a number of our San Francisco
stores, and targeting an initial rollout next fall as part of our plan to elevate and expand our lunchtime day parts.
In the year since we acquired La Boulange, we have demonstrated the significant strategic benefits of the acquisition
through the enhanced quality of our food platform, and the corresponding sales incrementality it is driving.
You have also undoubtedly heard that we are exploring another exciting innovative concept: Starbucks handcrafted
carbonated beverages in Atlanta and Austin, as well as in Japan and Singapore. These efforts are part of a larger plan to
enter and innovate in the cold carbonation industry, an over $100 billion global category, by leveraging our unique,
customized beverage retail platform expertise to deliver innovation and personalization to customers like no other
industry participant ever has. Customer response to our carbonation innovation has been encouraging, and we look
forward to sharing more details around our plans for cold carbonation in the months ahead. Stay tuned.
And beginning this Friday, we will begin rolling out Starbucks holiday beverages in our iconic red cups. A new
Gingerbread Latte recipe and the Savory La Boulange Almond Croissant will join a wide variety of other innovative
and delicious offerings that promise to make this holiday and winter season our most exciting and successful yet.
Turning to the EMEA region, I'm very pleased to report that the early progress we began to see in our Europe, Middle
East, and Africa region in Q3 continued in Q4, with positive 2% comp growth to the second consecutive quarter.
As I have previously shared with you, the leverage and learning from our U.S. transformation combined with strong
leadership in the region are driving beverage and food innovation and efforts to elevate and enhance the customer
experience across the region as we opened our 2,000th EMEA store this quarter.
We are particularly encouraged by the solid performance we saw in the UK, our single largest market in the region,
supporting our view that an early turnaround in EMEA may be underway, and that we are moving down the correct
path towards sustained profitability. We also opened 34 new license and franchise stores in Q4, early progress against

our plans to add more licensed and franchised stores in our EMEA portfolio.
Let me now turn to Channel Development and Emerging Brands. John will be providing an update on our fast-growing
Channel Development and Emerging Brands business, but a few noteworthy highlights I'd like to share with you. We
have already exceeded the aggressive growth plans we laid out for Evolution Fresh upon acquiring the business and
brand in November 2011. A wide selection of fresh, healthy Evolution Fresh juices are now available in more than
8,000 Starbucks and grocery retailer cold cases and almost all Whole Foods locations nationwide.
Earlier this month, we reached a significant milestone with the opening of our new state-of-the-art juicery in California.
The new juicery will employ 190 Starbucks partners, and quadruple our capacity to produce Evolution Fresh brand
cold-pressed juices, enable us to accelerate our plan to significantly increase our share of the $1.6 billion
super-premium juice category.
As I've said in the past, the category of tea, a $90 billion global industry that is ripe for innovation, is another major
strategic opportunity for us that leverages all of our core capabilities and existing infrastructure.
We are making significant progress against our plans to integrate, develop and expand the Teavana retail platform. Last
week, we were in New York City for the grand opening of a reimagined Teavana fine tea and tea bar store on the Upper
East Side, to be followed by a second store in Seattle's University Village shortly. The store in New York is stunning,
but beyond the aesthetics, the reimagined Teavana store brings the romance and theater of handcrafted beverages to the
tea category like never before.
We are convinced that with Teavana, Starbucks can reinvent and do for tea just what we have done for coffee, and that
we can grow and expand the tea industry and the tea bar concept by introducing a wide, innovative array of handcrafted
tea beverages, tea-inspired food, and world-class tea merchandise.
And with tea being a larger opportunity than coffee outside of the U.S. and Canada, we see a future with Teavana stores
across North America and around the world. What first drew us to Teavana was the company's unmatched knowledge
and authority around all things tea. Then we learned about Teavana's extraordinary tea-sourcing expertise and
capabilities.
In the quarters ahead, you will see how we are expanding and deepening the presence of high-quality Teavana branded
teas within Starbucks stores in order to leverage tea as a driver of additional customer occasions creating wide
recognition for the Teavana brand, and adding another layer of growth within Starbucks stores. The opportunity to
innovate within the global tea category is significant, and we are poised to bring an unparalleled retail experience to
customers around the world.
Let me turn to mobile, digital and loyalty. Perhaps no single competency and capability is enabling us to elevate and
amplify the Starbucks brand, and to deliver an enhanced Starbucks Experience to our customers more than our global
leadership position and continued investment in mobile, digital and loyalty innovations and technologies. And no single
competency is more important to the success of our proprietary strategic flywheel that is adding so much value to the
Starbucks brand and our financial performance.
Fiscal 2013 was another significant record year for our card program, with over $4 billion loaded globally, and nearly
one-third of all North American store tender paid with a Starbucks Card.
At the same time, our loyalty program expansion continued around the world, including 11 significant new markets
including Germany, Hong Kong and the Philippines.
We've also begun integrating our Emerging Brands and adding a number of exciting new features to the My Starbucks
Rewards program. Members can now earn and redeem My Starbucks Rewards stars in Teavana stores, and redeem
stars for Evolution Fresh juices and other bottled Starbucks ready-to-drink beverages in Starbucks stores, all of which
further leverage our world-class card and mobile payment programs, providing enhanced value to our customers.
Today with 11% of our U.S. and Canada in-store transactions being paid for with a mobile device, Starbucks is far
away the clear leader in mobile payment. We are encouraged by how our customers have fully embraced our mobile

apps as the most convenient way to pay, reload and keep track of their loyalty rewards.
And with the current average of over 4 million mobile transactions per week and more than 8 million customers using
our mobile app, Starbucks Mobile platforms are fast growing customer touch points. Through them, we are
communicating with and delivering innovation to our customers in a way that no other retailer can and on the horizon,
our enhancement for our mobile apps that include mobile ordering and digital tipping are on its way.
As we enter the last two months of calendar 2013, we do so with exciting plans for Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving and
the Christmas holiday shopping season that we know will delight our customers and further add to our operational and
financial momentum. There simply has never been a more exciting or more important time for our company. I'd like to
conclude by congratulating and thanking my 200,000 fellow partners who proudly wear the green apron for the
exemplary results we've achieved in 2013 and extending my heart felt appreciation to them for all they do for our
customers all around the world every day.
Now I want to close on a very personal note. Fiscal 2013 was the year in which Starbucks recorded record financial and
operating performance. It was also a year in which we delivered record value to our shareholders with over $20 billion
increase in market cap alone. But a record of which I'm particularly proud of is that in fiscal 2013 our partners, our
employees realized also over $230 million in value as a result of the commitment we've made over 20 years ago to link
returns to our shareholders and rewards to our people as well by providing equity in the company to all of our full and
part-time workers who work more than 20 hours a week.
It is evidenced that 25 years ago, when we set out to build a great enduring company, we said we want to achieve the
balance between profitability and a social conscience, by sharing our success with our people, by providing a great
opportunity for our customers and doing everything we can to enhance the communities we are doing business with.
This has been a phenomenal year – a stunning year for our company. And for all of us at Starbucks it is with great pride
that we present Q4 and year-end results to you.
John?
John Culver
Great. Thank you, Howard. 2013 was indeed an extraordinary year for Starbucks. And I couldn't be more proud of the
significant role the China and Asia Pacific region and the Channel Development business is playing in our overall
success.
I'll begin with the incredibly strong results for CAP, Starbucks' fastest growing region with 13 countries, close to 4,000
stores and nearly 70,000 partners serving 11 million customers every week. As you can see from our results the growth
throughout the region continues to be a meaningful component of Starbucks' overall story.
For the quarter, I'm very pleased to share that the region is reporting record results in three key areas. Total revenue,
total operating income and new stores opened. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew a very healthy 29%, reaching $256
million, which was driven by an 8% comp growth and the opening of 588 net new stores in the year. This store growth
represents a 31% increase over the prior year.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered $96 million in operating income, which represents a 46% increase over the prior
year. Operating margin increased to 37.5%, a 440 point basis point improvement over last year. This was driven by a
combination of strong sales leverage, lower operating costs and a reduction to our estimated asset retirement
obligations on certain store leases.
Today, we have a very well balanced portfolio of company-operated, joint venture and licensed markets, led by China
and Japan. And these results demonstrate the strength of the Starbucks brand and the relevancy we are gaining with our
customers across the region.
We continue to take a holistic approach to building the Starbucks brand in our markets, while making the necessary
investments ahead of the curve that will fuel our future growth. We now have localized capabilities in the region not

only in store operations, real estate and marketing and category, but also in the critical areas of store design, R&D,
supply chain and IT.
Coupled with the recent announcement of Jeff Hansberry as President for the region, we're now in a position to
integrate Channel Development into our markets, and expand the Starbucks footprint beyond our retail stores.
In the quarter, we reached two significant milestones. We opened our 1,000th stores in both China and Japan. The
stores that we are building today across the region are some of the most unique and innovative store designs we have
anywhere in the world. This is highlighted by the most recent opening of our two newest flagship stores in Beijing.
These stores are designed to elevate the coffee experience for our customers, and to further enhance and differentiate
the third-place experience from anything else that exists in the market.
Digital also continues to be a huge opportunity and focus for us in the region. We have now introduced the Starbucks
Card and aspects of our loyalty program in 11 of the 13 countries we operate in. We are seeing significant transaction
with the card program in all markets, as it now accounts for 23% of tender across the region.
From a customer perspective, our satisfaction and quality scores are achieving record levels. The frequency of our
customer visits continues to increase, and we continue to attract new customers into our stores, reflected by a 6%
increase in transactions for the quarter.
Turning to China, we have been humbled by the way in which our customers have embraced the Starbucks Experience,
and recognize that we must continue to earn their trust and respect each and every day. We have seen firsthand that
Starbucks is increasingly becoming a daily ritual for local Chinese. Key drivers for this have been our innovative store
designs, local product innovations and the My Starbucks Rewards program, where in just two short years, we've built a
base of over 3 million members, and it has now grown to account for 35% of transactions in our stores.
For the year, we opened 317 new stores in China, and the initial performance of those new stores is very strong. The
stores that we opened in 2012 are currently averaging sales in excess of $700,000, while our 2013 class of stores are on
track to annualize with a very similar result. Not surprisingly, China will again be the largest driver of the
approximately 750 new stores we plan to open across the region in 2014.
Beyond China, we are accelerating growth in every other market. I'm particularly encouraged by our strong results in
future growth opportunities in key geographies, including Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. And I'd like to also
congratulate our India partners on the one-year anniversary of the market. Through our relationship with Tata, we have
opened 25 stores and the response of our customers has been nothing short of amazing, which gives us tremendous
optimism for the future growth prospects for this market.
Finally, we have a very long runway for growth across the region based on the foundation we have built for our brand
and the investments we continue to make, and I remain extremely confident in our ability to drive strong comparable
store growth, while balancing the rapid expansion of our new store footprint well into the future.
As optimistic as I am about the future growth opportunity, we have at CAP, I'm just as excited about the long-term
opportunity for our Channel Development business. With fiscal 2013 revenue of $1.4 billion, operating income of more
than $400 million, a very robust operating margin near 30%, and a portfolio of market-leading products, Channel
Development has become a meaningful contributor to Starbucks' results and is directly benefiting from the strategic
flywheel, Howard mentioned earlier.
In the fourth quarter, Channel Development grew revenue by 13% to $361 million. At the same time, operating income
of $128 million grew more than two times faster than revenue in Q4, accelerating to 30% growth on the benefit of
lower coffee costs and leverage from our strong top line growth.
In Q4, we were able to stabilize and grow dollar and pound share in 11 of the 13 weeks for our premium roast and
ground packaged coffee. This was due in part to the list price reduction we took in May.
We're also encouraged by the synergy we are creating with the emerging growth drivers such as linking the My
Starbucks Rewards program to our packaged coffee business, where our customers have earned more than 1.5 million

stars since launch. We also continue to work with key retailers to increase our presence through the Starbucks signature
aisle.
Already in 100 grocery stores today and with plans to reach 400 by the end of the fiscal year signature aisle
quantitatively elevates our brand, while enhancing the customer experience. The combination of value, rewards and our
premium positioning will allow us to continue our leadership position in premium packaged coffee.
Additionally, premium single serve continues to drive accelerated growth for the business with Starbucks K-Cups
growing sales 42% in the prior 13 week period. We have a very diverse portfolio of K-Cup offerings that gives us the
premium leadership position down the aisle.
In the quarter, we added vanilla and caramel-flavored coffee to our K-Cup line-up and we will continue to bring new
flavors and varieties to the market through our expanded relationship with Green Mountain in 2014.
It has now been a year since we launched Verismo and we're looking forward to another successful holiday season.
This year, we have significantly increased the number of doors we will be in for the holidays. Introduced a new
machine with a fresh design and functionality and are offering several new SKUs to drive the success of this platform.
We remain very optimistic about the large and growing opportunity we have to expand Starbucks beyond our retail
stores, given the performance of the business throughout 2013. Our competition down the aisle continues to increase,
both in terms of the emergence of the value segment and increased promotional activity in the coffee category overall,
we are in a position to win.
Although, we may experience volatility quarter-to-quarter, we will continue to elevate our brand through market
leading innovation, strong cross channel rewards, which leverages our MSR program and meaningful value and
differentiation. Make no mistake, we are committed to delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth for this
segment in 2014 and beyond.
In closing, I'm incredibly proud and want to thank and recognize all of our partners throughout China and Asia Pacific
and within our Channel Development business for the significant contributions they have made to the overall success of
the company. It is through their efforts that we have been able to deliver these record results and it's why we believe we
are poised and positioned to capture the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Troy. Troy?
Troy Alstead
Thanks, John. Let's turn now to the Americas segment, where the fourth quarter represented an impressive continuation
of the strength delivered in Q3. Revenue growth of 11% was driven by an 8% comp growth, including a 5% lift in
transactions.
And as the case has been for quite some time now, there were a diverse set of drivers behind the growth. In the U.S.,
food continues to boost our sales adding about 2 percentage points to the comp in the quarter. That is a result of gains
in both attach rate and favorable mix in both lunch and bakery items.
Food is a key driver behind our strength in the lunch hours of 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., our fastest growing day part and the
one with the highest incremental profit potential. The Pumpkin Spice platform now in its 10th year once again
delivered strong growth. Additionally, our focus on summer refreshment and iced beverages was a success. Those
promotions combined for 1 point of comp.
Treat Receipt was a hit again this year with a 16% higher redemption rate than last year. And as a result of the
favorable mix shift in food, as well as recent pricing actions, ticket growth contributed 3 percentage points to comp in
Q4; its highest contribution in 2 years.

While food was the single largest driver of U.S. comp in Q4, La Boulange in just 15% of our stores for the entire
quarter does not yet have the reach to contribute meaningfully. It has, however, been very meaningful in stores that
carry it, which is encouraging to us as we proceed with the rollout.
Profitability remains strong in the Americas, as operating income grew 16% to $606 million in Q4, with operating
margin expanding 100 basis points to 21.8%. Sales leverage continues to be the primary driver of margin expansion in
the Americas.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, fourth quarter results demonstrated the improvement that has been building over the
past two years. EMEA revenue grew 3%, driven by an increase in the number of licensed stores and sales growth
within them. Our largest licensed markets in the EMEA are among the best-performing, including the Middle East and
Russia. We were also able to sustain 2% comp growth in our company-operated EMEA markets, despite a still
challenging macro environment.
Profitability continues to improve in EMEA as well, with Q4 operating income reaching $27 million, the highest level
of quarterly income since we started reporting EMEA as a separate segment in 2010.
Our ongoing store portfolio optimization effort, which we embarked upon a year ago, has been critically important in
several ways. We've ramped up store development with licensees, adding stores that are delivering excellent sales,
strong profitability and high return on capital.
We've refocused our efforts in company-operated stores to those with a strong combination of excellent real estate, a
practical cost structure, and demographics that support sales levels that drive profitability.
This optimization program, led to the closure of 72 underperforming stores, and the re-licensing of 24 more, in the past
5 quarters. This program coupled with a renewed focus on operations and the customer experience has helped drive
transaction comp growth higher by 5 percentage points and by 3 percentage points respectively, in the past two
quarters.
Work in the past year has also enhanced margins in EMEA. The 9.3% operating margin reported in Q4 is the highest
we've achieved in 12 quarters, and we continue to make progress on our target of improving profitability each year,
finishing fiscal 2013 at 5.5%, up from 0.6% last year. We are making real progress in our long-term path to mid-teens
margins in this region.
Across all our other segments, which includes Teavana, Evolution Fresh, Seattle's Best Coffee and our Digital Ventures
business, revenue more than doubled from $105 million, driven largely by the inclusion of Teavana revenue beginning
in Q2. Both in our Digital Ventures business and Evolution Fresh also contributed. The net operating loss of our other
segments was $17 million in Q4, as we continue to invest in our Emerging Brands.
The strong revenue and margin growth in all our businesses led to outstanding consolidated results in the fourth
quarter. Net revenue grew 13% to $3.8 billion, strong global comp growth of 7% comprised of 5% transaction growth
and 2% ticket growth was the key driver. The addition of 1,701 net new stores globally, including 366 Teavana stores
over the past year, and strengthened licensed stores and Channel Development also contributed to the revenue growth.
Consolidated operating income of $669 million grew 29% over the last Q4, more than doubling the revenue growth
rate. This led to record operating margin of 17.6%, an expansion of 220 basis points over last year.
Strong sales leverage contributed 90 basis points of favorability, with the EMEA portfolio optimization adding 60 basis
points, and lower commodity costs adding 50 basis points. Earnings per share of $0.63 grew 37% over last Q4.
As I indicated to you in July, the fourth quarter included a $0.03 gain on the sale of our equity in Argentina and Chile,
which will enable further growth and enhanced profitability for both parties in these markets. Even without this $0.03
gain, EPS growth accelerated in each quarter throughout fiscal 2013, demonstrating the momentum we have in
translating our strong top line into significant bottom line growth.

For the full fiscal year 2013, our results were equally impressive. Consolidated net revenue reached $14.9 billion, 12%
higher than in 2012. 7% global comp growth in 2013 was the largest driver, and was our 4th consecutive year at or
above that mark.
Transactions grew by 5% for the year, while average ticket grew 2%. Consolidated operating income grew to a record
$2.5 billion in fiscal 2013, an increase of 23% over fiscal 2012. We also delivered record operating margin in 2013 of
16.5%, a full 150 basis points higher than last year. Leverage on our record sales and 50 basis points of commodity cost
favorability were the key drivers.
The strong revenue growth coupled with excellent margin improvement led to record earnings per share of $2.26 in
fiscal 2013. This represents growth of 26% over the prior year, and includes $0.03 each in the second and fourth
quarters for gains on the sale of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina.
Globally, we added 1,701 net new stores in fiscal 2013, and our growth is more geographically diverse than ever
before. For instance in 2007, our largest year of store growth ever, the U.S. accounted for 70% of new stores.
By contrast, in 2013 the U.S. accounted for just over 20% of new stores. This diversity is allowing us to be selective on
real estate, while accelerating growth, ultimately enhancing return on capital.
The strong business results we delivered in fiscal 2013 have culminated in healthy cash generation. This has been
critical in allowing us to reinvest in the business, while concurrently increasing cash return to shareholders.
For the year, we returned a record $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Additionally, today we announced that our board has approved a 24% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.26 per
share. This aligns with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns, which includes growing dividends, and as
part of that commitment we have increased our targeted dividend payout ratio range now at 35% to 45%.
Over the past several years, and again in 2013, we've demonstrated the innovative capabilities and operational
excellence to drive strong and consistent comparable store sales growth. We've demonstrated the ability to accelerate
new store development, while also increasing return on capital. We've demonstrated the vision to plant the seeds of
growth for the future in our Channel Development and Emerging Brands businesses.
We've demonstrated the ability to expand operating margins and consistently drive earnings growth faster than revenue
growth, and we've demonstrated the ability to deliver earnings above our targeted range, when performance warrants,
while also investing for growth.
As we close 2013 and look ahead, the strength of our fiscal 2013 results further increases our confidence in our ability
to deliver another strong year. As I now provide you with an update to our 2014 outlook, and as you then subsequently
establish your own expectations for our financial performance in the coming year, I would ask you to both recognize
the strength and consistencies of our historical performance, as well as recognize the challenge of the task ahead; the
challenge of again driving strong comp growth through this large system; the challenge of again expanding margins
after several years of driving margins higher; the challenge of overcoming increased interest expense and a higher tax
rate. We are more optimistic about our future than ever before, and at the same time, we are realistic and practical in
our expectations and I would encourage you to be as well. We're targeting revenue growth in 2014 of 10% or greater,
driven by global comp growth in the mid single-digits and continued growth in Channel Development.
Now, let me clarify any misunderstanding about our revenue guidance. That revenue growth target is no different from
the guidance we provided last quarter. The 10% or greater just recognizes that we have great confidence that we can
consistently drive double-digit top line growth in the short-term as well as the long-term.
Now as we said last quarter, and on the heels of phenomenal global comp growth in the third and again in the fourth
quarter, that level of high single-digit comp growth is a stunning accomplishment for a system as large and mature as
Starbucks.
We strongly believe that we have the innovation pipeline, customer trust and loyalty, and operational capabilities to
continue to sustainably drive same-store sales, and equally strongly believe that the mid single-digit level is challenging

yet achievable. As we move into the new fiscal year, it would be unreasonable to plan for or set expectations any
higher.
Also contributing to our revenue growth in fiscal 2014 will be our planned 1,500 net new stores. China/Asia Pacific is
now targeted to open 750 net new stores with approximately two-thirds being licensed. EMEA is now targeted for 150
net new openings, essentially all licensed.
We continue to anticipate opening 600 net new stores in the Americas, with approximately half licensed. Full year
consolidated operating margin is expected to expand by 150 basis points to 200 basis points in fiscal 2014, as we
continue to drive leverage on strong revenue growth, as well as recognize the benefit of lower coffee costs.
In the Americas, we expect moderate improvement in operating margin, driven by strong sales leverage. In EMEA, we
anticipate operating margin percent to reach the high single-digits, driven by the benefit of the portfolio actions taken in
fiscal 2013, as well as continued performance improvements.
In CAP, we anticipate operating margin moving towards the low 30% range, and our rapid growth continues to shift
away from our historically licensed model. In Channel Development, lower coffee costs will provide modest operating
margin expansion in fiscal 2014.
Our strong revenue growth and margin expansion target gives us confidence in targeted earnings per share in the range
of $2.55 to $2.65 in fiscal 2014. We're targeting EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69 in the first quarter, with $0.54 to
$0.55 targeted for quarter two, a traditionally lower quarter due to seasonality.
Contributing to the EPS growth will be another year of tailwinds on coffee costs, still expected at an approximate $0.09
to $0.10 net benefit for the year. This benefit is expected to be spread evenly throughout the year, and reflects the gross
coffee impact, partially offset by the recent pricing reduction in CPG, as well as routine investments in the business.
We now have the vast majority of our coffee needs locked for fiscal 2014, and have begun selective buying of certain
varietals into fiscal 2015.
Perhaps one additional comment regarding coffee, I sometimes hear speculation that Starbucks might benefit
significantly more from favorable coffee costs in 2014. Given that we are essentially fully price-protected now, our
price reduction in CPG was executed earlier this year, and our other offsetting investments throughout the business are
fully planned and in various stages of implementation, I would encourage all of you to pay close attention to my coffee
guidance just provided, and not create expectations of anything more than the $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit.
Capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 are expected to remain flat to the previous year at approximately $1.2 billion.
Continued investment in store innovations, new stores, and other retail initiatives will continue to comprise the majority
of the spend.
We anticipate resolution to the dispute with Kraft before the end of this calendar year, and believe we have adequate
liquidity to cover any outcome. And finally, our tax rate in fiscal 2014 is expected to increase to 34.5%. This is
meaningfully higher than fiscal 2013, which included non-routine benefits from prior year audits and state tax true-ups.
At our Investor Conference last December, I summarized 2012 in one word: execution. For 2013, strong execution
again led to outstanding financial performance. Record revenues in all our segments, margin growth in all our
segments, comp growth at the top of our peer set, more than $1 billion in cash returned to shareholders, across the
board 2013 was truly a year to remember.
Yet with all the success in 2013 the best is still in front of us. Our stores are in excellent shape. We've renovated nearly
half of our stores in the U.S. over the past two years. Our product line up is deep, with premium coffee at the core and
new high-quality food, juice and tea to complement it.
Loyalty is on the rise, and new technologies continue to enhance the customer experience. Our growth appetite remains
large, and opportunity abounds in China, India, Latin America and with licensed partners globally.

And our financial discipline remains strong, as we balance height, return, investments in our business, while increasing
returns to shareholders.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Oh, great. Thank you very much. I actually had two quick questions on the Americas. One is,
I think with respect to Boulange, the last time we heard from you, you said the response from customers has been
phenomenal, and I just wanted to see if you could give us either a quantification or qualitatively East Coast versus West
Coast, in terms of contribution.
And then the other piece is on the margins. I'm surprised the Americas margins guidance is for moderate expansion,
because I would think on strong comps and some coffee benefit, and then mix shift towards license we'd see better
expansion than just moderate. Can you give a sense of what investments or offsets you might be making? Thanks.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Sara, I'll take the margin question first, and then I'll hand it over to Cliff to talk about La
Boulange. First, on the size and scale of the U.S. business as big and profitable and as many stores as it is today, we are
very pleased that we can commit to the kind of margin expansion, in fact, deliver the kind of margin expansion we have
over the years, again in fiscal 2013, and again in Q4, and again promising it for fiscal 2014. So, we're quite pleased
with our ability to deliver that comp growth into stronger growth on the bottom line.
Recall that coffee benefit does not have meaningful impact on our store segments. So, the Americas and the U.S. does
not get a significant benefit from the coffee tailwind. That primarily lands in our Channel Development business. So,
that's the first thing to remember.
And then beyond that, as we've significantly elevated margins over the years, I would anticipate our ability to continue
to slowly and moderately over time raise the profitability of that system. But just recognize how far it's come already in
a short period of time. Cliff?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yeah, thanks, Sara. La Boulange, we are seeing incredible excitement around the new
product. It is showing up really well in-store. We've achieved over the last nine months what we didn't achieve in the
previous 20 years around food. So the quality, East Coast, West Coast, every market we're launching in, we're getting a
real passion around it from our teams in stores, and customer action is superb.
That said, we're still in the early days. We've launched in 3,500 stores. We'll complete that rollout in the next 12
months, and we will be able then to see the meaningful contribution its making. But wherever we've launched it and
particularly around the pastries, the croissant, the chocolate croissant, we are seeing a huge difference in experience,
the customers are getting. We continue to refine the range. We continue to refine our operations in-store. But it's
elevating the whole experience, and it really is a testament to the investment we've made in La Boulange to help this
grow a capability around food, and we're really excited for the future.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you.

<Q - Jeffrey A. Bernstein>: Thanks. Just two quick questions as well. One just from a cash usage perspective. Troy,
you talked about the share repurchase and the dividend. I'm just wondering how the board evaluates or balances
between the repurchase and the dividend in terms of, you boosted the payout ratio, and if you could just tie that in with
the $750 million of leverage you guys just took on? Whether or not there's opportunity for more leverage or, better yet,
what's the appropriate debt level that you guys think the system can handle?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Sure. Let me speak to that, Jeff. First of all, in terms of how we evaluate repurchases versus
dividends. We're committed as a company to return cash through both avenues. Dividends, of course, will be a much
more sustainable and routine, and we're very, very fortunate in our business to have healthy and consistent cash flow
that has rapidly grown over time, in which we anticipate will continue growing as we go forward. That's given us
confidence both to grow our dividend rate faster than our rate of earnings, as I announced today, in terms of what our
boards approved. But also to give us flexibility over time to expand that payout ratio higher, which is also we
announced today.
Share repurchases are also important to us, but we'll always be a bit more opportunistic, as there are plenty of times
when we as a company are blacked out of the market or updating our plan. So, I would expect repurchases to, over the
course of any three or four or five quarter period of time, to be a component of our cash return not unlike it's been over
the past few years. But there will always be quarters where it's higher rather than lower and vice versa.
In terms of debt levels, it's – I would suggest to you that in our history, we've tended to be a bit underleveraged, and
we've recognized some opportunity, particularly given where the market conditions have been over the past year, to
bring a little bit more debt under the balance sheet and to enhance our liquidity. So, we've done that. That still leaves
us, we believe, with a very strong credit rating, which we intend to maintain and capacity within that credit rating over
time, if opportunity warrants and market conditions warrant, to bring on more debt. But let me be clear, we have no
immediate plans to do anything more than the $750 million offering that we just placed.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Bernstein>: And if, I could follow-up, you mentioned just the coffee costs being 100% locked. Just
wondering whether you're seeing any unusual or irrational behavior from peers with the very favorable coffee costs
than – or maybe better yet, internally how you guys think about price to be taken or whether using value to drive traffic
when coffee costs are so favorable?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Well, at times because our – many of our peers buy shorter term than we do and frankly are
chasing us often, so I would suggest, trying to catch us with whatever pricing actions they can take. Sometimes we see
those actions down the aisle, frankly, and perhaps even in competing coffee stores around the country. Frankly, that
tends to be less of a driver of our own actions, particularly in the stores, as does cost pricing to meet customer need.
Now down the aisle, it is much more competitive and reacting to that marketplace we took a price reduction earlier this
year.
We believe that, that positioned us very nicely, and I would suggest that the Q4 results for our Channel Development
business that we just released today underscore that we did the right thing with the pricing action, that we are now
competing nicely again down the aisle. We're positioned well, and we strongly believe, not only by competing on price;
but on innovation, packaging, about the leadership we can bring down the aisle, all those things will contribute to our
ability to continue to hold and grow share over time in all forms of that home consumption.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Bernstein>: Thank you.

The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.
<Q - Sharon Zackfia>: Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping to touch a little bit more on the food and the Americas. If
you could update us on where food ended as a percent of sales for fiscal 2013 versus 2012? And then, Troy, if you
could help us think through the impact of the increased food penetration as we think of the pushes and pulls in the

Americas gross margin for 2014, I'm understanding the new food is higher margin than the old food, but probably still
lower margin than coffee. So, just wondering if you could talk through that?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yeah, on margin first, Sharon, what I would say is that, over time, there's a few dynamics that
happened as we grow our food business, which we believe to continue to be a significant opportunity for us, and we've
been experiencing that as food has been a disproportionate driver of comp growth this year as you've heard from us
each quarter recently.
With that said, when you netted all the pushes and pulls of product margin and distribution, the efficiencies we get in
the back office, the waste management initiatives that we've implemented in the stores, all those things in the
long-term, we believe, negate each other, and we don't think that there'll be meaningful movement whatsoever in gross
margin.
Yes, food is a moderately lower product gross margin than is beverage, but remember as we sell more food through an
existing system, it is extremely accretive to percent margins – not just to mention dollar margins, at the bottom line of
the store, and highly profitable in terms of store profitability and return on capital in that existing asset we have with
our store system. So the economics, top to bottom are very, very good for us.
In terms of food mix. Food remains right around 19% of the sales mix of our stores. There's some upper movement
over that over time, but given the huge base of business we have, we think that will be a slow and moderate progression
reaching next toward 20%, and we think ultimately a bit higher.
<Q - Sharon Zackfia>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: Yeah, I wanted to ask about La Boulange, as well. And the first was, can you talk to any
group of constraints that may have developed in the stores that have rolled it out, and whether you've come to the
conclusion that you may need to flex-up labor a bit to keep the stores moving?
And then also on La Boulange, you talked about expanding it to lunch for next fall. And I was curious, if you could talk
us through what makes sense for lunch at Starbucks, and what doesn't?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yeah, thanks, Michael. It's Cliff. In terms of what we're seeing on the La Boulange
operation, it's obviously new. We're investing in labor around the launch times, so as we can share these fantastic new
products with our customers. And once, we're through that launch phase it becomes part of the normal operation. It's
not about adding labor, it's just being very deliberate in how we deploy our labor.
The customers are already there, and we're obviously trying to move the percentage of customers who buy our food on
a regular basis, and we're going to increase that. The opportunity is significant. We're already serving the customer. So
– and giving you an example, I was in New York, which is one of the most recent markets. We've launched over there
last week. I was extremely pleased with what I saw in terms of customer engagements. The way the partners are
embracing the La Boulange routines and disciplines, and the food and the beverage were being served with a great
experience for the customer. And if we can do it in New York, we can do it in all our markets. So, I think that's a great
start for us.
If we look at lunch, we start from the same premise. Great ingredients, and building on the opportunity to serve existing
customers who come into the stores. The lunchtime, Troy said, we're starting to see some growth in that area. I think
the investments we're making in carbonation, investments in tea will also further complement that lunchtime occasion,
and give us over time a second peak.
The food, again, will be starting from fantastic ingredients, relevant for our customers and will give them a fresh and
healthy approach to food. And it really complement the beverages we've done. The investments we've made in supply

chain suppliers and the investments we've made in our stores so far will all help us with this food range.
We've invested in, or started, should I say, with a small test in San Francisco, and it's around paninis, it's around salads,
it's around convenient food for our customers, while they're enjoying the store, or take back to their office. And it's
been, again, extremely well-received, and we're extremely excited that we'll be able to follow-on from the morning
enhancement of our food with a lunchtime offering, which we think will be the start of a significant business around
lunch.

<A - Troy Alstead>: Thanks, Michael.
Operator
The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. I guess, still two things on Boulange. One is, when will you feel comfortable in talking
about the sales lift? It's the question I guess that's been posed a number of times and what point or how many stores do
you need to feel comfortable that you've got a good baseline?
And then secondly, why wouldn't this be additive? I know you noted a couple of times mid single-digit comps and I
understand you want to be reasonable in terms of the expectations. But it doesn't seem like – is there anything that's
going to fall away from this that you lose? Is there some anniversarying of some of the lunch items you've added
recently that you have less confidence in or have you simply just seen the business maybe be more moderate in the last
few weeks or months and maybe that gives you rise for caution?
<A - Troy Alstead>: John, let me speak to comp growth and then I'm going to ask Cliff to come back to a bit more on
La Boulange. First thing to remind you and everyone is and of course you know this, John, but comp growth trends
toward zero every year for everybody out there – every retailer. Anybody who measures it. Everything we did over the
past year to drive the fantastic and amazing comp growth, because it's a big system that we've done, beverage
innovation, food, the contribution from loyalty. All those things now are in the baseline. And as we move into this
coming year, just doing those same things again would provide zero additional comp lift.
What we need to do and what we have great confidence in, by the way, is our ability to come up with that next level of
beverage innovation, the next fantastic food program, the elevation of food, the continued enhancements to consumer
facing technology and to the loyalty program. But all those things need to be more and better than last year to give us
any comp growth.
So, comp growth can never be additive. It starts over and we believe we have ability to take what we've done in the past
year. And yes, add to it, in terms of traffic, volumes, in terms of dollar sales to our system; and by doing that, we
believe a mid single-digit comp growth on a system, the size of a Starbucks and the maturity of Starbucks is nothing
short of outstanding.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Troy, let me add one more thing. It seems like we can't get through a conference call
without somehow this tension between us and you, with regarding to comp growth guidance. So, let's just try and
establish common language, so there's an understanding about what it is we're trying to do and what it is we're trying to
guide.
Last quarter, we had a 9% comp in the U.S. business. And I said then as I think we're trying to say now is that we had
an 8% comp this quarter. And it would be just irresponsible of any of us at Starbucks to project to you or guide you to
that level.
Now, do we have aspirations to try and do it again as we did this year? Absolutely. Do we think we can? Many of us
think we can, but we're not going to sit here and put a number out there, that is such a stretch target and have you put it
in your model and then we come up with a 6% or a 7%, which against our peer group is stunning and incredible and

then you write reports that says we've disappointed. That's not going happen.
So, the guidance we're giving is the most responsible guidance we could possibly provide you, especially when you
consider the maturation of our store base and the number of stores. Now one other thing. What La Boulange is
providing us well beyond the morning pastries and the lunch is a significant platform to go after need states and day
parts well into the future.
And what we've learned over the years is that our stores now provide a third place well beyond the morning day part,
which was our core business just 5 or 6 years ago. The opportunity to expand Starbucks significantly in the future with
the innovations that we've talked about in our prepared remarks and the food, is well beyond where we are today.
But I think we've always tried not to provide aspirations and guidance that would so far feel from reality and provide
you with an opportunity with real numbers. And I think not to allow any of us to get so far ahead of ourselves,
especially when we have a situation in the U.S. where there's quite a bit of uncertainty in terms of customer confidence,
consumer confidence, external behavior that relates to the government shutdown. And what could happen in February,
with where we're once again we're looking at a possible default.
So this is the most responsible thing we can do on the heels of a record year in our 42-year history, a record quarter and
a comp number that no other company in our peer group or no other company that any of you analyze has put up
against us. So, this is a remarkable opportunity for us to have a year end result. And once again, try and provide a comp
number that we think is responsible and I think the most judicious thing we can possibly do.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: So, John, just to say when will we be able to share the contribution La Boulange is giving us,
and quite frankly, it will be after we've rolled out all markets and we've really seen what happens in the first year. We
are going very quickly with the rollout. I'm absolutely delighted by the fact we got to 3,500 stores by the end of the
financial year. We'll complete the rest of the stores and we've already – so the rest of the stores company operated, will
be completed in FY 2014. We will also have the opportunity to bring a new food range to our Canadian business and to
our licensed stores, so we're busy working on that. It is a new skill for us. It is a new discipline. We've been
beverage-led for a very long time. And we will continue to work on the operational detail.
The fantastic thing is we can respond very quickly on recipes, on customer feedback, and that is also part of this. So,
we're in that learning phase. But I really am excited by where our partners and our customers are receiving the food.
We have some great success stories.
Really again, I just want to go through the operational discipline I've always brought to the Americas and make sure
that when we share something with you we can continue to build off it. It's definitely complementing the experience of
the customer. It's complementing the beverage purchase, and our potential of the future is exceptionally strong with
food. Thanks, John.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Great. Thanks, Cliff. Thanks.

The next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Want to ask two questions, if I can. I want to take advantage of Howard and
John being on the call and just ask about the recent media coverage about pricing in China and just your perspective on
it?
And then secondly want to go back to an earlier question. Not so much the staffing that's needed for La Boulange, but
kind of a broader question, not just La Boulange based. Are you at a point in terms of speed of service where something
else has to change to handle this tremendous level of traffic growth that you're driving?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I'll take the latter question. Unlike others who have talked about speed of service or
throughput issues that is not a problem that we have or anticipate, so you can take that off the table. And in fact, what

we've been able to do with mobile payment and the card has absolutely cracked the code in terms of convenience and
speed of service and we're only going to get better at that, because we will be introducing new levels of technology in
calendar 2014. We have no speed of service or throughput issue inside Starbucks. Take that off the table. John?
<A - John Culver>: Thanks, Joe, for the question. Regarding the recent media speculation on the price issue in China,
as you know, Joe, we've been in China now for 15 years. And we have over 1,000 stores. We operate in over 60 cities
across the mainland. And as this issue became public, we acted very swiftly. And as we always have, communicated in
a very open, honest, transparent and very factual way with our customers.
And one thing I would say is that we've been able to build a level of trust, loyalty, respect with our customers and key
stakeholders across the country and we felt it was important that we respond very openly and transparently to them.
In terms of the speculation, there's a couple of things I'd like to point out. First is that the prices that we charge for our
products in China, the Latte, are comparable to and in some cases lower than the competition. So that's number one.
Number two, the prices that we're charging in the market actually reflect the cost of doing business in that market. And
at the same time, reflect the level of investments that we're making ahead of the curve so that we can fuel the future
growth of the business.
So we will continue to be very transparent, very open and very factual with any questions that come up around pricing.
But let me just add that, as a company, building a large business in China, well over 1,000 stores and beyond, that we're
not immune to the challenges and complexities of building a large business in China. But at the same time, given the
trust and loyalty that we've been able to build with our customer base there, as well as key stakeholders across the
mainland, that we have tremendous confidence in our ability to continue to build a very strong business not only in
2014, but well into the future.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you.
<A - John Culver>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Yeah, thanks. Just one on the Channel Development side. The revenue growth accelerated there.
It sounds like that was mainly driven by the better pricing positioning, I guess, but just wondering, if you could talk a
little bit more about what drove that revenue growth? And is that the kind of number you guys are expecting going
forward?
<A - John Culver>: Well, I think that we obviously had very strong growth in the quarter and finished the year very
strong double-digit revenue growth for the year. The results that you saw in the fourth quarter were the results of the
momentum that the business is beginning to get around the LPR on packaged coffee, but then also the momentum that
we're building on K-Cups, and as I said K-Cup growth during the quarter was 42%. We've added two additional SKUs
in the quarter, and we've got aggressive plans to continue to expand and grow the K-Cup offering in 2014 throughout
the year.
I think it's also important to note that I talked a little bit about the My Starbucks Rewards down the aisle. And as we've
talked in the past, this is our opportunity to leverage the strategic flywheel that Howard spoke about. And in a very
short period of time, just over three months, we've been able to provide over 1.5 million stars to our most loyal
customers down the aisle who are purchasing our packaged coffee. So, we remain very optimistic that we can continue
to accelerate stars down the aisle and leverage that flywheel.
Going forward, as I said, there is volatility that's happening down the aisle and in the grocery segment, particularly as it
relates to packaged roast and ground coffee. We feel we're very well-positioned to navigate that volatility. We've got a
lot of new innovation that's coming into the business this year, not only on the packaged coffee side, but also K-Cups,

VIA and other items.
And what you're going to see this year in 2014 is that our performance is going to build by quarter. And with the back
half being the stronger piece of the business due to the first half LPR rollover. So again, my comments earlier, we're
committed to sustained double-digit growth in this business both on the top and bottom line in 2014. And we're looking
forward to another very successful year in the channels.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Yeah.
Operator
The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Great. Hi. Thank you. First, quickly, and then a longer question. Troy, do you have the
Starbucks Card balance at the end of the quarter in front of you?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yeah, we do. I'll have Adam Brotman actually make a couple of comments about that. Adam's
our Chief Digital Officer. He's here with us. Go ahead, Adam.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Hi, John. At the end of the quarter, the balance in the U.S. was $621 million, and reflective
of the record year we just had with $4 billion loaded across the U.S. and Canada.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: And do you have the corporate balance as well that we see on the balance sheet?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: I don't have that with me at this time.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yeah, let me – ask your other question, John, and I'll try...
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. And, Howard, maybe this question is for you. A couple
years ago, I guess, in 2009, at least part of the Starbucks revitalization, you included a refocus of excelling at your store
level basics, which obviously you did in a fairly profound way. When we listen to the call today, I mean, there's a
number of initiatives that are coming into the stores in the next couple years, Teavana, cold carbonated drinks, the
continued expansion and focus on La Boulange specifically and maybe food more generally, that does add more
complication to the stores perhaps than there is today. So, just a little bit of a broader question, just can you talk about
how the system has been prepared maybe relative to 5 years ago to handle this increased complexity with the low-risk
nature that you've demonstrated over the past couple of years?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Well, John, I think that's a very important and appropriate question. And if you were in any
of our meetings during this year as we prepared for fiscal 2014 that was much of the conversation. We want to do one
thing and one thing well and that is whatever we bring into the store, we want it to be enhancing to the customer
experience and complementary to our leadership position in coffee.
Having said that, I think the last two years of our stores that we've opened, coupled with the comp number,
demonstrates the significant health and strength, and I'd say, unequivocally the U.S. business has never been stronger or
healthier than it is today, in terms of financial results and the equity of the brand and the experience.
We feel very good that we have prepared our stores, and if you go through them, Evolution Juice when we brought it
into the stores we replaced an existing juice product, and enhanced the quality and enhanced the experience.
Teavana tea that we're going to bring in at some point in calendar 2014, we're already in the tea business. But tea
represents less than 1% of our sales, and we believe we can significantly expand that, and in doing so, create significant
awareness and trial, and use our flywheel to drive new traffic and incrementality to Teavana stores.
When we get to La Boulange, we've been selling food for 30 years. It just hasn't been as good as our coffee. Now our
food is as good as our coffee, and we have a story to tell and we want to tell that story in multiple day parts and fulfill

multiple needs states.
Carbonation. That is a new category for us. The test results in Austin and Atlanta and Japan and Singapore are very
encouraging. We think it's a significant opportunity, and again, we learned a lot over the last few years with our
refreshment category that we have, other than coffee and the opportunity in coffee, we have an opportunity to provide a
need state in the afternoon and evening around refreshment. And also we've learned in the carbonation test itself that
there's a significant food attachment to the carbonation beverages. So, this works hand-in-hand with our opportunity.
And I think we're going to create more incrementality.
I think Cliff and his team have done a wonderful job in not taking the entire country at once with any of these
initiatives, but sequentially going from market to market and learning from it, and not leaving one market to go to the
other until we have it right. And that's why La Boulange has worked so successfully. That's exactly what we're going
do with all of these initiatives as we did with Evolution Juice.
So the short answer is, it's an appropriate question. We learned valuable lessons in 2006 and 2007. Those lessons have
been learned, and they will never, ever be repeated. And we're at a position right now, where we're playing to our
strength, and we're going to continue to do that and leverage the fact that our stores are a meeting place, and a gathering
place for multiple day parts well beyond the core coffee business that we began 42-years ago. But, we're always going
to be the primary destination for the world's best coffee.
<A - John Culver>: John, to your question about the Starbucks Card. At the end of the fourth quarter, so at the end of
fiscal year, the deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet, and that deferred revenue balance is essentially the
Starbucks Card balances, was $654 million. And by the way, that's almost 30% growth over the same period a year
ago, over the year-end 2012. And that 30% – almost 30% growth in that balance, on the balance sheet, just reflects the
continued tremendous up-take of the Starbucks Card, the adoption of loyalty, of how mobile is contributing and how
we're resonating with our customers in a way that is unique anyone else in the space. And, by them pre-paying
essentially a significant amount of transactions, and having that sit on our balance sheet long before it turns into
revenue.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: It's probably the perfect litmus test for the future of the company in the near-term, by
having 30% greater loaded on the card versus a year ago, and that 30% is almost three times greater than the growth
rate of the company.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions. First one is on EPS guidance for Troy.
Particularly relating to the second quarter guidance, it looks like the first quarter guidance you're implying basically
about 20% EPS growth and then dips down on a year-over-year basis to that 13%-ish range for the second quarter. So,
that's kind of below where you're going to be at for the full year, so what exactly is going on in that quarter? Anything
you can point out for us?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Well, yeah, Brian. I'm happy to do that. First, I make sure, when you look at the second quarter
growth rate over prior year, back-out that unusual, non-routine gain from – gain on the sale of our [indiscernible]
(75:02) business from Q2 of a year ago. So, it's important you do that adjustment. Now with that said...
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: But it's still 13% off that $0.48, right?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Actually, Brian, the range I gave you is 13% to 15%. So, it will slip towards that mid-teens EPS
growth rate. And then, give me a moment and I'll explain what's going on.

Our investment spending that we do throughout the year will vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. And in the case
of the second quarter, we are planning to spend a bit more in marketing just timing the spend throughout the year as we
look at that quarter.
We have a number of other routine investments that come and go from quarter-to-quarter. The timing of which, every
year, can move a little bit from here to there. So, we put that guidance out there today, so you'd have some more
visibility and transparency into how we're planning the year and how we see the earnings progression.
With that said, there will be some quarters that are more like the mid-teens and there'll be some quarters as we have
delivered over this past year that will tip towards the higher part of that range. And that's why we have an earnings
range out there that I'll have you think about as we go forward.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Okay. And just something about cash flow and balance sheet. I mean, you guys did almost $2
billion of free cash flow this fiscal year. I think you generated more free cash flow this year than you generated in
operating cash flow last year. I know you took on some debt this quarter, but it looks like you have over $3 billion of
cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. I think, obviously, that looks to be more than enough liquidity to
deal with any resolution with Kraft. Is there any update on that arbitration that you guys can give us, any timing update
or anything like that?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Brian, what we can say is that we expect resolution of that, to hear from an arbitrator before the
end of the calendar year. That's really our only news for today as we expect that to be some time before the end of this
calendar year.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And you're right on your earlier points. Our cash flow was phenomenally strong in the year. And
I think that's very, very reflective of our strong performance in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year in that
consistency of strength of cash flow and the phenomenal strength of our balance sheet. And the amount of cash we
have sitting on our balance sheet both gives me tremendous comfort that we have adequate liquidity to cover whatever
the answer may be coming out of that arbitration.
And also gives us tremendous flexibility as we look forward the future and we make investments into our business, in
renovations, in store development and gives us the ability to continue elevating cash return to shareholders.
<A - JoAnn DeGrande>: Mike, we're available for one last question. And we will follow-up with those that are left in
the queue.

The last question comes from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thank you. Thanks for the time. Of the loyalty, the $1.5 million, I believe it was
incremental stars earned through the Channel Development, can you talk to us about if anybody signed up new, so new
users of the loyalty program? And then, also what was most surprising as you – versus what you tested and expected as
you started to launch this? Thank you very much.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Sure. Nicole, I'll take this. This is Adam. So first of all, I would say that, yes, we've seen a
lot of new users coming through that channel. We're not ready to quantify those publicly, but it's been exceeding our
expectations in terms of both new users. It's been exceeding our expectations in terms of the velocity of take-up of our
loyalty members, as well as new loyalty members that have been participating.
And frankly, we're just getting started in terms of how we're going to integrate loyalty with our CPG business. So, it's a
great example of the strategic flywheel – there's a mini version of it. There's a digital strategic flywheel. We're
integrating our loyalty, card, mobile, and now across channels and across brands and even across geographies. So, this
is just one example of how it's working well for us.

<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I would just add one thing and that is that in a sense what we're establishing is the
Starbucks currency and that currency can be interchanged between Starbucks and Teavana stores. And the stars, the
currency of the stars can now be leveraged across consumer products that are unparalleled, because there's no other
consumer product that has a retail store that can provide our customers with a reward and an incentive to come back
and forth. And this is just the beginning of us being able to thread these multiple channels of distributions and brands,
so that the customer has significant value in supporting and shopping at Starbucks Teavana and Starbucks consumer
products.
