Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey.
Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
While FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight posted solid financial results, the third quarter was very challenging for FedEx
Express due to continued weakness in international air freight markets, pressure on yields due to industry overcapacity,
and customers selecting less expensive and slower-transit international services.
In response, as Dave Bronczek will tell you after Alan Graf's remarks, beginning April the 1, FedEx Express will
decrease capacity to and from Asia and will aggressively manage traffic flows to place lower-yielding traffic in
lower-cost networks.
We are assessing how these actions may allow FedEx Express to accelerate the retirement of more of its older,
less-efficient aircraft as part of our fleet modernization program begun several years ago. We remain focused on our
strategic cost reduction programs, which are ramping up and on target.
FedEx has a long, successful history of flexing our networks to meet market conditions, and I'm confident the strategic
profit improvement program we are implementing – as well as additional actions we are taking at FedEx Express – will
increase margins, improve cash flows and strengthen our competitiveness over time.

I'd like to congratulate FedEx team members around the globe for once again making FedEx one of the 10 most
admired companies in the world, according to a survey last month by FORTUNE Magazine. This honor and others our
team has received reflect the outstanding reputation they've earned through their commitment to our Purple Promise,
which says simply, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.
Before I turn the microphone over to Mike Glenn for his comments on the economy – and then Alan Graf for financial
perspective, and as I mentioned, Dave Bronczek on the Express issues – I'd like to recognize and thank Dave Rebholz,
who is participating in his final earnings call as President and CEO of FedEx Ground. Dave is retiring on May 31, after
37 years of service to FedEx. He spent more than 30 years with FedEx Express, and during the last seven years, has
been largely responsible for the incredible success and growth of FedEx Ground.
Dave, on behalf of the entire FedEx team, thank you for your leadership, your friendship, and your wise counsel as a
member of our strategic management committee during these many years, and best wishes for your well-deserved
retirement.
Now, Mike Glenn.
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred.
On the economic front, our forecast calls for modest growth in the global economy. Historic revisions and incoming
data since our last earnings call led us to adjust our GDP and industrial production numbers.
Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2% in calendar 2013 and 2.5% in calendar 2014. For industrial production, we expect
growth of 3% in calendar 2013 and 3.5% in calendar 2014. Housing and auto markets have shown improvements,
e-commerce experienced mid-teen growth rates, and we've seen some inventory restocking taking place in the
near-term.
Our global GDP forecast calls for 2.3% growth in calendar 2013, and 3% in calendar 2014. The calendar 2013 outlook
certainly remains uncertain, due mainly to policy issues in the U.S., Europe and China.
Now turning to yield commentary, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yields
increased 2.1%. The increase was primarily driven by rates and discount improvements, followed by increased weight
per package.
The FedEx Ground yield increased 1.9%, excluding the impact of fuel, with the year-over-year increase driven by rate
and discount improvements and an increase in extra service charges.
Excluding the impact of fuel, International Express package yield declined 3% year-over-year, due to changes in
product mix, which were referenced earlier, rate and discount and weight changes.
And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, FedEx Freight yield per hundredweight increased 1.7% year-over-year with
the increase primarily driven by rate and discount changes.
And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.
Our third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23, excludes $46 million in cost for business realignment activities,
primarily from the voluntary buyout program that we outlined in our profit improvement plan.

As Fred noted, Ground and Freight continued to post steady results. However, our lower-than-expected results for the
quarter and reduced full-year earnings outlook were driven by third quarter international revenues at Express, declining
approximately $100 million versus our prior forecast primarily due to accelerating customer preference for
lower-yielding international services, lower rate per pound and weight per shipment. Profitability was also impacted
this year by one fewer operating day at Express and Ground and two fewer days at Freight.
Now, let's take a look at the segment results for the quarter. Starting with Ground, Ground continued its solid
performance with a 17% operating margin. Average daily volume at Ground increased 10% from growth in our home
delivery service and increases in our commercial business. Meanwhile, SmartPost volumes grew 26% through growth
in e-commerce.
Operating income increased slightly, while operating margin was lower as the benefit of higher volume and revenue per
package was mostly offset by higher purchase transportation, a favorable self-insurance adjustment in the prior year,
higher network expansion costs, one fewer operating day, as I mentioned earlier, and inter-company charges of $9
million associated with the business realignment program. One-time items such as the insurance benefit and the
realignment costs drove the majority of the difference in margin year-over-year.
Freight continues to leverage the benefits of an integrated network. Freight's operating results improved with LTL yield
growth and increased average daily LTL shipments, along with ongoing improvements in operational efficiencies. This
is the first positive profit in the third quarter for Freight since 2008. Freight's profitability for the quarter improved,
despite 17% higher depreciation and amortization expense from continued investment in transportation, equipment and
technology. As a result of our higher utilization of rail and other fuel efficiency improvements, Freight's fuel costs were
5% lower year-over-year.
Turning to Express; our results for Express reflect a significant decline in profitability, due to the ongoing shifts in
demand to lower-yielding international services, a trend that has continued to accelerate this year versus our previous
expectations. Results were also impacted by lower international yields as lower rate per pound, lower weight per
shipment, and lower fuel surcharges have all impacted yields for international.
Given the persistence of this trend, additional cost-cutting actions are underway for the line-haul network, which
represents a significant part of our cost to provide our international services. We are reducing our trans-pacific capacity
on April 1, flight hour reductions will lead to savings in fuel, crew, and maintenance costs.
We will align our global networks to better match yields with the appropriate cost-to-serve network, taking advantage
of the increased capabilities at FedEx Trade Networks. Some of the actions we are evaluating may involve temporarily
or permanently grounding older, less-efficient aircraft, which could result in asset impairment or other charges in future
periods, and Dave Bronczek will have more to say about this, when I conclude my remarks.
I'd like to now look at our profitability improvement programs and our outlook. In addition to taking actions to reduce
our network costs at Express, due to the recent trends, we're also continuing to implement our profit improvement plan
for the corporation as discussed at our October Investors and Lenders Meeting.
As part of our plan, in Q3, we began implementing our voluntary buyout for eligible U.S.-based employees. Certain
officers and managing directors accepted the voluntary buyout as we adjust our leadership team to our new
organizational structure. In mid-February, eligible U.S. employees were offered voluntary buyouts with a deadline of
April 1 to accept.
Employees that accepted buyout will be scheduled to vacate their positions in phases to ensure a smooth transition and
maintain service levels to our customers. Employees in the first phase will leave on May 31 and we expect all
employees who accept the buyout to vacate their positions by the end of FY 2014.
The pre-tax cost of the voluntary buyout program will be approximately $450 million to $550 million in FY 2013.
Actual costs will depend on employee acceptance rates. Costs of the voluntary program will be recognized when
eligible employees accept their offers, predominantly in Q4 of FY 2013. Additional costs will be incurred beyond FY
2013, primarily related to facility optimization and professional fees associated with our ongoing IT transformation

projects.
While the estimated range for the FY 2013 costs of the voluntary buyout program is approximately $100 million lower
than our previous forecast, we still expect the same savings from our business realignment activities. The estimated
range is lower due to facility closures that we originally expected in late FY 2013, which will now occur in FY 2014.
Also, significantly deferred hiring of open positions reduced our need to offer voluntary buyouts in some cases.
Other ongoing profit improvement initiatives for Express include aircraft modernization, pickup and delivery
productivity, aircraft maintenance processes, fuel consumption best practices and further facilities rationalization.
In addition to continued profit improvements in the base businesses at Ground and Freight, our profit improvement
programs are targeting annual profitability improvement at FedEx Express of $1.6 billion by the end of FY 2016 from
the full year FY 2013 results.
Looking ahead, based on the economic outlook that Mike discussed, we project diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to
$2.10 for the fourth quarter and $6 to $6.20 for FY 2013. Both of these ranges do not include charges related to the
company's business realignment. All the profit improvement initiatives discussed are expected to increase margins,
improved cash flows and increase our competitiveness.
But now, I'd like to turn this call over to Dave Bronczek, who will discuss Express in more detail.
David J. Bronczek
Thank you, Alan and Fred and Mike.
And I'm going to talk about something they all talked about and basically start off with I wanted to say that at Express,
the $1.6 billion that we gave you at the Investors and Lenders Meeting in October is well on track. We told you that
75% of that benefit would accrue in FY 2015. That's still the case and in fact in some categories we're exceeding even
those estimates.
I also wanted to stop and say that in our domestic business, we're performing actually very well. Our average daily
volume this quarter was up 1%, domestic yields that Mike Glenn pointed out was up 2.1%, domestic U.S. freight was
up 3% and domestic U.S. yields in freight was up 3%. So, our business in the United States, Domestic Express is
performing very well.
The international business and the international trends is what I'm going to talk about for the remaining of my time; and
those trends have shifted, the marketplace has shifted this quarter. And to show you how much it shifted, the revenue
this quarter in IP, International Priority, was down 4%. The revenue was down in International Priority Freight by 13%.
Yields for international exports were down 3% and overall IP Freight yields were down 1%. So, we have a yield issue
that exaggerated itself this quarter over last quarter.
The other issue that we're dealing with is actually something you would think was a good problem for us to have. Total
international export volume was up 4%. That, however, was driven by a 12% growth in deferred international export
traffic, mainly led out of Asia and Europe. So, we had a lot of freights – a lot of freight on our planes, our high load
factors, quite frankly, were driven by the deferred traffic. So, we have lower yields, we had more traffic, higher pounds,
all in deferred traffic.
So, what Fred and Alan have said, is we started in November actually to start moving our line-haul network down and
tweaking some of our network around the world. We're big enough to move our network around and I'm going to talk
about that in a minute here, with actually – without affecting service to our customers.
So, in November, we began the process. April 1, we're moving our trans-pacific line-haul capacity down because we
have markets that have multiple aircraft in them. We're going to be forcing a higher-yielding revenue component into
our planes, while we're reducing our costs, moving some of that lower-yielding deferred International Economy Freight
into lower-cost networks, primarily our FedEx Trade Networks network and our own deferred network. And by doing

so, we'll actually improve the overall yields into our network that is actually going to be reducing its costs and that's the
beginning of our outlook for our international line-haul; that starts April 1.
Beyond that, we're looking at the rest of our global line-haul that also has multiple airplanes in multiple markets that we
can actually force the revenue yield and quality of the revenue into our existing network while reducing our costs.
So, as Alan and Fred both pointed out, we're going to take this opportunity off of the third quarter market shift to look
at our fleet; and in fact, if we have some of our airplanes that are inefficient for fuel and maintenance and determined
throughout the quarter, if we have some airplanes that we can retire.
Going back to the issue at-hand, Q3's performance on international revenue driven by yields was the issue. We actually
had more volume. So, we're resetting the Express capacity. We're resetting the revenue forecasting. And going forward,
we're actually going to take a very hard look at all of our expenses at international, but the main expense for
international is our global line-haul. Q3 to Q4, Q4 is significantly improved over Q3. So, in Alan's guidance and his
outlook, you'll have an Express Q4 performance that's significantly better than Q3.
Mickey Foster
Okay. We're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Tom Wadewitz [JPMorgan Securities LLC].
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, good morning. And I think I probably said this before, but congratulations to
Dave Rebholz and wish you well in retirement.
So a lot of things going on in international. I wondered, if you could give a sense of why – what you think is happening
in the market? Whether this is a shipper-driven effect in terms of the trade-down and some of the weakness and if you
see that continuing and becoming more of an issue?
Is it somewhat of a competitive issue, where I think UPS had announced that they're doing – starting to offer in, I
guess, an IP Freight-type of a product, where I don't think they've had that specific product in the past. And I think
DHL has been aggressive; but what – how do you think about what's really driving the issues in international and how
they might play out going forward, if they get any better or if it's just a challenge that persists?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, this is Fred Smith speaking, and let me make a comment or two and then Dave
put some color on it. I'd like to refer you back to a speech I gave in May, I mentioned this in the last quarterly call, I
believe. It's on our Investor website. And while I was the spokesman of the speech, obviously, it reflects FedEx's belief
about the trends in international trade and international transportation. And I would urge you, if you're interested in this
matter in depth, to read that presentation, because it lays out what has gone on in the international trading arena. And
the reality is that the American consumer drove international trade for a long period of time and brought Europe back
after World War II and helped bring China into the current fantastic economic powerhouse it is; but policy decisions
and the cost of fuel have radically changed the international trading situation. So, last year, you had a reduction of
international air freight in its broadest sense.
Again, I'll refer you to the Wings Club speech, of about 1.9% in terms of revenue freight kilometers as it's measured.
And you had about 1.9% increase in sea freight measured by TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units. So, trade has
contracted relative to where it was before 2008 and the cost of fuel is such along with the increasing cost in China that
these markets have been constrained. At the same time, you have a lot of capacity that's come into the market.

So, I think the bottom line is, we got a little bit ahead of our skis and we had more capacity out there into the heavier,
more cost-sensitive air freight market and that's what Dave is doing, he's adjusting our capacity back, so it's really
focused more on the International Priority, where our network is quite unique and has a competitive advantage. Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: That's exactly right, Fred. I think you – if you look at the market you can see that it's
overcapacity and because of that overcapacity, people are looking for a market shift in their pricing. And the issue for
us isn't that we don't have enough volume, we have too much volume in the wrong product in the wrong network.
As I mentioned before, our overall growth in deferred was 12% and quite frankly that's only because we had to cap it,
because our planes coming out of Asia were full, full of the wrong type of products. So, we're moving the traffic into a
lower-cost network, we're opening up our Express freighters for truly IP, International Priority traffic, and we're
bringing down our cost of the capacity. So, when you look at the marketplace, it shifted. Right now, until the
marketplace corrects itself on the overcapacity, we're taking the lead for our business.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, guys. Wanted to dig in, I guess a little bit more on this international side and try to
figure out what's changing on the margin here. I mean, it makes a lot of sense to move to third-party line-haul in some
of this business because of the margin differential. Is it the weakness because of overcapacity more in the air cargo
market versus the parcel market, that's actually taking place with all the wide-body deliveries that have happened and
that are scheduled to happen?
And then when you take a look at your fleet, should we expect – when you balance out deliveries and retirements on a
go-forward basis, that we'll see a net decrease in FedEx's fleet capacity?
And I guess the third part of that is, what does that imply for CapEx on a go-forward basis? So, I know a lot of pieces
there, but trying to figure out if it's air cargo versus parcel, what the net impact is to FedEx's fleet, and then how does
that impact your capital plans on a go-forward basis?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. I'm going to turn it over to Dave about the fleet and
then he and Alan can talk about the go-forward CapEx. It is the air cargo market, and the air cargo market is, as I
mentioned a moment ago, has been adversely affected by lower economic growth around the world, caused by the
policy choices that are now reflected in the European situation, relatively low growth in the United States and China
situation.
So, the International Express business is still growing, the door-to-door part of the business and these aren't new things.
They just perhaps have accelerated a little bit, because of this overcapacity situation.
And over the last couple of years, Dave Bronczek has done a great job of readjusting our deliveries of capacity, pushing
off 777s and bringing in the 767s, which have an immediate accretive effect in the domestic system, so they're so much
more fuel-efficient and the airplanes they're replacing. So, I'll let him talk about that and Alan on CapEx.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Fred. That's right. It's the air freight market. Our IP parcel, we actually grew 2%,
which is a good thing. The issue is, we've got this big lane imbalance between Asia and United States and it keeps
driving itself farther and farther where you would actually have to put on more planes coming back from United States
back to Asia.
So, our goal is to take advantage of our network, that's a global network, where we have multiple airplanes in some
markets, pull them out, force the traffic that's truly IP into our planes, move into the lower-cost network, some of these
lower-yielding packages, more lane balance than the network around the world and we have a lot of opportunities
beyond just Asia to the United States. We're looking at Asia to Europe, and back and so forth.

So, when you look at the marketplace, we have a lot of growth in it, it's shifted to deferred, because you have
overcapacity in the air freight market.
In terms of airplanes, yes, we're looking at ways to – because of the pull-down in the international market there,
looking at ways to replace or retire, I should say, older, more inefficient – fuel inefficient maintenance planes sooner.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Justin, this is Alan. Two points. One, we're already seeing the benefit of flying fewer pounds at
higher-yields in the fourth quarter guidance that I gave you, that'll continue into 2014. So, as Dave said, Express'
performance in Q4 year-over-year will be a whole lot better than it was in Q3 and there's been a lot of cost cuts that are
already being done ahead of schedule.
Secondarily, from a CapEx standpoint, recall that Express' aircraft capital expenditures over the next two or three years
are largely replacement, and if anything, we're going to accelerate that, because we will be – if we decide to make some
elections to retire airplanes, they'll be the older airplanes that have significantly higher fuel burn, more maintenance, et
cetera. So, those capital investments we still want to make, because they still have a high ROIC. We're not taken by a
couple of 777s over the next several years. Most of those have been shoved way back, so whatever we come up with
here will be the size of the fleet we're going to fly internationally for at least two or three years.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone. Wanted to talk a little bit, kind of shifting gears a little bit just
away from the Asia, U.S. kind of lane, but over in Europe, obviously with the big merger that kind of fell through with
some of your competitors, how are you thinking about your opportunities there? I mean what are some of the current
trends and what are your kind of investment outlooks there to kind of take advantage of that growing region? Thanks.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, I – let me – this is Dave Bronczek again. Our European organic strategy we put in
place about 18 months ago has been performing exceptionally well. We've opened 70 stations in Europe. By the end of
this fiscal year, it'll be 87 and that's over a two-year period of time. The service is great. The volumes are growing.
As I mentioned before, Asia and Europe actually led the way for international export, but also in Europe. So, we're
actually very – we're very comfortable with our position in Europe right now. The markets are tough, but we're in a
very good position there.
Obviously, we don't talk about acquisition opportunities now and we – for a lot of good reasons, as Fred always talks
about, so I just wanted to point out, our European team is doing a great job; very happy with their results.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Yes. Good morning. A lot has been talked about Express, I wanted to shift over to FedEx
Freight for a bit. It was barely profitable in the quarter, so I was wondering does price need to go up there or is density
still weak and more terminals need to be closed, because the gap is just not being closed with the competition and the
competition is all operating a lot better than FedEx Freight, it's still a mile away from its former industry-leading
operating ratio.
<A - William J. Logue>: Hey – hi, David, this is Bill Logue. Again, as Alan said, our quarter three was our strongest
quarter three in five years, so we're probably most profitable in the quarter. The challenging issues that we have in this
quarter, obviously is December, January and February, and we've seen a significant impact from two less operating
days this year. And that had a big impact on our numbers.

So, again, our overall Q3 from our perspective, again we saw volume up; we saw yield up and we saw weight up. And
so, from that perspective, it was a good quarter. We took on some charges from the buyouts, as Alan mentioned,
increased depreciation. So, I think from that perspective, our business had a healthy Q3, and if you look forward, we
saw productivity in the quarter being very strong as well.
So, again our shipments per FTE were up 2%. So, from our perspective, we had a good quarter and as we move now
into Q4 so Q3 best in five years for us, so that was good progress.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning. Could you provide some perspective on – obviously, you're
taking air freight capacity out of the Asian market both inbound and outbound; but the trends, I guess into March and
the pace of factory activity coming back up online following Lunar New Year. I've been hearing some mixed data
points, as it pertains to that and the trajectory of March air freight out of Asia at the moment. Could you provide some
perspective on that front?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. We don't provide monthly forecasts and projections regarding the
business, but I would say that the trends have been stable. We expect those to continue, in terms of the shift in the mix
of the business. So, we don't anticipate any significant changes in the mix of traffic going forward.
I think the key for us as Dave has mentioned several times is the adjustments we're making to the network that allows
us to leverage the global network that we have to improve the profitability in our international segment.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hey, there. Good morning. Dave Rebholz, before we have you head on-off for your retirement, I
was wondering, if I could ask, could you just comment a little bit on your thoughts about growth in volumes. Alan read
sort of a number of items that affected the margins this quarter, but it is the second quarter where you've seen
incremental volume growth with margins that didn't go up?
So, I realize that maybe if we adjust for these things margins might have been flattish, but I think it's safe to assume
that at these kind of margin levels, it's tough to see the margins go up materially from here. So, do you think the time
has come to sort of slow the volume growth a bit and focus a bit more on yields to sort of get the profit growth instead
of just growing the share? How do you think about balancing those two? Thank you.
<A - David F. Rebholz>: Well – All right. So, you understand that the predominant factor was the year-over-year issue
of the favorable self-insurance. That is just simply a fact. We continue to grow not only in the second and third quarter.
We've picked up growth in the fourth quarter. We're very confident and happy about that.
I think, fundamentally that while margins are unpredictable relative to weather and different issues that affect us, the
timing of issues, the fact of the matter is, is that we have a better mouse trap. Our service is absolutely supreme. And
customers are coming and talking to us.
I think if you talk to my compadre, Mike Glenn, and the person who's going to replace me, who I have incredibly great
faith in, Henry Maier, who I hired in the first year that I went up to Ground for the purpose of replacing me and
building the organization and changing it. I don't see any end in sight.
Now, having said that, all of these issues come down to the fact that we have invested a lot of money; we've done it
efficiently and effectively to make sure that our service proposition is greater than the competition. Put that another
way, when there are too many people that want to get in the door, you've got to raise your yields.

Having said that, we will look at every customer on an individual basis and determine the value proposition that we
each share and essentially improve our margins. Putting that aside, I see no risk in the Ground proposition value today.
I think we are on the right track. We're moving in the right direction. So, I would ask Mike to comment on the yield,
but as a matter of fact, I think we're in a very good sweet spot.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: So, I appreciate your comment, but I do want to remind you that Ground had 10% growth in
the quarter and our yields excluding the impact of fuel grew almost 2%. So, I think that's very consistent with our
strategy to work with our operating companies to find the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement
to maximize the profitability. And I would encourage you to look at the long-term trends that we've been able to
produce here and we're very confident in our ability to position the outstanding value proposition we have in the
marketplace and our sales team is doing a great job with that.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: So, Bill, this is Alan. Just to answer your question, this company is about driving cash flows and
we're perfectly happy with continuing to grow the top line, while we maintain 17% or 18% margins at Ground and have
a 27.5% after-tax ROIC.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Alexander Hahn>: Hi. This is Alex Hahn in for Chris. I just had a question about incremental capacity and
investment in Ground, where do think that's going and do you think the network now is in a position to leverage future
volume growth?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, Alex, the good news about our problem is we constantly have to balance this;
the growth in the demand at the right price point, we will invest whatever is appropriate to take on new business.
However, we are well-suited moving forward.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: There we are. Can you hear me, guys? Hello?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yes.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you. David, congratulations, and best of luck. I have one question for Dave
and one question for Bill. On the international side, it sounds to me like what you're saying is the issue isn't growth; the
issue is the wrong assets in the wrong place for the type of business you're seeing, is that the way to think about it?
That's really the whole point of this realignment?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes, we have the wrong – we had high growth in deferred, which is good. As long as we
put it in the right network, that makes us more money. And we open up our network that actually is there for the
higher-yielding packages. And right now, it's being overrun almost by the deferred traffic.
So, we're moving that traffic off of our Express freighters on to a more – a lower-cost network, our FTN network. And
some of our own deferred flights and opening up the Orange network, our priority network at Express for the
higher-yielding traffic. So, when we do that, we actually force the capacity to go down and force the revenue quality to
go up.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys.
So a question on the Express side, so the mix shift seemed worse than you were thinking and you're trying to offset that
with more capacity reductions than I guess you were initially thinking. Net-net, how should that impact the $1.6 billion
of profit improvement over the next few years? And is there a point where if the mix shift continues to accelerate more
than you thought, where it's just impossible to offset with capacity?
And then maybe just separately, on the domestic side, first quarter of volume growth in Domestic Express in a couple
years. Do you think something is changing there and that's sustainable, or just kind of just a one-off quarter on easy
comps?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, I'll answer both questions. On the $1.6 billion that I gave you in October, off of our
FY 2013 base, that's all still in place.
On the international side, I think I gave you $350 million in that $1.6 billion was on the international piece. That's still
in place. We have probably more opportunity to try and beat that, quite frankly, with the way we're looking at our
network going forward.
In the United States, we're performing very well. The volumes, the yields, working with Mike Glenn and his sales
team. There's also a component in that $1.6 billion in our U.S. transformation and that's on plan. And quite frankly, our
team's doing a great job there.
So we just are adjusting our network right now, and we are big enough to do that and become more profitable there.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah, this is Fred Smith speaking. We've made this point a couple of times on these
calls and at the Investor Day back in October. The Express market is going to be around forever.
I mean the growth in Ground is outstanding, and it's a much bigger market in terms of units. But the types of things that
go into the Express network – things that require time-certain long-distance delivery – are going to continue to be a
requirement for shippers. It's just the ratio of the Express shipments to the Ground shipments.
And I think what you saw in this quarter was sort of a stabilization of the Express-Ground ratio. There's certainly
e-commerce driving a lot of traffic for Ground, and some proportion of the e-commerce requires Express delivery, so
that's really what you're seeing.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Hey. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that.
If you look at the profit improvement plan – and you're already talking about cutting more aircraft, a quarter after a
multi-year kind of program was set – does that mean, when you look back, you didn't go far enough in terms of
adjusting the network? I just want to understand how you think about how you need to reshape that domestic network,
as you're just about to enter the real part of the SG&A savings and network realignment?
<A - William J. Logue>: Well, let me be clear. It's really the global network that we're talking about here.
We have an opportunity – and I've challenged my team to – we have some older planes, 727s and some Tri-Motors,
that if we could retire them earlier, after what I told you before, would be better. But it's really across the world, and it's
on a global basis.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. I was wondering, could we talk a little bit about
your international/domestic operations, as well?
It looks like – obviously you've had a lot of acquisitions there, and the comps are impacted by those. But when I look at
your purchased transportation at the Express segment, it looks to be growing in line or maybe even a little bit above the
revenue growth in international/domestic. Is there any correlation there? And can you talk to the opportunities in those
new networks, and where the profit targets might be in the future?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, on that purchased transportation line, it looks like it's growing 30%. It's actually in
the base growing 2% – only 2%. It's acquisitions and FTN, which is a good thing.
Our domestic acquisitions are perfect for our company, and we will start harvesting the returns and the profit
opportunities in the very near future, going forward.
But on the purchase transportation, that 30% growth is, in the base, only 2%.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Thanks very much. Yeah, there's obviously been a lot of focus on Asia and Europe, and I was
wondering, if you could just take some time to elaborate and remind us about the FedEx opportunities, particularly with
LatAm, given the tremendous air freight growth we continue to see out of those markets? And then perhaps to a certain
extent, Middle East? Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, Dave can talk about this more in greater detail, but the Latin America market
is, in fact, growing.
We have a great position there, a great management team. We made an acquisition in Mexico. We made an acquisition
in Brazil. So we're very optimistic about the prospects for Latin America, and we have a good position there.
A lot of the air freight market – the traditional air freight market in Latin America are perishables. And we have a
position in that market to some degree. But as the acquisitions become integrated and turn from an expense to a
positive, as Dave told you, we are very optimistic about our Latin American results.
Dave's got a better focus perhaps on the Middle East, and he can give you some comments on that.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: I will, Fred. Thank you. I'll talk about Latin America for a minute, though.
Juan Cento, who's our Head of Latin America, is a fantastic executive.
We've acquired two terrific companies, one in Mexico, one in Brazil. Same cultural fit, same great service, same great
market presence, same great customer base. And we're going to see terrific returns when we harvest the profitability
there. We had to go through the obvious branding, the IT integration, but we're well on our way there. So you're going
to see more, very good performance out of Latin America.
In the Middle East, of course, in the Middle East, they're performing well. We have another acquisition in India that we
lump into our Middle East region – it's actually improving. And some of the line-haul adjustments across the world
actually affect India and the Middle East in a positive way.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question.
You mentioned being more return-on-invested-capital-focused at Ground, but does that make you – does that mean
then that this 17% to 18% margin level is where things stay, as the mix of B2C increases? Or are there some other
levers that you can pull to move those margins higher in Ground? And maybe where do you think they go from here?
<A - David F. Rebholz>: Well, there are plenty of levers.
I think the capital investment is in exactly the right spot. If you look at our past, it has been consistent. And we've been
able to provide a good return, as evidenced by our ROIC, as Alan said earlier.
There's nothing that is at risk. We are very judicious on how and where we spend money. And we're very judicious
about, as I said earlier, the right return from customers that come in the door.
So we will spend money when we can make money. End of story.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. A three-part question in Ground.
Part number one, could you just recap and assess the holiday season, now that we're all the way through, and just the
positives and negatives that you saw there in the Ground category?
Number two, the yield was a little bit lower than anticipated throughout Ground. And just how impactful were higher
postal rates in SmartPost? Just how should we think about that going forward? It was kind of addressed earlier, but if
you can touch on that?
And then lastly, weather impact in the quarter in Ground? Thank you very much.
<A - David F. Rebholz>: All right. This is Dave. Let's take the weather last.
Every year has its own experiences with weather. And clearly, this past year, there were some unique circumstances.
But frankly, we were able to perform effectively. And as evidenced by our contractor model, our contractors rose to the
occasion.
So from a service standpoint it was great. From a cost standpoint, in any kind of weather situation no matter what
organization you're talking about, in transportation, you have a lagging effect. So you might get hit for a week of bad
weather. You get some recovery as people rebound.
So put that aside. That is just simply a nominal issue.
In terms of – all right – so you had a three-part question. I want to make sure I answer them correctly. So go back to
your first question, because I want to make sure I have it right.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: The holiday.
<A - David F. Rebholz>: All right. The holidays. All right.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Right.
<A - David F. Rebholz>: So what happened in the holiday? The holiday was a great season for us. All of our large
customers had exceptional demand.
There was clearly demand from the online world that probably had not been experienced historically. That was good
for them, and that was good for us.

We recovered. We handled the business. We handled at a high level of service. Understand that when demands are
high, we're going to spend some extra money to make sure that the customers who do business with us all year long are
satisfied with our performance during the two weeks.
So I think that the retail sector is very healthy. There are some changing dimensions. We are prepared to handle it with
our three bottom-line product portfolios: Ground to Commercial; Ground to Home; and our SmartPost product
portfolio.
In terms of SmartPost, the only thing that we were surprised by was the relative rate increase from the Postal Service.
We are well-positioned to handle those rate increases. And our customers value the product portfolio. And we're very
well-positioned to handle additional growth in that network. And I think our partnership as their largest customer puts
us in a position to continue to grow.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: And Scott, this is Al. Let me just clarify one thing. You said that the Ground yields were less than
anticipated. That's your words. They came in almost exactly where we thought they would be.
And a little bit of the margin issue year-over-year is that we had a higher peaking factor in Ground this year. And that's
what Dave was referring to – that the higher the peaking factor, the more temporaries and the less productivity that you
get, when you get to those higher peaking factors. So some of that extra peaking traffic did not carry the same margins
in this year's peak as in last year's peak.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Scott, let me just make one comment about – as we – as part of our revenue management
process, when we bring on a large customer, especially in the e-commerce segment, we do a lot of work with the
operating company to look at not only the impact of the volume and yield in non-peak season, but how the traffic peaks
during peaking season, and how it's going to affect the overall profitability of the opportunity.
So we do a lot of extensive work to work closely with Ground to make sure that we have a clear understanding of the
impact of e-commerce and peaking as it relates to our margins.
So a lot of effort there. And I think the Ground company did a phenomenal job in providing outstanding service during
peak season.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Rabe with Raymond James.
<Q - Derek S. Rabe>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. This is Derek Rabe on for Art Hatfield.
You were granted licenses to operate the Domestic Express network in 8 cities in China back in September. Can you
just talk about customer response to this shift so far, and any growth opportunities or speed bumps you have
encountered or see going forward? And then also are there any progress updates toward countrywide access there?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. And I'm going to have Dave talk about it in greater
detail.
We have a very large domestic business in China. I don't know how this kind of has been obscured over the years. We
actually serve 400 cities in China. And we got that domestic network by acquiring our joint-venture partner some years
ago.
Then the Chinese government passed a different law that requires you to be re-licensed under a different part of the
China government. So they issued these licenses, and they've assured us that our domestic operation over time will be
re-licensed, if you will. But in the interim, that domestic business continues to operate and grow. And we're very
excited about it, because of its unique capabilities and it's one of those areas that could be lumped into the category that
Dave was talking about that will start producing profits in the years to come after having built this network. Dave, you
want to add anything on that?

it's business as usual for us. We do serve 400 cities there in China. There – we are making great strides there and we've
been in China for a lot of years. So, our international business is very big there. Our domestic business is growing
there. And we think that in the very near future, this will be very accretive for us than domestic business in China.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Well, thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. And Mr. Rebholz, congratulations on your
upcoming retirement. Yeah, I know we've talked a lot about Express and you talked about managing the traffic flows to
place low-yielding traffic in low-cost networks. As I think about the growth in your FedEx Trade Networks, does this
mean we could see an even greater focus on the ocean? And will you be looking maybe to drop some of that
lower-yielding traffic maybe to water?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes. We've had terrific growth in our FedEx Trade Networks organization and they've done
a fabulous job over the last three years, almost tripling or quadrupling their growth. That will continue. The customers
have a great – they can track-and-trace the same. They can use the same sales organization. So, the – the opportunities
for us to grow our FTN, our Trade Networks organization continues to be very big, because we started off in a modest
organization a couple years ago. And I think that this opportunity now that presents itself will let customers see how
good our service opportunities are at Trade Networks.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah, let me just add that I want to make sure we're clear here, the changes that we're talking
about in our network are not designed to take traffic out of our airplanes and put it on the ocean. The market will drive
the trends in terms of the mix between air freight and ocean traffic. And we are looking to make sure that we have the
right product in the right network to maximize profitability. But as Fred noted earlier, we do see growth in the overall
market in the ocean side and some pressure on the air side, but that's a different issue than what we're talking about here
in terms of rightsizing the network.
