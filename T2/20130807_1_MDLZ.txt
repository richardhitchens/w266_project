Thanks, Dexter, and good afternoon. Our second quarter and half results played out essentially as we told you they
would. Although our top line was below our long-term targets, our underlying business fundamentals were solid. We
exited the second quarter with strong volume/mix and Power Brand gains, faster growth in emerging markets, and
increasing market shares around the world. This positions us well to accelerate organic revenue growth and expand
margins in the back half of the year and in 2014. Earlier today, we also announced a substantial increase in our share
repurchase program as well as an increase in our quarterly dividend, our first raise since 2008.
These actions reflect our Board's confidence in our future, our balance sheet strength and our commitment to create
value for our shareholders. Let's take a closer look at the key metrics behind our first half results.
In both the second quarter and first half, we delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%. As I mentioned, that's below
our long-term target, but consistent with our first half guidance. As expected, the impacts of lower coffee prices and
capacity constraints tempered revenue growth by about 1.3 percentage points. Beneath the top line number, our
fundamentals were solid.
I say that for several reasons. First, we delivered high quality growth fueled by strong volume/mix. In fact, volume/mix
accounted for about three points or more than 75% of our top line growth. What's more, this strength was widespread.
We grew vol/mix in each of our regions. We're especially proud of the performance of our European team, who once
again drove strong underlying revenue in a very challenging macro environment.
Second, our focus on Power Brands continued to pay off, with revenue up 8% in the first half, more than double the
total company rate.
Third, our two largest categories posted strong revenue growth. Biscuits grew 8%, while chocolate was up 6%.
Although gum remains a challenge, we are seeing some encouraging signs of share recovery.
Fourth, in emerging markets, our revenue growth was 9.5%. Over the past few quarters, it has accelerated from 8.4% in
Q4 last year to 9.3% in Q1 to 9.7% in Q2. Importantly, it's now approaching our long-term target of double-digit
growth. Revenue in BRIC markets also continue to improve sequentially, up nearly 13% in Q2, including very strong
results in both Russia and Brazil.
Fifth, we're taking the opportunity to fast track a number of emerging markets investments originally planned for the
future. The impact of this is more than offset by the benefit of some tax favorability. These investments will generate
attractive returns and are expected to benefit both revenue growth and margin expansion in 2014.
And finally, our share performance was terrific. On a global basis, we're gaining or holding share in nearly 60% of our
revenue, with particular strength in biscuits, chocolate and coffee.
Let's take a closer look at results in each of our core categories. As I mentioned a moment ago, biscuits were up 8% in
the first half. In emerging markets, revenue increased low-teens, led by growth in Latin America. In developed markets,
biscuits were up mid-single-digits with strong growth in both North America and Europe. Our Power Brands grew
12%. Globally, Oreo was up nearly 15% and belVita, Tuc/Club Social, Barni, and Chips Ahoy! each posted impressive
growth. In addition, we continue to deliver outstanding share performance with more than three quarters of revenue in
key markets gaining or holding share. In chocolate, global revenue was up 6%.
In emerging markets, revenue was up low-teens with strong growth across all geographies. Developed markets were up
low-single-digits. Power Brands grew 11%. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up double-digits including more than 20% in Asia
Pacific. Milka increased double-digits, while Lacta delivered solid growth. Our chocolate share also remained strong
with more than half of our revenue in key markets gaining or holding share.
Turning to gum and candy; global revenue declined 2% in the first half. Candy was up mid-single-digits, driven by
Halls. Gum in emerging markets was also up mid-single-digits, led by the successful launch of Stride in China. So the

challenge continues to be gum in developed markets, which was down mid- to high-teens. However, we're beginning to
get some traction from the four initiatives that we've been executing. Better priced size architecture, stronger marketing
campaigns focused on fresh breath and oral care, more impactful displays and getting the right product assortment on
the shelf. In the second quarter, gum shares increased in the U.S. for the first time in a couple of years, and also grew in
most of our European markets as we implemented these same initiatives. Despite the share recovery, revenue lagged
somewhat due to the short-term impact on inventory as our customers reset their shelves. This should correct itself as
the year progresses.
Finally, in beverages and cheese and grocery, first half revenues held steady, with Power Brands up 3%. As expected,
coffee was down mid-single-digits as we passed through significantly lower green coffee costs. But this masked the
underlying momentum. Vol/mix was up mid-single-digits, and market shares were strong, with more than half of
revenue in key markets gaining or holding share. In addition, our Tassimo business continues to thrive. Revenues grew
nearly 40% in the first half as brewer sales more than doubled. Finally, in powdered beverages, we once again
delivered double-digit growth, led by Tang.
With that as background, let's take a closer look at our top line results by region. In Latin America, organic revenue
was up 9.6% in the second quarter and more than 11% in the first half. Brazil delivered strong growth despite an
increasingly challenged economic environment and softening category trends. The business grew low-teens with a
good balance between vol/mix and pricing. Outside Brazil, most of the region's growth was driven by pricing in the
inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. We remain cautious on these markets due to their volatility.
Overall, the region's Power Brands increased 13% led by Club Social, Oreo, Halls and belVita.
In Asia Pacific, organic revenue grew 3.3% in the second quarter and 4.6% in the first half, with vol/mix gains driving
nearly all of the growth. The region's Power Brands grew 18% led by Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Stride,
and Tang.
The story in this region, however, is a tale of two cities or more precisely, a tale of the contrast between emerging and
developed markets. Emerging markets across the region were up double-digits in the first half, including mid-teens
growth in China and low-double-digits in India. Despite its strong results, China slowed sequentially from more than
20% in Q1 to low-double-digits in Q2, reflecting softening category trends in biscuits. Our Power Brands, Oreo and
Chips Ahoy!, delivered solid gains, but some of our smaller brands declined. The success of Stride gum, however,
continued to boost our top line.
In India, we again delivered double-digit growth, led by Cadbury dairy milk. That's despite capacity constraints that
continue to temper growth in chocolate. With new production lines now on stream, we expect revenue to accelerate in
the second half as we look to fully support the category which continues to grow at more than 20% a year. In contrast,
the developed markets in the region were down low- to mid-single-digits mainly due to gum and candy weakness in
both Japan and Australia.
Turning to EEMEA; organic revenue grew 11.3% in the second quarter, and nearly 8% in the first half fueled by strong
vol/mix gains across most markets. Power Brands grew 12%, led by Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo, Barni, Tuc and Tang.
Our turnaround in Russia drove the growth as we significantly improved our sales execution. In the second quarter,
Russia was up mid-teens as exceptionally strong vol/mix was partially offset by lower pricing in coffee and chocolate.
Looking at Europe, organic revenue increased modestly, up two-tenths of a percent in both the second quarter and first
half. Vol/mix gains were largely offset by lower coffee pricing. In fact, lower coffee revenues reduced Europe's overall
growth by 1.3 points in the quarter and nearly 2 points in the half. But our vol/mix was exceptional, up 3.8 percentage
points in Q2 and up sequentially from 1.3 points in the first quarter. In the first half, chocolate revenues rose
mid-single-digits, driven almost entirely by vol/mix. Biscuits were up mid-single-digits, with about three-quarters of
the gain due to vol/mix. Oreo, belVita, and our chocobakery platforms delivered much of the growth.
Coffee was down mid-single-digits due to pricing, but our convenient coffee formats such as Millicano and Tassimo
were up strongly. Gum and candy revenues were down high-single-digits, all due to gum. And Power Brands increased
3% across the region. In North America, organic revenues increased 2.3% in the second quarter, and 2.4% in the first

half. U.S. biscuits was a standout, with revenues up more than 5% in the second quarter. In fact, that represents the
eighth consecutive quarter of growth of 5% or more.
Oreo, Honey Made, belVita, Chips Ahoy! and Triscuit, each made solid contributions to the first half. This business
continues to benefit from the renewed focus on in-store execution by our direct store delivery sales force following the
spin. For example, through our One More in the Store initiative, we increased the number of displays nearly 17% in
Q2. DSD is also a key enabler to get our new products on shelves. In the first half, nine of the top 10 new biscuit
products in the U.S. were ours. As a result, our market share is up 140 basis points in the quarter and 100 points
year-to-date.
In contrast, gum and candy was down high-single-digits. Candy once again delivered solid gains, but gum declined
sharply as our customers reset their shelf assortments. As I mentioned earlier, though, our gum share in the U.S. has
improved, gaining four-tenths of a point in Q2 and a full point in the last four weeks of the quarter.
From a margin perspective, we have a lot of work to do, but we're making progress toward our goal of increasing
margin by 500 basis points over the next five years. We recently announced plans to invest approximately $350 million
in the construction of a new biscuit manufacturing facility in Mexico. When its doors open in the second half of 2014,
this facility will support biscuit growth across the Americas and will enhance margins by utilizing state-of-the-art
technologies that enable manufacturing at world-class costs.
We also announced our transition to a category-led organization effective January 2014. Modeled after our success in
Europe, this structure is designed to simplify processes, reduce costs and increase the speed of decision-making.
Ultimately, we expect this category-led structure will accelerate top line growth, drive share and improve margins,
much as it did in Europe.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave to discuss margins, earnings and our outlook for the balance of the year.
David A. Brearton
Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene just described, we're poised to accelerate revenue growth in the second
half and into 2014. We expect gross profit margin to expand in the back half of the year as well, as productivity
programs pick up steam and as we drive leverage from stronger revenue growth.
In the first half, however, adjusted gross margin was essentially flat as pricing and vol/mix gains offset higher input
costs. Adjusted operating income margin in the second quarter improved sequentially to 11.4%, up from 10.3% in Q1.
For the first half, however, adjusted OI margin was 10.8%, down 170 basis points, but in line with the expectations we
communicated earlier this year. The results reflect a combination of factors, including about 50 basis points from
cycling of prior year one-time items, about 30 points from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, and about 20
points from ongoing restructuring costs. In addition, we invested over $100 million to drive growth in emerging
markets. While this tempered margins by about 70 basis points in the first half, it sets us up for a much stronger 2014
on both the top and bottom lines.
Turning now to earnings per share; adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.37 including a negative $0.01 impact from
currency. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 5.6%. For the first half, adjusted EPS was $0.71 including
a negative $0.05 impact from currency. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 13.4%, driven primarily by
lower taxes. As I mentioned, however, our incremental investments in emerging markets were a key driver of the $0.04
decline in operating earnings.
Turning to guidance; we continue to expect organic revenue this year to grow at the low-end of our 5% to 7%
long-term target. And on the bottom line, we're reaffirming our outlook for adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.60. This range
reflects average 2012 foreign exchange rates as well as an estimated negative $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the
Venezuela bolivar. As you know, the dollar has strengthened since the start of the year. Based on translation impacts
recorded to-date, and spot rates as of July 31st, our EPS would be about a nickel lower than the $1.55 to $1.60
guidance. We fully recognize that reaching our full-year outlook will require a step-up in top line growth and margin

expansion in the back half.
So let me give you some understanding of why we believe we'll deliver. In the second half, we expect to achieve top
line growth of about 6%, despite a slowdown in our categories that we and many of our peers are experiencing. Let me
tell you why. First, we're entering the second half with good momentum. Our vol/mix gains and market share
performance have been strong. Second, in the first half, we faced headwinds from capacity constraints and lower coffee
pricing, which together were nearly a 1.5 drag. We don't expect capacity constraints to be a significant issue going
forward. Coffee pricing will still be a headwind, but we expect it to be less than the 1 point impact in the first half.
Third, we have favorable comparisons with the prior year, especially in Q3. And fourth, our emerging market
investments in sales capabilities, route-to-market expansion, and A&C support behind our Power Brands will reinforce
our momentum and should help offset the impact of slower category growth
With respect to margins, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin to be essentially flat at about 12% for the year. With
the first half coming in at just under 11%, this implies a second half margin of about 13%. How will we get there? First,
in the back half, we expect non-sales overheads to be in line with prior year, as cost reduction programs lessen the
impact of dissynergies. As a result, we should benefit from overhead leverage as revenues increase. The impact of this
should be even more pronounced in the fourth quarter due to its higher revenue contribution. And second, a
disproportionate amount of the benefits from productivity are weighted to the back half.
As we outlined at recent investor conferences, we expect to increase our adjusted OI margin to 14% to 16% within the
next five years. That's starting from 12.2% in 2012 with a 2015 target of about 13%. That's over 13.5%, excluding
ongoing restructuring charges.
Let me give you a sense of how that plays out specifically for 2013 and 2014. As you can see on this chart, base
margins will expand in line with our algorithm both this year and next, about 60 to 90 points per year. Next month, at
the Back-to-School Conference, we'll provide more details on our plans to deliver this base margin increase. Originally,
we targeted spending about $100 million on investments in emerging markets this year.
As we mentioned in May, based on affordability, opportunity, and return, we've chosen to accelerate a number of
investments that were originally planned in the future. As a result, rather than a 20 to 30 basis point impact, we now
expect these investments to more than double and temper margins to 50 to 70 points this year. That creates a bigger
margin headwind in 2013, but that spending is now in our base, which means a much smaller incremental impact in
2014. These programs are all expected to generate returns well in excess of our cost to capital, and deliver sustainable
profitable growth.
In China, for example, we're improving sales coverage in traditional trade outlets in Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets as well
as continuing to develop routes-to-market in Tier 3 and 4 cities. We're also increasing A&C to create brand awareness
in these new outlets. In India, we're expanding distribution in the south as well as stepping-up A&C support. And in
Russia, we're investing in sales capabilities that will improve our availability in the hot zone and traditional trade outlet.
Across these markets, we expect increased A&C to translate into improved share results in the second half of this year
and in the next year. Benefits from investments in sales and distribution will take a little longer to realize, but should
contribute in 2014.
Also, as we said in May, in addition to the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program, we intend to invest up to $100 million in
ongoing restructuring in 2013. That will reduce margins by about 10 to 20 basis points this year. We plan to invest
somewhat more in 2014 en route to the $200 million to $300 million in annual spending we will reach in 2015. This
spending is key to the cost reduction efforts needed to deliver our long-term margin goals.
So in 2013, as we said, we expect adjusted OI margin to be roughly flat at about 12%. But in 2014, we get the benefit
of two years in one, as much of our base margin increase will flow-through so we expect to expand margins to the
high-12s next year. So how do we expect to drive double-digit EPS growth this year as we increase our emerging
market investments? The answer is lower taxes. In the first half, our adjusted tax rate was around 6%, which reflected a
number of discrete items.

For the full-year, we now expect our tax rate to be 12% to 14%. That implies a tax rate in the second half of 16% to
20%. The Q3 rate is likely to be well below that range while the Q4 rate will be higher. In terms of EPS, the lower tax
rate will generate a benefit of $0.11 to $0.14 for the full-year. Putting it all together, we expect adjusted EPS to be
$0.84 to $0.89 in the second half, and for the full-year, we continue to expect 14% to 18% EPS growth on a constant
currency basis.
Let me now turn it back to Irene.
Irene B. Rosenfeld
Before I wrap up, in a separate press release today, we announced our intention to increase the return of capital to
shareholders. As you may recall, at CAGNY, we committed to resuming share buybacks and dividend increases once
our leverage ratios were back in line with our targeted credit rating. As a reminder, our priorities for cash are, first and
foremost, to invest in the business to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And as we've discussed, we're doing that.
We're also aggressively expanding capacity, increasing capital expenditures from about 4% of revenues to about 5%.
That includes, for example, the expansion of a biscuit plant in China, the construction of the new growth facility in
Mexico that I mentioned earlier, and a new greenfield site in India. It also includes a number of other high-return
expansions around the world. Our second priority for cash is tack-on acquisitions. At present, we believe we have
ample flexibility to manage the M&A opportunities that may become available in the near-term. The third priority for
cash is the return of capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and/or higher dividends. And the fourth is
paying down debt.
We've now reduced our gross debt to about $18 billion and net debt to about $15.5 billion. At these levels, our leverage
ratio is now consistent with our target rating, investment grade with access to CP. So with investments fully funded and
a solid credit profile, we can now return more capital to shareholders, while still preserving our ability to pursue future
strategic opportunities.
As such, today we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.14 a share, an increase of a penny or 8%.
We're also significantly increasing our current share buyback authorization to $6 billion, or about $1 billion to $2
billion annually through 2016. We believe that the combination of double-digit EPS growth, higher dividends, and a
substantial increase in share buybacks creates a highly attractive mix that taken together will drive superior returns for
our shareholders.
So to wrap up, our first half results demonstrated solid underlying business momentum, including strong vol/mix and
Power Brand gains, faster growth in emerging markets, and increasing market shares globally. We'll build on these
strengths in the second half to deliver improved performance. On the top line, we'll benefit from our first half
momentum and increased investments in emerging markets as headwinds from coffee pricing and capacity constraints
begin to subside. And on the bottom line, we expect margins to expand as revenue growth accelerates and as we
aggressively drive productivity and overhead cost savings. As a result, we're positioned to deliver our commitments for
2013 and to drive sustainable profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.

<Q - Chris Growe>: Hi. Just two questions for you. The first one I'd like to ask is just as you think about the emerging
market investments, Irene, you had some tax favorability in the first quarter, you have some more here in this quarter.
You let some of that flow-through in the first quarter. I just want to get an understanding now like all the tax benefits
that are coming through this year, should we assume that the majority of those are being reinvested back into the
business? I'm trying to put some color around the amount of incremental reinvestment back in the business.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, I think, Chris, we gave you a schedule to show that. We said we'd generate about
$0.11 to $0.14 favorability from taxes. We gave about $0.03 back in the first quarter, as you recall. Our investments are
about $0.06 and that just gives you a sense of how we're thinking about that.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Okay. And then if I could also ask a question I guess maybe more for Dave regarding your
increase. Did the share repurchase authorization and your increasing likelihood to repurchase shares, is there an
expectation that you would take on debt? I was trying to think about your free cash flow over the next year or two. Is
that free cash flow growing faster than you expected and allowing you to do more share repurchase activity? Or is there
the capacity to take on some more debt?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Well, the free cash flow is pretty much in line with what we laid out at CAGNY at this
point in time, but I think as you think about what we said at CAGNY, 2013 and 2014, we've still got the Restructuring
Program spending in there. As we get going forward beyond 2014, that will disappear out of the base and we'll be
delivering a stronger cash flow. So we may have to take on a small amount of incremental debt in the near-term, but I
think it's well within what we can afford as we go over time.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Okay, thanks for the time.
Operator
Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good evening, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Just one thing I wanted to follow up on Chris's question just to make sure I fully understand the
new full-year guidance. When you reported the first quarter, you mentioned you were holding I think $0.03 to $0.04 of
tax flexibility in your pocket for the rest of the year, and then as I look at your current guidance, you're saying it's still
$1.55 to $1.60, but you also beat this quarter, taxes more favorable than you thought even at the end of the first quarter.
And relative to our model, interest expense was also much more favorable. So I'm just trying to get a sense of where
some of that flexibility is going.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, Andrew, we're still looking to keep our powder dry as we look to the balance of the
year. There's quite a bit of volatility in a number of these markets, and we want to make sure that we are appropriately
hedged to deliver our commitments.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. And then we're now I guess five weeks into your third quarter, and I wanted to get a
sense from you if you could, just even directionally, are the trends you're seeing so far in the third quarter relatively
consistent with your expectation for the kind of acceleration you're expecting in – most importantly, in the organic rate
of top line growth that you're looking for in the second half of the year?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, I don't want to give you a week-by-week guidance, but what I will tell you is
certainly we have expressed great confidence in the back half of the year for all the reasons that we've said, and there's
nothing we're seeing that's inconsistent with that.

Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: A question about as we look at the organic sales performance in the first half, especially in
the second quarter, one thing that's been really encouraging is that volumes have accelerated sequentially over the last
couple of quarters. And if you go back to some of the years where – the period where organic sales growth was at the
high-end of your range, there was probably more of a pricing component, actually, volume wasn't really a big
contributor to revenue growth. So I guess what I'm asking is, as you move into the second half of the year, do you
expect that vol/mix to continue to be in that 3% to 4% range in terms of the contribution of revenue growth, first? And
then second, of all the pieces that are still sort of below sort of your long-term expectations, whether it's gum, some of
the developed markets, coffee contribution, where do you think the – we should look for sort of the acceleration?
Should it come from even more growth in the emerging markets? Or should some of those weaker areas begin to
contribute more?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think on the first bit, I can cover that, and then Irene can cover the second bit. I
think when you go back to those days when we had much lower vol/mix, it was a very high pricing environment. That
was when we had the commodity run-up and naturally there was a bit of pullback on vol/mix as consumers and the
trade, frankly, reacted to those price increases. Obviously we're in a very benign pricing environment today. So almost
the entire revenue growth you're seeing is coming from vol/mix. As we look at the back half, I'm not looking to input
costs to increase or pricing to measurably improve, so most of that revenue improvement on the back half is going to
have to come from vol/mix.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: But if you think about it, just to put it in some perspective, Bryan, I think if you think about
the 3.8%, as we said, we believe that about a point – 1.3 points is due to, coffee is about 1 point and about 0.3 due to
capacity constraints. As we then exit the first half, those headwinds will – certainly in the case of coffee will lessen. It's
still going to be there. The capacity constraints should be behind us. And so as we look to what we're going to execute
in the back half, we feel quite comfortable that the momentum we've got in the front half, the spending that we've got in
our emerging markets and our overall share performance will carry us through.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So I guess it stands to reason that your confidence in an increase in A&C spending in the
second half will have an influence because you're really targeting consumption growth as opposed to pricing? I mean
the idea is that if you spend more in advertising and consumer spend, you should drive even more consumption.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: That's correct. But I would also tell you that the programs that we are investing behind are
proven programs. I mean it's things like the launch of Golden Oreo in China, the route expansions that Dave alluded to
in both China and India. It was some incremental preseason support on Tang. These are proven programs that we have
invested in, so we have high confidence that we'll get a good return on those investments.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great. Thank you and good evening, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Wanted to – Dave, wanted to just maybe ask very directly the EPS guidance or – you didn't
actually give it – but on the third quarter it seems like you're expecting stronger revenue growth but the OI margin

expansion isn't as good as in the fourth quarter. There seem to be a number of puts and takes on the tax rate, et cetera.
Bottom line, would the third quarter EPS all-in, it should be a little bit less than the EPS contribution for the fourth
quarter, did I – I think I've taken into account everything, but can you confirm that?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I don't want to give you quarterly EPS, but I can give you two pieces of sort of help. Firstly,
on the OI margins, I wouldn't compare to prior year because prior year was pretty unusual given the timing of a lot of
spending and a lot of revenue as we were preparing for the spin. So last year was pretty unusual. This year I think is
going to be more normal. You'll see our OI margins improve progressively through the year, and our high points will
be in quarter four. So that would be the first point.
Secondly, on the taxes, we did say a few minutes ago that we would expect our taxes in the back half to be higher, but
frankly Q3 is going to be well below that 16% to 20% rate I said a minute ago, and Q4 will be higher. And again it's
because of some discrete items that we would expect to hit Q3 that will benefit Q3. So those are two elements I can
give you some guidance on.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: And then, Dave, just three other quick ones. Tax rate, I get this question a lot. Is the low tax
rate in 2013 going to be a headwind for 2014, or is the comment that you've reinvested it and that even when this tax
rate normalizes to something higher, the fact is, is that there are other pieces of the P&L that will change in 2014 to
compensate? Is that a correct way of thinking about the tax issue?
<A - David A. Brearton>: We've given guidance for a tax rate for the next three to five years that it's going to be
around 20% plus or minus. This year was unusually low so I'm not going to give specific guidance for next year. But
this year was really an outlier. I mean last year was about 20%. This year we're down quite a bit below that. Going
forward, over the next three to five years, I would expect to see closer to 20% again.
In terms of potential offsets, I'd maybe return back to instead the OI conversation we had. By accelerating the emerging
market investments from future periods into 2013, we've essentially built that into our base, and so it means we're going
to get two years of OI margin expansion in one next year, and we would expect our margins to grow from, as we said,
this year flat to last year, up in the high-12%s next year. And so our EPS next year is largely going to be OI-driven.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. Final two for me, fast ones. Marketing, what was marketing up in the first half of the
year? And last question on interest expense, can you give us interest expense guidance for 2013?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, marketing is about 9.5% of revenue, so it's similar to what it was in the first quarter.
And interest expense, I mean, I wouldn't expect – we had a small one-timer that we called out as we talked about that
was $0.01 to $0.02, but otherwise I'd say our trend on interest expense should be relatively even through the year.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Yeah. We're about $18 billion on gross debt and our weighted average rate is about 5.9%.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: You had some options in the back half of the year, though, on debt pay-down, so I think
there were questions as to whether or not interest expense was going to change in the final couple of quarters. So you're
saying second quarter run rate is a good run rate?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, we will be – we've got $1.8 billion coming due in October. We'd expect to pay that
off with a combination of cash and commercial paper issuance.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay, thank you.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Okay.

Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. A follow up to Dave Driscoll's question. I think you said that marketing was 9.5% of
revenue in Q1 and Q2, but what was it last year? And does it reflect an increase in marketing spending year-over-year?

And then secondly, just to drill down a little bit on U.S. gum, we took a look at some Kantar Media data, and it showed
big declines in tracked media spending in U.S. gum. I think it could have been reflected on the fact that you might be
increasing digital in your mix, but I thought that you had a lot of digital spending last year, too. So I'm just trying to get
a sense of whether the advertising cuts might have caused some of this decline in U.S. gum. Thanks.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I'll answer the first bit. Last year, our spending was 9.4% of revenue. Versus last year, you
would see within our mix, we're spending a lot more in emerging markets, and we are a little tighter in the developed
markets.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Bob, we feel quite comfortable with the level of spending we have behind our gum. As I've
talked about, we have made some important changes in the price size architecture. We have strengthened our
campaigns. Any declines that you see are really reflecting the mix we are increasingly investing at point-of-buying as
opposed to on television. For example, it's much more focused on digital and point-of-buying, and so you would see a
reported change in Kantar. But it does not reflect this level of support that we've got behind the business. And as you've
seen from the share numbers that I quoted to you, we're feeling very good about the results that this spending is
generating.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. And then one more question on the guidance. You said that you've seen some
slowing growth in categories in China, Russia and Brazil. To what extent did that affect your overall top line? Like if
you – could you quantify what that would mean just to the category growth assumption for the year? And just to give
us a sense of how much harder your business has to work, Dave, to grow for the remainder of the year to offset it.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, let me just give you some perspective. We start with the fact that we're growing our
share – growing or holding share in about 60% of our revenue. So a key offset to the slowing category is our share
gains, and we're seeing very strong share performance around the world and a lot of the investments that we're making
in our franchises, particularly in the emerging markets, is designed to help us there. But just for perspective, as you
think about the BRIC markets, for example, GDP has gone down from about 5% – year-to-date about 5%. It was about
6% the same time a year ago, and yet our revenue within those markets is up 13%. So there is not a direct correlation
nor should there be. There's no question we have to work harder in the face of some of these category slowdowns. But
the strength of our brands and the investments that we're putting behind brand equity as well as route-to-market is what
will carry us.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Got it. So you're up double-digit. That's more than enough to offset a 1% change in BRIC
GDP.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: As an example, yes, in aggregate, yeah.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from Eric Katzman at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi. Good evening.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hello, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Dave, I guess let me ask you a question on I think maybe it was Chris Growe, but when I do
the math, you basically have about $3 billion of net income, you've got depreciation and amortization of [ph] $1 billion
to $1.3 billion (43:12), CapEx has been running $2 billion, and your dividends are at least $2 billion with – and you're
increasing that. And that evens out to a free cash flow after dividends of basically zero. So where is other than just
straight-out leveraging over the next year or two until CapEx comes down, where is the share repo funding coming
from?

<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think when we talked at CAGNY we actually laid out our cumulative cash flow for
the 2013 and 2014 period. And so if you can go back and look at that, but I think we essentially said we had about $1
billion a year in [ph] facility (43:53). And I think what we're talking about here, if we're buying $1 billion to $2 billion,
there's no question that if you take the midpoint of that in the short-term, we would have a modest increase in our debt.
But I think as we wind through that Restructuring Program and the cash spending on that goes through, this is a
program that we can pay for out of our ongoing cash flow. So there will be a short-term increment, but it won't be big.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then unrelated question, but when I look at your performance in the latest quarter
across the regions, most of them are actually pretty solid in terms of volume/mix, and this EEMEA outlier of up 12% –
I know you said there was a big recovery in Russia, but I'm just a little worried that in the past the company has been
kind of stung by over-shipping consumption, and we'll find out later that it was a kind of a false positive. So why
shouldn't I be worried that, that one segment was so strong relative to everywhere else in the world? I mean, was Russia
just a complete disaster a year-ago and it's such a strong rebound? Or maybe you could just add a little more color
there.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think I'd say two things. Number one, Russia did have a very strong rebound, and
that's a combination of good marketing and share gains to get this year but a soft base as well a year ago. So that is true.
But I'll also I'd say we've got good growth in most of the EEMEA markets. We are growing well over 20% in Egypt,
we're growing well in Ukraine, we're growing in high-single-digits down in South Africa, we're growing in
double-digits in North Africa and Nigeria. As well, I think as you may recall from the first quarter, in the Saudi Arabian
market, we had a joint venture that we set up and essentially had to wind down shipments to the existing distribution
network and didn't ship much in that first quarter. So we've got a rebound from that as we get back to normal shipments
in quarter two. So there's a lot of factors. Would I expect to be growing 12% vol/mix every quarter? No. But I think we
feel pretty good that it is widespread strength, and no, I'm not worried that we're shipping ahead of consumption.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Thanks, Eric.

Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good evening, everyone. Two questions. First of all, the investments – the $100 million
investments in sales capabilities and route-to-market expansion and A&C support. Could you tell us a little bit about
where those are being deployed? Are they in the already-profitable BRIC countries? Or is this the beginning of getting
into the next wave markets that presumably aren't making money as yet?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, at this time, Alexia, the focus is on the already good gross margin BRIC markets. It's
an investment, as I said, behind – and if you think about the A&C support, it's business behind businesses like Oreo. In
particular I talked about Golden Oreo launch in China. It's the opportunity to continue to expand our sales coverage
both in China and in India. And it's the opportunity to continue to expand some of our innovation platforms. So these
are proven programs that have high returns, and that's why we felt quite comfortable accelerating them.
<A - David A. Brearton>: And, Alexia, jump in on the other markets. We do make money in almost all of our
emerging markets. So we talked about the BRICs because they're the biggest and they have very strong gross margins
and good OI margins. We also have very good gross margin and very strong OI margins in our other emerging markets.
We don't talk to them as much because they're smaller, but they all have very good margins. And we would not invest
in any country that didn't have a very strong gross margin, such that we could get good return on investment on those,
on those bets.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Okay, great. And then as a follow up, your Power Brands are growing much faster than
your non-Power Brands. Does that mean that there's SKU rationalization going on in those non-Power Brands globally?
And I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how many SKUs you have globally and where that might go to,

over time, if that's happening. Thank you. And I'll pass it on.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I don't think I want to get into an SKU discussion, but you can ask us that on some
future conference. I think it is a combination of – it depends on the market. There is some SKU proliferation that we're
pulling back on clearly. There is simply a matter of focusing on the brands that are going to be the future of the
company, and spending less support on the secondary and tertiary brands. And there's just smaller brands in markets
that just don't have the scale, over time, to sustain themselves. So they've been broadly for the last two or three years,
those sort of non-Power Brands have been broadly flat has kind of been the traditional trend we've been on, and I
would expect that's probably a realistic expectation going forward as well.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good evening, guys. Thanks for the question. It's been a while since you've done this,
but I was hoping that maybe you could disaggregate the volume and mix for us to give us a better sense of volume
trends and how big the mix headwind is.
<A - David A. Brearton>: No, we stopped doing that because truthfully if I give you a classic example, it comes down
to – if you change the pricing, that obviously is pricing. If you start doing downsizing, then you get into very
complicated volume versus mix calculation. So that's the reason we went away from it. Also gum doesn't weigh a lot,
but – so we will continue to report vol/mix as one number.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. I wanted to circle back, then, to Rob Moskow's question on what's ailing gum. Irene, I
think I heard you say that you don't think it's a spend issue at least in terms of measured media. But when you look at
the numbers, since the end of 2008, sugar confection up, like, 366% in measured media, chocolate up 97%, gum down
57%. How can we look at those numbers and not think that there's a spending problem or a marketing investment
problem behind the category?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, I'll tell you, Jason, we talked about the fact two years ago when we bought the
business we felt that there was a spending problem. There's no question that Cadbury in the final moments had pulled
back quite extensively on marketing support for gum and had very aggressively priced the category, and that was part
of the reason that we started to see some weakness fairly early on. We corrected that very early on, so that's why I feel
quite comfortable with the level of spending. The issue for us is just making sure that we've got the right marketing mix
within that spending.
I think the issues that we've talked about, there's really four that we've been focused on. It's been about pricing and
sizing both at the lower end and the upper end, particularly in markets like Southern Europe where the economies are
still quite challenged and we're finding that we're getting very good consumer take-away as we do a better job of
covering the spectrum of price points within gum. So that's been a very important part of our fixing program.
The second is, as I said, some of our marketing spending we were not feeling was as effective as possible. Some of the
campaigns had gotten a little bit too esoteric, and we've brought them back to the fundamental category benefits of
breath freshening as well as oral care, and we're finding we're getting a good response to that.
The third is more impactful displays. We have a number of examples around the world. Argentina is probably our best
example where we have displays that are increasing our take-away by 30%, 40%, and we've more broadly implemented
those displays in a number of our key gum markets.
And then last, which is probably the most significant, is the category over time got very heavily dependent on
innovation to the point where a lot of the base SKUs were being replaced by some of the innovation, and we were
participants in this, but it turns out that some of those innovations were not carrying their weight.

And so it's taken us some time to manage the category, to get our customers to change their shelf sets, and as I
mentioned, part of the reason there is a lag between our share performance and the revenue growth is simply because it
takes a while for our customers to make these shelf set changes. But really those are the four areas that we've been
focused on, and we are beginning to see some good traction in our key gum markets, particularly in the U.S. and in
Europe.

Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. Could you just provide a bit more detail on the
deceleration in volume trends in Latin America during the quarter? What were some of the factors? You called out
Mexico in particular as having weaker vol/mix. What were some of the factors at play there? And are there any
additional markets you'd highlight where volumes softened or where you saw more pricing come through and just shift
the balance during the quarter?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think, I'd start with we had very good vol/mix in the most important market, which
is Brazil. And that was really the key one. I think vol/mix declines really were driven by Argentina to some degree,
which has its own economic issues, and Mexico. And Mexico was really obviously – I'll say – it's gum, so it's the same
old thing. And an increase in competition in powdered beverages, but it's really those two categories in Mexico that
drove the negative vol/mix.

Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hi. Good afternoon. When you think about some of the macro trends you're seeing – I know
you touched on this a little bit, in emerging markets versus Western Europe, there seems to be a – maybe a bit of a
consensus thesis out there that emerging market's slowing a bit, Europe recovering a bit. Is it fair to say that you're
seeing that as well? One interpretation of some of your numbers sequentially would suggest that it is, but I'm just
curious if that's a fair analysis on a broad scope.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, Ken, I would say that's not exactly what we are seeing. I mean I would say our
Western – we are very pleased with our Western Europe trends, and we really feel very good about the progress that
we've made in a number of our core categories. Certainly in the most troubled parts of the eurozone, Southern Europe
in particular, we're still continuing to see softness. I do want to try to put, though, the category slowdown in some
context. When the emerging market categories slow down, they're still growing at 3 to 4 times the rate that we see in
the developed markets. So yes there's been a slowdown in a number of these markets, and I cited the GDP to revenue
relationship that we're seeing in the BRIC markets, for example. So there's no question we are seeing some slowdown. I
talked about biscuits in China. Biscuits category in China grew last year about 18%. The first half of this year it's up
only about 6%. So when I talk about slowdown, that's the kind of the dynamic that we're seeing but we're still seeing
the emerging markets for the most part are growing quite a bit faster than any of the developed markets. But I feel quite
pleased with the performance that we've seen in a number of our developed markets. I talked about the strong U.S.
biscuit performance, for example, as well as the strong underlying performance of our European business.

Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey. Good evening, everyone
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hello, Ken.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just two quick questions. One is how do you guys decide to actually just – to repurchase
stock and go that avenue rather than accelerate investments or cost-cutting efficiencies?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think – as Irene laid out, we basically – we had our three cash priorities that we
were focused on, and the first was – as you rightly indicate, investing in the business whether that's cost reduction
opportunities or whether it's investing in growth. As we sit here today, we believe we've funded the investments we
need to deliver the numbers we put out in 2013 and 2014 and beyond.
So that was the first step. We did look at M&A, and we think we have the flexibility for that. And we always said the
third step, the place we would turn to next would be returning cash to shareholders. So we did follow that sequence in
looking at the opportunity, and we did wait until we got our debt in line before we started those discussions. So it was a
thoughtful process, and it was tied really into our strategic plan process.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And then my last thing, as you gain share in gum, can you talk about your profit profile
change just to see how that actually has changed?
<A - David A. Brearton>: I don't think we give profit by category, and I wouldn't want to go down that road now.
Gum is a highly profitable business for the gross margin line. So I think that's about as far as I'll go.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Okay.

Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good evening, everybody. Maybe I'm a little bit slow tonight. I'm just trying to figure out what all
the puts and takes for the guidance are for the full year. And I have on the plus side maybe lower than expected tax rate,
maybe some share repurchases, the interest expense is lower, and then that is partially offset by reinvestments and
currency. Am I missing anything? And is the net-net of this a positive impact on the full year guidance or does it just
even out?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah. I think we held our full-year guidance at constant currency of $1.55 to $1.60. That's
the same number we gave back in May. Within that, taxes will be favorable to that. We have invested more behind that.
Interest is very small. And share buyback frankly will be very small as well because we're doing most of that towards
the end of the year. So I think that would be the two big swing factors. Currency, we called out that there was a $0.05
risk on currency because the guidance we give is at constant currency. So currency stayed where they were on July 31st
for the rest of the year, then the number would come down by about a nickel.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Got you. And then the other question I had, the pricing in Asia Pacific turned negative this
quarter. What's behind that?
<A - David A. Brearton>: It's just a question of timing of promotions and reacting to competitive events. But I think
importantly we're focused on maintaining the gross margin going forward.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. So that shouldn't trend for the rest of the year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: No.

We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Thanks for the question. Good afternoon.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hello, John.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Irene, wondering if you can speak a little bit to your introduction of the Nespresso
compatible capsules over in Europe. I know you've seen all the branded competitors do that in recent years. It's worked
out quite well for them reinvigorating their brands. So just wondering if you can speak maybe to the details of that
program, maybe your thoughts on the broader opportunities to grow premium roast and ground coffee across Europe in
general?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, without a doubt the driver of our coffee performance has been our more convenient
coffee forms, as I mentioned; Tassimo up about 40%, Millicano up very strongly in the double-digits. And so that
continues to be an area of focus. We did announce the launch of a Nespresso compatible pod. We're starting with Carte
Noire and Jacobs in France and Germany, as we speak, and we'll expand that to a number of other countries in the later
part of the year. So we see it as an opportunity, and we're – we believe we have very strong brands that will perform
well in that system, and that's what we're doing.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Great. Thank you.
