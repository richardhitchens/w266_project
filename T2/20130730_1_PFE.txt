MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please
go ahead, sir.
Charles E. Triano
Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's second quarter 2013 performance. I'm joined
today, as usual, by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and
General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research
and Development; Geno Germano, President and General Manager of Specialty Care and Oncology; Amy Schulman,
General Counsel and Business Unit Lead for our Consumer business; and John Young, President and General Manager
of Primary Care.

link for Pfizer quarterly corporate performance second quarter 2013, which is located in the investor presentation
section in the lower right-hand corner of this page.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements
and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that
could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and in our reports on
Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions during this conference call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated
today: July 30, 2013.
Also as we outlined in our earnings release, as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis, the financial results of the
Animal Health business are now reported as a discontinued operation for the second quarter and year-to-date for both
2012 and 2013.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck. I'll begin with some comments on the quarter.
We saw solid operational revenue growth in a number of areas. Within our innovative business, Oncology grew 28%
driven by the uptake of new products, mostly Inlyta and Xalkori in several major markets and we saw strong
performance from Lyrica in developed markets, which grew 14%, and Celebrex in the U.S. which grew by 13%. The
consumer business grew 5% operationally primarily due to strong global growth from Centrum. And China had strong
volume growth most notably for Lipitor and Prevnar. Overall, total China revenues grew 14% operationally or 22%
excluding the impact of product transfers in connection with forming our partnership with Hisun.
We continue to expect that the second half of this year will be stronger than the first half for emerging markets.
Although on a full year basis we now expect to see operational revenue growth of mid-single digits rather than high
single digits. This is mainly due to a slowdown in growth in Brazil and Russia and the impact of cost containment
measures in Colombia, Poland, Thailand and Turkey.
We completed the full separation of Zoetis into stand-alone public company. The transactions related to the disposition
of Zoetis generated approximately $17.2 billion of after-tax value for Pfizer shareholders. And our Board of Directors
authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. This new program is in addition to the
$3.1 billion of authorization remaining under the company's current share repurchase program.
Turning to our products and pipeline assets, the launches of both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to progress in various
markets around the world, and we are gaining market approvals for both Xeljanz and Eliquis in additional countries.
We are encouraged with the potential for both of these therapies over time.
For Eliquis, we are focused on gaining preferred formulary acceptance, continuing to obtain reimbursement and
building physician knowledge and comfort about the drug and its profile. With its unique profile in atrial fibrillation as
the only product with superiority versus warfarin in stroke prevention, major bleeding and a proven mortality benefit,
we are confident we will continue to see steady growth that will build over time.
For Xeljanz we are seeing good opportunities with patients who are switching from their current biologic therapy as
well as patients who are initiating Xeljanz therapy as second-line setting, that is following Methotrexate, but before a
biologic DMARD. In fact, almost half of our recent prescriptions are in the second-line setting, with the remainder
being patients who have been on one or more biologic DMARDs and not achieving satisfactory results.

In addition, we began our direct-to-consumer campaign in the U.S. early in June and have seen a subsequent up-tick in
prescription volume. Last month we announced that the FDA had accepted for review our supplementary new drug
application to include progression of structural damage in the Xeljanz label. And as of today Xeljanz, will be
commercially available in Japan where it will be co-promoted by Pfizer and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company,
Limited.
Overall we remain encouraged by what we are seeing with physicians' and patients' experience so far. I would describe
our progress as measured and steady and we recognize it will continue to take time for rheumatologists to feel
comfortable making a change. The launch is consistent with our expectations for a new oral mechanism.
Turning to the status of Xeljanz in Europe. Last week we announced that the Committee for Medical Products for
Human Use in the E.U. confirmed their prior opinion for the marketing authorization application for Xeljanz, although
with a much closer vote. Given the novel mechanism of action for Xeljanz, the CHMP wanted to see more data,
particularly around safety, to better understand the full profile of Xeljanz relative to other agents used in this patient
population.
As a result of the re-examination process, we addressed several of the questions and have more clarity on the remaining
ones. We plan to work with the European Medicines Agency to determine what additional data will be need in order to
resubmit a marketing authorization application and anticipate this will result in several years delay.
Regarding Xeljanz's Phase III psoriasis program, it continues to progress. However, given the large size and complexity
of this data set, analysis and reporting the data have been more complicated than we anticipated. That said, there is no
issue with the integrity of the data and this delay is purely due to operational issues. As a result, we now expect to
announce the top-line results from two of our four psoriasis ongoing studies by the end of the year.
One of the studies expected to read out this year evaluates maintenance or efficacy when patients are withdrawn from
and then retreated with Xeljanz therapy. The second study compares the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz to Enbrel and
placebo. We anticipate reporting the top-line results from the two pivotal studies that will be part of our planned
regulatory submission in the second quarter of this year – of next year, sorry.
For Prevnar, sales this quarter were adversely impacted in the U.S. by the variability of CDC purchase patterns and a
lower birth cohort in the U.S., as well as the end of a supplementary dose program in Asia.
Regarding CAPiTA, we continue to accumulate events and based on [indiscernible] (8:09) event rates, we expect to
complete the study this year. Given the size of the study, which is approximately 85,000 patients, once the number of
events is achieved it will still take several months to complete the necessary database validation and related activities
prior to unblinding the results. Given where we are today, we expect that we should see top line results in the first half
of 2014.
As we announced yesterday, we are moving forward with formally internally separating our commercial and
management structure into Innovative and Value business segments. And we will integrate emerging markets fully into
each of these segments.
One of the Innovative business segments will be led by Geno Germano, who will become Group President, Innovative
Products. This business segment will generally include products that have exclusivity beyond 2015, across multiple
therapeutic areas, consisting of Immunology and Inflammation, including Enbrel, Cardiovascular and Metabolic,
Neuroscience and Pain, Rare Diseases and Women's and Men's Health. Xeljanz and Eliquis are examples of products in
this business.
The other Innovative business segment will be led by Amy Schulman, who will become Group President of Vaccines,
Oncology and Consumer Healthcare. Each of these businesses will operate in a separate global business. Each has a
different operating model with distinct specializations around science, talent and market approach.
The Value Products segment will be led by John Young. It will include the brands that have lost their exclusivity and
generally the mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most markets.
Some examples include Celebrex, Zyvox, Viagra, outside of the U.S., and Lyrica in the E.U. The Value business will

also include our biosimilars portfolio and current and future collaborations for broadening our off-patent portfolio such
as our existing partnerships with Mylan in Japan, Hisun in China and Teuto in Brazil.
While we have decided to integrate emerging markets into the Innovative Value businesses, these markets will continue
to play an important role in Pfizer's long-term success. We see the fastest growing emerging markets becoming more
aligned with the profile of developed markets. With these changing dynamics we believe this is the right strategic move
for us at this time. I have asked Olivier Brandicourt to lead the transition from the current emerging markets business
into each of the three business segments.
And with Amy becoming the group president of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare, we are appointing
Doug Lankler, currently our Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, to be Pfizer General Counsel. In addition, Randy
Johnson, Senior Vice President and Associate General Counsel, will become the new Chief Compliance and Risk
Officer. All of the leadership changes are effective January 1, 2014.
We will be moving towards operating in the new commercial structure at the start of 2014 while we continue to manage
our business and report our financial results in the existing structure for the balance of 2013. All of the current leaders
will continue in their roles for the remainder of this year. Starting with the release of our financial results of the first
quarter of 2014, we will provide greater transparency into the financial profile of each of the three new business
segments.
Our plan is to provide a 2014 baseline management view of profit and loss for each segment. We anticipate providing
additional financial detail as we move forward within the new structure effective January 1, 2015.
In summary, I believe this new commercial structure will put us in a better position to assess the capabilities, progress
and opportunities of our innovative core and provide our Value business dedicated resource required to further
strengthen and globally position it to be a market leader.
Now I will turn it over to Frank to take you through the details of the quarter.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Before I
begin, I want to point out that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of the
Animal Health business are now reported as a discontinued operation in the condensed consolidated statements of
income for the second quarter and year-to-date for both 2012 and 2013.
Now let's move on to the financials. Second quarter 2013 revenues of approximately $13 billion decreased 7%
year-over-year, reflecting a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 4%
driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, most notably, Lipitor in
developed Europe in the second quarter of 2012, and multi-source generic competition for Lipitor in the U.S. beginning
in late May 2012.
The decline in Pfizer share of revenues for the terms of the co-promotion agreements for Spiriva, which are in their
final year in the U.S., Australia, Canada and certain European countries. The timing of government purchases of
Prevnar in various markets and the transfer of certain product rights to our joint venture in China with Hisun in the first
quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.56 decreased 5%, primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues and the
impact of foreign exchange, which were partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted
average shares outstanding, primarily due to our ongoing share repurchase program.
Reported diluted EPS was $1.98 compared with $0.43 in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly driven by the pre-tax
gain of $10.5 billion associated with the full disposition of Zoetis and to a much lesser extent by the Protonix patent
litigation settlement and lower legal charges, which were partially offset by the previously mentioned decrease in
revenues and a 5.1 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate on reported income from continuing operations

mainly attributable to the tax liability associated with the previously mentioned Protonix patent litigation settlement.
During the second quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets declined 2% operationally, primarily
due to the timing of government purchases of Enbrel in Brazil and Prevnar in Turkey, and the transfer of certain
product rights to the Pfizer-Hisun joint venture in the first quarter. These were partially offset by strong volume growth
in China, especially for Lipitor and Prevnar. In these BRIC-MT markets, volume growth of 1% was more than offset by
price reductions of 3% versus the year-ago quarter. In addition, foreign exchange negatively impacted BRIC-MT
revenue by 1% in the second quarter of 2013.
Revenue from all emerging markets increased 4% operationally in the second quarter. If you exclude the portfolio of
products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China with Hisun, we would have had operational
revenue growth of 5% in our Emerging Markets business and 22% in China. And BRIC-MT operational revenue would
have been flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Operational biopharmaceutical revenue growth from all Emerging
Markets business is expected to accelerate in the second half of the year to a high single-digit percentage.
However, we now expect full-year operational revenue growth in our Emerging Markets business to be in the
mid-single digits percentage due to continued slowing growth in some markets as pricing pressures continue to build
and governments take additional steps to contain rising healthcare expenditures. As we've previously stated, because of
the continued volatility in emerging markets, we anticipate our performance in that business to fluctuate from quarter to
quarter.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted second-quarter revenues by 3% or $392 million, and had a net positive impact
of 3% or $228 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses.
As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second-quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.02
compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to our 2013 financial guidance, we are reaffirming all components of our full year 2013 adjusted
financial guidance that we updated on June 24 to solely reflect the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer. I want to
remind everyone that the weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of adjusted and reported diluted
EPS reflects the net reduction of 405.1 million shares of Pfizer's outstanding common stock as a result of the exchange
offer. Because the exchange offer was completed on June 24, we will recognize only a partial-year benefit to our full
year 2013 adjusted and reported diluted EPS.
As an additional reminder, when we completed the full disposition of Zoetis in June, we announced that the expected
impact of the removal of the full year 2013 financial contribution of Zoetis and the impact of the partial-year benefit
from the net reduction in shares of our outstanding common stock due to the exchange offer would result in a $0.04
decrease to the upper and lower ends of our projected range for 2013 adjusted diluted EPS. Today, we've also updated
our 2013 reported diluted EPS guidance range to $3.07 to $3.22 to reflect the gain associated with the full disposition
of Zoetis and income from the previously mentioned litigation settlement.
Now moving on to key takeaways, second quarter results reflect the loss of exclusivity of certain products in various
geographies, as well as the continued volatility in emerging markets. As I previously mentioned, we expect high
single-digit operational revenue growth in emerging markets during the second half of 2013 and now expect
mid-single-digit growth for the full year.
We continue to mitigate the earnings impact of product LOEs with both expense discipline and share repurchases. We
completed the full disposition of Zoetis during the second quarter and we accepted 405.1 million shares of Pfizer
common stock in exchange for our remaining interest in Zoetis. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive to
reported and adjusted diluted EPS on a full-year basis in 2014.
We are reaffirming all components of our 2013 adjusted financial guidance. We remain excited about the potential of
our new product launches in mid to late-stage pipeline. We've announced our intention to implement the new
commercial structure beginning in fiscal 2014, which we expect will better position Pfizer for long-term success. And
we continued to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation.

In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of our common stock. To date in 2013, we have
repurchased approximately $8.7 billion or approximately 309 million shares and have $13.1 billion remaining under
our current authorization. And we continue to expect to repurchase in the mid-teens of billions of dollars of our
common stock this year, despite the blackout period for share repurchases during, and for 10 business days after, the
Zoetis exchange offer period.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to
Chuck.
Charles E. Triano
Thanks, Frank and Ian, for the update. Operator, can we please now poll for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much for the questions. The first one was on the corporate structure. Can
you just elaborate a little bit on why three divisions here as compared to simply the Innovative and Value core
franchises you've discuss in the past? I guess there's – is there a scenario where Pfizer could break itself into three
companies at some point in the future?
And then my second question – and just so I'm clear, can you elaborate a little bit more on what type of P&L
granularity we should be anticipating in 2014 and then maybe even looking forward to 2015 for these three operating
divisions? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Chris. So why the three rather than two? I think it basically is very strong operational
reasons that the Innovative business under Geno has a collection of large disease areas that cut across both the Primary
Care and Specialty and they have challenges of capital allocation and of the go-to-market model as we look to be more
efficient in how we deliver the message and how we get to see primary care physicians.
Whereas, the Oncology business and the Vaccine business have very distinct culture, they are smaller businesses that I
want to make sure didn't get subsumed into a larger Primary Care business. They have specific customers, they have
dedicated [indiscernible] (22:09) research facilities and research focus, and I thought it was very important for those
businesses to maintain their unique focus and extend it globally.
So that was the primary reason for maintaining or creating a structure where we had two innovative businesses. On the
details, I'll turn it over to Frank.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Chris, on the P&L granularity for 2014, and then you asked about beyond 2014. For
2014 fiscal year, we'll show revenue for each of the three businesses, we'll show direct cost and we'll show direct
expenses. And then what we'll do is on expenses that we don't allocate today, that we don't allocate come fiscal 2014,
we'll provide some qualitative directional statements so that you'll be able to model some good full-stream P&Ls.
Come fiscal 2015, we'll provide that same information and then we'll provide some additional balance sheet
information as well. So that's kind of the rhythm of how we're thinking about this.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Sure. On the separation, was curious as you internally separate these businesses are you
considering any changes that could affect the overall tax structure at Pfizer?
And then on palbo, I have a couple of questions. By when will you know that you might not have data in time for San
Antonio? I assume it's some time before the actual start of that conference so let us know if there's a key date there.
And Lilly has a program that's much earlier in that class, but they talk about the ability of their product to be dosed
continuously. Any comments on that subject of continuous dosing versus otherwise? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Gregg, Thank you. I'll ask Frank to comment on the tax issue.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So in terms of the tax structure, the creation of these three businesses in and of themselves
does not impact in any material way the tax structure. But we're always doing tax planning to see what we can do to be
more efficient from a tax perspective.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And then, Geno, could you respond to the questions on palbo?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, I mean, with regard to the timing on palbo, we're continuing to accumulate events.
And based on the rate of accumulation that we're seeing at this point, we think it's unlikely that we'll be presenting data
at San Antonio. So I don't have the specific date to give you, but I think our best view at this point is it's unlikely that
we'll present at San Antonio. We still expect to accumulate the required events around the end of the year, but unlikely
we'll meet the San Antonio date. And then with regard to continuous dosing, I'm really not sure and familiar with the
Lilly program so I can't really comment on that.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A couple of questions on the split up. Can you give us a very rough
preliminary idea of how operating margins might compare across those different businesses? Could established
products have the highest margins because those products tend to kick off a lot of cash and don't require a lot of
support? Even directional guidance on this sort of thing would be very helpful because that's what folks, I think, are
going to be interested in as we head into 2014.
And then separately, you've talked about needing three years of audited financials before you could potentially truly
split up the company, if that's what you're ultimately destined to do. There's been some speculation that perhaps you
could use historic data for this three-year requirement, which means you wouldn't have to wait until 2017 or so until
you really carve it up. Is this a possibility? Should we really think of 2017 as being the earliest you could really split
things up?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Well, I'll ask Frank to answer the margin issue the best he can and also your hypothetical question
on data needed to split.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. So let me answer the second question first, which is on data requirements. If we were
ever to decide to do something external to the company, obviously we haven't decided anything yet, which is, it
requires three years of audited financials. And our current thinking is, those would be prospective. The thought of
trying to retrospectively create those, when we look at everything that would need to be done, would be extremely
difficult. So the current thinking is clearly that those would be prospective in terms of the three years of audited
financials. So that's how I'd answer the second question.
On the first question on operating margins, the way I think about this is, we're going to provide 2014 guidance. We're
going to start providing more granularity relative to these three businesses. So Tim, for the time being, I really don't
want to start projecting the margins on those businesses until we start showing them come 2014, and then we'll give

lots more clarity when that time comes.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just a follow up on that last question. Frank, is there a difference in SEC requirements
for a spin versus a split?
And then a question for you, Ian, on M&A. You've done an amazing job returning cash to shareholders, which we've
all strongly applauded, but you also say that with respect to M&A, that you would always view share buybacks as the
case to beat, but with your stock at a 12 to 13 multiple, there really is no case to beat relative to a share buyback. So I'm
wondering how you're thinking about M&A going forward, especially as it relates to the potential to split the company
into multiple parts that might require more growth drivers or M&A activity. Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. So on the BD [Business Development] issues, we look at BD not as a strategy but as a
way of creating shareholder value and strengthening parts of our franchises or portfolio. We always try to analyze it
sort of in the light of new capabilities or strengthening capabilities we already had. We tend to talk in terms of bolt-ons
and you'd have to think that bolt-ons would be, you'd easily consider single-digit in billions of bolt-on for this
company. And we've also said we'll look at any type of acquisition; never say never to larger acquisition that made
sense.
Regarding when would we consider our share price to be at a level that BD would be more effective, well, it depends
on what deal we're looking at in BD, how it's priced and where our expectations are of our multiple is going in the next
two to three years. So I don't think I can answer that in a hypothetical way, but more in a, we'll look at each case by
case. We look at each deal. We're active in looking at deals. We compare it to what we think the value of buybacks are
and we take that decision on a deal-by-deal basis. Do you want to add anything to that, Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, let me just add quickly to that and then I'll answer the question about split versus
spin. And Jami, when we look at deals, remember, in terms of the case to beat being buybacks, it's also over what
timeframe. So is it year one? Is it year two? And then, well, how do we feel about the certainty of being able to achieve
those EPS projections based on assumptions on synergies and the like? So in my mind, it's to Ian's point. It's deal by
deal, situational and then over what timeframe do we see that being, I'll call it accretive relative to the buybacks.
And then in terms of the split versus the spin question and is there any difference in required financials, the answer is
no. Both scenarios require three years of audited financials.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank. Operator, can we move to the next question, please.

Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Excuse me. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe I can
build on Jami's question around use of cash. I think in the past, I've heard you say things like your priorities were
cancer, vaccines and also general practitioner drugs. I wondered if you could clarify or confirm that. And then when
you say you'd never say never to a larger deal, maybe you could just expand on that. Is that just a theoretical statement
or is that something that we should be thinking about as a possible move for Pfizer?
And then under the new structure, have you decided, will BD be centralized or will each unit have independent BD
M&A functions within them?

And then maybe just a quick R&D, if I can. Do you expect the NGF antibody to return to clinical development? Thank
you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So you asked about BD by segment. Well, clearly, BD that builds on a capability allows
you to synergize your expense base are easier to get done than BD when you're going to a totally new space. So while
we look at any good intellectual property that we could bring to patients and use our capabilities to bring to patients,
they're easier to get done if you've got some inherent synergies.
On a big deal, all I would say is, look, we're focused on creating value for shareholders. And you do the analysis and
you look at the risks and you look at the uncertainties and you make your decisions as you go forward. We've been, up
to today, primarily focused on bolt-ons.
Frank, do you want to talk about the BD? Certainly, I would say part of the rationale for creating these global
businesses is that I now feel I can have management teams tasked on creating both organic and inorganic growth, and
they're obviously going to have close ties and working with our BD organization. But, Frank, do you want to add to
that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. On the BD org structure question, the way we approach this is the BD resources are
centralized. However, there's matrix from a client support perspective. So when you look at any of the businesses,
they'll have folks that are dedicated to them that literally, from a business perspective, are on their team. Who they
report to, from my perspective, is irrelevant. We matrix this in such a way that their reporting is transparent. They're
living with those folks. They're co-located with those folks. They're working with those folks on a dedicated,
day-to-day basis. That's how we do it, quite frankly, for just about all of our enabling functions.
<A - Ian C. Read>: John, you wanted to add something?
<A - John D. Young>: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question about tanezumab, which is our NGF antibody. Just a
quick update on that. On the 19th of July this year, we actually received notification from the FDA that the partial
clinical hold for tanezumab has been lifted. You may know that the partial clinical hold had been placed on the
development of all the NGF inhibitors back in December 2012 based on observation and some animal tox studies
conducting on NGF inhibitors in development through other manufacturers.
So the partial clinical hold was lifted on a commitment by Pfizer to submit non-clinical data before initiating dosing in
clinical trials. And thereafter to limit any dosing duration until the additional non-clinical data has been submitted and
reviewed by the FDA. So there was requisite non-clinical data, studies have already been started and with the lifting of
the partial clinical hold and on the assumption of a positive review of the non-clinical data by the FDA, we're preparing
for a resumption of Phase III clinical studies in 2014.

Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. First on the R&D and perhaps M&A front,
either for Ian or Geno, could you comment on the extent to which cancer immunotherapy is a priority for you?
And then for Frank, you've obviously returned a lot of cash to shareholders in terms of buy-backs, but any thoughts on
a dividend increase given your relatively low pay-out ratio? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, would you want to take the R&D question?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: So we have a broad effort in Oncology and Immunology and we certainly have interest also in
the Cancer Immunology area. On one hand we have some vaccines in the Cancer Immunology area that are starting to
move into pre-clinical development. But we also have some monoclonal antibodies, let me mention the 4-1BB or

CD137 checkpoint activating antibody that we now have in Phase I studies in hematological and solid tumors and are
following with quite some interest that antibody and other assets.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you Mikael. Frank, do you want to...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Dividend?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Dividend.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. So let me just run the numbers on the dividend and then I'll answer the question,
which is when we announced the Wyeth acquisition back in 2009, we cut the dividend in half from $1.28 to $0.64.
Since then we've increased the dividend $0.09 to $0.10, $0.10 to $0.11, $0.11 to $0.12, $0.12 to $0.13, from $0.64, to
$0.72, to $0.80, to $0.88, to $0.96; 12.5%, 11%, 10% and 9% dividend increases over the last four years.
Our cadence is always at our December board meeting. We typically – Ian and I make a recommendation to the Board
relative to what we expect – what we want the dividend to be for the following year. Once the Board approves that, we
come out with a release to let everyone know what the new dividend will be. That's what we're expecting to do this
year.
And then in terms of just absolute dollar amounts, at the current dividend level we'll be paying more than $6 billion in
cash to our shareholders this year, so big number. And you mentioned the pay-out ratio. If you use the midpoint of our
guidance and then use the $0.96, you get about 45%, which is roughly in-line with the industry, maybe a couple of
points below. But we've been closing that gap over the last couple years with our increases.

Next question comes from Marc Goodman from BPS (sic) [UBS] (36:45).
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Morning. First is PCSK9, the sub-Q. I think we were supposed to hear about in mid-year. I
was just wondering, update there?
Second on Xeljanz, I know you're working on a once daily version. I was curious if you could update us there.
And then there were a couple of products in the U.S. that were very strong, Lyrica and Celebrex. Was there stocking
that drove that? Or can you help us there? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, Mikael, do you want to talk about the PCSK9 results? And then Geno will do – talk about
Xeljanz and John on Lyrica and Celebrex.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so thank you for your interest in PCSK9. We do believe there will be a limited number
of entrants in this new drug class. We think it has potential to be a very important drug class with a substantial clinical
and commercial potential. A key here will be to, over time, demonstrate important – see the outcome value for the
patients, physicians and payers. Our own antibody is now fully enrolled in Phase IIb and will soon complete the study.
We have seen interim results showing a potent antibody with a competitive profile. We will assemble all the data from
the Phase IIb. And look at opportunity for subcutaneous delivery at various time intervals and make a decision at end of
this year about the next step forward.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: With regard to the Xeljanz once-a-day program, we do have a delayed release formulation
that we're moving forward with. We've had dialogue with the FDA on the development plan, and we have determined
that the registration package will be comprised primarily of pharmacokinetic data, PK data without a requirement for a
clinical Phase III trial, which will accelerate the development of that program. So we expect to be filing by early 2015.

<A - John D. Young>: Okay. Marc, with regard to your question about the operational performance of Lyrica and
Celebrex, essentially, both products have seen strong operational growth in the quarter and year-to-date. We haven't
seen any effect of stocking or changes in inventory levels in the marketplace. In fact, those have been very steady. And
really, the performance that you're seeing is really just a reflection of the combination of both price and volume in the
U.S. and value proposition that continues to resonate very well with physicians.

Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I have three questions on the new business structure and then a
pipeline question. So first, is it dilutive to create three business units and build the matrix and enabling functions?
Second, could you discuss breaking up the sales forces in emerging markets and applying them to the new segments?
And then third, regarding the three years of audited financials, I'm assuming that's to affect tax-free exits. But would
you consider divesting one of the units, for example, Established Products, before you have three years of audited
financials, or is that just not realistic given the necessity to ensure tax-free transactions?
And then for Mikael, could you just tell us what the key pipeline disclosures are to watch through year-end, including
whether you're going to provide any updates on your breakthrough therapy discussions with the FDA on palbociclib?
Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So we don't believe this new structure will be dilutive to our present structure. In fact, we
assume that there will be some modest savings as we go to that structure. You have to remember we already have, in
the developed markets, we already have a primary care, a specialty care, vaccines and oncology business, and then we
have an Emerging Markets business in the rest of the world and we are effectively collapsing most of the primary care
and specialty business into one BU. So we do not believe that standing up those BUs are going to be dilutive.
On the field force in emerging markets, it really depends country by country. But if you take a country like China, the
vast majority of the field force will sit in the value business and we will have internal service agreements to provide
field force support for the innovative products. I do not see that at all as an operational issue. It's something we've been
doing for quite some time, is sharing field forces between BUs.
I'd ask Frank to talk about the three years and the possibility of divestiture prior to that. And then we'll go to Mikael.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. So on the tax-free question that you asked, Dave, the way I think about this is taxes
aside, if we would ever do anything external, we haven't decided, we would need to file a registration statement. Those
registration statements require three years of audited financials. So that's the way I think about that.
In terms of something prior to three years of audited financials, now, our current thinking is, this is all about getting
these three businesses to hum internally, to operate with excellence inside the company. And in our current thinking,
it's all around three years of prospective financials that would be auditable.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: So, David, thank you for your interest in our pipeline and I'm very excited about the pipeline,
both short-term and over the next couple of years. With the focus on this year, we already touched upon our Phase IIb
PCSK9 that we'll get data readout during this second half of the year.
Xeljanz, Ian has touched upon the two trials that will have a readout this year that will give us some first insight how
Xeljanz is performing with new indication.
We also have, I would like to say, in psoriasis, a topical study that now is running, which I think is a very interesting
further exploration of tofacitinib.

You've heard about Prevnar 13 adult that we are expecting to complete during the latter part of this year.
Within the Vaccine franchise, we are also now in the finalization of our reports from staphylococcal Aureus PoC trials
that we'll share during the latter part of this year. I'm very encouraged by the profile I've seen so far when it comes to
this unique technology that we are deploying for a very broad immune response to Staph Aureus.
In Oncology, we have the two dacomitinib trials for second, third line and third line and fourth line that we expect to
have data this year that will be probably shared early next year.
And you heard earlier Geno commented on palbociclib that we expect to have the final pieces of the data coming
together this year. And we have previously had very good dialogues with FDA on the breakthrough designation. So we
expect a continuous very close dialogue and our guidance how to best use those data to the benefit of patients.
And on top of that, in Phase II, let me just point to a couple of intriguing areas. We have a best-in-class IL-6 antibody
and a very long-acting antibody with good potency. And we expect readouts fall in lupus and later next year Crohn's.
We have a readout in COPD related to a p38 inhibitor.
We have our second biosimilar that has a readout this year, rituximab. We have earlier communicated positive data
from our first biosimilar to Herceptin.
And then we are broadening our inflammation efforts to also involve the intersection of cardiovascular disease with a
readout from another PD-5 inhibitor in chronic kidney disease.
So I do look forward to sharing with you the output from all of these studies in the next years to come.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Excellent. Thank you, Mikael. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thank you very much. Some brief questions on the new structure, if I may. If we could go back to
the notion of business development and if we used an example, say in established products, with your partnership with
the Brazilian company, Teuto, I believe there is an option to actually buy the entire company. So the question is, is that
a decision by John Young and his group? Do they make a recommendation to you, Ian, and Frank and the Board? How
does that capital actually get allocated if that were to occur?
The second question's around R&D to the structures. This may seem silly, but is 100% of the R&D allocated to those
three structures? I say this because I might – if they were split apart, one could argue if all the R should go in one of the
innovative areas versus one of the others, or not at all, or could be less than.
And then similarly in the Established Products Group, with respect to R&D allocation, I could actually argue under the
Pfizer umbrella, there's very little R&D. But yet I suspect if it were stand-alone, if you look at Teva and Mylan as
examples, 6% of total – 6% to 6.8% of total revenue is actually R&D. So I'm just trying to understand when we see this
in January, Frank, how does it actually look, if you can provide some additional granularity? Thanks again.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So on Teuto, what the global business units will do is they will be champions of projects and BD.
But we need to maximize the use of BD across the Pfizer portfolio so the decision is taken at the corporate level and the
BU leaders have to champion the deals.
On the R&D, clearly there are parts of R&D that are specific to the BUs, and parts that are general infrastructure
underneath it. And I think we'll work through that as we go. But I'll ask Frank to comment on that.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Tony, let me provide a little more granularity, see if this is helpful. Which is, so before
when I talked about direct expenses to the new businesses, clearly the post-pock expenses that are in the business units
today would continue to be in the business units tomorrow. Then if you look at – I'll call it the pre-pock spend we have

that resides in Mikael's organization today, and that we call WRD, Worldwide Research and Development, that doesn't
get allocated to the business units today. We're looking at how best to guide you all relative to that spend. And that's
stuff we're working our way through and we'll work our way through that through the year and obviously give you guys
updates as we go. But, we're looking at how best to basically – how best to communicate that to you all so that you can
model appropriately. Point one.
And then you mentioned EP, and if I could give you a little bit more direction, the answer is, of course, I can. If you
look at the overall R&D spend, the Value business as a percentage of revenue will have a lower spend than the
Innovative Co. businesses as a percentage of revenue. Once again, how we best direct and guide you all for next year,
is some of the sub-ledger detail that we're working our way through.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Tony, this is part of the – one of the benefits I expect to get out of having global businesses with
presidents who are champions. So the R&D today that would probably go to Established is more the type of R&D that
is safety, registration, regulatory, some biosimilars, and then some work around special formulations and that type of
work. John's role is – will be to look at that and as you say, compare it to what he needs to do to drive growth and look
at competitors and argue for capital allocation if appropriate into his R&D. This is what – the benefits you get out of
this type of focus on businesses.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. First on Xeljanz. Is the CHMP seeking longer-term safety data or is there a
potentially rare and/or serious issue that they are requiring clarification upon?
Secondly, is CAPiTA's delay due to a lower-than-expected event rate, or is it due to some other reason?
And then thirdly, on emerging markets, may we anticipate high-single-digit growth to return in 2014 and beyond, or is
this a business where mid-single-digit growth is more likely? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yes. Steve, so with regard to CHMP and Xeljanz, obviously we're somewhat disappointed at
the outcome following what was really a positive scientific advisory group meeting and a positive view from the
rapporteurs this time around. Ultimately, CHMP members, or at least some of the CHMP members, a small majority,
wanted to see additional safety data, and in particular, wanted to understand the kind of full profile of tofacitinib with
the new mechanism of action relative to other agents that are used in this patient population.
So it's not entirely clear whether we're looking for longer-term data or a larger database. As you know, we continue to
collect safety data. We have long-term extension trials, we have registries, we have a post-marketing study that we're
kicking off from the U.S. registration. So we have multiple ways. And then, of course, we have the psoriasis and
psoriatic arthritis programs. We have a number of mechanisms to generate additional safety data and we'll obviously
continue to do that.
It's not entirely clear at the moment what we'll need to do to achieve a registration. We do anticipate we'll need to do
some additional clinical work. And as Ian mentioned before, we think this could require several years of delay in
Europe. So that's the best way I can kind of characterize the situation there with the CHMP.
With regard to CAPiTA, it's difficult to predict what the event rate is going be. It's going to depend on the various
dynamics like the severity of the flu seasons, the efficacy of the vaccine. So if it's a highly effective vaccine, then the
only cases that you're accumulating are cases in the placebo group. So it is difficult to predict, and we are becoming
very close to the target number of events and hope to be able to present more clarity in the very near future.

<A - Ian C. Read>: And on EM, we've always said that EM will be volatile and we'll see swings in quarter-on-quarter
and even year-to-year. I think we'd all agree that sectorally that that's where we're seeing the vast majority of volume
growth is coming from in the foreseeable future as these economies continue to spend more on healthcare. And the
growth rates are going fluctuate depending on how the volume's doing and what pricing pressures you're getting in the
quarter. So I would say it's really too early to tell or to reset expectations for where we think long-term growth in
emerging markets are going to go. And we'll look at it in our 2014 guidance. But overall, we are – we continue to be
very bullish on the underlying demand for healthcare in emerging markets.

Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Yeah, good afternoon. Couple of questions. First, on the immunotherapies assets, you
mentioned, Mikael, the CD137. When do we get the first readout in NHL? Is that next year?
And then same topic, before you divested tremelimumab to Astra, you maintained some rights. Perhaps you could
outline what indications you have retained?
And then separately, for Ian, one of your competitors is having very visible issues in China. To what extent do you
think that the ongoing investigations over fraud are going impact pricing or demand in that market?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Mikael?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes. So we are just now running the Phase Ib studies here with our 4-1BB.
We think we have a real interesting antibody and we've have seen some encouraging early signs of activity here. I
would expect as we finalize the Phase I studies here, we will use conventional oncology conferences to report outcome.
We also have behind it a couple of other antibodies such as OX40 and GITR, so you should see it as a second wave of
checkpoint inhibitors, trying to benefit from the early enthusiasm around the PD-1 space. But building on that, and
bringing the field further on.
Tremelimumab, we did retain particular the rights to use it for vaccines. And I shared with you some enthusiasm about
our cancer vaccines platform. And I can inform you that we do include tremelimumab as one out of the options for
aduvant effect on cancer vaccine. So that was a really good way for us to plan when we did that retention.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. And on China, I can't really comment on individual cases. I would say what we've
seen in China is that as the government focuses on spending more on healthcare, they clearly want to be good buyers of
value of pharmaceuticals. So we'd expect to continue to have robust conversations and debates with them as we go
forward as to the value of the innovation we bring. I think you'll continue to see, as they have been doing, they do price
reviews of segments of the market and they reset prices. And normally volume responds to different price points. So I
think that will continue in China as we go forward.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you, Ian. Moving on, next question, please.

<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Oh, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions here. First, can you talk a little bit about
how you are going to be thinking about cost of goods and some of the overlapping dynamics there? Is this a situation
where Pfizer might consider a Coke bottling or a Lonza type structure over time? Should the units be split out or how is
that going operate as we think about it?

Separately, can you also talk a little bit about Europe and infrastructure there, relative to the overall industry's
profitability? One of your competitors commented on that and I think that might be particularly relevant as – perhaps
particularly relevant for Geno's business unit.
And then finally, as it relates to the emerging markets, Ian, you mentioned specifically that you see the emerging
markets, some of the larger emerging markets, starting to operate more similarly to the developed markets. Can you
just give us a little bit of a better sense in what regard that is? Is it in distribution, reimbursement? What is it
specifically and are we talking about more similar to the U.S. or more similar to Europe? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. So on the cost of goods, about in terms of absorption, 50% of our plants were absorbed
through the Value business and 50% are absorbed through the Innovative business. There are a limited number of
plants that are specific to one business or the other. So I would expect that internally, with simply a cross-supply issue
between the plants, and if there was anything ever externally done, I think this is easily handled by supply agreements.
Today, Pfizer purchases about 30% of its requirements from external suppliers. So, this is easily handled in the
ordinary course of business.
The next question was on Europe and infrastructure. Look, the pricing squeeze that Europe has applied to the industry
over the last few years, which has accelerated from low single-digits to mid-single-digits, is, of course, pushing
companies to look at what their infrastructure is, how they deliver the educational messages to physicians and their
investment in general. Part of our restructuring into the innovative one, innovative two and the value business is a
response to that in the sense that we effectively are merging our primary care and our specialty BU into one. So I
expect in Europe you'll continue to see pharmaceutical companies look for more cost-efficient ways to deliver their
message to physicians.
And on the EM issue, I think if you look at it, Turkey. You can see Turkey's gone to a full reimbursement model more
like Europe. There's – out-of-pocket has now become less important in Turkey. The government is more influential, so
they tend to be more dominant in the way they make acquisitions of pharmaceuticals and their pricing requests.
In sophistication, I talked really about the way the markets are beginning to be regulated in terms of compliance, in
terms of the rules that are similar in Europe and the U.S. So I just see these markets evolving and also you're beginning
to see more commonality in the requirements they ask for registration. And that's really the sense of my comment about
their evolving to looking more like mature markets.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian. And, operator, if we could please take our last question.

Your final question comes from Damien Conover from Morningstar.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question on the restructuring. Wanted to
see how products would flow from the innovative pieces to the value piece post-2014, and whether or not there would
be any precedent set up for any sort of transfer of value that could be used if the entities actually fully separated?
And then second question on the breakup. Was just – had a question on the consumer health business. And if I
remember correctly, one of the driving reasons to have that business within the Pfizer umbrella is to help with any sort
of Rx to OTC switches. And given that it's going in the vaccine and oncology bucket, I still wanted to know if that Rx
to OTC switch was still a major driving force behind that business underneath the Pfizer umbrella. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Damien. So I think the movement of products between the businesses will continue as
they have been in the last three years. As products that are in innovative one go LOE, we'll move them over to the value
business, and they'll be managed that way. In any hypothetical situation where there was the two businesses weren't in
the same corporate shell, then you would make your decisions based on what's the best way to continue to
commercialize those products at a later date. But that's really very early to speculate on. And then, Amy, would you
like to take the consumer?

<A - Amy W. Schulman>: Sure. With respect to the pipeline that we have for Rx to OTC switches, we continue to feel
very comfortable with the pipeline. It's robust. And assuming regulatory approval, we'll proceed with the Dexium
launch in 2014. And then we have a number of other promising molecules in the pipeline, some of which we've talked
about previously.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Amy.
