As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our
financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP
financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which
is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including
reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2012.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Dave. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 31% to $5.47 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow increased to $2.03 billion. Trailing 12-month capital
expenditures were $3.44 billion. The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of
continued business growth consisting of additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and investments in
technology infrastructure including Amazon Web Services.
Return on invested capital was 13%, up from 4%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets minus
current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of common
stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 476 million shares compared with 470 million shares one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $25.59 billion or 22% excluding the $258 million unfavorable impact from
year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue increased to $7.23 billion, up 11% or 13% excluding
foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $17.13 billion, up 23% or 24% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide
EGM increased to 67% of worldwide sales, up from 65%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 25%. Active customer
accounts exceeded $237 million. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than $2 million. Seller units represented
39% of paid units.
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $18.81 billion or 73.5% of
revenue compared with 75.9%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&A combined were $5.9 billion
or 23.1% of sales, up approximately 210 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $2.84 billion or 11.1% of revenue
compared with 10.3%. Tech and content was $1.69 billion or 6.6% of revenue compared with 5.7%. Marketing was
$1.11 billion or 4.3% of revenue compared with 3.9%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or
stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to
$15.33 billion. Media revenue grew 21% to $3.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 25% to $10.65 billion, representing 69%
of North America revenues, down from 70%. Other revenue grew 52% to $1.17 billion. North America segment
operating income increased 19% to $725 million, a 4.7% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew
13% to $10.26 billion. Adjusting for the $244 million year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue
growth was 15%.
Media revenue grew 3% to $3.71 billion or 6% excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenues grew 19% to $6.48
billion or 21% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 63% of International revenues, up from 60%.
International segment operating income increased 116% to $151 million, a 1.5% operating margin. Excluding the
unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment operating income increased 119%.
CSOI increased 29% to $876 million or 3.4% of revenue, up approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, CSOI increased 28%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes
stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income increased 26% to $510
million or 2% of net sales.

Our income tax expense was $179 million resulting in a 40% tax rate for the quarter and a 32% rate for the full year of
2013. GAAP net income was $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared with $97 million and $0.21 per diluted
share.
Now, I'll discuss our full year results. Revenue grew 22% to $74.45 billion or 24% excluding the impact of foreign
exchange. North America revenue grew 28% to $44.52 billion and International revenue grew 14% to $29.94 billion or
19% growth excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income, or CSOI, increased 20% to $1.99 billion or 21% excluding the unfavorable
year-over-year impact from foreign exchange and operating margin was 2.7%, consistent with the prior year. GAAP
operating income increased 10% to $745 million or 1% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $1 billion year-over-year to $12.45 billion.
Inventory increased 23% to $7.41 billion and inventory turns were 8.9, down from 9.3 turns a year ago as we expanded
selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 14% to $15.13
billion and accounts payable days decreased to 74 from 76 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies
amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates, can all have a
material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions,
investments, restructuring, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and
that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
For Q1 2014, we expect net sales of between $18.2 billion and $19.9 billion or growth of between 13% and 24%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $200 million loss and $200 million income compared with $181
million income in the first quarter of 2013. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation
and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes
stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $150 million and $550 million compared with
$441 million in the first quarter of 2013.
We launched Prime in the U.S. nine years ago with free unlimited two-day shipping on 1 million items in an annual
membership price of $79. Today, Prime selection has grown to over 19 million items. Even as fuel and transportation
costs have increased, the $79 price has remained the same. We know that customers love Prime as their usage of the
shipping benefit has increased dramatically since launch. On a per customer basis, Prime members are ordering more
items across more categories with free two-day shipping than ever before.
With the increased cost of fuel and transportation, as well as the increased usage among Prime members, we are
considering increasing the price of Prime between $20 to $40 in the U.S.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Dave, let's move to questions.

Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely, Mr. Wilds. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will now open the call up for questions. [Operator
Instructions] Our first question will come from Mark May with Citi.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my questions. The unit growth in the quarter, I believe, was around 25%,
which was a deceleration, and notable versus the last couple of quarters. I believe the comp even got a little easier. Any
– can you give – provide any color as to the dynamics in the quarter that may have drove that? And then trying to get a
sense of how to think about the magnitude of the Prime price increase, maybe if you could give us a sense of the base
of subscribers that that would be applied to? And then lastly, on shipping demand, is there anything that Amazon will
do differently next holiday season to try to smooth out the pace of demand late in the holiday shopping season?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: First, the unit growth, you're right. It was 25% year-over-year. It is a deceleration – a small
deceleration from the last couple quarters. Keep in mind that it is certainly our biggest quarter, most seasonal. And so
both from a revenue and from a unit standpoint, you saw a deceleration from Q3 to Q4 of 2012 also and so we saw
deceleration not of the same magnitude we saw back in 2012 from Q3 to Q4. But if you take a look at the total growth,
it's 25% on a unit basis, 22% ex-exchange on a revenue basis. We saw very good growth in North America, up 26%.
This is again on a revenue basis. It's down sequentially a little bit in the last couple quarters but certainly up from Q4
last year where we grew 23%. In International, the revenue was up 15% ex-exchange.
If you look at the pieces, certainly, one of the biggest things you're seeing is, if you look at the media growth in our
digital categories within media and international, it's growing very fast, but as we've been talking about for quite some
time, there's certainly a shift going from physical to digital. You see that reflected in our North America media growth
rates. The reason why you don't see it as much in our international is because we're at the very early stages of that. So
that's what you're seeing in terms of the differential – certainly one of the key differentials between the international
media growth rate and the North America growth rate. Also keep in mind, in other revenue, the AWS revenue, which is
growing very fast, is recorded in North America segment.
In terms of the Prime, in terms of impact, sorry, I can't help you with the impact on U.S. What we have said is globally
we have tens of millions of customers and we certainly have been offering Prime in the U.S. longer than international
and both segments are growing very fast from a Prime perspective, that's helpful.
And then from a customer standpoint, during Q4, we worked very hard on behalf of customers to make sure that we
can service them. I think the team did a very nice job. We'll continue to work on that to even get better in future
quarters and in future Q4s going forward.
Operator
Our next question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.
<Q>: Good afternoon. This is actually [ph] Rob (15:41) on the call for Neil. A couple questions. If you could maybe
talk a little bit about the impact of refunds or incentives given to customers to make up for some of the goods that
arrived late in the holiday season. Also on Prime with respect to the increase, will you consider phasing that in,
applying perhaps just to new members at first and also would you consider giving an installment options based off of
the [ph] flow (16:03)? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, in terms of the refunds, we did give some in the form of gift certificates as well as
refunding some shipping fees where fees were incurred by customers for that subset of customers who were impacted.

So that's reflected in the Q4 results that you see today. And in terms of details of how we'd roll out the Prime price
increase that we're considering, you'll have to wait on that. But certainly, as I mentioned, it's something that we haven't
had any increase in the nine years. Customers certainly love Prime. The available units for shipment have grown
dramatically from 1 million to over 19 million. Over the last nine years, we haven't had any price increase. Customer
usage on a per customer basis has gone up pretty dramatically given the selection and convenience of the service. So
that's why we're considering – of course, during this nine-year period, shipping costs have gone up a lot. Fuel costs
have gone up a lot. So that's certainly the basis for us taking a look at it. But in terms of the details, we'll be back when
we make those decisions back to customers.
Operator
Moving on to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to follow up on Prime as well. And I was
hoping, Tom, maybe you could give us some color on how newer Prime members, you have obviously added a lot of
them over the recent quarters, but how newer cohorts of Prime members act relative to older cohorts and, in particular,
if they convert sort of as quickly and if they are spending on a similar kind of early trajectory as your more tenured
Prime members? And then also, can you just comment on the, I believe, the constrained sign-ups in 4Q on Prime?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of details, I can't really give you a lot of color on the more recent versus the
Prime members who have been with us for a long time except to say that there is a lot of similarities in terms of what
we are seeing. So in other words, customers – when we launched Prime nine years ago, one of the things that we hoped
for was customers who do a lot more cross-shopping that they would buy more from us and we are seeing that trend
also in more recent Prime editions. Again, so we're – the program is growing very fast. We're very, very pleased with it
and we think it's great for the business as we look forward as well. In terms of – what was the second part of the
question again?
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: 4Q, I think you talked about sign-ups being constrained in the quarter?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, it – again, we had very fast growth. We put a couple statistics out in our holiday
release on the 26th that you can refer to, but we had very strong growth and we did constrain it a bit and customers like
it. And again, there is a lot of demand for the service and we're going to continue to make sure that we can satisfy
customers there and we thought it was appropriate to do so – to do that during Q4.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll move on to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi, Tom. A couple questions. Starting with – I'll continue the trend with Prime questions. First,
you mentioned higher shipping costs being a driver of potentially higher prices in the U.S. The U.S. Prime service is
also the only one that has Kindle lending library and video. And we're just wondering if potentially those additional
services have led you to think about increasing price as well to potentially further bolster either or both?
And then secondly, International CSOI's been on a glide path lower over the past few years and if that's happened, the
organic international growth rates moderated during the same period. And I'm just wondering going back to the
decision to embark on the international investment cycle, if you anticipated the current revenue growth rate that you're
experiencing and if not, where are the areas in the business where you could point to that we would begin to see growth
that's not yet evident in the international business? Thank you.

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the first part, we have added a lot of new services to Prime beyond the
shipping benefits. You mentioned Kindle Owners' Lending Library, certainly video, Prime video, we're investing very
heavily. And so those are certainly costly.
Those aren't the reasons for the price increase that we're contemplating. Those are – that decision again is just based on,
we haven't done our price increase in nine years. Shipping costs have gone up. If you look back considerably over the
nine-year period, customers like the service, they're using it a lot more. We have a lot more selection. They're using it a
lot more. And so that's the reason why we're looking at the increase.
In terms of the International growth, the growth was solid with revenue ex-exchange at 15%, the unit growth was
considerably faster than that primarily because third-party growth was very strong, and certainly FBA as a component
of that. And when you think about the capacity that we built, it's not only for our retail but also for our third parties and
we're able to offer our FBA items through Prime as well. So we're very happy with the capacity that we've built across
the world, including our international operations and that's reflected in the results that you're seeing. Certainly, one of
the reasons why you're seeing the growth of operating income up over 100% in Q4 for international is because of the
mix of third-party certainly helping that. So it's a combination of a number of factors, but certainly that's one that's a
significant callout.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. A couple things. I was hoping you could talk about your initiatives with AmazonFresh, what
you're seeing in Bay Area and Los Angeles so far. Are you seeing more units per customer? And then maybe talk a
little bit about the international Kindle stores. Could you start to see better media results as you build out that
infrastructure? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of Fresh and L.A. and the Bay Area, it's very, very early. We like what we
see. Customers like the service, there's been good adoption, there's been good conversion from the Prime trials and so
we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. But it's still very early and so we'll have to – you have to stay-tuned on
that one. But again, it's very early, but we like what we see.
In terms of international Kindle stores, absolutely, we're – to be very clear, if you look at the Kindle content growth in
Q4 and International, it's very strong. It's just, again, we're at the early stages of this cycle from physical to digital. So
the growth rate is very strong. And we saw similar type things when we look back in the U.S. in terms of trends. But
it's – again, it's – we're at the earlier part of the cycle on that conversion.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll now hear from Brian Nowak with Susquehanna.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Thanks. It looks like 1P gross margins ex-shipping expanded nicely year-on-year again. I was
wondering if you could talk to some of the margins of the – or some of the drivers of 1P gross profitability getting
better. And how should we think about the sustainability of that over time? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're not breaking out the first-party margins, if you will. So I can't talk to the specifics of
that. But our retail business is very good. The combination of our retail business and our third-party business on our
platform works for us. We think it's very important to have both offerings for a number of reasons. One is, from a
customer experience standpoint, we like the fact that customers come to our detailed pages on our respective websites
around the world and they see competitive offerings. They know that we're very excited about making sure that we get

great values for customers and that we price our products appropriately, competitively low.
And so having third parties on our website certainly helps do that. It also adds additional selection that we don't have.
And so it's a combination of being able to make sure we have a competitive marketplace as well as add great unique
selection from both retail offerings and third parties to make it work. And that's why we don't talk necessarily about
first-party or third-party in terms of margins, but it's the combination of those working together on a platform that
makes it work.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll now hear from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thank you. A couple questions. With the potential of pricing change of Prime in the
U.S., would Amazon consider offering Prime Instant Video separately? And in terms of Prime Instant Video, can you
discuss the change in marketing spend for the service on a year-over-year basis 4Q 2013 versus 4Q 2012? And then just
in the North American electronics and other goods segment, could you call out any particular categories that drove the
growth? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with there. We certainly have – it's a
great offering for customers. Wouldn't speculate what we would do or not do going forward. But we like the service
that we have. We continue to invest and – in our Prime offering and it comes in a number of different forms. We'll
continue to add unique selection that's Prime eligible. We have a great pattern of doing that over the nine-year period.
We've also offered other services, as you mentioned, in terms of Prime Instant Video as well as Kindle Owners'
Lending Library. So it's a great value for customers. And we plan on keeping that a great value for customers even with
the price increase that we're considering in the U.S.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thanks. And in the North American electronics and other goods segment just
wondering if there are any other particular categories that drove the growth?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, it was very broad in terms of growth. We're very fortunate that we saw a very good
growth across many different categories. Certainly, a few callouts to soft line categories were very strong –
consumables are very strong, again, a number of different areas. Those certainly a few callouts.
Operator
Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets has the next question.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Yeah. To stick with that EGM category in North America, it looks to us like it's decelerated
relatively sharply. I thought you were going to call out some areas of weakness there. Is there anything that constant
growth rate that you would call out, that caused the growth rate to decelerate on EG comp. And then, Tom, did you
want to call out anything related to weather or UPS or do you think those impacts were immaterial to business in the
quarter? Thanks?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Well, again, if you look at – you're talking about – I think the question was around EGM
and North America grew 25%. You're right, it did decelerate from Q3. Keep in mind that a number of the categories
within EGM, there's certainly a seasonal impact. If you look back the last year, Q4 growth rate in North America was
24%. So we actually saw an acceleration from Q4 last year to Q4 this year, slightly, and so that's – and then – sorry,
Mark, the second part of your question was related to...
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Did you want to call out anything related to weather and UPS?

we'll continue to work on behalf of customers to make sure we improve that experience over time. Where we didn't
serve them well, we certainly did give some GCs to customers. We also reimbursed them for shipping costs where they
incurred that. And we'll continue to make that better and better for customers over time.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Tom.

Moving on to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Capital (sic) [Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC] (30:48).
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you and two quick questions. Your CapEx was just slightly higher than last year's same
period. If you correct for the real estate purchase even though the business overall grew 22% and you said AWS grew
very fast. Does this relative decrease in CapEx signal an expectation that AWS is going to grow slower? And secondly,
on again, the Prime price increase. If you have tens of millions of Prime users that increasing price at, at least to $80
with no incremental expense, that's quite a good chunk of money. Do you have specific plans to reinvest that money?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: The first part of your question, do we expect – is this an indication that AWS is slowing
down? No. It's not. Actually, we're very pleased with the AWS business. It's growing very fast. The team's doing a
fantastic job from a product and service standpoint. And we're very excited about that business. So I wouldn't form any
opinions about what CapEx might be in the future related to the growth rates in AWS, it's going very, very well. And
then the price increase on Prime, anything that we would invest would be an independent decision. From that, again, I
think in the opening remarks I talked about the rationale as to why and that's really what's driving that decision. And
then our investment decisions would be independent of that.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Okay.

Greg Melich with ISI Group has the next question.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi, thanks, Tom. Going back to Prime, as you consider the price increase, do you think the
brand is such that you would be willing to price tailor or tier it based on the value that's offered and the services you
provide to certain customers? And then second, on the categories, I believe you even called out a few quarters earlier
that clothing in particular was one and third-party clothing had picked up a lot. Did you see that this holiday just given
the importance of that category in the season?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I'll take the second part first. Soft lines is very strong in Q4, which clothing is a piece of
that. And in terms of tiers on Prime, I wouldn't speculate. We might or might not do in the future. But we like the Prime
program where we've invested very heavily in it. We continue – you should expect us to continue to make it even better
over time.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: There's no prohibition to that but you still like it the way it is?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes, we like it the way it is, yeah. But, again, if you look back at what we've done, can't
speculate what we might do going forward but certainly, we've had in the U.S. Prime in place for nine years. We've
added massive selection during that time period. We've also added – this is on the physical side. We've also added
digital content as well to the service in the U.S. with Kindle Owners' Lending Library as well as Prime Instant Video.
And so it's a great value for customers. We see the customers love it and we're going to continue to try to make that
even better for customers over time.

Moving on to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to follow up on AWS and talk a little
bit on pricing. And while it's certainly coming down as efficiency has improved but I believe AWS is sold in hour
increments. I think Google's [ph] compete solution (34:42) is sold on a per minute of use. And so wondering if you
thought about maybe changing the way AWS is charged to maybe per minute. And then a quick follow-up on just
fulfillment centers, if you can just remind us what you ended the year with and if you have any plans for this year?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. I'll take the second part first. The fulfillment centers, we opened seven on a net basis.
So that's the net adds. But on a – if you take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment centers, you'll get a number but
our square footage actually grew at quite a bit faster rate than that. Keep in mind that I think we've talked about in
previous calls. We did have some smaller older facilities that we consolidated into larger ones and so that's a net seven
and again the square footage growth is higher than that.
In terms of pricing on AWS, the team's doing a fantastic job looking at the best way to run that part of our business.
And I wouldn't want to speculate what they would or wouldn't do related to pricing but they're certainly making sure
that they are – have offered great services to customers, and they're great values to customers as well. And we're very
excited about that part of the business.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Thank you.

We'll now hear from Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.
<Q - Chad W. Bartley>: Hi, thank you. Two quick questions. How much of the slowdown in revenue and unit growth
was a function of the shorter shopping season in Q4? And then in terms of raising the price on Prime, how much of that
might be based on customers' reaction and behavior after recently raising the threshold for free shipping to $35?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the shorter period for shopping, it's hard to tell. Honestly, it's hard to know. It
definitely was a shorter period from post Thanksgiving to the holiday. And – but again, hard to know. And then in
terms of your – sorry, your other part of your question...
<Q - Chad W. Bartley>: I'm curious if the potential price increase on Prime and you're confident in doing that and that
it wouldn't impact the adoption of Prime. How much of that is tied to the early results of raising the shipper saving
threshold to $35 from $25?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: They were independent decisions. They weren't related.
<Q - Chad W. Bartley>: Thank you.
Operator
Thomas Forte with Telsey Advisory Group has the next question.
<Q - Tom Forte>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So when we think about shipping costs, I know you're
talking about raising the rate on Prime. But you just indicated that you added seven fulfillment centers in 2013 on a net
basis. As you get closer to the consumer and you shorten the ship miles, how should we think about the benefit on
shipping expenses from just having more fulfillment centers closer to the consumer?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yeah, there's no question that we get – as we grow our footprint, we get closer and closer
to customers with additional selection. And that certainly helped us not raise prices or look at raising prices before this.
And so certainly, we'll continue to roll out our footprint. We'll try to make our network as efficient as possible. And
that's even with this price increase that we're looking at, it still enables us to make sure that we have Prime at a great
value to customers. And that's something that's very important to us, because we know it's very important to our
customers.
<Q - Tom Forte>: Thank you.

Moving on to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks. In terms of digital content, how are exclusive titles and original series driving user
growth and Prime memberships, and any color on what kind of engagement dynamics you're seeing across the different
platforms? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Hello? Can you repeat the question, please?
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Sure. In terms of digital content, just trying to figure out how some of your exclusive content and
titles are driving user growth and Prime memberships, and any color just on what type of engagement you're seeing
across the different platforms via PC, tablet, et cetera?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're seeing – customers like the digital content. We're seeing great engagement. We're
not breaking out in terms of the form, but again, we're seeing great engagement. We do track very closely the Prime
customers that come from free trials, for example, for – that comes through the pipeline for digital content from a free
trial standpoint, we track those conversions and we see that that's growing very nicely. We do look at customers that
use our Prime Instant Video, how they – what their shopping patterns look like outside of digital content, do they buy,
beyond the free content we have on there, do they buy more digital content and certainly we're seeing nice growth in
digital content because of that, because they do. They also do a lot of shopping in physical categories as well. So those
things we're tracking very closely. And it's a great pipeline for us as customers look at the total value proposition for
Prime, including digital content.

Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs has the next question.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. Tom, you mentioned the strong growth in AWS. Looking at the deceleration in
the North American other line, how should investors think about the relative growth of AWS versus the advertising and
financial partnerships that make up the rest of that segment? And then just on Fresh with L.A. and San Francisco's
fulfillment centers carrying a number of non-perishable SKUs, what does Fresh do for your same day fulfillment
capabilities in those markets?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of AWS, I think the best way to think about it is, a number of things that are in
other, other than AWS, can be lumpy. And you should assume when you look at the North America growth for Q4 that
our AWS revenue is growing at a faster rate than other. And then in terms of Fresh, certainly when you look at those
two – look at the new offerings that we have in the Bay Area and in the L.A. area, it's certainly helping our same-day
delivery, and they work hand-in-hand. So in other words, we've increased our capability both for Fresh as well as for
our non-Fresh part of our business there in those locations.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thank you.

We'll now hear from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, have you seen any impacts from the rise
of Google's PLA this quarter? And second, are you using Kiva's technology in your food distribution centers
particularly for perishables, our understanding is that it's not optimized for that, but is that true and if not, are there any
other solutions outside of Amazon that do that optimally? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of Kiva, it's very early. We're early in our installations there. That's really all I can
say. We have it in a few facilities. It's going very well, very pleased with having Kiva as part of the Amazon family, if
you will. And we're excited about the opportunity that brings us going forward.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: And on the PLAs?

Our next question will come from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks. Tom, just a quick high-level question. So consumers in smartphone markets are
spending about half their time on mobile these days and a lot of that's coming off of PC. And I'm sure that's a great kind
of new customer acquisition channel for you guys. But in terms of existing Amazon customers, are you guys seeing
purchase frequency for physical products go up because of having phones with you all day or is it just swapping off of
PC and into these newer channels? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I kind of view just having the more connected devices is just the tailwind for our business
and it's additive. It's certainly helping our business grow. So whether that's phones or tablets, it's just the tailwind for
our business. And we think it will continue to be so. So customers will certainly still purchase from their desktop or
their laptop and so the tablet and mobile will not be completely additive but it will certainly be a tailwind for our
business just – any time customers have easier access to be able to purchase, that's good for us.

And, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Hey, good afternoon. Could you just remind us on just kind of a high-level philosophy the
tradeoff between revenue growth and earnings? I think investors typically think that you see this as a very – all of your
markets as nascent and profitability is kind of a distant thought. Is that still the case? And any guidance in terms of how
to think about that over the next 2, 5, 10 years. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. We track a lot of our investments on a discrete basis as best as we can. We're looking
to maximize... can you hear me okay?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're looking to maximize free cash flow in those investments over time. And so we have
some investments that certainly start to pay off and become profitable in a three to five-year period. We have others
that have been a bit longer. But again, we're monitoring those investments very carefully. Our goal is to maximize free
cash flow for investors over time. That's clearly our goal and that's something that we're working towards.
All that being said, we are investing a lot in the business right now. You can see that when you look at our results. And
we weren't – the reason why we're doing that is because of the very large opportunities that we see and we do go in
cycles as you've seen in our historical results. From time-to-time, we'll pull back to make sure the model is working.
And we have done that. And I'm sure you'll see that going forward at times as well. But again, we're focused on making
sure that we have a great customer experience, we maximize free cash flow over the long-term.
