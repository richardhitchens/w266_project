David E. Simon
Good morning. It was another productive quarter. FFO was $2.11 per share, up 11.6% from the second quarter of 2012.
Our FFO exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.04. For malls and outlets, comparable property NOI growth was
5.9%, driven by occupancy up 90 basis points to 95.1%; growth in releasing spread to $7.49 per square foot or 14.1%;
base minimum rent per square foot 3.6% higher than the year-ago period; and our tenant sales were up 4.2% to $577
per square foot.
Now let me turn to just some deal activity. On May 30, we acquired a 390,000 square foot outlet center in Portland,
Oregon for $147 million. This is a very productive center with sales in excess of $600 per square foot. It's 99% leased.
There's a great tenant lineup and fits terrific with our outlet portfolio, and it has been rebranded Woodburn Premium
Outlets. And as you would expect, it's immediately accretive to FFO.
On June 3, we announced our JV with McArthurGlen to invest in certain of their designer outlets and become a partner
in their property management development companies. They have a terrific and one of the best performing portfolios of
high quality retail real estate in Europe and a good strong team of professionals. The transaction supports and extends
our international premium outlet strategy. We completed the initial phase of this transaction and are now 50:50 partners
in the management and development companies. And we also will become a partner in their new designer outlet project
in Vancouver and are working to close our investment in several of their existing centers.
On May 7, we sold Laguna Hills Mall for $110 million.
Now let me turn to new development. Phoenix and Shisui opened in April, both 100% leased, both strong openings,
and we're pleased with the performance. The third quarter, this third quarter, we have three new premium outlet centers
that we'll open: Toronto this week, August 1, you're all welcome; St. Louis, which is 100% leased, on August 22,
you're all welcome; Busan, Korea, maybe a little bit out of your way, but it is 99% leased and opens on August 29.
Construction started during the second quarter at our Premium Outlets Montréal, which is our second Premium Outlets
center in Canada. Vancouver will be our third.
Let me just turn to redevelopment activity, a lot going on. I won't go through everything, but some highlights. In April,
we completed the redevelopment of an existing Limited building at Dadeland Mall. It's great, go look at it. The
redevelopment of Walt Whitman opens this September with the addition of retailers and restaurants on the exterior of
the building. The Shops at Nanuet in suburban New York City opens in October. At this project, we actually
demolished the existing mall and created a new open-air center. The redevelopment of Lenox Square continues, as does
the transformation of Del Amo Fashion Center, among several other centers that are all listed in the 8-K.
And on the Premium Outlets front, we completed expansions at Paju and Seattle during the second quarter. Expansions
are underway at Orlando Premium Outlets in Vineland and Johor, Malaysia. Both of these projects will open in the
fourth quarter. The significant expansion of Desert Hills continues, will open in April of next year. And finally on that
front, we started this quarter the $170 million redevelopment expansion of Woodbury Commons in New York. The
Mills, Sawgrass Mills, we opened the expansion in The Colonnade Outlets during the second quarter as well as the
redevelopment of the former Wannado space.

Macy's opened at Gurnee Mills last week. In addition, we have significant box activity throughout the Mills and mall
portfolio with numerous stores under construction. Our pipeline of new development and redevelopment projects is
significant and growing. Stuff is coming online. We're also under constructions with several projects. We expect this to
continue at least $1 billion annually through 2016. And I'll remind you that we're funding this primarily with $1 billion
of our free annual cash flow generated by the company.
Just quickly on financing, we're pleased with the Standard & Poor's upgrade in May. With our corporate credit rating
and senior unsecured debt ratings were increased to A-level. We believe this reflects our conservative balance sheet
strategy, the quality of our portfolio, and the ongoing focus of being a good steward of capital.
We continue to be active in the debt markets. So far year to date, we did 17 new loans, approximately $2.4 billion, of
which our share is $1.7 billion. The average interest rate on the loans is 2.9% and the average term is 8.1 years.
Klépierre reported solid first half results. I won't go through them in detail; they're available. Shopping center gross
rents, which represent 94.4% of total rents, were up 4.1% or 2.5% on a like-for-like basis. They increased their 2013
guidance for net current cash flow per share, and they continued to upgrade the portfolio through development,
redevelopment, as well as the disposition of non-core assets.
Today, we increased the top and the bottom of our 2013 FFO guidance once again to a new range of $8.60 to $8.70 of
FFO per share. This is a, increase of $0.20 from our initial guidance or over $70 million. And as always we are
extremely focused on the successful execution of our plan for 2013 from the effective leasing and management of our
high-quality existing portfolio to the successful delivery of our new and redevelopment pipeline and the achievement of
the returns that we have outlined. We're now ready for any questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions]
<A - David E. Simon>: Hello?
Operator
And your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of New York. Please, proceed.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: And thanks for not reporting on a Wednesday afternoon. I look at the supplemental
and it says the openings projected for 2015 and beyond it lists Del Amo and Roosevelt Field, but it doesn't list Copley
Place and Houston Galleria. Is this just because those projects are starting late or is there a change in plan for those
assets?
<A - David E. Simon>: No change at all. We are – we actually, once they are formally approved within our internal
process, they go on the schedule. Copley, we're actually going through just a little bit more permitting approvals, which
we expect to have by the end of the year. And then The Galleria, we have an announcement coming shortly. Stay tuned,
we approve it internally. They'll both be on our list. No real change of plans on either one.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. And I also noticed in the anchor section, you're adding a Wegmans to the
Montgomery Mall, may you be adding supermarkets to other centers? And was there any change that you made in
terms of parking or access to make Wegmans work with the rest of the mall?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Hi, Craig. It's Rick. The Wegmans is being built on the site of a former Boscov's, which
we demolished and the land was suitable to be able to have all their parking accommodated. We are putting several
outside uses in Montgomery just to be accommodative to that. So we're having some uses we think will work well with

the supermarket. And we're also adding a fairway market at Nanuet. So these types of high profile, high volume users
are we think very additive to the properties.
<A - David E. Simon>: Craig, I remember you used ask about Nanuet all the time. So now thankfully...
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: It's happening.
<A - David E. Simon>: It's opening in October and we're basically virtually leased. Not everybody will open by this
year, but by spring of next year the – all 100% will be opened.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: I was actually by the site a couple weeks ago, it looks like it's pretty transformative.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, it should be. We're excited about it.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: One last thing, are you able to give a cap rate on the Laguna Hills Mall that you sold
in May?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I'll let you do the math. The NOI, if I remember correctly was around $6.5 million or
something in that range, $6.5 million.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Just on the McArthurGlen acquisition, can you just talk broadly about the opportunity in
Europe with outlets and how involved Simon's senior management will be with the management and growth of that
business?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think there is a significant opportunity both within their existing portfolio and the
ability to add extensions to them as well as continue to upgrade the tenant offerings and add to the footfall of those
centers through tourism efforts and the like.
In addition, McArthurGlen does have a significant pipeline of additional opportunities in terms of new development. So
when you couple those, as well as we do think there'll be acquisition opportunities within their portfolio and others, we
think it's going to end up being a significant platform for our growth of over the next several years. It's a complicated
deal not only because it's in Europe and you're in different countries, but also the ownership of the assets are owned not
by just one individual, but by various partners and funds. I think over time as we solidify the platform, bring our
expertise to the table along with their assets and their people, it should be a very good deal for us. So we're excited
about it.
And the sales productivity of these centers is very high and there are not a lot of them, and they're very well accepted.
And there's not that many players in Europe that do it at such a high level. So we think ultimately it's going to be a
good transaction for us.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: I think you still own a stake in Value Retail, the other outlet developer and owner in Europe.
Are you now a seller of that stake?
<A - David E. Simon>: Do you have an offer for me?
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: I don't have the money.

<A - David E. Simon>: Okay. No, we're happy with that stake, but we're always interested in whatever we can do to
benefit our shareholders. But that investment has been good for us. We anticipate continuing in it. As you might know,
I mean that was kind of an investment that the former Chelsea made. We've added to it over the years. We've got a
significant embedded gain compared to our book value of it and they do a very good job in terms of operating their
centers as well. So we think we're a long-term owner of it, but I never rule anything out.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. And then just lastly there's been a lot of media speculation on the Colonial investment
management platform in Australia. I know you guys are constantly looking at global opportunities. Is the Australian
mall industry one that interests you?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, maybe. Haven't ruled it out, but we'll look at anything. I mean Westfield does such a
good job. We've always been a little bit reluctant to enter that market. On the other hand, it's an interesting market. It's
very stable. We like the people there and the malls there do very well. So I wouldn't rule anything out. Just like we
monitored Brazil for years, haven't found the right transaction, we wouldn't rule any one particular place out there. The
one place we continue to be the most concerned about in – as we look internationally is China just because it's a tough
place to figure out who's on first. Australia to some extent has a lot of benefits that it's a very transparent market.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from the Christy McElroy of UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Hi, good morning, guys, just a quick follow-up on McArthurGlen. With regard to the
property management development partnership, will there be any immediate impact to cash flows just thinking about
any fees or is that further down the road?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's a profitable management company. So we'll – our investment will have a return
associated with it. Now that will just end up flowing through our JV line, so it's not going to be in our management
company, but – so it will be hard for you to see. But they're profitable and we expect to have a pretty good return on
our investment in the management company.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: What was the investment?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's really separated into two pieces, but both for the management and the development
was £25 million.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Okay. Are you able to disclose the Q2 2013 only year-over-year change in sales?
<A - David E. Simon>: Say it again?
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Just the quarter change in sales? So if I were just to isolate the second quarter sales and
look at it on a year-over-year basis.
<A - David E. Simon>: We don't do that, but it was up about 1%.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Okay. And then, just lastly...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, go ahead.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Just lastly, regarding some of the new sort of in-store customer tracking technology that
some retailers are using today, are you having to do any upgrades to the technological infrastructure of your malls such
as increasing bandwidth or other changes? And are you using any new technologies to sort of collect any of your own
data on customers or analyze shopper traffic patterns?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, that whole area, we are treading very, very carefully.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Of course.
<A - David E. Simon>: Because it is lots of privacy concerns. So we have not – we've looked it at all, but the fact of
the matter is until the folks in Washington feel good about it, we are watching it and we're not really playing in any of
that stuff because we really don't know what kind of privacy violations it may generate. So I would tell you that we're
trading very, very carefully and have done nothing along the lines that would be able to track anything like that, period,
end of story.
Now, with respect to, I think the big effort generally in the mall industry is we're all investing in Wi-Fi networks
throughout our malls. We're doing that as well. We're starting at the bigger ones first and that's really primarily for the
benefit of our consumer, but to the extent that it can help facilitate our retailers, we're happy for them to participate. But
again, I would tell you, on the privacy front, we're not doing anything. We're treading very, very carefully.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: And from a CapEx perspective, what are the sort of per mall costs associated with adding
the Wi-Fi?
<A - David E. Simon>: It depends, it's – I'd say generally it's around $150,000 a mall, but it really depends,
somewhere in that range.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Hi, good morning. Steve, you've been a little quiet so far, so maybe I'll lead off with
you. As far as the A rating, is this a blessing or a bit of a curse? In any way, does it limit your ability whether it's on the
redevelopment front or on the overseas investment front, does being an A student, does that hinder your guys'
flexibility or would you rather be A-?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It does not hinder it at all, Alex. And in fact one of the additions that we made to the 8-K
this quarter was to give you some look at some credit metrics over a five-year look-back period. And you can see how
the metrics had improved. The coverage has gotten better, leverage went down, debt to EBITDA went down. So I think
if anything it's just a reflection of the continued strengthening of the balance sheet. And to the extent that we can
absolutely borrow at cheaper rates than anyone else in our sector, I think that's absolutely a good thing.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I'll just add that S&P, they're pretty smart folks. They've seen what we've done
historically, both in redevelopment and M&A activity. So they have every expectation that that will continue. And they
don't necessarily just rate you based upon being a status business, they rate you on what you've done and what they
expect for you to do going forward. And our redevelopment pipeline of $5 billion thereabouts as well as our continual
activity in finding smart external investments is part of our history of our company and that they actually like that stuff,
because it's obviously increased our return on equity and increased our cash flow and made us a better company. So
that's all factored into how they look at us going forward.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then the second question is going onto the McArthurGlen and Klépierre.
The first part is just when you were talking, David, earlier about buying out in McArthurGlen, presumably that was
buying out some of those individual ownership stakes so that it would be JVs that you would own McArthurGlen assets
with McArthurGlen and Simon as the ownership structure and then separate...
<A - David E. Simon>: Correct.

<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's correct. That's correct.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then separate is it's early on, but down the road do you see synergies
between Klépierre and McArthurGlen? Or in your view these are two totally separate platforms, they each have to
stand on their own?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think initially they're two separate platforms and definitely will stand on their own. I
mean they have very successful operating platforms and they have obviously dedicated management for both and
they're both big businesses. But I do think with time there certainly could be cooperation between the two, but it's not
necessary. But I would expect the two to cooperate over time. And especially in France where McArthurGlen has at
least three in the pipe of new potential developments, given the history of Klépierre and developing in France, there's
no reason why some sort of cooperation wouldn't make sense for both companies. And we'll certainly encourage that. I
happen to know both guys that run it, so it will make a little bit easier.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Listen, thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. David, when I look at some of the recent acquisitions, they always seem to be
largely strategic. You think about the big picture, you look at adding outlets to Europe where you obviously have the
full price presence. That's got similarities with what you've done in U.S. Your growth always seems to be primarily
strategic. Do you also look at plays where you would find more distressed real estate or you would find big discounts
through NAV or asset value? Or is this still on the back burner and you keep looking for strategic acquisitions?
<A - David E. Simon>: I can't tell you, there's nothing more than buying something cheap that excites me and the team
here. So we love to buy things really cheap. And if that can be done on a distressed basis, we like it as long as –
ultimately we've got to believe in the real estate because we're not, well, I wouldn't say we're traders. So at the end of
the day we've got to have a long-term view that we like the cash flow that's being generated from the real estate.
But to some extent, I mean if you go back to the Klépierre deal and look, Europe is still squishy to put it mildly. That
was a – I wouldn't call it a distress situation, but it was certainly at a pretty decent discount to NAV and an uncertain
future. And not many people are investing in Europe when we talk about McArthurGlen. There are not many people
that are at this point taking the position that Europe is a good place to invest in. So to some extent both of those
transactions are somewhat contrarian. And if we see those as capital ebbs and flows throughout the world, I mean I
would hope that we would be able to take advantage of it.
So we'd certainly love to try and do that. It's not what we do every day. We've got to believe in the real estate at the end
of the day, but I would tell you that we've done it historically. So we would hope to continue to find those kinds of
opportunities.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: And when you look at it currently, are those investment possibilities primarily outside of the
U.S., or do you see potential distress here, distressed properties or even companies that might be at prices that are of
more interest in the United States?
<A - David E. Simon>: I would say, Cedrik, generally those kinds of opportunities are outside the U.S.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Would you be able to share the cap rate on Woodburn?
<A - David E. Simon>: You won't believe it, but it was 10.5% only because we had a long-term option to buy it at a
10.5% cap rate. So it's not a reflection of market value, but it just goes – it's a long history there but it's a pretty good

deal for us.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: How did that option – how was it put together?
<A - David E. Simon>: It was really by the Outlet guys with Craig over a number of years, history of that whole
relationship. It's not really all that material how it got there, but it just – it's a good deal for us and importantly it's a
very good center.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks, good morning, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: I was hoping that you guys could focus a little bit on the core portfolio since that's the primary
driver of I think growth here. You guys are now 95% occupied. The business is really hitting on cylinders. When I look
at the releasing spreads and look at where ending rents are for next year, they actually are lower in 2014 than they are
for the balance of this year, so I'm just curious. How are you and Rick thinking about the leasing, the discussions with
tenants? And what are you guys doing differently today, given where you're sitting with the portfolio as well leased as
it is?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: How are you doing, Steve? It's Rick. Basically, we are spending a lot of time just focusing
on our mix, focusing on getting the right tenants in the right spaces to maximize the productivity, to maximize the rent
that they can pay. And I will tell you that a lot of the calls that David and I receive are tenants worried about whether
they're going to be renewed in their spaces as opposed to having to solicit interest in the spaces.
So we're still in a pretty dynamic market. All of the improvements we're making to this portfolio in the renovations, the
redevelopment, I think over the last four years, we've probably added 200 different anchors to these portfolios. We're
just taking market share and making them better. And I think the thing you can focus on is the fact that our occupancy
cost is 11.3%. And as you see with our spreads and you see with the momentum we have, we're going to be able to
continue to grow that NOI because of all those reasons.
<A - David E. Simon>: But, Steve, I would just say look, the fact is supply and demand is a little bit better. But our
philosophy on how we operate the business is not all that different. We've seen cycles ebb and flow at the end of the
day, what's best for the business creating the win-win with the retailer and we've done that. We don't get to where we
are today if we hadn't taken that philosophy over the last 50 years. So it's not all that different. Sure, it's better to be in
this kind of environment where supply and demand is in the owners' favor, but that changes too. And so at the end of
the day, it's all about just trying to create a win-win, which I think the history of our company suggests we know how to
do.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, maybe a quick question for Steve. On page 22 of the supplemental, you've obviously got a
fairly large decline in the other income. And even if you strip out some of the things like gain on land sales, the other
was down about $10 million and it's down about $12 million for the year. Can you just talk about that and how do we
think about that business in the back half of the year and into next year?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Sure, Steve. There are a couple of things that were in other income in 2012 that aren't there
in 2013. If you remember, we talked from time to time on prior calls that we were owners of some mortgages, so there
was income flowing through from that debt. That debt has all been paid off. Likewise, we were the mezz lender to The
Mills. That debt was obviously retired as part of the transaction in 2012. And then we have had, as you mentioned, both

lower land sales as well as on a year-to-date basis much lower lease settlement income.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, just to reinforce there because I saw your – well, just to reinforce, the core business of
what's in the other income, sponsorship, all the ancillary things that are generated from the mall business is up this year
compared to last year, so there's no change there. That category does represent a lot of our other activity, whether it's
loaning folks, buying mortgages. Sometimes we loan developers money where we get an option to buy. As Steve said,
we bought mortgages. Last year, we sold our investment in The Domain residential, so that also category represents the
other activity that the company does. That's not what I'll call its operating business and it's a little bit lumpy, no big
deal. But the important point is it is other income which is good. It's not other losses, that's point one.
Point two is that the core business sponsorship, et cetera, is all trending up this year compared to Q2 of last year and
year to date. Now I don't have exactly that number what it's up, but we can certainly get it to you pretty quick unless
you have it. We don't have the core business number, but we can get that for you, no big deal.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, thanks. And then lastly, David, just talk maybe a little bit about the Brazil situation, your
relationship with BR Malls, and what's going on in terms of looking for deals down there; and the weakness in Brazil
and how do you think that plays out over the next year or two?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, the joint venture that we have with BR, the first deal we were looking to build an outlet
center in was in São Paulo. And as you know, it ran into right-to-build issues. Those still to this day have not been
satisfied, at least to our comfort level. So at this point, it's a no-go deal until that gets satisfied. And if it does get
satisfied, then we'll have a decision to make. We'll have to assess the climate, both short term and medium term, in
deciding whether or not to go forward. But the condition precedent to that decision is not yet there, and that's the
right-to-build issue. There are a couple of other sites that our team went down to look at that may be in the pipe in the
future.
So let's put that aside. The macro stuff there is concerning. All the supply in the market is concerning. That's why we
like the outlet business because it was different. It was new. It was going to get ahead of a lot of the supply that came
on, on the full price. Obviously, you've got to weigh the macro in. But long term, Brazil's a great country with a lot of
dynamic growth to it. But we're very cautious on a market like that. And we haven't found the right deal, and thankfully
in hindsight our decision not to invest aggressively there has been the appropriate one.
So we'll wait to see. I've always worried about the cash flows from the buildings that have been built there and whether
that was sustainable with all the new supply, the fact that a lot of the cash flow comes from parking. There's a whole
host of things. The cost of the goods down there is significant. The high-end malls there, whether they're profitable for
the retailers or not, still is a question mark. So there's a lot there to underwrite. And essentially, you should assume that
those questions have been factored into the fact that we have not made an investment in Brazil.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi. Just a question on sales growth with regards to the increase from $575 a square foot
reported in the first quarter to $577 reported now. Do you think the sequential increase of 35 basis points is a sign for
concern, is it somewhat weaker than the other recent quarters?
<A - David E. Simon>: No.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: No. Okay. And then can you comment on which areas of retail seem to be doing especially
well versus the ones that are keeping the number from increasing as much as it had been the previous few quarters?

<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, I'll let Rick talk about that. But I will say this, I mean the ups and downs of retailers and
retail sales is a historical fact. But the increasing of our cash flow year-after-year is also a historical fact. And so we
don't get overexcited whether sales go up 5% or down 5%, because we know that the cash flow that we generate from
our buildings has a long history of increasing, given that we've got tenants in there that are very profitable and we have
leases that are below market.
So when we look at – we give you this information. I have never pulled my hair out based upon – or jumped for joy
when sales have increased. I mean we're just giving you the facts. The fact of the matter is our comp NOI is going to
grow, because our market rents are well below what leases are rolling over, as someone pointed out earlier. So just I
just want to reinforce that point and then Rick can go ahead and answer your question.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: So just add a little more color to that, that the stronger regions for us were New England,
the Mountain states, Southwest and South Atlantic, a little weaker over the Plains, Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes. Our
stronger categories were juniors, women's specialty, accessories, men's shoes and women's better, and the weaker areas
were women's popular, home furniture and women's special size.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thanks, just a couple quick follow-ups. Could you guys talk about yield expectation for your
investment in McArthurGlen?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we're going to – when the whole deal closes, we'll give that to you. But as we said
initially when we announced it in May, that it will be accretive. And it's going to be a – we believe it's going to be a
profitable transaction, but until all the elements of it close, we're not going to get in those details.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. And you guys made investments in six interests in their malls. They own about, I think
about 20 or more. Was it just because of the structures in individual malls, or was more selective bias?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, we haven't closed on four of the six yet. But when those close, some of those
interests are held outside of MGE, which again over time I think we'll have the opportunity, to the extent that we want
to, to buy interest in some of those assets. But they're not really at this point owned by MGE other than a couple which
we kind of collectively both agreed that we didn't want to buy at this particular point.
So again, this is a long-term transaction that we feel we'll be able to increase our investment in but in a methodical,
thoughtful way. And we're just focused on finishing the first deal and then we'll be able to look at other opportunities
going forward, not just with some of the assets that they manage, but don't own or own very little, but also other
opportunities out there.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. And the 5.9% same-store NOI growth, could you help us – could you break that out a little
bit, maybe how much of it was on the revenue front versus expenses? And it looks like your tenant reimbursements
increased pretty significantly, how much of that was driven by that as well?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Ki Bin, this is Steve. You hit the three components, minimum rent was over half of it. A
contributor was also the net increase in recoveries, if you will, and then percentage rents, if you look at our overage rent
line on both the consolidated financials, but then also our share of the JV income overage rent was a contributor as
well.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: And is that – the increasing recovery, what brought about that? It seems this was higher than it's
been before on a year-over-year basis?

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: I don't think it's higher than it's been year before, but it's – we're 90 plus percent converted
to fixed CAM. We have annual escalators of that fixed charge and that annual escalator has been at a higher rate than
expenses have been growing and in fact we've done a really good job of holding expenses relatively flat, so that has
been additive.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay, and last question and I'll leave it open ended. I'm surprised that you guys didn't include the
outlet development in Philadelphia with Penn REIT in your – I guess maybe it's too new, in your development pages or
disclosures, so I guess I'll leave it open and maybe you could comment a little bit about that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, once we approve it internally, it will go on our schedule. We expect it to go forward. It's
still finalizing the permit. We're actually rushing, I hope, to start this year so we could open next year. That's going to
be touch and go just because we have to go through some permitting stuff. Once we do it and approve it, it will be
there. We expect it to be a good deal. Penn REIT approached us with the site, I don't know, a year and a half, two years
ago, Rick, probably?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: A year.
<A - David E. Simon>: We looked at it. We did a little bit of tentative pre-leasing with the retailers. They expressed an
interest. We're going to build it, once we get permitted, not overly complicated. And then hopefully, if we do get –
jump through the hoops that we need to jump through, we could actually start this year and then have a chance of
opening next year. But like I said, that's right on the bubble. It's not going to be a 2015 opening.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Is that a 50:50 JV?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. We own 75%, we have a – and they own 25%, and we have a small partner in our piece.
So I think our effective, I remember is around 65%, our effective ownership is 65%.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay, thank you, guys.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul E. Adornato>: Thanks. Good morning. I guess this morning Hudson's Bay was talking about spinning off
their real estate into a Canadian REIT. And so the question is not on Hudson's Bay or Canadian REITs, but really just
the longer-term trend of the anchors trying to capture the real estate value for their own shareholders. Was wondering if
you had any thoughts or comments on that dynamic and how you might see it playing out going forward?
<A - David E. Simon>: I will tell you that the attractiveness of a company like ours versus a captive REIT are a
completely different set of institutional investors. What people look to our investment is the growth, rising dividends,
the dynamic nature of our company. And by investing with us, they've been well rewarded by our ability to increase
our earnings and our dividend and obviously resulting stock price increase.
In those captive REITs, they're basically a different set of investors, they're bond-like investors. So it's a whole
different thing. And if retailer wants do it, I mean god bless them. I mean if it makes them ultimately a better retailer,
and they can use that capital to reinvest in their business, it's no big deal from our standpoint.
So there are some that are also trying to redevelop some of their boxes. I think they have found that to be really
difficult. And I think what they'd rather end up doing is trying to figure out what the fair market value is and then look
for the developer; i.e., us to make the profit. And that's been the nature of the development business for years is that the
developer tends to get the development profit because they know what they're doing.
So I don't think any of this is really all that different, I think it's a potentially an attractive way for them to raise the
capital to fund Saks and if they can do that and make the combination a better and more profitable business, we're all

And your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Good morning, all.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Hey. It looks as if we ended the 30-year decline in long-term interest rates in the first half
of this year. So if rates are going to be going up, what do you think Simon might have to do differently over the next
three to five years in order to generate returns as attractive as the returns you've been able to generate over the last
couple of decades, David?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the plan has been put in place, David, which is for us to generate the kind of
returns that we want to generate that we've done historically, it's really the redevelopment, new development pipe that
we've produced. And that's bigger than it's ever been. A lot of the returns that we generated historically was because we
bought a lot of stuff at good prices and the values went up and we added value through increasing the cash flow.
The arbitrage that we have in the redevelopment and new development business and as large as it is, is actually higher,
even with higher interest rate. So as long as we can execute and that's assessing retailer demand and making sure the
cost are right, I think we can still do what we've done as we've shifted more toward redevelopment and new
development as opposed to acquisition in terms of how we look at all the capital that we're plowing back into the
business. So I don't think we have to do anything extraordinary. And other than – and it is extraordinary, other than
execute our pipe which is huge and complicated, but if we can do that I think we'anded.ht be at prices that are of more
interest than the United States?
ies.
it. So we certainlyre in good stead.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: David, I'd also remind you, as I think David mentioned in this opening remarks, we fund
that pipeline with free cash flow. So the – in theory the cost of that capital is zero, so the arbitrage is very good.
But I'd also remind you, we have $2.9 billion of debt coming due next year, the weighted average interest rate is 6%.
We've got $2.9 billion coming due the following year at a weighted average interest rate of about 5.25%. So even with
the spike in interest rates that we've seen, today our bonds trade in the 3.75% range for 10 year. So there still should be
a very positive pickup as we refinance that debt over those couple of years.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Steve, you read my notes, I put out a month ago or so and I suggest – made six
suggestions that REITs might adopt, by way of strategy and tactics to generate performance in a rising rate
environment. Would you just care to expand on why you think that managing leverage over the cycle would perhaps
not be the right way to go?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, David, listen I think one of the things we should have all learned coming out of
2008, 2009 is that the world changes, it's a volatile place. The price we pay for being a REIT is that we don't fund –
self-fund our debt from cash flow. So we should all run with a fair bit of liquidity and I think we should all run with
relatively conservative balance sheets. So you and I might disagree on that particular point.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Okay, and just a point of detail on the McArthurGlen deal. If we think about the return
expectations you underwrote there, on the existing assets, do you think those assets are going to produce a higher

returns than dollars invested in the existing outlet centers in the U.S.? And so we're looking really at this transaction as
offering the better returns from development as we go forward? Or do you think it's going to be – you're going to get
attractive returns out of the existing assets as well?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the returns that we're able generate out of the U.S. outlet business are pretty
damn good. So there's not much out there that we're going to do, that's going to rival the returns that we get from new
development and extending our existing U.S. Premium Outlet business.
But that doesn't mean that that should eliminate us making other good investments. And we are as busy as we've ever
been in the U.S. Premium Outlet business. We're not doing every deal, I mean there's lots of other outlet developers
doing lots of new business in that space, both re-development and new development. So we're focused on what we can
do and that's great. And we're piling a lot of capital in that as evidenced by the new development and the extensions at
Woodbury and Seattle and Desert Hills and Orlando and Vegas, et cetera. But that doesn't mean that the stuff that we're
doing in the – in Europe is not going to be attractive over both the medium and the long run.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Having seen a couple of....
<A - David E. Simon>: It's not quite as good as the U.S.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Right. I mean, having seen a couple of those McArthur assets over the years, I mean, I
think they're pretty well – been pretty well managed. I'm not suggesting that you couldn't squeeze some more out of
them, but it's not like a huge amount been left on the table, I don't think?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, people have said that about other stuff that we bought.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Yeah.

Thank you. And your next question comes from John Kim of CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - John Kim>: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to follow up on your potential interest in CFS Retail in
Australia. Internationally, your acquisitions have primarily been through joint ventures. But regarding CFX, I was
wondering if your preference was again to go this route. Would you entertain the idea of fully owning and managing
the assets, given the high quality of the portfolio and given the fact that the management rights are for sale?
<A - David E. Simon>: We didn't say any of that. So I think someone asked a big picture question about Australia, and
that's all I said was we haven't ruled it out. So I don't – I really can't add anything more to that than I – what I just said.
<Q - John Kim>: Okay, then maybe I could just clarify. Is the Commonwealth Bank's potential sale of its management
rights and interest in CFX, is that something that heightens your interest in Australia than a normal investment?
<A - David E. Simon>: Again, we haven't ruled – we're looking at opportunities worldwide. And to the extent that that
surfaces we'd look at it just like anything else. I can't really expound on it. There's nothing really to add at this point.
<Q - John Kim>: Okay. Just turning to another Aussie company, there are market reports that Lend Lease, who you've
transacted with in the past, is looking to sell its ownership stake and management rights of Bluewater in the UK. Would
a single acquisition like this be appealing to you in complementing your European investment, or do you still prefer a
platform in entering a new market?

<A - David E. Simon>: I would say one individual asset would – this is a generic statement. It would have to be a
unique individual asset in a market that we're familiar with for us to do it, to do that as opposed to just – I'd prefer a
platform. Certainly an asset like Bluewater is unique and it's a very good asset. But generally, it would have to just, this
is just a generic statement. For us to enter into a market that we don't have any presence would have to be the best of
the best in terms of an asset. I'd prefer a platform, and that's basically a generic statement outside of it being the best
asset in that market.
<Q - John Kim>: Can you comment on whether or not UK is within Klépierre's domain, or is it an open market for
either one of you to invest in?
<A - David E. Simon>: First of all, there are no restrictions that we have vis-à-vis Klépierre other than I'm Chairman
of the Supervisory Board, and I've got to obviously act accordingly. They are not in the UK. There has never been any
discussion that they'd have any interest in the UK, and I don't see foresee that at all.

And your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Maybe to follow-up to an earlier question for both David and Steve, what sort of interest rate
environment are you guys managing the business towards over the next few years? Are you expecting higher rates in
say the next two to three years?
<A - David E. Simon>: Are we? Sure, I wish I could tell you what the rate is. Then I would also be trading Treasuries
I guess. But fact of the matter is we're being as aggressive on refinancing our business as we can. We're not all that
excited doing trading dollars, which essentially is to some extent our secured debt has got obviously make-whole
provisions in all of it or most of it. But as soon as they are open to prepay, we're refinancing that. We don't necessarily
believe in funding that – make-whole premium is basically trading present value dollars, creates lumpiness in the
earnings, blah, blah, blah. I'm not a big fan of it. We may do it in one particular context on one deal. But we're as active
as we can, Steve, on refinancing.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: We are. And not only that, Jeff, we have, despite the fact that LIBOR is at 20 bps and
hasn't moved and there would be a temptation to float, the fact is 90%-plus of our debt is fixed rate debt. We've done
the math with long-lived assets and long-term fixed rate debt. Jeff, I think David is right. I think rates are likely to rise.
Having said that, they've already moved 75 to 100 bps, and we don't have a lot of robust economic growth in the
economy today. But I do think it's probably likely that we'll see a higher rate environment going forward.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Have you guys seen already any demonstrable impact on asset pricing, either deals being
retraded, or do you expect a better acquisition environment ahead?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, I don't think there has been a really reaction on the transaction side because of rising rates
at all. I have not seen it at all.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And maybe this one is for Rick. Just on occupancy costs, I'm curious. The pace of sales
growth is decelerating but releasing spreads have been fairly healthy. Why haven't we seen an increase in occupancy
costs, and do you think that's going to ratchet up in the next 12 months?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: One of the components of occupancy costs are sales and rents. Frankly, we're only rolling
a relatively small percentage of our square footage every year, and our sales have been growing pretty aggressively and

our spreads have been growing right along with that. So as we pointed out earlier, given that we're 11.3%, we think we
still have considerable room to grow our rents even in a moderating sales environment.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: That's helpful. And just maybe an understanding percentage rents, I know overall the portfolio
does about $577 a square foot. But when you guys look at who actually pays percentage rents, does the sales
productivity of those tenants vary much from the portfolio average? I'm just curious if the productivity of the
percentage rent payers is higher or lower than the portfolio as a whole.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It is all over the block. We've got over 1,200 tenants they pay us percentage rent. So we
have a very wide and diverse base, and really there's no particular corollary between how you would say sales
productivity in the payment of percentage rent.
<A - David E. Simon>: And to amplify Rick's point about 1,200, a lot of our percentage rent payers are actually
department stores that pay 1% or 2% or 3% depending on the vintage of the original deal. And I would tell you that
that's a big component of our percentage rent. And as you might imagine, it has been static over the last several years
and in some cases down when you're talking about $0.01.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Just one last question, actually for you, David. I recall that I think Simon or Chelsea had
bought in Craig's interest in their Carlsbad Outlets years ago for I think around a 10% cap. Are there any more of those
purchase options still lingering with Craig?
<A - David E. Simon>: We're looking. I'd like to find a few more, but I don't believe so. But if I stumble upon one, I'll
let you know.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Thanks, have a good one.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Nate Isbee>: Hi, good afternoon. Just focusing on the same-store growth, you're in the mid-5%s through the first
half of the year against some pretty tough comps in 2012. And you guys mentioned earlier in the year that some of the
redevelopment might weigh on 2013 growth. Would you say you've navigated through that better than expected, or
should we expect some of that to rear its head in the second half of the year?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think our comps – I've been very, very pleased, and it's above our own internal budgets on
our comp NOI growth. So the team, the folks, the leasing, the management folks have done a fantastic job year to date
and beaten my own internal expectations. So they've done a great job.
<Q - Nate Isbee>: Okay, so looking ahead to the second half of the year, you do have some pretty easy comps from
last year. Is there anything out there in the redevelopment that should make us think that you would not continue what
you've been doing here in the first half?
<A - David E. Simon>: Again, redevelopment we exclude. So it's really – it's not – that's not in that number, so let's
put that aside. Look, there are unknowns in the business environment, sales, I hate blaming the weather. I will never
blame the weather. Even if we miss one quarter because of the weather, you will not hear the weather excuse here.
<Q - Nate Isbee>: Will you say credit for it though?
<A - David E. Simon>: We won't take credit. We will not blame an early Easter, a late Easter, an early Halloween or a
late Halloween. But there are lots of things, Nate, out of our control, tenant bankruptcies, lousy sales, lousy weather,
whatever, international politics, U.S. politics, whatever changes the consumer mindset. So we're still in an uncertain
environment; that's why we try to be very cautious in how we look at things. And I've been, as I said to you, I wish I
could give you a number. I won't, you know we don't, but I've been very, very happy with the way the team has

And your next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hi, everyone. I just wanted to clarify on the McArthurGlen deal. I know you're going to provide
more details when it finally closes. In terms of the guidance update though, is there anything baked in for accretion for
McArthurGlen and also any transaction costs baked in?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, not at all, it's not in our numbers, correct.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: And then just going back to the interest rate commentary, I appreciate the color on not wanting
to prepay some of the mortgages. But I was just curious if you're thinking about prefunding some of the unsecured debt
that's coming due given where rates are today, how they've backed up in light of your rating increase or improvement
there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, that's a distinct possibility as we look out in the third and fourth quarter. Steve can add to
this. We always get ahead of that schedule. So it shouldn't surprise you if we do that sometime this year.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes, bonds are like mortgages in that there is the equivalent of yield maintenance. There's
a make-whole. So to some extent, you are trading dollars. But having said that much like we did in December of 2012,
we went to the bond market to prefund, if you will, our 2013 maturities because we knew what they were. If you look
at our debt maturity schedule, we've got about $900 million of bonds coming due in 2014. So as David mentioned, we
do look at the market. We monitor the market. One of the great things about the bond market is that you can go
relatively quickly. And so we do have that option to prefund that at some point in time.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

And your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yes, hi, just two quick ones on McArthurGlen, sorry about this. But the $435 million was
an equity investment, can you let us know what the associated debt is that goes along with that?
<A - David E. Simon>: We will outline all of that when we're closed on the transaction.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: But the leverage on – there's nothing extraordinary about the leverage amount on these assets.
So but we'll lay it all out with all the facts, once all of the elements get closed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. Do you think that's Q3 or is that Q4?
<A - David E. Simon>: Let's see, when Q3 – I would think that it should be completed by the end of this quarter.

<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay, great. And then last question. What was the trigger to sell the Laguna Hills Mall?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's very interesting. We have a redevelopment plan. Even after that redevelopment plan given
all of what the assets are – if you've been to Laguna and you know kind of the – what we own in Orange County, what
the spectrum does and what the spectrum is, our Mission Viejo and Brea Mall, even with the redevelopment, even
though it's well located, it was never going to be a really good core asset like Brea or Mission or Orange, The Outlets at
Orange. So we said, you know what, we can take that capital and reinvest it in what we think will be a core opportunity
at the end of the day and it was really that kind of thinking.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore. Please proceed.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Hi. Thanks. David, you mentioned having no additional purchase options with Craig Realty, but I do
recall you did have some prior agreements with Prime when you ended up buying Livermore in Grand Prairie. So
maybe based on your comments, is it fair to assume that you have no prior agreement option or other with any private
outlet owners at this time?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm just trying to think, don't put me on the spot like that, I can't remember everything. We will
do – we are about to another deal with Prime that actually we'll probably sign up this week. So – and they've announced
– it's no secret. I mean it's in the Minneapolis St. Paul area, which we think is going to be a terrific investment for us.
And so you're putting me on the spot, I mean but we're – we've got a couple other opportunities. So I just want to be
careful how you characterize that, but there's other stuff that we're working on that we'll have options to get in on. So I
shouldn't unilaterally say, yes, you're right. I think there are other stuff out there.
<Q - Ben Yang>: All right. Sorry for putting you on the spot. But maybe...
<A - David E. Simon>: No worries.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Is that deal with Prime in Minneapolis, I mean can you talk about the pricing and the cap rate on that
potential deal, and are you going to buy the entire center outright at this point?
<A - David E. Simon>: In that case, there's no option to buy it, frankly. But it's – we're a development partner. So
there's – we're just going in on the development side.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: So the returns are consistent with kind of what we've developed over the years in the outlet
business.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Okay. But you are going to be an owner in that project, right?
<A - David E. Simon>: Correct, correct.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Okay. And I'm just curious why is the expansion at Woodbury Premium Outlets so expensive given
the relatively modest expansion of physical space there? Is anything – is there anything unusual going on with that that
would lead to that $170 million investment that you're making?
<A - David E. Simon>: First of all, parking is really expensive because we have to deck the parking to create the
additional space. We have a tight site to start with. And we've got a lot of infrastructure work in terms of the parking.
And a lot of – we're redoing all of the ingress, egress, all of the roads are around it. And then, I mean, as much as we
love the center, it is long in the tooth. So we're also bringing it – keeping it consistently with consistent theming, but it

does need to be renovated.
But at the end of the day, even with that said, so you have the parking. You've got all the road work. It's going to make
it better for the consumer to get in and out of. We're renovating the mall. We got to demolishing a couple of buildings.
You put it all together, New York ain't cheap. It's not like building in the Midwest. You put it all together, I had the
same reaction frankly, but I still like the returns, and it is the world's best outlet center. So if we're going to spend
money anywhere, in ought to be in the world's best outlet center.
So you put it altogether, it's a good return and it is what it is. We're actually very excited. It's progressing. We actually
originally were going to do it over a three-year period. I told the guys to go back, figure out how to get it done in 2015,
and they've come up with a plan. So we're going to – this thing is going to be hot and heavy for a year and a half. But I
think afterwards, it will reinforce its position as the world's best outlet center. So we couldn't be more excited about a
project than that one.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Okay, but a lot of non-income producing work that you're doing there. So a good return to you, but
below the 12% that you're getting on some of the other redevelopments in the outlet space funds flow?
<A - David E. Simon>: Correct.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Okay. And then just final one, I know it's a small potential investment, but can you maybe comment
on your intentions at that land at Oyster Bay that you're trying to buy with some of your partners?
<A - David E. Simon>: Nothing really to say other than to the extent it moves forward, us and our partners will look at
it and come up with a plan that's got – that's subject to zoning and we would expect to come up with a responsible
development plan, but it's all going to be something that's going to be subject to getting zoning approvals. But we hope
to benefit the community there and work with the community there to come up with the appropriate plan. But it's going
to be driven not just by us, but our two highly regarded partners.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Is the goal to build a regional mall at that site, longer term?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. No, I don't see that at all.
<Q - Ben Yang>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Way back to the recovery ratio questions, the JV recovery ratio is
up pretty extensively in the first and second quarter of this year. Is that going to continue at that kind of rate you think?
Are we level at 2Q for a recovery ratio in the joint venture platform?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Rich, it's just ultimately math. It's a function of where the expenses go relative to the
contractual increases that we have built into our leases. Give me your view on where you think inflation is headed and
where costs are headed. So far, over a period of several years now, we've been having expenses grow at a slower rate
than the escalators in the leases, so it has been additive to the comp NOI growth. In any event, Rich, I would say that
the pace of the additiveness will probably slow down.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, good. That's fair. Then you commented, David, on what's going in Brazil as far as
outlet centers go. What do you think for North America in terms of how many you can build annually or some number
that addresses that concept over the next five years?
<A - David E. Simon>: I can't put a number on them. There's a big pipeline out there. We're going to do a handful.
Lots of other guys are involved in trying to do a number of them, and we'll see. It's not clear to me that they'll all get

built, but obviously it's the flavor of the month. Any center that's out there that is not meeting its performance
expectations turns into an outlet center. They're all harder to do than what people think, but there are a lot of obviously
very capable, competent developers out there trying to build outlets.
The important thing is what we build is good, and I can't worry about what others build. I can only worry about what
we build, and it's every intention on our front to only build what we can lease and generate a positive return on. And
thankfully, Rick, we haven't really screwed up yet on the new development side. So hopefully that will continue.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing that I would emphasize, as David touched on it earlier, is in addition to
new development, these expansions that we're doing are at some of the best outlet centers in the world, and they're not
small. Desert Hills is 147,000 feet. Las Vegas North is 147,000 feet. Seattle is 90,000 feet. These are big substantial
expansions that we're bringing great retailers, making some of the best in the world even better, and that shouldn't be
lost sight of.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. While you're on that, Rick, I have a question for you on Desert Hills. I just was in the
area and saw that one, and it's always been a great center, and I'm curious. I didn't quite get exactly what you're doing
there. It looks like you might be building a golf course in the middle or something.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I don't...
<A - David E. Simon>: Even though Steve wanted us to, we...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Exactly.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: I thought it was finally time to have a golf course at an outlet center.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Just a par three.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: What's going on now is, there are really three things going on simultaneously. We are, as
David alluded to at Woodbury, we're building a parking deck behind the existing larger section of Desert Hills, plus
we've already built additional grade parking behind the smaller section. And now what you're seeing in the interior of
the larger section is the actual development of the retail space. It's basically going to be an inner ring. So we're going to
maintain our race track layout. But now instead of being single-sided with parking in the middle, it's going to be
double-sided with parking in the decks.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, I got you. So how many retailers do you have there do you think?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, we're adding 147,000 feet. And frankly, one of the things we've been able to do to
drive our NOI is to try and be a lot more disciplined on the size of the retailers and maximizing our revenues by trying
to fit as many new retail concepts into the space as possible. So I would hope that it would be several dozen, but it
remains to be seen because people want as large a store as they can get there.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, good, got you. And last thing, guys. Do you have any updated thoughts on JCPenney
and how they're doing I guess over the past quarter?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing that I would comment on is that we're obviously in the stores. The stores
look good. We know as much about their sales as you do. I will tell you that through our channel checks, the debt is
trading at par. I think this is just a matter of giving the management team time to position it where they want to position
it. It's still a formidable retailer with considerable gross sales. And we certainly hope they can recapture market share
and resume a growth profile.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes, good afternoon, two quick ones for Steve. First, Steve, the reversal of the provision for
credit losses, I'm just wondering how much of that is a signal to the Street about how confident Simon is feeling about
tenant credit.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Tayo, it's not really a reversal of a provision. It's just the fact that there were some
receivables that we had reserved for and in essence written off that in fact were subsequently collected.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: But I will say this. As we look at the credit profile of our tenants and as we look at our
receivables every month that we do, the number of outstanding receivables, the number of tenants on the watch list is
pretty muted right now. And I would say the overall health of the retailers is pretty strong right now.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, other than I just – there are a few out there that – and don't ask me to name names
because I won't, but there are a few out there that still have some clouds around them. So we're focused on two or three
out there that are relatively decent sized for the mall business that we'll have to just monitor how they ultimately turn
their business around.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just the JV income, Steve, first quarter that number was
about $54 million but I think you mentioned that number was on the high side because of some mark-to-market on the
Klépierre leases. But in 2Q, the number comes in at $56.5 million. Just kind of wondering from a run rate perspective
what makes sense for us to be modeling?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It's – I would say, Tayo, the run rate is probably more in line with what we saw in the first
quarter backing out that one-time trend, one-time thing that we talked about. So it's in the high 40s to about $50 million
a quarter I think.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: So what happened this quarter again to make it still elevated?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: There was a gain – a small gain that flowed through related to Klépierre's sale of their
home office headquarter building.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
