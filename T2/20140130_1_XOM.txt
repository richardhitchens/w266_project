MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings
conference call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President
of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon
Mobil's financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. I will refer to the slides that are
available through the investor section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.
Moving to slide three, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth continued at a modest pace in the fourth quarter with mixed performance across the regions. Moderate U.S.
economic growth was sustained. China's growth rate stabilized while Europe's economic recovery remained sluggish.
Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices decreased more than $8 per barrel, widening the discount to Brent
as the global marker was only slightly lower in the quarter. Henry Hub natural gas prices were essentially flat. Global
industry refining margins strengthened as stronger U.S. margins were partially offset by continued margin weakness in
Europe and Asia-Pacific. Chemical commodity product margins also declined over the quarter.

Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on slide four, Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings were
just under $8.4 billion or $1.91 per share. The corporation distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the quarter through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares.
CapEx was $9.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12 billion. At the end of
the quarter, cash totaled $4.9 billion and debt was $22.7 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased
from $5.7 billion to $4.9 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our
ongoing asset management program yielded $12 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included
additions to property plant and equipment of $8.4 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.8 billion. Additional
financing and investing activities increased cash by $1.4 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are
expected to be $3 billion in the first quarter of 2014.
Moving on to slide six, and a review of our segmented results, Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings of just under $8.4
billion decreased by $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012. Lower earnings across all business segments were
partially offset by reduced corporate and financing expenses.
In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide seven, earnings increased by $480 million as higher upstream and
downstream earnings and lower corporate and financing expenses were partially offset by lower chemical earnings.
Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, and starting on slide eight, upstream earnings in the fourth
quarter were $6.8 billion, down $976 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. Realizations increased earnings by $60
million as worldwide natural gas realizations increased by $0.41 per thousand cubic feet and crude oil decreased by
$2.38 a barrel.
Unfavorable volume and mix effects, including the impact of crude underlifts in West Africa and the North Sea, along
with lower natural gas production, decreased earnings by $550 million. All other items decreased earnings by $490
million, reflecting increased expenses driven by Kearl operating costs and higher planned exploration costs in Russia.
Upstream, after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter were $17.95, excluding the impact of non-controlling
interest volumes.
Moving now to slide nine, production decreased by $77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8% from the fourth
quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 32,000 barrels per day or 1.5%. Ramp up at the Kearl and Nigeria
Satellites projects, lower downtime and continued increased production from unconventional plays in the U.S. were
partly offset by field decline and price and spend impacts. Natural gas production was down 654 million cubic feet per
day, primarily due to expected lower U.S. production and field decline in several areas.
Turning now to the sequential comparison and starting on slide 10. Upstream earnings increased by $73 million versus
the third quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $430 million as worldwide crude prices decreased by $5.89 per
barrel and natural gas realizations increased by $0.57 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects improved
earnings by $90 million, reflecting increased global liquids and natural gas production. All other items had a positive
impact of $410 million. Higher gains from asset sales were partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Moving to slide eleven, oil equivalent volumes were up 190,000 barrels per day or 4.9% sequentially. Liquids
production increased 36,000 barrels per day, mainly due to additional production from work programs in the U.S. and
the North Sea, Kearl ramp up and lower down time, partly offset by scheduled maintenance in Nigeria and field
decline. Natural gas production was up 973 million cubic feet per day, mainly due to seasonal demand in Europe.
Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the
quarter were $916 million, down $852 million from the fourth quarter of 2012, mainly due to lower, non-U.S. refining
margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $110 million, driven by refining optimization activities. All
other items, including higher operating expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by
$280 million.

Turning to slide 13, sequentially, fourth quarter downstream earnings increased by $324 million. Improved refining
margins, mainly in North America, increased earnings by $120 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$330 million reflecting favorable refining optimization activities. Other items reduced earnings by a net $120 million.
Moving now to the chemical, financial and operating results and starting on slide 14. Fourth quarter chemical earnings
were $910 million, down $48 million versus the prior year quarter due to lower specialty product margins. Positive
volume and mix effects were mostly offset by other items.
Moving to slide 15, sequentially chemical earnings decreased by $115 million, primarily due to lower margins in
Europe.
Moving next to the fourth quarter business highlights, and beginning on slide 16. We continue to advance our global
portfolio of high quality upstream projects. Construction at the PNG LNG project is nearing completion, with the focus
shifting to commissioning key facilities and equipment in preparation for first LNG delivery, now targeted for the third
quarter of this year. Gas has been introduced to both the gas conditioning plant at Hides and the LNG facility in order
to progress commissioning activities.
The Kearl expansion project is on budget, is now more than 70% complete and remains on target for a 2015 startup.
We continue to develop attractive logistics solutions to provide market access for our growing oil sand production from
this future additional capacity.
At Upper Zakum, we are progressing with our partners, the field redevelopment to raise production capacity to 750,000
barrels a day over the coming years. The increase is enabled through the use of four artificial islands of which two are
now complete and extended reach drilling using proprietary Exxon Mobil technology. Civil works and facility
additions will continue through 2015.
In 2013, the Upper Zakum joint venture was granted a 15 year license extension through 2041. The extension includes
enhanced fiscal terms, allowing the expansion project to meet our investment criteria and contribute towards Abu
Dhabi's plans to boost production.
In Iraq, we reached a production capacity of 500,000 barrels per day at the West Qurna I development in 2013. We
continue to progress additional capacity expansion through facility debottlenecking, work-overs, new drill wells and
well tie-ins. We have also completed 3D seismic acquisition over the West Qurna I field.
In the fourth quarter, we executed agreements to sell a combined 35% interest to PetroChina and Pertamina, reducing
our participation interest from 60% to 25%. We will remain as the lead operator for the project and are committed to
continue to maximize value for all parties involved in redeveloping this world class resource.
Turning now to slide 17 for an update on our exploration activities. In Tanzania, the Mronge-1 well discovered an
additional 2 TCF to 3 TCF of natural gas in place from two separate intervals. The main accumulation is at the same
stratigraphic level as the proven Zafarani-1 well. Secondary accumulation was encountered in a separate gas-bearing
reservoir in a play previously untested in Block 2. Mronge-1 is the fifth discovery on Block 2 and brings the total of the
gas in place up to 17 TCF to 20 TCF. Further exploration drilling is planned for 2014.
In Russia, ExxonMobil and Rosneft completed joint venture agreements to implement a pilot project for tight oil
development in Western Siberia. Operations for the pilot program are underway. We are evaluating data from the 2013
activity, which included a mix of work-overs and new well drilling. The year 2014 will focus on drilling and testing
new horizontal wells with operations to commence by the third quarter. We are currently finalizing locations to test this
high potential resource.
In Argentina, we drilled our first operated well and are currently drilling a second operated well in the Vaca Muerta
shale formation. Previously, we've drilled a total of six Vaca Muerta wells with our co-venturers to progress the
evaluation of our approximately 900,000 net acres. We have ongoing well operations to gather the production testing
data required to validate expected recovery and to support potential development planning.

Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our downstream investments, which continue to strengthen our global
portfolio. During the quarter, we achieved several investment milestones.
We commissioned a new diesel hydrotreater at our Singapore refinery, increasing ultra-low sulfur diesel production
capacity by 62,000 barrels per day. The new unit along with the recently completed petrochemical expansion project at
our Singapore complex positions Exxon Mobil to competitively deliver high value products to the growing Asia-Pacific
region.
We continue to extend our operating cost advantage by improving energy efficiency at our facilities. Worldwide cash
operating costs for our portfolio of refineries are well below the industry average and consistently outperform the
competition.
In November, we commissioned our latest cogeneration facility at our Augusta refinery in Italy, increasing energy
efficiency by 6%.
To support market access for our growing Canadian oil sands production, we announced plans to build a crude oil
railway loading facility next to the Strathcona refinery in Edmonton. The terminal will have a capacity of up to 250,000
barrels per day of which we plan to use 100,000 barrels a day to supply our refining network. Connections to both
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific mainlines will enable efficient, cost-effective transportation of heavy crude.
Construction is underway and start-up is expected in early 2015.
Now, I would like to provide a summary of our full year results shown on slide 19.
2013 earnings were $32.6 billion or $7.37 per share. The corporation distributed $25.9 billion to shareholders in 2013
through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $15 billion was utilized to purchase
shares. CapEx in 2013 was $42.5 billion and includes $4.3 billion for acquisitions. Base, full year CapEx of $38.2
billion was in line with our spending plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales remains robust at $47.6 billion,
which included $2.7 billion from asset sales.
Moving now to the full year cash flow statement, as shown on slide 20. During the year, cash decreased from $9.9
billion to $4.9 billion. The combined impact of earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other
items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $47.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $33.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $25.9 billion.
Additional financing and investing activities increased cash by $7 billion.
Moving on to slide 21 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2013 earnings decreased by $12.3 billion. Lower
net gains from divestments account for 70% or $8.6 billion of the reduced earnings. Lower earnings across all business
segments were partially offset by reduced corporate and financing expenses.
Turning now to the full year comparison of upstream results, and starting on slide 22. Upstream earnings were $26.8
billion, down $3.1 billion from 2012. Improved natural gas realizations, partially offset by lower crude oil realizations
increased earnings by $390 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects, including the impact of crude underlifts in
West Africa and lower natural gas production decreased earnings by $910 million. All other items, including lower
gains from asset sales, higher expenses, driven by Kearl start-up and operating costs and higher planned exploration
costs in Russia reduced earnings by $2.5 billion. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the year were $18.03
excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.
Moving to slide 23. Volumes decreased by 1.5% or 64,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2012. Excluding
the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was essentially flat.
Liquids production was up 17,000 barrels per day. Ramp up at the Kearl and Nigeria projects, lower downtime and
increased U.S. production were partly offset by field decline and divestment impacts.
Natural gas production was down 486 million cubic feet per day, as expected lower U.S. production, field decline in
several areas and full year AKG entitlement impacts in Qatar were partly offset by increased weather-related demand in
Europe and project ramp-ups.

On slide 24, we show actual 2013 production volumes compared to the outlook we provided at the analyst meeting last
March. Overall, total production volumes were in line with our target of 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day with
liquids production slightly below target and gas production slightly higher. Several positive factors contributed to this
result including strong up time performance, increased North America unconventional liquids production and higher
European gas demand for the year. These factors mostly offset a lower than expected volume contribution from Kearl,
and the loss of Kashagan volumes, due to the pipeline issue currently being investigated.
During the fourth quarter, we continued to ramp up Kearl production including making several upgrades to the steam
system and filtration units to improve overall reliability. Average Kearl production for the fourth quarter and full year
was 47,000 and 21,000 barrels per day, respectively and production rates of 100,000 barrels per day were reached by
the end of the year.
Full year comparison for the downstream is shown on slide 25. 2013 earnings were $3.4 billion, down $9.7 billion from
2012. Lower refining margins across all regions reduced earnings by $2.9 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased
earnings by $310 million, as higher planned maintenance activities in the U.S. and Europe was partly offset by refining
optimization activities. Other items, including the absence of gains from the Japan restructuring and other divestments
reduced earnings a total of $6.6 billion.
On slide 26, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2013 earnings were $3.8 billion. Higher
commodity margins, partly offset by lower specialty margins increased earnings by $480 million. Volume and mix
effects also increased earnings by $80 million, mainly due to strong U.S. commodity demand. Other effects reduced
earnings by $630 million, mainly due to the absence of gains from the Japan restructuring.
Moving to slide 27, in conclusion, in 2013 we earned $32.6 billion, generated $47.6 billion in cash flow from
operations and asset sales, invested $42.5 billion in the business and distributed $25.9 billion to our shareholders.
Exxon Mobil's strong financial and operating performance reflects the benefit of our integrated business model and
other sustainable competitive advantages that create long-term shareholder value. We achieved total production in line
with our target and continued to progress attractive opportunities across our unique and balanced portfolio. Base full
year CapEx spending was also in line with our plans. Our cash flow remains strong and enables robust shareholder
distributions.
Finally, I would like to mention two upcoming events. First, in mid-February, we will be releasing our 2013 reserves
replacement data. Second, as many of you will already have seen, our upcoming analyst meeting will take place at the
New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 5th. We'll include a live webcast beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern,
8:00 a.m. Central Time. The presentation will be led by Exxon Mobil's chairman and CEO, Rex Tillerson.
That concludes my prepared remarks, I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instruction] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI Group.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning. How are you?
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: I'm doing fine. My question is about European E&P, and specifically whether or not we
could get clarification on the supply restriction at Groningen; meaning, it seems like a 20% reduction in output is going
to be required from the partners during the next three years, which I think equates to about 60,000 BOED net to Exxon
Mobil, so is this the correct way to think about the supply effect and the duration of the restriction? Any color on that
situation would be appreciated.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, Doug, I'd be happy to give you a little perspective on the Groningen situation. Let
me start by saying that the government's draft decision does include a production decrease for the next three years of
about 7%, compared to average production over the average of the last few years. If this indicated, you know, if this
off-take limit is final, it would have an impact of approximately, on Exxon Mobil, 100 MCF a day net production in
2014 versus the average of the last several years.
Now compared to 2013, which, as I mentioned, was a year of very high production due to weather-related demand,
there would be a decrease of about 20%, and that's consistent with what was communicated by the Dutch government.
The proposed curtailment is not final. It will take a little bit of time to finalize it. But if implemented, again, you know,
the impact on us, relative to a normal year, you know is about 100 MCF a day.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. Sorry, go ahead.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm sorry, let me just make one other comment to keep it in perspective and add a little
color. In terms of the financial impact on the company, while Groningen is, of course, a very attractive asset in our
upstream, the unit profitability is in the bottom half of our portfolio, and so the earnings impact is not as great as I think
some people might have expected.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, good point. And then just, second, on the U.S. downstream, obviously you guys have
a leading position in the Midcontinent and it's really benefited from wide differentials over the last couple of years; but,
I wanted to see if we could get an update on the program to secure advantaged feedstock via railcars, or what have you,
for the refineries outside the Midcon? Any elaboration on this is appreciated. I think you guys talked about it a little bit
for the Gulf Coast at the analyst meeting. So just an update would be appreciated
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, sure. You know, in general, if you look at our Midcon footprint, which, as we talked
about before, is one of the largest in the industry. And, you know, our Gulf Coast refining footprint is also one of the
largest. So we've got a lot going on in terms of making sure that we can get the Western Canadian crudes down into the
circuit and also take advantage of the light sweet crudes.
And we are pipeline, you know, pipeline, rail, barge, we're using all of the logistics opportunities available to us to
optimize those barrels getting to the refineries. And that's a big piece of what you see in these positive volume mix
effects on our earnings, both quarter-to-quarter, sequentially, and that sort of thing, particularly if you look at that
sequential comparison where we've really been able to optimize the fee slate we're running and, of course, take
advantage of butane pricing as we switch over to winter grade fuels. And, so that's been helpful to us as well. But we
are actively progressing that and the fourth quarter, you know, was a good one for us.
And I might just mention, you know, that one of the things that makes that important in the earnings comparison, we
did have, in the fourth quarter alone, about $250 million of negative price timing effects, so that hurt on the margin
side, you know, it's somewhat offset by some of these refining optimization efforts we that talked about.
So, we continue to work on that. One of the things that helps is being fully integrated across the downstream, upstream
and chemical and having a worldwide supply department to help us on this. But, you can rest assured, from Canada all
the way down to the Gulf Coast, we are fully optimizing and taking advantage of our integration opportunities.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: All right, thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.

<Q - Evan Calio>: Yeah, first question on the production volumes. I guess, from your comments, I could disaggregate
the impact from Kearl and Kashagan in the fourth quarter. Can you provide any outlook into 2014 on Kearl? What's the
ramp, and more color there? And on Kashagan, which you mentioned, is there any prognosis for the production return
and the state of the gas leak repairs? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, let me start with Kearl. I can't give you, you know, an exact time of when we would
expect to reach our full production capabilities. You know, I will say, although the Kearl volumes did come in over the
course of the year, as I mentioned, less than our expectation going in, and certainly part of the volume outlook we
shared with you last March, we did achieve a number of milestones in cranking that project up.
We have been able to run each of the three treatment trains at their max capacity. On a combined basis, we've been able
to reach, you know, rates at 100,000 barrels per day. What we're working on now is how do we improve the reliability
so that we can run at those rates on a consistent basis and we continue to make progress there. And again, I think as I've
mentioned in prior calls, the good news for us is all the technology is working, the trains work, the equipment works.
It's simply been just a matter of startup and this complex kit we got on the ground and working some of these reliability
issues that I mentioned.
But they're all fixable. We're working on it, we're making progress. But I wouldn't want to give you an exact date in
terms of full capacity, but we'll give you an update at the analyst meeting in March and probably be in a better position
to help you with some outlook on that.
With regard to Kashagan, as you know, oil and gas production does remain shut in. We are investigating. We've got the
best experts in the world looking at this. We're investigating the root cause of the pipeline leaks and the seeps. That's
going to take a little more time. We do know that the immediate cause of the leaks, you know, has been sulfide stress
cracking, but we're still investigating to establish, you know, what's the cause of the sulfide stress cracking? And that is
ongoing.
There's a lot of work going on, a lot of analysis underway. But I just couldn't give you an outlook. I know there's some
speculation out there at various times, but, I'd be hesitant to try to give you an outlook until we know more about both
the cause and extent of the leaks, and therefore, you know, what it's going to take to repair them and get that equipment
back in service.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question is on – it also relates to production and to 2014
production. Thank you for the color on Groningen. I guess there, is there any ability to offset volumes from other
European fields, as it's largely a demand-driven market?
And secondly, in another area which has been, you know, very profitable, and a marquee investment for Exxon and
Qatar LNG? Any color there on the relative contribution as you move through various contract thresholds in those
contracts would be helpful, thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me start with Groningen. As you know, it is the swing field in Europe and tends
to take the balance of what's needed, depending on weather, typically, unless there's some supply disruption. And so,
that's really what drives the production there year to year, more so than capacity.
In terms of ability to offset, you know, we're already working everything we got, as you know. Continental Europe
conventional gas is on decline. North Sea gas is on decline. So, we do feed LNG into that circuit out of the Middle
East. But, you know, it has to compete with prices that you can get in Asia-Pacific. So, we will be looking to optimize
that, but again, you know, under normal circumstances, loss of about 100 MCF. But we'll be looking to optimize
around that, to the best we can.
If you're talking about Qatar, you know, I think the one thing to keep in mind is, other than the AKG project, all the rest
of the trains are joint ventures, they're not PSCs, so they don't react the same way that PSCs do. They do all have
unique fiscal terms associated with them. But I can tell you, as time goes on, we don't see any significant impact on the
earnings contribution, anything that would be material. So, we continue to remain focused on keeping that equipment
up and running. We had a terrific year on uptime and reliability, and that enabled us to take advantage of some very

strong margins that are available – prices, you know, particularly in the Asia-Pac. So it continues to be a terrific
investment for us.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great, Dave. Thanks for answering my questions.

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hi. I have a couple questions, also if I may. The first is on the long-life nature of some of your
assets. It just kind of occurs to me, obviously you haven't given a reserve replacement number for the year yet. But, as
your portfolio shifts towards the likes of Qatar and the likes of Kashagan and so on, Kearl, all these very long-life
assets, what is the determination internally about the need for reserve replacement to be at or above 100% when you
have such a huge, a huge piece of your portfolio that doesn't decline, you know, a multi decade basis? And I've got a
follow-up. I'm thinking really about capital intensity of the overall portfolio.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me hit the capital intensity first and I'll use that to back into your original question. We
have been in a very capital intensive mode in the upstream over the last few years as we recapitalize and invest in a
number of these big projects. Some, you mentioned, coming out of Qatar and into Kearl, Papua New Guinea LNG,
Gorgon LNG, the Kashagan, of course. You know, you have seen a wrap-up in CapEx on these long life projects. But,
as we talked about in the March analyst meeting last year, you know, we do have an expectation of rolling that
upstream CapEx over a little bit as we go forward, and we'll give you an update on that in March, but we continue to
progress that.
In terms of having a target of 100% reserve replacement, you know, we don't really have a target. In other words, we're
not going to go out and do things that are not optimal just to achieve a 100% replacement target. You know, we
basically – you know the company and the organization well. We span the world looking for good opportunities, good
resources to get access to. And, if they're commercial, we'll put the investment capital and human capital in there to
develop them. We have been fortunate over the last many years that the summation of all this effort has achieved 100%
or greater than 100% reserves replacement. But I am glad you asked the question because I do want everyone to know
that we do not go and spend the shareholders' money to reach any kind of target like a reserves replacement. It's the
outcome of our very disciplined analytical process, and again, making sure that the CapEx is being spent in those areas
that have the best opportunity to generate long-term value for the shareholder.
The last thing I'll mention, you know, Doug, as we look around the world and you look at our exploration portfolio, one
of the things that's really nice today is our ability to be selective amongst that portfolio and pick and choose those
opportunities that we want to go after, and do the most attractive ones and the reserve adds will be the fallout of that.
But thanks for asking the question.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Sure. My follow-up, very quickly, is on the Middle East again, specific to the ADCO
concession. I know it's fixed margin and relatively low in the grand scheme of things, but, can you just explain for us
what the situation is with that contract? I believe it expired on January 1, and whether or not you have any chance of
recouping that at some point, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expired on January 10th of this year. We did
have a 9.5% interest in that. That worked out to about 140,000 barrels a day of production. We are no longer in that
concession. I will tell you, you mentioned fixed margin contracts, while it was 140,000 barrels of production, the unit
profitability of that was down at the lower end of our seriatum of profitable barrels. So, that's the status on the onshore.
I really couldn't comment on any discussions, opportunities, forward-looking thoughts other than to, you know, kind of
give you a status of where we are today.

Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Hey, good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: It seems we're all fishing for your slides in March on the production volumes, so why not
fish again? Just very quickly, the reduction in the West Qurna stake, how much did you include longer term in the slide
that you put up each year, in terms of the new projects for West Qurna? Do you know?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, what I can tell you is, when we put up that slide in March of every year, and it's
important to know this, we do it on an apples-to-apples basis. So, we assume the status quo and the same as prior year
prices, so it allows you folks to get a look at what we would be status quo, so no assessments every March in terms of
acquisitions, divestments, contract expiries and all those sorts of things. So last year we would have had, you know, an
assumption of the status quo in that outlook.
Now, I can tell you that the way the contracts work, we don't book a lot of barrels in that area, and so the reduction, you
know, will not be significant. I don't have a specific number for you, other than to tell you it won't be significant in the
overall context of our production
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Okay, and then trying to shift the conversation on, can you talk a little bit about where you
are, you know, in terms of oily rig count again in North America, some of your plans? I mean obviously the industry's
announced some success in the Duvernay, you've got some good acreage in Woodford and the core of the Bakken and
the Permian. Just a quick sort of update on where you are in the oily drilling in North America? Thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. You know, as you can tell by the sequential quarter-to-quarter to quarter sustained
increase in U.S. liquids volumes, we have been really orienting our rigs towards the more liquid areas. The biggest
places for us: the Bakken, the Permian and the Woodford Ardmore. Most all of our rigs are running in those areas. We
continue to ramp up, we're adding rigs in the Permian, for example, both for conventional liquids as well as testing
some of the unconventional. We are drilling in the Montney and the Duvernay, as you suggested, and increasing
activity there, as well as in the Bakken.
So, if you look at the rigs we're running today, it's not 100%, but you know, it's probably 85% or so of all of our rigs
are working in liquids-focused plays. Thus, you've seen that significant increase in production. We're bringing a lot of
wells on to sales every quarter and continue to ramp that up. We're testing new areas, new zones, and in these plays, the
Marietta in the Ardmore, for example, looks very promising to us and we'll be getting more wells down there, the
Wolfcamp out in the Permian and a number of those plays. So we're very pleased with the acreage we've been able to
acquire and get into and ramping up pretty dramatically.
And you know, if you look at a number of these things that are occurring over this year, a lot of it gets back to the
commentary we made at the analyst meeting about working on improving unit profitability. And you do that by
limiting or reducing your exposure to low-profit barrels, working on fiscal terms where you can, and putting your
human and financial capabilities in those areas that generate above average incremental profitability. And we've been
executing those efforts this year and we'll give you a better update at the March analyst meeting on the extent of that
program.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Very good. So, sorry to beat a dead horse too much, if I look at your last year presentation in
the analyst meeting on the production profile, can you tell us that for 2014, 2015 roughly how much is built-in into that
particular profile you shared from the greenfield project from the Abu Dhabi onshore contract and also Groningen?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I don't have a specific number for Kashagan. Abu Dhabi would have been something
in the neighborhood of 140,000 barrels a day I mentioned, and Groningen would have been, you know, whatever the
equivalent would have been, you know, again for an average year. So I think the important thing to think about is, you
know, the difference would be kind of what we've mentioned today for both Groningen and the onshore. And again,
you know, we'll be giving you a full update on our outlook that will incorporate those changes and many others that we
have heading into 2014 when we get together in March.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay, second question. When I'm looking at Imperial, in the fourth quarter, they report
downstream earnings of 625 million Canadian dollars. So if we adjust for your working interest and the foreign
currency, it would suggest that your share of their downstream earnings is about $417 million; meanwhile that your
U.S. downstream only reported $319 million. Does that mean that outside Canada, the rest of your global downstream
operation actually lost about $100 million, or there is some other accounting adjustment that we didn't aware?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, let me give you a little perspective on that. First of all, you know, as I mentioned a
few minutes ago, one of the issues we did see in the quarter was price timing effects, about $250 million negative in the
U.S. and that impacted those earnings. We do see weakness in our European and Asia-Pacific businesses out there.
Margins are weak, the economy, you know, is a bit sluggish and so, both on the refining and the chemical side, you
know, you're not seeing an earnings contribution there that you'd see, you know in an up cycle. We're kind of, as I said
before, we're at bottom of cycle margins.
We also had in the 4th quarter, a higher turnaround and maintenance load in Europe. Our Antwerp refinery for
example, had a major turnaround. So, you're looking at some volume impacts there. But clearly, we're optimizing the
European and Asia-Pacific footprint as best we can with the integration between refining chemicals and lubes, but those
are weak markets compared to the U.S. and Canada without question.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Can I just sneak in one real quick one.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: For the quarter, you have cash proceeds from asset sales of $1.8 billion. Can you tell us what is
the asset sales gain in the quarter and breakdown by segment?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. If you look at the, first of all, the proceeds from asset sales, we had a number of asset
sales in the quarter. I mentioned our partial sell down in Iraq. We had a number of sales in the U.S. and in Canada,
additional service stations as we continue to progress that effort. We booked the films divestment on the chemical side.
So a number of things contributed to that $1.8 billion. In terms of an earnings contribution, in the fourth quarter, you
know, that total was about $1 billion all-in in the quarter across all the businesses and you know, that compared to
about $400 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, do you have a breakdown by segment on that $1 billion?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, if you look in the upstream, right about $775 million and the downstream, about
$225 orders of magnitude.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Hi, David. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I couldn't help but ask a question
on natural gas here, given the recent spike that we've seen. I know the volumes for Exxon have been progressively in
decline due to the activity, but I'm just curious, is there a certain pricing level where you may get interested in
re-engaging an activity and I guess tied in with that, I know historically the company doesn't hedge, but with the recent
move we've seen, is that an opportunity to maybe lock in some economics and get more active?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'll hit the last one first and then back up. No, we don't hedge oil and gas prices and I
wouldn't expect that to change here. So...
In terms of natural gas pricing, you know, you have seen some firming here, in the last several weeks, you know, we've
had a very cold winter in the U.S. and the demand for gas in the power gen and heating has been very strong. So we've
seen a fluctuation on the upside for that. But you know, we don't, we don't change our activity levels and investment
plans you know, to any significant extent on short-term price movements in the commodities.
We do have tremendous flexibility in our operations, you know, I think our drill well inventory here in the U.S. is about
50,000 wells so that we can, we certainly have the capability to move our activity around. But again, we don't typically
move dramatically one way or another on a short-term price spike or decline. But do acknowledge that we have seen
some price uptick here recently.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay, fair enough. The second question is on Tanzania. Obviously you've had some really
good success there and from what I gather, it looks like sufficient resources to probably move forward with the
development. So I'm curious, can you give us an idea of timing on potential FID and maybe, what additional resources
you may need to kind of move forward?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. First of all, it all starts with that resource and we have found a very high quality gas
resource out there with the wells that we've drilled so far. I think I mentioned earlier, 17 TCF to 20 TCF gas in place. I
think one of the things that's encouraging is we still have several more prospects on that block that haven't been drilled
yet. And so, we are continuing to drill, we'll drill some more this year. We'll be doing some appraisal drilling and some
more wildcat exploration activity, so that continues to go very well.
In terms of forward planning, you know, we are in the early stages of planning for the development of that block
working on things like site selection. You know, you're probably aware that us and our partner, Statoil have worked
with BG and Ophir to complete an evaluation of potential sites for a common onshore LNG plant and we have made a
recommendation to the government of Tanzania regarding that.
You know, the next step, as you progress, would be moving into early FEED to kind of see what you have there. But
it's a little too early to be talking about any potential FID date at this time. But clearly, as we always do, if you have
what looks to be an excellent resource, you put the human capital on it and get to thinking about development and
optimization. I can assure you, that process is well underway. We'll probably be able to give a little better update in
March as well on that opportunity, but for now, I'd just say, we're moving right along and very pleased with this world
class discovery that we've made.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Thanks, David.

Our next question comes from Arjun Murti with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: Thanks. David just a couple of follow-ups, just first on the natural gas point, I fully appreciate
Exxon classically does not adjust to the short-term price swings. Is it reasonable to think the mid-single-digit declines
you've had will continue for the next several years? Or as you've assessed the XTO in your own resource base between
the Marcellus and Woodford and some of these other areas, do you see greater confidence in the cost and the resources
that the decline rates might be lower or different than you've done say over the last year and a half?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, that's a multipart question and both of those can be independent or work together.
Certainly we have continued to make good progress in terms of productivity, well rates, down spacing, optimizing our
completions and drilling. So, we've been able to kind of make the progress we always thought we would when we
acquired XTO and combined their folks with our folks and looking at some of these things. So that continues to
improve.
It's hard to give an overall decline curve, because as you know, that's a lot of time that depends on well work activity
and work-overs and various other things and a lot of that will be driven by the activity levels, which of course, are
dependent on longer term price outlooks, so, I think, you know, from our perspective, with the resources there, the
opportunities are there, we know all these plays, we know how to produce more gas, and when the market needs the
gas, you know, we'll provide it, but so, it's a market-driven activity and you know, the outcome in terms of production
and reserves and decline will be based on, you know, the outcome of those activities as opposed to any target that we
might set. But we can adjust quickly. We do have the capability to adjust quickly, if the market needs the gas.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: That's great. An unrelated follow-up. You mentioned the partial sell down in West Qurna in
Iraq to 25%. I think a few years ago you also bought some acreage in Kurdistan. Can you provide any update on your
activities there? I think there'd been some question at least at the time as to whether you could pursue activities in
southern Iraq and Kurdistan? So any thoughts on what you're doing in Kurdistan would be helpful.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, if you look at the Kurdistan region in Northern Iraq, I can tell you that we continue to
progress all six of the PSE contracts we have there and meet our commitments. Specifically, we do have drilling
operations underway in one of our blocks. That drilling is ongoing. I don't have any report out for you yet but those
operations are underway. And we continue to do seismic and other operations on our other blocks in preparation for
drilling there.
So, you know, I think in summary, across Iraq, of all our contracts in the north and the south, we continue to meet our
commitments and we continue to progress our operations in all of the areas and you know, I'm pleased to say that all of
them are progressing per the plan and doing quite well.
<Q - Arjun N. Murti>: That's great. Thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thank you. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey Asit. How are you?
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Good, good. Two quick questions. First on asset sales, it looks like the $1.8 billion in the fourth
quarter did not include a portion of Hong Kong Power. Could you update us on the Hong Kong Power sale?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, you're right. That 1.8 did not include any proceeds from the Hong Kong Power sale.
As you are aware, we have reached agreements to divest our interest in those facilities. Those approval efforts are
ongoing and you know, but it's not closed and it won't close for a little while, but, the process is moving along, you
know, and we would expect to close that deal sometime later this year.

<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Okay, and the second one is on PNG LNG. It's very unusual to see a big LNG project coming on
ahead of schedule. My question is what sort of volumetric contribution do we expect in Q4 in the ramp up phase?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I might just add to your comment about how unusual it is to see one of these
mega-projects stay on schedule. I'll also note that we're still on budget. We have not increased the cost outlook on that
project since the outlook we gave over a year ago. So we're on or ahead of schedule and on budget.
I don't have a specific volume outlook for you for the fourth quarter, it's all going to depend on, you know, how we get
this thing ramped up. But, I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think we've been saying, we'd have first deliveries in the
second half and now we've moved that up a little more concrete to the third quarter. And as we progress,
commissioning, you know, we'd be in a better position here in March to maybe give you a little better update in terms
of what to expect, but everything is working well, the drilling, all the commissioning, feeding the gas, the equipment,
and that's why we were able to give a more specific target of the third quarter. But we'll look forward to giving you a
better update here in a month or so.

Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thank you and good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Faisal.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: I wanted to clarify the gain on the asset sale, the $1 billion you said, was that for the year or for
the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, thanks for that follow-up so that we can be clear. The absolute gain in the fourth
quarter was $1 billion and that compares with a gain of about $600 million in the fourth quarter of last year. So we've
had a change to a positive $400 million.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Just on exploration expense, it's sort of been elevated for the last three quarters, and I
understand you know, some of that is coming out of Russia, but can you give us an idea of how this number is
supposed to trend? Because you've gone from roughly you know, $450 million to over $700 million a quarter. And so,
it's tending to have an outsize effect on some of your expenses. Any sort of clarification or sort of guidance in terms of
where that should be would be helpful.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: The biggest driver of the exploration expense, as you noted, it has been our pickup in
activity in Russia and it's in all areas. So, we're talking about all the work that we did this summer in the Kara Sea, the
seismic we've been running, the efforts we have in West Siberia, as well across the northern Black Sea and then over in
Russia.
So we have had a lot of exploration activity in support of what is going to be a very robust drilling program this year
and next year in a number of these areas. So, that is ongoing. It's nothing that we haven't planned or expected as we
came into this year or looked forward to this year. But I don't have an outlook in terms of a forward look. You know,
again, that's one of those areas we'll talk a little bit more about in March. But you know, dry hole expense has been
kind of low this past year, so it hasn't been a big contributor to that. It's been just a lot of work identifying those
drillable prospects and preparing for, again, an active drilling campaign.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thank you, David, appreciate the time.

Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Allen.
<Q - Allen Good>: I wonder if I could press you for a bit more details on the Western Siberia tight oil campaign,
whether it be maybe the rig counts or planned wells for 2014 and maybe even what you anticipate production exit rate
in 2014 might be?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, I'd be happy to give you an update. We've got a lot of activity going on, a lot of, a lot
of geotechnical work, seismic work. As I mentioned in the last quarter call, we did have a lot of effort in terms of
entering some old well bores, doing some other activity in the fourth quarter of last year.
As we head into this year, now's the time to move on to a drilling program where we would drill horizontal wells and
see how we can get various areas to produce, you know, one of the things that's really important for us with the size of
our acreage position is to make sure we understand where we are in the play, what are the most prospective areas and it
takes a lot of analysis so you don't waste a lot of money drilling wells.
But we've got a lot of expertise in this area that we acquired from XTO, we're bringing that to full bear along with some
of our only technology that we have. We're looking forward to getting some more wells down this year, testing the
production capability of these areas, but it would certainly be premature to give any indication or thinking about you
know, exit rates or production rates, because we're early on in this analysis and again, it's a very huge resource
opportunity in front of us and, certainly behooves us to take our time and go about this in a disciplined manner so that
we don't waste a lot of money, while at the same time, you know, finding out what this very exciting play is capable of
doing and this will be a big year for us.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, thanks for that and I know you don't give guidance on asset sales or what you may be
marketing, but earlier this week, I guess one of your peers came out and indicated he's willing to sell a pipeline asset
they own here in the U.S. I'm wondering, presumably you're sitting on a lot of midstream assets that may not
necessarily receive the value that they would in the market, being incorporated within Exxon, given the level of
disclosure and the size of your business. Is there any interest? I know MLP may be out of the question, but any interest
in trying to monetize some of these mid-stream assets or do you think you have more value ultimately through
operating them and then integrating your operations as opposed to selling them?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: You know, it's interesting, if you look back over the last couple of years, so 2011 and
2012, we actually did divest a fairly significant chunk of those mid-stream assets that we had, not only in the U.S., but
elsewhere. And that was a portion of those large asset sale gains that we had and cash flows in those two years.
I can't give any specific outlook or asset, but, as you would expect, we are continuously looking at all of our assets and
including our mid-stream assets, what those values are to us internally and what they might be on the market. And we
test the market occasionally with some of these. So, again, they're not sitting there not getting looked at and evaluated,
but it's all part of a program you know, to look at the entire logistics footprint that we have. I mentioned the Edmonton
rail facility we're building.
So where it's optimal for us, we'll add midstream facilities and where some mid-stream assets that we have are worth
more to somebody else than they are to us, then we'll divest them. No specific outlook or assets, but we are
continuously looking at that entire portfolio.

Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Just a follow-up a little bit on the chemicals business. There've been a few questions already,
but I want to understand the changes you saw in the fourth quarter, and Exxon wasn't particularly unique, we definitely
saw greater competition out there. But as we look forward into 2014, what's going on in terms of new competition,
pricing and all that, let us know how you fall into that or how you would expect 2014 to unfold on the chemical side?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, you know, as I have on a number of other questions, I can't give an outlook today on
any kind of financial parameters for the business. But one of the things we've seen recently, first of all, we'll start here
in the U.S., we continue to take advantage of a very good market there. Demand has picked up a little bit. And of
course, gas cracking is also a very attractive business for us. We've been fortunate in that we've been able to run our
facilities along the Gulf Coast flat out here over the last quarter and therefore, make the production you know, we need
meet the market demand.
So those margins in the U.S., remain healthy, demand pick-up a little bit. Export opportunities, also very attractive and
we're maximizing all of that. On the other side of the planet, margins continue to be quite weak in the Asia-Pacific area.
You know, we did have some capacity come on last year and it's typical in our business that there's never a perfect
match between capacity additions and demand growth.
Demand growth tends to be out there for a while and then people put on the facilities and they tend to come on in
chunks and for a while, you'll have supply outstripping demand and we've seen that in a number of areas, a number of
products, particularly in Asia-Pac area. Those have a tendency to balance themselves out over time. We are also seeing
some demand pick-up in China and the rest of the Asia-Pac area and that is helpful.
I mentioned the specialties business, we have seen some weakness there, particularly in Europe, again, both from the
economic situation there, as well additional industry capacity that's come on. I'd characterize it as kind of normal
cyclical business for the chemical industry. Across many years, you've got the U.S. at kind of top of cycle business
conditions today and Europe and Asia-Pacific kind of at bottom of cycle.
That's why we have, over time, invested in each of these places where we can bring some technology or get a feed slate
advantage or logistics advantage in order to be able to supply all of those regions through the business cycle. But most
importantly, be able to take advantage when you get an upside and we're certainly well-positioned to do that with our
facilities. Combine that with the level of integration we have, and you know, it's, if you look overall, it is kind of a
tough market, but we did make almost $4 billion this year in that business and that's pretty strong performance.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Totally agreed, thanks.
And the unrelated question. You mentioned in the press release, the LNG for Alaska. I was just curious. Is there
anything you can do to help us understand more conventional business on North Slope crude and Alaska? You had the
tax change that the government put through up there. We've seen some indications that the other participants in Alaska
are getting a little more active. Just wondered, how does Exxon participate in that? Is it basically along with the others?
So maybe there is a little bit of growth coming from Alaska in the near future or if it's, you're waiting for something
larger, like the more offshore drilling that looks like it continues to slip out to the future?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: What we have seen across the business up there is pretty much what you'd expect. Lower
taxes have led to folks to take another look at their investment opportunities. And investments that were not viable
under the old regime could very well be viable under the new regime, so you have seen some activity up there.
As you know, we, we are a large participant owner in Prudhoe Bay. We're not the operator, but any of the growth that
you see there in some of the projects and activity increase that you've seen announced and underway in Prudhoe Bay up
on the North Slope, we'd participate in. And so, obviously, everybody up there is looking at that. And it's still a very
key resource for us. And as opportunities become attractive, of course, with our partners, we'd be willing to invest in

that. So, I think that's pretty straightforward on the North Slope.
If you look at Alaska LNG opportunity for us, as you know it's one of many opportunities we're looking at across the
globe for LNG. We did, as you read in the press, have a heads of agreement here recently, another very positive
milestone. It sets guiding principles, terms and conditions to progress the work on the project and so you know, we are
continuing to progress that.
We have, after a long evaluation process, looking at locations, we have identified an industrial site near Nikiski as a
lead site for the potential plant and terminal. We're looking at other sites, but I think the message is that's potentially a
very large, very complex project. So, all of the stakeholders are progressing the analysis and looking at that project in
due course. And we, of course, are a big part of that.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Thank you
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
<Q - Robert A. Kessler>: Good morning. I see you've finalized the Canadian rail terminal project plans. Can you tell
us what the total CapEx will be for that 250,000 barrel a day facility? And then, how do you think about it more
strategically? I know, at least to me, Exxon seems more like a vertical integration player where you see an opportunity
in your downstream and you set up a midstream opportunity here to really integrate. But, others seem to be using rail as
more of an optionality. If the spreads get a certain distance and other transport routes are not available, you use them
kind of opportunistically. So, can you tell me how you're thinking about the expected utilization rates at that facility? Is
it more of a base run near 100% or are you leaving it out there as an option?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah. Let me hit the first part of your question first. We'd expect the all in capital costs for
that JV to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 million, to $250 million. That's a 50/50 joint venture so we have
got about half of that.
The terminal will have – the max capacity could be upwards of 250,000 barrels a day. Out of that, we're looking at
utilizing initially about 100,000 barrels a day to move our expanded production into the market. With the growing
production of Western Canadian crudes, both heavy crudes and oil sands, it's prudent to be working on all those
logistics opportunities so that you do get a lot of optionality, as you mentioned, but also, the flexibility to be able to
better pinpoint the destination of some of your crudes as various regional opportunities present themselves.
So, we're taking full advantage of all the pipeline opportunities that are out there and working on that, other modes of
transportation by water are also being utilized and then, again, as is prudent, we're looking at the railcar option. So, it's
all about optionality, flexibility and being able to take advantage of spreads and opportunities to maximize the overall
value and we've been working on that for quite a while.
The other thing, having the flexibility on the transportation piece is, it really helps us on both the integration with our
own refining circuit, as well as having the opportunity and viability to make third party sales. The more options you
have and the more flexibility you have, the better off you are to divert production to areas different than what you
might've originally planned. We're taking all of that into consideration.
<Q - Robert A. Kessler>: Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification.

Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Hey, guys. Just one from me and this is a high level question. On the day that the Senate
Energy Committee is debating crude oil export policy, I know that Exxon's perspective on this is going to be closely

watched, so any thoughts on the issue and where the company stands?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, I'd be happy to talk about that. It's a topical subject. First of all, our response is
principle based, as you would probably guess. And, as a company, we fully support free markets, free trade. We oppose
any barriers or restrictions to free trade and open investment across the value chain in the energy sector. Over time, I
think it's pretty clear that barriers to free trade can actually lead to higher prices, dampen economic growth and
prosperity and in this case, could potentially harm energy security by limiting the diversity of supplies.
So, trade is good, free trade is the best way to maximize the economic value of any enterprise, including an oil and gas
enterprise. Generates the most jobs, generates the most revenue to the taxing authorities. And so, across the business,
that's what we support and we would not advocate putting any restrictions at any point along a manufacturing value
chain, even if it might benefit some part of our business.
In addition to crude oil, we strongly support unrestricted LNG exports, even though we are a very large petrochemical
company and consume a lot of petrochemical feedstocks. So, the bottom line, big supporters of free markets and free
trade, level playing field for all competitors, and then let the market do what it does best.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: All right, appreciate it, guys.

Our next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
<Q - Biraj Borkhataria>: Hi, David. Thanks for taking my question. I have two, if I may, firstly on LNG, you touched
on it a couple of times in the call. I wondered if you could talk through your options to expand in this growth area
outside of Tanzania and PNG.
And secondly, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about your thought process when setting dividends. You obviously
have a very strong balance sheet and the highest returns in the industry and you could afford a significantly higher
dividend. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about that.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me start with LNG, because we're very pleased to have a broad opportunity set in
front of us. In addition to Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tanzania, as you mentioned we have a very attractive
opportunity in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we already have a very large regas facility, so a lot of that investment is
already on the ground. And, we have an opportunity to add liquefaction capacity there. One of the things that makes
our project unique is we also have regas capacity available in Europe from some investments that we made in prior
years. So, we have the opportunity to simply add liquefaction capacity on the front end, and then, export that LNG and
take advantage of a number of opportunities, not least of which is capacity we have to regasify in Europe.
We have received a permit for Free Trade Agreement countries and we have had a permit application in for some time
for non-free trade agreements, and that continues to be a nice opportunity.
We also are looking at the possibility or viability of LNG exports out of British Columbia in Canada. We have a very
large resource base in Western Canada, of natural gas, and we do have efforts underway and are progressing. In fact,
we just received a permit approval for a potential – up to 30 MTA facility in Western Canada. And we're working on
site selection and other things there. Then, of course, Alaska, which we just mentioned a minute ago. Huge resource, a
great opportunity, but, again, like the other projects, very high capital cost, very complex. It'll be extremely important
to have attractive, stable fiscal terms, as it is in any area. But, that's also an opportunity for us.
So, again, it's all about having a broad balanced portfolio of opportunities so that you can select those that are the most
attractive but, you don't find yourself in a position where you have to do something that's not attractive and our LNG
opportunity set certainly fits that case.
In terms of dividends, we have been pretty briskly increasing the dividend over the last few years. We had a fairly
significant dividend increase, I think it was about 20% or so, in 2012, another 11% increase this past year. It extends a

very long period of time that we've been increasing dividends, so I think we've been responsive in that area.
In terms of going forward, I wouldn't expect any change to our overall philosophy with regards to the dividend. We do
expect to pay a consistent dividend that grows over time. Obviously, we're able to do that given the strong cash flows
the business generates and our strong financial capacity. So, don't have any outlook or guidance or anything other than
to say that I would expect our philosophy going forward to be the same as it has been historically.
<Q - Biraj Borkhataria>: Perfect. Thank you.
