Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to report another very strong quarter with record revenues and earnings per share, driven by
broad-based demand for our 3G and multimode 3G/4G chipsets. In QCT, we shipped a record 225 million MSM
chipsets, well ahead of expectations, driven primarily by strength in emerging regions. We continue to benefit from our
tiered road map and diversified customer base, as revenues in MSM chip shipments were up 17% and 31%
year-over-year respectively.
Total 3G/4G device demand in the March quarter was stronger than our expectations; however, QTL total reported
device sales and revenues were down from our prior guidance expectation as a result of a dispute with a licensee,
underreporting by certain licensees in China and sales of certain unlicensed devices in China. Derek will discuss this
more fully, including the actions we are taking to address this situation. We will also give a brief update on the ongoing
NDRC investigation.
We began the year with several key objectives. First, we set out to compete effectively across all tiers in the LTE
rollout in China while driving the modem and AP roadmap to maintain our competitive lead. Second, we developed
plans to focus our investment on adjacent opportunities that adopt our core technologies as well as technologies that
address the 1000x data challenge and drive IOE adoption. Third, we set challenging OpEx targets to achieve greater
operating leverage from our scale. And finally, we committed to materially increase our return of capital. As I will
explain further, I'm very pleased with our results to date on all of these elements.
I will begin with the operational front where we are executing against our initiatives to drive productivity. We remain
committed to exiting our fiscal year at an overall operating expense run rate lower than our exit from last year. Our
team is executing to this while making critical investments in our roadmap and supply chain initiatives.
We also continue to make progress on our efforts to focus our new business initiatives across the company. As part of
that effort, we are accelerating our transition from the current generation Mirasol display technology to the licensing of
the next generation, with a focus on wearable devices. However, we will continue to make and sell the current
generation Mirasol displays to support certain existing customer requirements.
As a result of this new plan, we expect to significantly lower spend in our QMT division in fiscal 2015, providing an
expected annualized savings of more than $125 million. The actions related to these changes resulted in an impairment
to the QMT business this quarter, which George will cover in more detail.
Adding to our portfolio of important technologies, we recently completed a few noteworthy acquisitions. First, we
acquired Wilocity, a leader in the development of 60 gigahertz chipsets based on the IEEE 802.11ad standard, also
known as WiGig. We have been working closely with this team for many years and see this technology as important to
the new high bandwidth use cases we expect. The Black Sand acquisition supplements our RF team and expands our
RF360 roadmap. And finally, we acquired leading digital still camera technology from CSR, which further enhances
our differentiation in the important area of image processing.

On the product front, the first device based on our Snapdragon 805 and fourth generation multimode 3G/4G modem
was launched, the Samsung Galaxy S5 broadband LTE A. The Snapdragon 805 processor is the first mobile processor
to offer system level Ultra HD support, 4K video capture and play back, and when coupled with our industry-leading
Gobi modems, enables users to stream and watch 4K content over LTE. The fourth generation Qualcomm Gobi 9X35
is the first 3G LTE modem to commercially ship in smartphones that supports global carrier aggregation deployments
of up to 40 megahertz with both LTE TDD and FDD Category 6.
QCT has seen very strong design traction across its tiers with the emerging China customers. It is worth noting that our
success to date in China is based on chipsets that were launched last year, and we are on track this quarter to
commercialize our new low cost architecture with our Snapdragon 410. We believe the launch of Snapdragon 410 and
our follow-on LTE chipsets raise the competitive benchmark and improve product cost.
With our Wi-Fi and RF360 solutions, we continue to pursue growing our share of content in devices. Both product
lines continue to ramp, with our overall Wi-Fi unit volumes on track to grow more than 40% this fiscal year, as our
attach rate in mobile continues to grow significantly.
We now have over 100 devices launched or in design incorporating RF360, including the first launch of a device to
feature the Envelope Tracker, antenna tuner and power amplifier. Looking forward, the continued rollout and growth of
multimode 3G LTE is a significant opportunity for the company. According to the GSA, 300 operators have deployed
LTE and more than 200 more have committed to deploy LTE.
In addition, over 55 operators have or are planning to deploy LTE Advanced services, including carrier aggregation.
We are now positioned to help enable this opportunity with our LTE leadership position, including chipsets across
multiple product tiers, and we expect to launch the Snapdragon 810, the world's first premium tier integrated SOC with
Category 6 for smartphones later this calendar year.
To date, over 2,000 multimode 3G LTE devices have now either been launched or are in design based on our chipset
solutions. The LTE feature set continues to evolve with features such as LTE Broadcast and LTE Direct. LTE
Broadcast has been commercialized in Korea and has been demonstrated in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. We have
also announced an LTE Direct trial in Germany in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom.
Although still early in the adoption cycle, opportunities in the automotive, healthcare and wearable segments are taking
shape. Our automobile pipeline continues to add OEMs and design wins. Our leadership in LTE is an advantage in this
segment as it moves from 3G to multimode LTE, and this quarter we saw General Motors launch OnStar LTE. In
addition, new Android Wear devices were recently announced and Snapdragon 400 is enabling devices offered by
Samsung and LG. Adjacent opportunities allow us to build off our core investments into new growth segments. We
expect to see an increasing impact of this over time.
In closing, we are making substantial progress on the key objectives we set for the company. We delivered a record
quarter and see significant opportunities ahead. Our portfolio of multimode 3G LTE chipsets has strong design traction
which positions us well, and we are working hard to address the near-term challenges in our licensing business.
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Qualcomm's President, Derek Aberle.
Derek K. Aberle
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.
We continue to see healthy end user device demand spurred by, among other things, the transition to 3G LTE in China.
In fact, we now believe 3G/4G device demand, excluding TD-SCDMA GSM devices for calendar 2014 will be at the
high end of the 1.22 billion to 1.3 billion device range that we provided last quarter, reflecting strength in both
developed and emerging regions.
Turning to China, China Mobile has launched LTE service in over 300 cities, with over 300 LTE device models and
has seen increased data usage and ARPU from its LTE subscribers. In addition, LTE FDD trial licenses have now been

granted to both China Unicom and China Telecom. Both operators are launching hybrid LTE TDD and FDD trial
networks in 16 cities. We expect those trials to expand to additional cities throughout the year. We are working closely
with the operators to help them optimize their networks and our chipset solutions which support both the TDD and
FDD modes of LTE, provide the mode, band and hand-off combinations they require for their 3G and LTE networks.
As Steve mentioned, we continue to have strong LTE chipset design momentum with manufacturers in China and we
are seeing significant demand for our multimode 3G LTE chipsets. Here in the U.S., we have also seen positive trends
as a result of competition amongst the carriers. In addition, promotions tied in to the World Cup have shown success in
Latin America, and we have seen positive 2G to 3G migration trends in Southeast Asia as well.
Despite this healthy 3G/4G device demand environment, we have reduced our financial outlook for QTL for this fiscal
year to reflect some challenges in China that could prevent us from collecting royalties in the near-term on the full
3G/4G device demand. First we have a dispute with a licensee that is that has a resulted in that portion of that licensee's
shipment activity being excluded from our fiscal third quarter results and fiscal fourth quarter outlook. Like other
disputes we have had in the past, we expect to resolve this situation and are in active discussions with this licensee.
However, the timing of a potential resolution is uncertain.
Second, as we have previously said, the timing of the LTE launches in China as well as device composition at China
Mobile has been a bit difficult to forecast. Although we have signed more than 70 single mode LTE licenses with
Chinese OEMs, we still need to sign agreements with a number of other Chinese OEMs in order to be able to collect
royalties on all three-mode devices in China. Given the time it will take to complete the remaining single mode LTE
licenses in China, we expect to experience a delay in the timing of our collection of royalties on these devices.
Third, we recently have seen an increase in sales of lower tier 3G connected tablets by a number of Chinese OEMs, and
we expect sales of these devices to continue to grow. This is a positive sign for 3G/4G attach rates in tablets, but the
tablet OEMs are largely not the same companies that have been supplying handsets in China and therefore in most
cases they are not currently licensed. We are in the process of negotiating licenses with this new base of potential
licensees, but those discussions will take some time to complete.
Fourth, we believe that some of our Chinese licensees are underreporting and may continue to underreport a portion of
their 3G/4G device sales. As we have explained in the past, we have a robust and active compliance program in [audio
gap] (13:44) a priority for the business going forward. We are taking steps to confirm the underreporting and to work
with the licensees to resolve the issues.
In summary, primarily as a result of these four items, our revised QTL fiscal year outlook reflects a reduction of
approximately 8% in total reported device sales for the second half of fiscal 2014. The timing of the resolution of these
items is uncertain, and we will update you on our progress next quarter.
For the calendar year 2014 3G/4G device forecast, we now expect the total unit demand will be at the high end of our
prior unit estimate or approximately 1.3 billion devices. However, we currently expect that QTL will not participate
near-term in the full device demand based on the four items we just explained.
We now expect that between 1.04 billion and 1.13 billion 3G/4G devices will be reported to us for sales during
calendar 2014. We estimate the impact from these four items on total reported device sales on a percentage basis to be
between 6% and 9% for calendar year 2014. The percentage reduction in units is greater than in total reported device
sales because the units are expected to be lower priced devices.
Although we have these near-term challenges, we continue to expect to collect royalties on all LTE devices globally,
including three-mode devices sold in China, and have executed more than 110 single mode LTE licenses in addition to
our more than 260 3G licenses which cover multimode 3G/4G devices. We have had disputes in the past and have a
good track record of successfully resolving those disputes. It is also not uncommon for a licensor to experience some
delays in collecting royalties while they negotiate license agreements covering new entrants or new products. Finally,
we are closely monitoring and in discussions with companies that we believe are underreporting or operating without a
license, consistent with our long-standing compliance activities around the world.

Let me now move on to discuss the status of the investigation in China. As previously disclosed, the China National
Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, is conducting an anti-monopoly investigation of certain aspects
of the company's business, primarily the company's licensing business and certain interactions between the company's
licensing business and our chipset business. We have met with and are continuing to fully cooperate with the NDRC as
it conducts its investigation but the timing and outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, as does the impact on our
future business in China.
That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, George Davis.
George S. Davis
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone.
We are pleased to be reporting strong operating and financial results this quarter, primarily driven by record QCT
performance. Fiscal third quarter revenues were a record $6.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating income of $2.43 billion was up 19% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44
was up 40% year-over-year and up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 above
the midpoint of our guidance range.
Our results included a $164 million charge, or $0.08 per share, related to the transition of our Mirasol business, as well
as a $208 million gain, or $0.12 per share, for a reversal of expenses related to the favorable ruling in the ParkerVision
litigation. Excluding these two items, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.40, $0.20 above the midpoint
of our prior guidance range.
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $58.1 billion, and we estimate that 250 million to 254 million
3G/4G-based devices were reported by our licensees for the March quarter at an average selling price of $228 to $234,
up approximately $7 sequentially at the midpoint. QTL's ASP in the fiscal third quarter reflected strength in mid to
high tier devices, as well as the absence of lower ASP devices associated with the licensing challenges summarized by
Derek.
In QCT, revenues, earnings before tax and MSM shipments were all quarterly records as demands strongly exceeded
our prior expectations. QCT shipped 225 million MSMs, 12 million units above the high end of our prior guidance
range, primarily driven by shipments to Chinese manufacturers for 3G and 3G LTE devices. Implied revenue per MSM
was approximately $22, slightly lower sequentially on the mix of demand. QCT operating margin was 23%, also above
our prior expectations, reflecting the stronger than expected MSM demand as well as some favorable impact as a result
of the ParkerVision ruling.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 7% sequentially, in line with our prior expectations. Investment
income was strong this quarter, adding $0.06 in EPS relative to our prior guidance. Strength in the financial markets
and changes in asset allocation to lower long-term risk in certain of our investment portfolios drove this contribution.
Looking ahead, we forecast fiscal fourth quarter investment income to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million,
which is down sequentially on lower realized gains. Cash flow from operations was strong at 39% of revenues, and we
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $32.7 billion. During the quarter, we returned almost $2.1
billion to stockholders, including approximately $700 million in dividends and $1.35 billion in stock repurchases. At
the end of the quarter, we had approximately $6.5 billion remaining on our buyback authorization. Our non-GAAP tax
rate was 13%, and lower than expected on business mix and the effects of the ParkerVision reversal.
Now turning to our guidance. We are updating our financial forecast for fiscal 2014 to reflect our fiscal third quarter
results and increased outlook for QCT, partially offset by our lower estimates for QTL. We estimate fiscal 2014
revenues to be in the range of approximately $26.3 billion to $27.2 billion, up approximately 8% year-over-year and
unchanged at the midpoint from our prior guidance. We expect fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the
range of $5.21 to $5.36, up approximately 17% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $0.14 per share from our
previous guidance midpoint on the strength of our fiscal third quarter.

We are increasing our estimate for the reported fiscal 2014 QTL average selling price to approximately $222 to $228
which is $2 above our prior $223 estimate at the midpoint, again, reflecting the absence of the mix impact of
underreported and disputed devices. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately
5% to 6% year-over-year and, as Steve indicated, we are still on track to exit the fiscal year below the run rate at the
end of the last fiscal year.
Turning to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate our revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.5 million to $7.4
billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fourth
fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.20 to $1.35 per share, up approximately 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We
anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be between 2% lower and flat
sequentially.
In QTL, we forecast total reported device sales of $53 billion to $59 billion, down approximately 4% sequentially at the
midpoint, reflecting the uncertain timing of potential resolution of the licensing matters.
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 230 million to 245 million units during the September
quarter, reflecting continued strong demand across all tiers with particular strength in low and mid-tier chip sets for
Chinese OEMs. We expect QCT operating margin to exit the fiscal year above 20% as previously forecasted as a result
of solid execution on spending and supply chain initiatives. We continue to expect 3G/4G channel inventory to remain
within the normal 11 to 16-week range through this calendar year, with China related inventory increasing on LTE
channel fill.
That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Great. Thank you. Derek, just going back, if you take the midpoint of the units now excluded
roughly 215 million units, can you help us maybe break it down between the four reasons you gave for excluding those
units, and is the one licensee dispute, is that a meaningful piece of that 215 million excluded now from your outlook?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Sure, Mike. Yeah, it's a little bit hard, you know, we have a pretty wide range on the units
because of the uncertainty of the timing of the resolutions, and they're all kind of different in kind. But the licensee
dispute is a meaningful contributor to that number during this timeframe, and of course if that particular licensee were
to gain more share or lose share, that could impact the estimate that we have at this time. But, they're all meaningful
contributors to the numbers that we put out for the year.

Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.

about the complexion of some of these customers and what Qualcomm can do. Do some of them sell outside of China

where you might have a little bit more leverage? Are they chipset customers where maybe you also have some leverage
on the supply side? And then related to that, do you – are you concerned about this spreading maybe to some of the
other Chinese?
And also there's been some stories about some Google initiatives in India with a few handset companies that are not
Qualcomm licensees. So maybe can you just talk a little bit about this as potentially being a broader issue than just
these OEMs in China? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Sure. Tim, this is Derek. Yeah, again, there are kind of multiple factors here so let me try to
break them down. On the dispute, I think that's something that we've we have had a – we've had several of these in the
past, as you know, over the years, and our typical process is to try to engage with the licensee, and see if we can resolve
it through negotiation, which we usually are pretty successful at. And then when that doesn't work, things need to take a
different course, and even in that route, we've, I think, had a history of pretty successful results there.
On the other OEMs, so it's really a mixed bag. In the white box or the lower end tablet space, it's really a set of kind of
a new set of suppliers that, at least today, are, I think, primarily focused in China and then maybe some of the other
emerging regions. And much like the mid to smaller size companies in China in the past, we have had a lot of success
in getting those companies to sign licenses over time. It's really just a timing question, I think, in my mind, because
we're, you know, kind of at the outset of this growth in a new segment and its new suppliers so it's going to take some
time to get those licenses in place. The same is really true for, you know, for the three mode volume, I think it's, from
our perspective, more of a timing question in terms of getting the remaining licenses in place.
And then around the under-reporting, it is, again, we are at the pretty early stages of trying to confirm sort of the extent
of this and engage directly with the OEMs in China, but our typical process is, you know, we will – we will uncover
something and then we will work with the licensee through the compliance and also an audit process which takes some
time to try to get what we believe is a compliance situation. And when that doesn't work, obviously we have different
mechanisms we can pursue under the agreements themselves. So I think it's, you know, again, I think we have a
number of avenues available to us which have proven successful in the past, and we just have with a little bit of more
uncertainty right now in China, we have a period where we need to push these things and it's going to take a little time.
In terms of things spreading, I'm actually – my sense is that the units that are supplied even into the local brands in
India are really supplied primarily today out of China. And so it would be sort of a similar set of suppliers as we have
discussions with for supply in China and the other emerging regions. In other words, it's not a new set of suppliers
cropping up in India that aren't supplied elsewhere from the licensee base.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah, guys. So let's do a little bit of math. So we're talking about 215 million units for the year
that are essentially you're dealing with this licensing collection issue. Approximately?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Approximately. That's the midpoint of the range that we gave.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: All right.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, Brian, from a TRDS standpoint, though, the range is more like 6% to 9%. So it's about
half the percentage effect that the units would imply.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Okay. And then if these are lower end products, you're probably looking at royalties on an ASP
of say $100 or maybe even lower depending on what the product is. Is that correct?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: I mean, these are lower, yeah, these are lower priced devices that we believe are kind of in
this bucket generally.

<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: A question for Derek again. Not surprisingly today, Derek, I guess I'm trying to
understand how this whole thing came about and what I'm getting at is you mentioned the whole thing about connected
tablets taking off. Were you previously assuming in your guidance you would license them and now you can't? I'm
surprised you even included that I guess is my point.
And then the additional thing I was just thinking is in terms of the same thing applies to new licensees you were
targeting but you weren't able to close them. I'm surprised that caused you to revise your estimates down. That would
be an incremental upside if it ever occurred. And so what I'm getting at, is it just a – is the main driver this major
licensee that's not reporting – not paying you now and the under-reporting generically by everyone? Because a $200
million number out of the Chinese market is a really big number out of that market, frankly. And so I'm trying to
understand how this kind of came about and why suddenly it hit you now or were there warning indicators for the last
six months about this? Any kind of context around that would be helpful.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Okay, Kulbinder, this is Derek. Let me try to break that down a little bit. So first of all, the
$250 million is the midpoint of, as I said, a relatively wide range. And the reason we gave a relatively wide range is just
because the number of factors involved and the uncertainty around the timing of each one of those potential resolutions.
The dispute that we have with the licensee, as I said, is a significant contributor to these units. It's not all of their units.
We have a dispute around some of them. And frankly, I don't think it's a question of whether they're going to end up
paying royalties, it's just a question of the timing of trying to resolve it and what that resolution will look like. On the
white box tablets, we've been monitoring that. We've been in discussions with a number of those companies. Frankly,
just the acceleration of the growth that we expect to see over this period is faster now than we expected a few months
ago or even before that. And that is a contributor but I'm not going to suggest that that's the largest contributor of the
units. It's just a piece of it.
On the under-reporting, again, if you think back through calendar 2013 as we've been monitoring this and I know
you've asked questions about this periodically, we've been really on top of the compliance aspects in China. And really
isn't – the first time we're really seeing a meaningful impact of this is in the current quarter that we're reporting. And it's
really a relatively recent phenomenon, and part of it is really just trying to understand where this will go in terms of a
trend. And we've provided a relatively wide range on that for that reason.
Again, the typical process is when we notice things that look suspicious, we will engage with the licensees quickly and
then usually move to an audit process, which takes some time to get the data and then work through the issues. But
once we get through that process, we're able to typically get a resolution.
So again, I think there's just a number of factors that came together at the same time. Obviously we're also seeing a
ramp in the LTE volumes from China Mobile, which is a good market phenomena, but there given some of the
uncertainty there right now and the discussions around the LTE licenses, although they've been ongoing and we've been
progressing and increasing the numbers, has been a little slower than we had anticipated. So it's taking longer now to
get to some of these agreements. And so we believe we will get there, it's just a question of timing, and it's just
uncertain in terms of when that will be.

question.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to see if you can give us a little bit of color, Derek, on of
the 70 licensees you have in China, what percent of the total volumes in China do those cover? And then is there a
distinction in terms of your collection of Chinese made devices that are sold in China versus those that are sold

overseas?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, it's really hard for us to pinpoint a – or give a range even for the percentage of the units
that will be supplied over the calendar year where we're giving these projections from the licensee base that are
currently licensed for LTE. There are significant companies in the group of companies that have signed licenses for
three-mode devices and LTE generally, but there are a number of other meaningful suppliers in China that haven't yet
signed up, which is why you're seeing the impact; and those negotiations are continuing and I suspect will get
concluded it's just a question of when they will be concluded.

Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I appreciate it. Well actually sorry about that. I was messing up my
phone. Thank you. A couple of questions, again trying to get this straight. First of all, on the NDRC, could a possible
conclusion of that investigation be something that relates to the royalty rates that you will end up having with your
licensees in China? Or is that completely separate and the negotiations you do with the licensees, that will – and the
royalty rates that come out of that will be totally separate from what the NDRC conclusion is?
And then again just to understand a few other specific things, I just want to confirm that the dispute that you're having
is with a Chinese vendor and that it is with handsets, as Simona said before, both that they sell within China as well as
ones that they sell outside of China because going back to some of the other questions, we can't get to a player large
enough in China to be a significant player of the – of that 215 million if we only consider their Chinese handsets. So
just trying to get a frame of that.
And if I could sneak one more in, these vendors who are not paying – or who are either under-reporting or not paying
you now, are these ones that were licensed in the past and therefore had paid you in the past and are not now? Or are
these new vendors that had never paid you? Sorry for all the questions.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, okay. A little hard to – hopefully I got all of them scribbled down there. So, Ehud, I
think here on the NDRC, I think we've made a pretty robust – not a pretty robust, a very robust disclosure in our 10-Q
in terms of the range of potential outcomes that could come out of a decision from the NDRC, and so at this point we're
continuing to fully cooperate, as I said, and try to work through this but we can't comment specifically on what – what
any particular outcome may be from that – from that proceeding. In parallel, we are in negotiations with a number of
licensees, as is typical for the business, and there's a little bit, I would say a little bit of a more complication or a little
bit slower pace of those negotiations given the backdrop of the investigation which is having some amount of impact.
As to the units kind of inside versus outside China, yeah the 215 million midpoint or the overall range would not
necessarily be limited to sales – in fact, likely is not limited to sales just for China. You know a number of these
suppliers, as you know, supply worldwide, and so really it's a phenomena that's right now we believe unique to Chinese
OEMs.
And as to the ones that are – that we believe are under-reporting, it's not a question of companies that have stopped
paying or reporting entirely. I think it's just as we look at the market data that's available to us, which is a very
extensive process we have, we now believe that there is a gap between what we expected to be reported to us and what
actually was reported to us in the third quarter and what we expect for the fourth quarter and for the remainder of the
calendar year, unless and until we can get resolution on some of these issues.
So it's really companies that are under agreement and the typical process I outlined before is to go through sort of the
compliance discussion which has started already and then from there if it's not resolved, we move to audits, and if
ultimately if that's unsuccessful, we have other mechanisms to pursue it under the contracts themselves that they've
signed.

Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thanks a lot. Just a quick follow-up to that then, Derek. I think you mentioned that you felt
like some of the negotiations with potential new licensees were being impacted by the NDRC investigation, et cetera.
Do you feel like that some of the compliance issues with existing licensees are also being impacted by that same
investigation? And then just a quick question maybe for Steve, on the overall market for chips into China and the
emerging markets is that clearly you're seeing good success, and that's evidenced by the large volumes you shipped last
quarter, but just wondering how you're feeling about the competitive environment and anything that you need to do
from a pricing or promotion standpoint to continue to take share that you'd like to in those developing markets?
Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Sure, James. This is Derek. Yeah, I mean it's clear to us that the investigation, among other
things, is creating an increased level of uncertainty, I think, with the licensee base in China right now. I guess the way I
would answer that is we believe the investigation will be resolved at some point. We're working hard to try to see that
through. And once that is resolved, I do believe some of the challenges we've had in the near-term will become easier.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And, James, this is Steve. With regards to your questions about chips, it's been an area
of strength for us actually, shipping chips into the Chinese customer base. Not all of those, by the way, are being sold in
China as well. We've had actually some strength in the 3G portfolio over the last quarter for devices headed to Latin
America and the rest of the world. So I think it's, in general, been a very strong picture, and I would say we feel very
good about where we sit competitively. And I think if you look at kind of the guide, it's consistent with that view.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah, guys. Where I was going with that line of questioning earlier was if you assume 215
million units and you assume probably an ASP of around probably $100, given this is China, and a 3% royalty rate,
we're talking about say 645 million, 650 million of revenues in royalties and you pull back over time once these
disputes get settled. Is that kind of a good way to look at it?
And then the second question for you, Steve, you're doing a lot of work around you've got 28-nanometer RF getting
ready to start shipping in October, you've got a ton of 14-nanometer tape-outs occurring with Samsung. Can you talk a
little bit about how some of these advances you're doing on the substrate side will help you from an economies of scale
and margin standpoint against the competitors as you push forward aggressively into these areas? Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Hey, Brian. This is George. I'll take a shot at the sizing issue. I think your basic math is, in
general, right. The way I would look at it in terms of these are lower priced devices on average, less than 50% of the
average for the overall ASP for the company that we report. And I think one of the things you can do is, this is a very
strong year relative to our expectations on the QCT side for the year. Now, we talked last quarter about there being a bit
of a lag just because of the timing of the ramp in QCT that QTL wouldn't fully participate this year, all things being
equal, but it was really good momentum going into 2015, so I think if you look at the – if you want to try to size the
impact, I think you would have started to see this impact more fully realized in the third quarter calendar quarter, fourth
calendar quarter.
And if you look at what the year-over-year looks like there, we're down about 3% year-over-year on QCT. This quarter
it widens out a little bit. Next quarter, basically – QTL, excuse me, not QCT. Obviously QCT was up significantly year
over year. So I think you can size it. We would have expected and expect this when this is resolved that this will be
strong momentum for QTL as well.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And, Brian, on your question about the substrates and different technologies that we're
going through, there are a couple of things I think. One is it has clearly been an advantage to have the scale that we

have and to have that scale across multiple foundries. It has helped us with supply. It's helped with us pricing. It's
helped us with a number of items. And then I think probably the most important thing is from a design perspective,
your ability to go to advanced nodes and to integrate a number of different technologies onto the same dye, and
increasing those technologies are RF technologies, that's been a competitive advantage for us. And we think it's going
to continue to be a competitive advantage moving forward.
So we continue to push that. That's one of the things that I mentioned in my script that we were pleased that we're able
to even execute on that strategy while cutting back on the OpEx as well. So it's – we feel like we're positioned well
from the product perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, 250 million, 215
million units out of your forecast seems too big to me to be strictly a 4G in China situation. So can you give us some
feeling for, I suspect this is beyond 4G, this is 3G as well. So do you actually have 3G licensees that were paying who
are now underreporting, is this leaking out?
Secondly, on the NDRC, I know in your Q you talked about there would be likely a probable impact, but you're – a
financial impact, but you're unable to size it at this point. Can you talk about what some of the possibilities are,
anywhere from a fine to business model transitions? Is there a possibility that there could be an adverse change to your
business in China? And if there is, how do you stop that adverse change from leaking out of China into the rest of your
regions and impacting your royalty business overall?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Stacy, this is Derek. Yeah, so on the 215 million midpoint, again from the TRDS impact, you
know, you will see significantly less than that. The reason I tried to kind of break it down into four different buckets is
because the underreporting bucket that you mentioned that we believe is going on right now is broader than just the
LTE. It would include 3G volumes as well. And so that's when we look at the market in terms of both China and
devices flowing outside of China to other parts of the world, that's encompassing a broader technology set than just 4G.
On the NDRC, really, I don't think I can say much more than I said in response to a prior question, other than yes, we
did change the disclosure to indicate that we believed some loss would be probable, but given the many factors that are
involved there, we're really not in a position to be able to estimate what that might look like. We just believe whatever
the resolution may be will likely include some form of payment.

Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Thanks. A couple. Derek, first on this NDRC investigation, should we expect some resolution
this year? Or should we be bracing for this thing to spill into 2015?
The other question I had was just on the strength in MSM this quarter you mentioned emerging. Can you talk a little bit
about how your Tier 1 customers influenced the performance here in June and your outlook for September? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: So this is Derek. I'll take the first one. Yeah. Again, it's pretty difficult to determine timing on
the NDRC resolution. As I've said in the past, we're – this is obviously a large priority for the company to resolve it,
and we're cooperating and actively engaged with the NDRC to try to get it resolved as expeditiously as possible.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And on the second question, you know I think this last quarter we really benefited from
our diversified customer base and our strength across tiers, and that continues to be something that we think will be a
good part of the business. What we are seeing in China, and I think most people probably don't realize all the time, is
that it is very much a multi-tiered market, and we are seeing, you know, strength across the tiers, and then what's really

interesting is that you're seeing a lot of the OEMs in China going international as well, and I think that's helping us on
the chipset business as well.
One other thing that I wanted to mention and it wasn't in my script is that we will be focusing I think more and more of
our chipset road map and energy on increasing the pace in which we refresh that road map, and I think that will benefit
us as well moving forward in the customer base.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Thanks a lot. I had two. First, Derek, of the 215 million units, can you somehow put those into
each of the four buckets, the dispute, the tablets, the three mode and then the underreporting?
And then a question for George. George, I'm trying to get the pro forma op margin for QCT. It looks like it's about
19%, and if that's right, I'm surprised it wasn't a little better, given the revenue upside, so I wanted you to comment on
that. Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tim, this is Derek. Yeah, again, you know, the 215 is a midpoint of a relatively wide range of
units. And a number of different assumptions in terms of potential outcomes are baked into sort of the high end versus
the low end of that. And so it's really hard to break down the bucketing of that. As I said, I think probably the smallest
contributor in this timeframe would be the tablet space, which shouldn't be surprising, and kind of the other three are all
pretty meaningful contributors.
<A - George S. Davis>: Tim, I'm not sure I followed that. The operating profit percentage that was reported was at
23% for QCT, very strong, certainly above the expectations. We said we're going to exit the year above 20%. If you put
all those together, then – and look at our 18% to 20% range for the year, we're clearly at the high end of that. And I
think that's fully in keeping with our outlook for the year and benefiting a little bit more from the upside in MSM units.

Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi, guys. Before I go to the main question, just a few housekeeping items. Implied royalty rate was
higher than you said last quarter. Last quarter you said it's going to be 3.1% and you reported 3.24%, if you can go over
it. Also the ASPs were higher. Is this just related to the elimination of China in the numbers that were – or part of China
that we're talking here about? Or is it also related to other things? Also, financial expenditures...
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Could you repeat that question? We – I think we're – you got it? Okay. Go ahead.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Sure.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Go ahead.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Should I repeat the question?

<Q - Tal Liani>: It's okay. Half of the outperformance this quarter outside of the revenues was higher financial
income, lower taxes, what's going on there, if you can discuss? So these are all the P&L items.
One question that I have on the issues on the – the licensing issue is what I want to understand is, is it – is it related to
MediaTek not reporting anymore the numbers to you so you have more limited way to audit the numbers that the

vendors are reporting? Or is it more related to new technology and vendors basically making a very broad kind of claim
saying on this kind of technology we're not paying, which is a – there's a difference in the difficulty to convince them to
pay in one scenario versus another. Thanks.
<A - George S. Davis>: Maybe I'll jump on the P&L items first and the implied royalty rate. So I think we're looking
at different numbers. We reported – the reported number would be 3.1% which was right on top of what we had guided.
So if you've got some more questions on that, maybe check in with the IR team, and they can go through the
calculation.
In terms of tax, what you saw is actually last quarter we reached a settlement which lowered our outlook for the tax rate
for the year. We got an additional benefit this quarter as well from the effects of the reversal of the ParkerVision
judgment, and so that was a – it didn't carry tax with it so it had the overall effect of lowering our tax rate.
And as we've been reporting, we are seeing higher investment income on gains in the portfolio. As we have started to
implement higher return of capital, we have had a program to reduce some of the volatility in higher risk assets that are
in our long dated portfolio, just to keep our risk levels in line, and so that's led to gains. And the gains turned out to be a
little bit higher than we thought in the quarter because it's just been such a strong financial market. As we've sold those
down, we've had greater benefit.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Tal, this is Derek. On the ASP for the quarter, I think really the primary driver was the fact
that we got, we had less volume in than we expected at the lower tier devices in China. That's really the primary driver.
On your second question, really the under-reporting, it's not an issue of kind of a new technology issue as you
described it, meaning licensees taking a position that they don't owe royalties on a particular product or technology
under their agreement. We really think it is just as we dig into this, we believe we will find that they're only reporting
something less than 100% of their sales and hoping they're going to be able to get away with it.
And again, we've always been very clear that the effort involved in making sure we collect on everything in China is
significant, and we have a lot of resource in that. And we triangulate a lot of different information, and the information
that we get from MediaTek is one element. And certainly having less information makes things a little more difficult
than having more information, but that, we don't believe, is the primary indicator for what's going on here.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Sue with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you. Gentlemen, historically, when Qualcomm worked and settled with the Korean vendors,
the Japanese or even the European vendors, we've always had a subsequent resolution and subsequent recovery. And
along the way there was a little bit of give or take which then sets a precedent. China just seems like a whole new
animal in terms of the size and the scope, so conceptually, should we think about just kind of the different structural
rate going forward considering that there's a balance of bargaining power that seems to be shifting? And then how do
we kind of containerize what happens in China so that it's not reflected by others as a precedent? And also,
additionally, is there additional OpEx that we should be thinking about in terms of the cost of doing business in China?
Auditing the extra data, for example. Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Yeah, I'm not sure, again, I think the way that we've been handling China is very similar to
the way that we've addressed our licensing program worldwide, very consistent. You are right that I would say the
typical resolution of these things when there's a period of uncertainty and a period of time where amounts are not being
paid to us that we believe are recoverable, that resolution usually carries with it some kind of recovery for past, and I
have no reason to believe wouldn't also be the case with the items that we've outlined.
Again, we look at the compliance activity very carefully, and that's a meaningful part of the program. It has been for
several years. The number of audits that we do has increased pretty much every year, but we do have, I think we do
have a reasonable amount of resource on that and we have that in the plan. I don't see a significant increase in OpEx

that would be needed to address the issues.
Again, our best assessment is that these are near-term challenges that, given the period of uncertainty we have, may
take some time to resolve, but will get resolved, and we'll just have to see how this plays out as we move forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I had a couple. Derek, I wondered if you could
talk a little bit about the likelihood this turns into a collective bargaining situation or if it is already there and if that's
the case, who the negotiator on the other side of the table would be? Would it be a consortium of these companies or
some representative of them? So if you could just kind of talk about how you expect this to play out. Is it a single deal
you do with all of the companies, or do you do individual deals with everybody?
I also, I wanted to go back to the question on the reports that – or the question on the chips and the involvement of the
chips in this. I mean, it seems clear that that 215 million number involves people pulling CDMA royalties from you that
they had already agreed to pay. So why wouldn't chips at some point get involved in this? If the negotiation drags on, is
there any good logical reason why that wouldn't happen? Just be curious to hear that.
And then lastly, given it's – the fun place that China is to do business, we've also got these reports, the government's
talking about limiting high-end marketing spending from the carriers. I wonder if maybe, Steve, since you're there,
could you comment on what's going on with that. Is that a real issue? Is that something that's going to impact high-end
smartphone demand over time? Be interested in some color on that. Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Rod, hey, this is Derek. Let me try to take the first two, and then Steve can cover the last one.
So again, our – we have sort of two things, right. We have – we do have the NDRC investigation ongoing and as we've
said, we're actively engaged with them to try to find a resolution. We don't know exactly what the impact or the
resolution will look like, both looking backwards or looking forward. We're just continuing to try to work that one and
get to a resolution.
Beyond that, we don't anticipate that there will be sort of a need or a movement to collective negotiation with
companies in China. That's not been the practice that we've followed successfully over the last many number of years.
And that continues to be the way that we were operating. We're basically in discussions with individual companies
which – every company has different needs, different business models, et cetera. And so, a collective deal really isn't
typically appropriate in any event. So I expect going forward we'll continue to negotiate like we have in the past,
individually with the various companies and that won't be a change.
On the chip side, I'm not sure I fully understood your question but let me try to answer it as best I can. Certainly if you
look at the magnitude of the number of units that we have, kind of in this range, there are – we do expect that there will
be products in that mix that aren't reported to us for a period of time that could include our chipsets. Our typical
practice when that has happened in the past, is to engage with the licensee and try to work it out and find a resolution
and pursue payment under the license, without an impact on the chip side. And that's what we would plan to do here as
well.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: And, Rod, this is Steve. There have been reports about the level of subsidy changing in
China. I don't know to the degree that we're seeing that reflected in the demand. I mean, if you look at the raw number
of dollars that are actually authorized, it's quite a number. And I would say I would characterize our demand across
tiers to be fairly robust. So I'm not sure we're seeing a downstream impact on that, of that concern.

<Q - Anil Kumar Doradla>: Hey, guys. If I recall, Derek, some time ago you talked about maybe all the licensees not
due until 2017. I think that was a comment you made maybe in a year or a year and a half ago. Can you give us an
update on that from beyond the Chinese guys? And as a follow-up, Broadcom obviously is exiting the baseband
business. They talked about even writing down all of that stuff. What immediate impacts have you seen in your
business with them getting out of baseband? Thanks.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Anil, this is Derek. So I think – straining my memory a little bit, but let me try. Going back
several years ago we did talk about, at one point in time, we had basically five WCDMA licenses that had to get
extended before that timeframe that you mentioned, 2017, 2018. And then we kind of knocked all of those off some
time ago. We haven't really updated that or given color as to whether there are other agreements that need to be
extended beyond that, so that's a little bit of a dated number, and I don't think we're prepared to update that today.
