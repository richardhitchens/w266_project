Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CVS Caremark Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, May 2,
2014.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go

Nancy R. Christal
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm here this morning with Larry Merlo,
President and CEO, who will provide a business update; and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who

and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail business, are also with us today and will participate in the
question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than
one question with a quick follow up so we can provide more callers with a chance to ask their question.
Please note that just before this call we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information
you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance.
Additionally, please note that our quarterly report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will
be available on our website at this time.
During today's presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities
laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ
materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC
filings, including the Risk Factors section and Cautionary Statement disclosure in our most recently filed Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
During this call, we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance,
including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these
non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our
website. And as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call
for one year.
And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We posted solid results in the first
quarter with adjusted earnings per share growing 22.5% to $1.02 per share. Both our PBM and Retail segments
delivered solid operating profit growth despite the impact of a fair amount of unforeseen weather-related issues. And
when combining the weather issues with a higher than anticipated tax rate, the estimated impact to our adjusted
earnings per share versus our expectations was at least $0.03 per share.
Now let me just say that it's unusual to hear us talk about the impact of weather on our business. Historically, it's been
our practice to not blame the weather when we explain our results. But this quarter the amount of severe weather was
so abnormal that, quite frankly, it's hard not to talk about it. I want to emphasize that our underlying trends were very
strong, and given the weather issues noted, Retail operating profit increased a very healthy 14.2%, just below the
low-end of our expectations.
PBM operating profit growth was slightly above the high-end of our expectations, increasing a very strong 28.5%. Also
of note is the $1.8 billion of free cash generated in the quarter, which puts us well on our way to achieving this year's
free cash flow goal. So while disappointed that the severe weather put a damper on an otherwise excellent quarter, we
remain very confident in our outlook for the full-year, and Dave will discuss our financial results and guidance in
greater detail during his financial review.
So with that, let me turn to a brief business update and I'll start with health reform. As I'm sure everyone is aware, the
latest available data suggests that 8 million individuals have enrolled in the public exchanges. Now it's still too early to
estimate the impact this might have on utilization trends, acknowledging that the mix of those lives is unclear, so,
obviously, more to come on this issue. With regard to Medicaid expansion, available data indicates that 3 million
individuals have gained coverage and it's forecasted that this number will continue to increase in the coming months.
And as expected, we have seen a slight positive impact on our results from this growth in the Medicaid segment and we
continue to believe that CVS Caremark is well-positioned to serve these new customers across our enterprise assets.
I also want to touch briefly on our 10-year agreement with Cardinal Health. That agreement forms the largest generic
sourcing entity here in the U.S. Both CVS Caremark and Cardinal continue to work closely together on all aspects of
the launch, deepening our longstanding working relationship and building on our combined sourcing expertise. Initial

reactions from suppliers have been positive and we remain on track for a go-live date as soon as July 1 of this year. The
company will be staffed with individuals from both Cardinal and CVS Caremark. The entity will be located in
Foxborough, Massachusetts, and will operate under the name Red Oak Sourcing. So progress continues, and we're
looking forward to this exciting new venture.
Moving to our PBM business and I'll start with an update on the 2014 selling season, and since our last earnings call we
did add some second half wins and we learned that the transition of some business lost through acquisition, primarily
the Amerigroup business would be delayed from 2014 until 2015. And as a result of these changes, our client net new
business for 2014 increased to $3 billion, and that's up from $2.4 billion at our last update.
I should also note that Amerigroup would have been required to pay an early termination fee had the business transition
this year so the improvement in the 2014 net new business is expected to be immaterial to this year's financial results.
I also want to remind everyone that the 2014 net new business excludes the impact from attrition in our Med D PDP
business. As we discussed during our Analyst Day, we lost approximately $1.3 billion in 2014 revenues related to last
year's CMS sanction, and with the sanction lifted we are now able to enroll newly eligible Medicare lives as they age
into the program throughout the year. However, we missed the opportunity to gain lives through open enrollment last
fall.
In our SilverScript plan as just mentioned, we began to enroll new choosers for February as they aged into Medicare
and we expect to begin receiving low-income subsidy auto assignees this month and we currently have roughly 3
million lives in our individual PDP and we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the business over the
long-term.
I'm pleased to report that we have had a very successful 2014 welcome season. We've effectively handled hundreds of
implementations with very high levels of service, and the success has been driven by investments that we've made in
our people, our processes, and our technology. As for the 2015 selling season, it's still too early to provide a substantive
update, but I'll just say that the marketplace is active, we are seeing a significantly higher level of RFPs relative to the
2014 selling season and would also say that RFP activity is generally consistent with the levels experienced two years
ago.
In mid-April, PBMI released its annual Pharmacy Benefit Manager Customer Satisfaction Report. It's a broad survey. It
includes the opinions of nearly 400 plan sponsors who represent almost 65 million members, and we're pleased that
CVS Caremark ranked first among large, publicly-traded PBMs on overall satisfaction and we think these results
underscore our commitment to excellent service and we believe that we are very well-positioned in the marketplace to
both retain business and gain share with our strong service record along with our unique suite of capabilities.
We recently announced the renewal of a three-year contract to provide integrated pharmacy benefit services for the
federal employee health benefit program, or FEP, as it's commonly called and we continue to provide mail, retail, and
specialty PBM services along with highly customized clinical programs to FEP's more than five million federal
employees, retirees, and dependents. And we're certainly very pleased that FEP continues to recognize the value and
services that we provide to their plan and to their members.
Moving on to specialty, our business remained strong in the first quarter. Revenues were up approximately 34%
year-over-year. Today, about 60% of specialty revenues in our PBM book of business are dispensed through CVS
Caremark's specialty pharmacies. And our service model is resonating with our PBM customers as well as in the
specialty standalone market, impacting those specialty clients for which we are currently not the PBM.
At our recent Client Forum last month, conversations confirmed that finding solutions that will stem the specialty cost
trend is our clients' top priority. And we believe that tools used in the PBM market to manage the traditional pharmacy
spend can be effectively applied in the specialty sector. And we're very well positioned to help clients through a variety
of unique programs that improve cost, quality, and access, whether the drugs are paid for under the medical benefit or
the pharmacy benefit.

We recently released our annual trend management report. We call that Report Insights. And while spending for
traditional medications was up just 0.8% in 2013, overall trend was 3.8%, and that was largely driven by a 15.6%
increase in specialty medications. Among our clients, specialty now represents about 22.5% of total drug spend, and
projections have that growing to as much as 50% by 2018.
So let me highlight two offerings that utilize our unique assets to help our customers manage specialty costs: medical
pharmacy management and site of care management. First, we believe our suite of offerings in medical pharmacy
management, or let's call it MPM, is a significant differentiator in our strategy to manage all aspects of the specialty
patient.
According to a recent Milliman report, the transition of that portion of specialty flowing through the medical benefit,
moving it to the pharmacy benefit can save payors an average of 19% across 14 classes of specialty injectables. For
those classes that payors choose to pay under the medical benefit, our Novologix claims platform allows plans to
manage these drugs with the same level of precision that is routinely expected from PBMs. And again, that leads to
significant cost savings. So the opportunity here for payors is large. And we continue to have meaningful discussions
regarding how CVS Caremark can best help them.
Secondly, we can offer patients more convenient lower-cost alternatives to hospital outpatient infusion. And this could
be the physician's office; it could be a retail infusion site or even the patient's home. All of these create opportunities to
reduce costs. And our recent acquisition of Coram will enable us to execute and do just that.
Coram is a market leader in specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition. The integration to date is going well. Our
sales forces are being aligned, and we are beginning to develop integrated products for both hospitals and health plans.
Now in addition to those two opportunities, the rollout of our new Specialty Connect offering is expected to be
completed at the end of this quarter. And Specialty Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities, providing choice
and convenience for members, while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. And
as of late-April, more than 15,000 specialty patients have been served by this new model and adherence and satisfaction
rates are already meeting or exceeding those we see in traditional specialty. So we continue to be excited by the
prospects for our Specialty Connect offering as clients see this as another tool to achieve their objectives. So I think I've
given you some examples. I think you can see how we're positioned to continue to gain share in the fast-growing
specialty marketplace as we develop innovative offerings that capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality,
and access.
Moving on to the Retail business, again, we had solid operating profit growth in the quarter despite the tough
comparisons with last year's strong flu season along with the extreme weather we experienced throughout the quarter.
Total same-store sales increased 1.4% while pharmacy same-store sales increased 3.8%. Pharmacy sales comps were
negatively impacted by about 120 basis points due to recent generic introductions and by approximately 90 basis points
to 100 basis points from the impact of weather along with the comparison to last year's flu season. Pharmacy script
comps increased 2.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis, and we estimate that the impact of weather and flu resulted in a
negative impact to script comps of 180 basis points to 200 basis points.
As for the front store business, comps decreased 3.8% and we estimate that the combined effects of weather and the flu
resulted in a negative impact of 140 basis points to 160 basis points. Comps were also negatively impacted by about 80
basis points due to the shift of the Easter holiday from Q1 last year into the second quarter this year. Now I'll note that
excluding any impact from our exit of the tobacco category, we do expect our front store comps to improve in the
remaining quarters of the year. We plan to break out the impact to comps upon exiting the tobacco category so you'll be
able to easily see this underlying performance.
Also worth noting, the response to our exit from the tobacco category continues to be extremely positive. And we
remain confident that this strategic decision will lead to enhanced enterprise-wide opportunities for growth as CVS
Caremark plays an expanding role in our evolving healthcare delivery system.
In the first quarter, we continued to see an increase in both the breadth and depth of promotional activity out in the
marketplace. And as we've stated many times in the past, we continue to reduce our dependency on the weekly circular

and to begin to shift promotional investments to more personalized offers through our ExtraCare program, all with the
goal of driving profitable sales rather than chasing those empty sales. And as competitor promotional activity grew
higher, we actually reduced our circular ad blocks year-over-year. We reduced them by about 6%.
And as a result of staying true to our targeted promotional strategy, I'm pleased to say that we saw growth in our
average basket size along with notable growth in our front store margin in the quarter. Now of course, we would like to
see better front store comps, but it's important that we have a sustainable front-end strategy. And we're doing a number
of things that we believe will drive our front store business long-term. And while we're at an early stage for some of
these efforts, we are beginning to see what could become meaningful change as we go forward, again with the goal of
delivering the right value to customers while driving profitable sales.
And let me give you a couple of examples. Through insights from ExtraCare and our predictive modeling for
personalized emails, we've experienced email open rates that are two times the industry average with response rates
that are five times the industry norm. And the importance of that lies in our ability to increase share of wallet of our
best customers. Beauty Club is another example where we see the impact of personalization as we engage 13 million of
our best beauty customers. These Beauty Club members are shopping our stores more and they're spending 2.5 times
the average beauty customer.
Driving higher margin store brand sales is another area of focus for us. And our store brands as a percent of front store
sales increased about 25 basis points to 17.6% in the quarter. And our goal remains to drive store brands to more than
20% of front store sales over the next few years. So I hope you can see that we're not sitting still at retail and we'll
continue to explore innovative personalization strategies through ExtraCare insights to drive results.
Turning to our real estate program, we opened 22 new stores, relocated nine, closed seven, resulting in 15 net new
stores in the quarter. And we are on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year.
Before turning it over to Dave, let me briefly touch on MinuteClinic, which continues to post strong results. In the
quarter, revenues increased 11.4% versus a year ago. We opened 28 net new clinics in the quarter and we currently
operate 828 clinics in 28 states plus the District of Columbia and we plan to open at least 150 new clinics this year,
about a third of which will be in new markets. MinuteClinic added two new health system alliances during the quarter,
bringing our total number of affiliations with major U.S. health systems to 32. We also recently announced our move to
the Epic electronic medical record, which we believe will allow us to better integrate records with other hospital and
provider groups. It will also enable MinuteClinic to respond more quickly to the needs of our patients by accelerating
our ability to offer new services, and these enablers will allow us to achieve our goal of creating a national platform
that supports primary care by providing integrated, high-quality care that is convenient, accessible, and affordable.
So with that, let me turn it to Dave to go through the financial review.
David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. As always, I plan to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results
followed by a review of our guidance but before I get to that, I want to highlight how we continue to enhance
shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program.
During the first quarter, we paid approximately $325 million in dividends. And given our continued strong earnings
outlook for the year, we remain on track to surpass our targeted payout ratio of 25% at some point during this year,
more than a year ahead of our original schedule. Additionally, we repurchased 11 million shares for approximately
$801 million at an average price of $72.69 per share, and we still expect to complete at least $4 billion of share
repurchases for the full year 2014. So between dividends and share repurchases, we returned more than $1.1 billion to
our shareholders in the first quarter alone, and we continue to expect to return more than $5 billion for the full-year.
And as Larry mentioned, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash in the first quarter. Strong growth and
earnings and working capital improvements were the key drivers of this large year-over-year increase, and we continue
to expect to produce free cash of between $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion this year.

Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.02 per
share, up 22.5%, reflecting very solid growth across all of our segments despite being $0.01 below our EPS guidance
range. And as Larry stated earlier, the estimated impact to our adjusted earnings per share from the combined effect of
the unforeseen bad weather and the higher than anticipated tax rate was at least $0.03 per share. GAAP diluted EPS
was $0.95 for the quarter. While the Retail segment produced excellent growth in operating profit, it performed just
below the low-end of our expectations. Now in contrast, the PBM came in just above the high-end of our expectations.
Now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the first quarter increased 6.3%
or approximately $1.9 billion to $32.7 billion. PBM net revenues increased a healthy 10.3% or approximately $1.9
billion to $20.2 billion. The strong performance was driven by specialty, inflation, and net new business. Offsetting this
to some degree was lower mail choice claims as well as the negative impact on claims from bad weather.
The PBM's generic dispensing rate increased approximately 190 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82%.
Revenues in the Retail business increased 2.7% in the quarter or approximately $441 million to $16.5 billion. Sales in
the Retail segment were a little light due to the unforeseen extreme weather as well as our decision to remain true to our
strategy of not responding to aggressive promotions by others in the marketplace. Retail GDR increased by
approximately 170 basis points versus the first quarter of 2013 to 83%.
Turning to gross margin, we reported 18.2% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately
five basis points compared to Q1 of 2013. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased approximately 45 basis
points versus the same quarter of LY to 4.6% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 21.8% year-over-year.
The increase year-over-year was driven by growth in our specialty business, better acquisition cost and rebate
economics, and the increase in GDR. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by typical client price
compression. Gross margin in the Retail segment was 31.5%, up about 60 basis points over LY. This improvement was
driven by the increase in GDR as well as a notable increase in front store margins. Additionally, gross profit dollars
increased 4.8% year-over-year within the Retail business.
Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 65 basis points from Q1 of 2013 to 12%
while total SG&A dollars grew by only 0.9%. The PBM segment expense growth kept pace with revenues as the
SG&A rate was flat to LY at 1.5%. In the Retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales improved approximately 45 basis
points to 20.8% while expenses grew just 0.5%. Now keep in mind that our SG&A dollar growth in Retail was
minimal, largely due to the comparison with last year as we are lapping the highest SG&A growth rate quarter of 2013.
Now, this was partially offset by weather-related costs incurred during the first quarter. Within the Corporate segment,
expenses were down approximately $9 million to $190 million.
And adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 70 basis points to 6.2%.
Operating margin in the PBM improved approximately 45 basis points to 3.2% while operating margin at Retail
improved about 105 basis points to 10.6%. For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong, growing at 28.5%. This
was again just above the high-end of our expectations for operating profit growth in the PBM segment. Retail operating
profit increased a very healthy 14.2%, and while Retail sales were negatively affected by weather, Retail operating
margin was in line with our estimate at 10.6%.
And going below the line of a consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased
approximately $33 million from LY to $158 million. The debt we issued in the fourth quarter was the primary driver of
the increase. Our weighted average share count was 1.19 billion shares. And, finally, our effective tax rate was 39.5%,
slightly higher than we anticipated.
Now let me update you on our guidance and I'll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of our
guidance in the slide presentation that we posted earlier this morning on our website. As we stated in our press release,
we are maintaining our 2014 EPS ranges given our confidence in the outlook for the rest of this year. We currently
expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2014 in the range of $4.36 to $4.50, reflecting strong year-over-year
growth of 10.25% to 13.75% and that's after removing a gain of approximately $0.04 associated with the legal
settlement in the third quarter of 2013. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of

$4.09 to $4.23 per share. We've increased our top line outlook in the PBM and now expect revenue growth of 8.75% to
10%, about 150 basis points higher than our prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for
better-than-expected growth within specialty pharmacy, fueled by combination of both inflation and new product mix
as well as the impact of the change in net new business. And as a result of this improved expectation, we are raising our
guidance for consolidated net revenue growth to 5.25% to 6.5%, 100 basis points higher than our previous guidance.
Guidance for operating profit growth in our segments remains the same. We continue to expect Retail operating profit
to increase 7% to 8.75% year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 6.75% to 10.75%. We're increasing our
expectations for amortization for the year slightly by approximately $5 million to account for an additional expense
related to Coram. And we now expect amortization of approximately $520 million for the year. And as I've said before,
our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion.
Now in the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.11 per share,
reflecting growth of 11% to 14.75% versus Q2 of 2013. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to
be in the range of $1.01 to $1.04 per share during the second quarter. Now within the Retail segment, we expect
revenues to increase 2.5% to 4% versus the second quarter of LY. This revenue increase will be driven by solid
prescription growth as well as the positive impact of the Easter shift on front store sales.
Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 2.75% to 3.75% while we expect total same store sales
in the range of 1.25% to 2.75%. And the PBM, we expect revenue growth of between 10.75% and 12%, driven by
continued strong growth in specialty and inflation. We expect Retail operating profit growth of 4.5% to 6.5% in the
second quarter. We expect PBM operating profit growth of 18.25% to 23.25% in the second quarter.
Now just a couple of notes on second quarter margins, during the second quarter, we expect that a large state will
finalize its reduction in Medicaid reimbursement rates. Given our historical rate estimates, this finalization will likely
have a positive impact on pharmacy margins in the second quarter as we reconcile to the confirmed rate structure. On
the flipside, we expect total front store margins to decline in the second quarter due to the anticipated discounting of
some inventory related to our exit of the tobacco category as well as tough comparisons with the second quarter of LY,
the highest rate quarter of 2013. And I'd note that we expect front store margins to turn positive again in the back half
of the year. All things considered, we expect another very solid quarter in Q2.
So in closing, I'll leave you with three key thoughts. First, we posted solid growth this quarter and we're off to a very
good start for the year. Second, our outlook for 2014 for both businesses at both at the enterprise level is unchanged
and very strong. And finally, we expect to continue to generate very strong free cash and we will use a disciplined
approach to capital allocation to ensure that we maximize the value we return to our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to Larry.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thank you, Dave, and let me just wrap up with a reminder that all the ongoing changes that we're seeing in the
healthcare environment are certainly creating unique opportunities for CVS Caremark. And our unmatched model and
innovative solutions make us well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, and we believe, create a sustainable
competitive advantage. And our management team remains laser-focused on driving enterprise growth while enhancing
shareholder value.
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Charles
Rhyee with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yeah, thanks, guys, for taking the question here. Larry, Dave, I wanted to talk about on the
PBM side here, a lot of discussions over the last few months particularly around all the new drugs in hep C. And just
wanted to talk about what your experience has been so far in the PBM side, and then also particularly on specialty
pharmacy, but also on your Part D lives, I think you talked about 3 million members in your individual Part D plans.
Do you have a sense on your exposure there as more of the risk-bearing entity? And can you kind of talk about what
your – per patient, what your exposure would be in Part D? Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Charles, this is Larry. Let me start and then I'll ask Jon to jump in here. But I think as we have
alluded to in our prepared remarks, specialty patients are dealing with complex issues, and again, as we heard last
month at our Client Forum, our clients are more forecast than they have ever been on managing this trend without
compromising care. And the private market has solutions that have proven to be successful and there is an acceptance
and a growing interest in terms of bringing some of those tools to – that have been successful on the traditional side of
pharmacy to specialty. And in addition to that, we talked about some examples this morning where we believe we have
unique integrated products that even take that one step further. So our goal is to bring these tools to the entire specialty
market. Hep C just becomes one of those categories. So, Jon,...
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, okay. And, Charles, SOVALDI is about $80,000 for 12 weeks of therapy. We do
have prior authorization programs in place today to ensure appropriate utilization. I think the most important thing is
we're expecting new drugs into the marketplace in the fourth quarter that will create competition and allow us to
leverage our formulary capabilities that we introduced three years ago very successfully. So it is getting a lot of
attention. I agree with Larry that the tools that we have can appropriately manage this. And we're expecting to be able
to leverage those as new drugs come to the marketplace. As far as our Part D plan, there is usage in there and we expect
that to continue, but we do have protection in the risk quarter, so we expect the impact to be minimal for this year.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe, Jon, just a follow up there. You talk about your formulary
tools. Can you talk about some examples in specialty where your formulary tools have been able to deleverage the
pricing? I guess an example would be maybe your experience in multiple sclerosis because you look at the list price for
some of these drugs like even an Avonex, which is an older therapy relative to some of the other ones. The price has
still increased over the years. But is that an issue that we're looking at the list price versus maybe what the prices that
your clients are actually paying? Thanks.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Well, Charles, I mean how we leverage our formulary strategy is formulary placement,
access to the drugs for our clients and their members, and we negotiate with pharma rebates that those pass back to our
clients and reduce the net – reduce the cost of that drug, the gross cost that you see, they get a rebate on top of that and
it reduces the ultimate price that they pay. So that's how it works. We've done it with specialty – growth hormone as a
good example and we've been very successful. And that will expand to other categories. And hep C is a very good
example of how we'll expand that moving forward.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, Charles, the only thing I would add is that among clients, there has been a growing
interest in formulary management. And I think as you're aware of, we've seen competitors introduce very similar
strategies. And we introduced our formulary program some three years ago. So, we think it's a real opportunity to drive
down costs.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for the questions. Just looking at the pharmacy same-store sales results, pretty
impressive considering the weather impact. Factoring the impact from generics in, it would appear that pricing was up
about 300 basis points. Obviously it's still very healthy, but a pretty significant step-down from the pricing impact from

the previous quarter. We've heard some comments around inflation moderating. And just wondering what you guys are
seeing on the pricing front. And have trends in pricing on both generic and branded changed at all in your view since
you gave guidance back in December?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Bob, I'll start and Dave may want to jump in here as well. But we haven't seen anything out of
the ordinary that we haven't anticipated or comprehended in our outlook. And on the branded side, I think that the
trends there have been very similar to what we've seen in prior years, and in the generic market, there has been – we've
seen some price increases, but it's relatively off of a – it's a small number off our entire book of business and really not
material in our results.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, and I'll just add just a bit to that more around the generic side. As we look at it from a
generic marketplace, there is a lot of generic capacity in the marketplace today and there's a lot of generic competition.
So as we think about it long-term, we think there's a lot of opportunity remaining in our book of business to continue to
drive down our cost of goods sold and we're doing that both on our own but more importantly here in the next several
periods beginning to do that through our joint venture with Cardinal Health.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Got it. And I guess just a follow-up around pharmacy, moving over to scripts, obviously
appreciate all the detail on the impact from weather. Scripts look like they can still grew 2% on a same-store basis I
think you said 180 basis points, 200 basis points was a negative impact from weather so really would have been pretty
impressive growth on the script front. I think I saw on the slides, Dave, you might've mentioned that the outlook for 2Q
is 2.75% to 3.75%. I think this is clearly a step forward from what we've been seeing as far as prescription growth
really over the last few years. Can you guys just maybe talk about or break out what the drivers are from the underlying
growth in both the quarter and behind your expectations for script growth going forward?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, maybe I'll start and maybe I'll ask Larry and Helena if they want to add to this. As you
know, we continue to take share in the marketplace and I think importantly as you look at our business over the past
couple of years, we've continued to take more share of the Caremark clients' dispensing volume into the CVS channel
and/or into the Caremark mail channel and that has enabled us to, I'll say, outpace the marketplace in general. And if
you look at our script trends, you look at how we performed in Q1, in our expectations for the next several periods,
we're continuing that process and we have not really fundamentally changed our strong underlying trajectory there.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Ross.
<A - David M. Denton>: Good morning.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: On the PBM selling season, if you had to sort of break it down into the key drivers of why you
think you're sort of seeing more interest in the platform and why you sound, I would say, incrementally more
enthusiastic on sort of your potential capture rate this year. Do you think you're getting some positive tailwinds from
the tobacco announcement? Do you feel like it's Maintenance Choice driving it? Do you think some of your home
strategy and specialty strategy is resonating? I'm just trying to get a sense for where you think the key points where
you're gaining momentum.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ross, it's Larry. Let me start and then I think others will jump in here as well. I think that
the ticket to the game is you still got to be right on price and you got to have demonstrated high levels of service
performance. And I think that once you get the ticket to entry from that, I do think many of the elements that you
mentioned and some that we alluded to in our prepared remarks become differentiators, where the client can check the
box there, and in some cases there's not a competing offering. And I think tobacco is another one of those items that

you check the box on, recognizing that there is more and more and growing evidence in terms of the cost of tobacco in
overall healthcare costs and the desire of health plans and employer-sponsored coverage to begin to curb the costs
associated with that. And, they – I think in many cases, they see us as leading the way to bring solutions to that.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And, Ross, this is Jon. Let me just add that we feel very good about our positioning in the
marketplace, so our service levels are strong; Larry talked about that in his opening remarks. Our differentiated
capabilities are resonating in the marketplace like Maintenance Choice, what we're able to do with MinuteClinic, what
we're able to do with specialty. Specialty is clearly our clients' top priority and we talk about our capabilities with
Specialty Connect, Novologix and Accordant as an example.
I will tell you that, as I sit in front of clients, tobacco always comes up, and they applaud our move and I think it's just
another intangible that as they're making decisions around which provider they want to go with, they feel really good
about a company that's made a move like that. And then the last question you asked about was platform. That does not
come up in our client meetings. They're on a platform, they're on one platform. It's really a non-issue for them. It's an
internal opportunity for us around efficiency and productivity.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Great. And maybe just one question on capital deployment. I mean, Dave, you've done a
fantastic job, you talked about where the payout ratio has gone and you guys have obviously been buying the stock.
You still have room on the M&A front. There's been some more chatter in the public markets about you maybe doing
more down in Latin America and Brazil. I mean, how has that venture gone so far? How are you – updated thinking
about that market? And is that still your sort of preference in terms of some of these higher growth markets for kind of
expansion versus maybe other more developed markets that have lower growth?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ross, this is Dave. I'll kick it off and then I'll ask Larry to chime in here. As you pointed out,
we're fortunate in the fact that we have a very robust cash flow generation organization in the sense that we'll throw off
a lot of cash flow this year but more importantly over the next several years. As you said, we've been very focused on
the fact of using that cash to put it to use in the most effective manner to drive shareholder value, and we still have
opportunities importantly to increase our dividends to do meaningful share buybacks, but importantly, we can also add
to and invest into our business when it makes sense, and there's opportunities both here in the States but also
opportunities elsewhere around the globe. And I'll ask Larry to transition into maybe a conversation around what we're
seeing in Brazil at this point in time.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ross, we've been – I guess it's been just under a year since we've been operating, and the
results have been in line with our expectations and we remain focused on learning from our international operations.
We've got several pilots that are underway that are allowing us to bring expertise to the market and, at the same time,
understand which of our capabilities can work in Brazil. We've seen good results from those tests. And today we've got
I think it's 47 stores. We'll look to accelerate that growth in future years both organically as well as inorganic. And as
we've stated in the past and as Dave alluded to, we will take a disciplined approach to our international expansion
plans.

Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Larry, two things. One on specialty, if you take Coram out, the impact of Coram,
would the growth rate have been similar to the last few quarters? It would've been?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes, it would've been.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. And then do you think as you build out your capabilities in specialty – so the last
four quarters roughly 20% or so. Is there a scope for that to accelerate much, say, over the next couple of years?

<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, John, I think there is, and I think that the significance around the Coram acquisition was
our ability to not just manage the specialty drug but to manage the specialty patient holistically. And the infusion
component was kind of that missing piece of the puzzle that would allow us to do that. So we're very excited about the
capabilities that we have and we touched on some of the unique offerings that we can bring to market, and that,
combined with just the anticipated growth in the specialty market, I think that we're in a very good place.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And, John, this is Jon. So with the Coram acquisition, with the Novologix acquisition
when you think about specialty pharmacy; half of the spend is on the pharmacy side which PBMs have traditionally
managed, we've essentially doubled the size of the pie. With those assets we can now participate in specialty pharmacy
across both pharmacy and medical, and we built out our specialty strategy really across three pillars: cost, quality and
access. And we have solutions. The marketplace is looking for solutions. This is our top priority and we believe that
our assets will allow us to disproportionally grow in this area.
<A - David M. Denton>: And maybe I'll just close on the statement that we – as you look at the specialty market,
we're plugging ourselves into payors and to capturing more share of the payor spend but we're also importantly
plugging ourselves into the patients and using our Specialty Connect and our retail MinuteClinic assets to capture more
of the open market, and all of that from an environment perspective is being fueled yet again by new products over the
next several years coming into the marketplace as that will further drive utilization in this category.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: So, John, obviously you can tell that we're excited about [indiscernible] (49:43).
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So just transitioning to Retail for a second, you guys have done an incredibly good job of
improving Retail profitability. So the question becomes, and I guess it's a moving target, but how close do you think we
are to getting to peak margins in that business? Do you know? And then let's assume that there are things with
personalization that kind of are game-changers. How much more upside is there to retail EBIT margin? And is
personalization and what you do with the circulars, is that the single biggest driver?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, John, let me take the first part of that and then I'll flip it over to Helena to talk more
about the personalization strategy. But, John, when you think about the opportunities at a very high level of retail, our
ability to – from an operating margin point of view, okay? – our ability to pump more volume through our box is what
the key driver is there especially when you think about the pharmacy opportunities acknowledging the fixed costs that
exists not just with the bricks and mortar but the cost of the pharmacist. So I think that many of our strategies and our
thought processes with that in mind. And then I'll ask Helena to talk a little more about the personalization strategies as
it relates to the front-end business.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Sure. So overall, you can see that we continue to focus on driving long-term profitable
growth in the front and our front store is still a small part of our overall business. We see a growing role of both digital
and personalization. So our personalization efforts are really at the key. And some of what we hear from our suppliers
is given that we've been at it for 16 years with ExtraCare; they're definitely noticing our unique ability to use the data to
drive profitable growth. So in particular, if you look at areas like health, beauty and personal care, these are areas where
we continue to grow share in the marketplace, and we're essentially staying out of the promotional fray and growing
our margins and our profits in these businesses. So this continues to be a very important part of our overall growth
strategy.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, John, as we alluded to in our comments, I mean obviously we'd like our front store comps
to be better and I think as I've talked about on past calls, there's a balance there. It's a little bit of art and science, and
we'll continue to work to innovate to find that sweet spot there. But I think that, again, as you heard from my earlier
remarks, our goal is to create a sustainable front-end strategy, and quite frankly, we think there are elements of the
current promotional marketplace that are not sustainable for the long-term.

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. And I actually wanted to follow on with what Jon was kind of talking about and
what Larry what you were talking about. Just basically as you look at your – it's kind of a strategic question – as you
look at your asset base whether it be the clinics, the stores, specialty, of course the back end of the stores, how
interconnected do you believe the businesses are?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Scott, I'll start and then others may want to jump in here. Okay? I actually think that if I
can use a baseball analogy that we're probably in the second inning in a nine-inning game. Okay? I mean, I think that
we're doing some things that you don't see in the marketplace, largely driven by planned design for our PBM clients
and their members. But I think there's so much more that we can do and that's what our team and I say teams because
it's not just a retail focus, it's an enterprise focus when you think about our retail offerings and how that intersects with
our PBM offerings and planned design as well as MinuteClinic.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Scott, this is Jon. I mean let me bring what Larry talked about to life. So we have a client
that's a health plan that has a focus on the primary care medical loans, and so we're connecting into their technology
platform, our PBM services, our stores, our MinuteClinics and Coram, and we're able to work with the primary care
doctor and message patients, message the providers, message the pharmacy, message the MinuteClinics with the goal
of being all aligned to influencing that member in a way that will ultimately reduce overall costs. So we've positioned
ourselves as an integral part of the healthcare network leveraging our assets and our technology capabilities. So I think
that's a very good example of how the assets all come together and interplay.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, and then just building on Jon's point, I think if you look at, and Larry alluded to this
before, but we have spent a great deal of time, Jon's team and my team working together on the rollout of Specialty
Connect. We're really excited about where that's going. It's a great example of how we're working together to bring a
solution for the marketplace that is truly unique and holistic and thinking more from an enterprise perspective than our
individual business units.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So if you guys think, and it sounds like you do, that you would agree with this idea that the
stores can kind of become a center for health and wellness, and looking at that asset base, where do you think the
biggest lever is in that store to increase return on invested capital, return on assets?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Scott, I think it goes back to the question that John asked. I think ultimately, it's
generating more volume through the box. Okay? And that's where we'll see the biggest ROI.

<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Larry, I noted that when you talked about the 2015 selling season you said more RFPs than we've
seen historically. Is there any way for you or for Jon to size the potential pipeline or opportunities for 2015?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Lisa, I think that's hard. I mean we look at, I guess, the season opportunities more based
in terms of the RFPs that are out in the market. And as you well know, RFPs are not all equal as you look at volume.
And...
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Right.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: ...I mean, I think that one of the questions that we always get is how much business do we have
up for renewal? And we see it as kind of a normal renewal season, less FEP. Okay? And I think we've said on past calls
we had $16 billion to $17 billion up for renewal, and again, that excludes FEP. But I think that, again, as people
compare this year to last year, recognizing that last year was a down year from RFP activity, the marketplace is very
active at this point in time.

this year, more employer business? Any color around how we should think about this year's selling season?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, I think it's hard to say. Clearly, you see the managed care business coming out
early in the season. So we've seen that. And we're just now beginning to see the employer business come to the market.
And the activity is tracking essentially to what we saw a couple of years ago. So I'd probably think about it in those
terms.

Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. On mail choice penetration, it's dipped down to a low not
seen in many years at this point. I was just curious to get some insight into the cause of that, whether it has to do with
the PDP volume loss from the CMS sanction or something more fundamental in the market. So anything there would
really help us.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Dane, let me start and again others may jump in. But, the – we have said in the past that
we don't see traditional mail as a growth driver. We saw that slowing. Okay? And one of the drivers behind that is
payor mix shifts. As more business migrates into the Medicare and Medicaid segments, the traditional drivers of mail
just don't exist within those government programs. And I think we're beginning to see that.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And, Dane, Jon again. We are seeing our mail, the Maintenance Choice volumes grow at
retail, while not enough to offset what we're seeing at mail. So we do think as we've looked at, we have about 17
million lives in our Maintenance Choice program. We've talked about the opportunity to grow that to 34 million lives.
So we still think it's an opportunity to grow. Larry talked about the mix shift difference and specifically about our PDP
plan. Part D plans have very low mail penetration, so it's really not a factor here.
<Q - Dane Leone>: And so as we think about your unique model versus some of your competitors, from the outsider
view generally we hold that mail volumes carry a much higher margin for the business than retail volume. Does that
still hold true or has that really changed over time as you developed your integrated model?
<A - David M. Denton>: Dane, this is Dave. That's a little different for us. If you think about the economics, let's say a
90-day maintenance prescription be that at mail or at retail, they carry the same economics for us so we're truly
financially agnostic to that. And what's nice about our model is as we plug into payors and as we work with patients,
we can give them that opportunity at the same economics as I'll say a mandatory program pushing into a channel that
they may not choose to utilize.

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Thank you for squeezing me in here. Regarding, though, your assumptions on weather, do you
assume the basket size increase had to do to some extent with the severe weather? Or do you think that that's
sustainable going forward? And then how do you know that some of the impacts weren't from the competitors
advertising programs or perhaps from the greater seasonality that you should probably be expecting relative to higher
deductible plans being sold. There are so many changes going on this year with healthcare reform. How are you able to
parse away some of the weather impacts from some of those other impacts?

<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: This is Helena, Peter. I would just say that our basket size growth continues on its normal
trend. We haven't seen anything out of the ordinary. And for us, as I said before, it's a continued focus on
personalization. We have, as Larry mentioned before, as others have increased their promotional activity, we have
actually reduced ours and instead are spending this on our top customers. That is our particular focus. These are the top
customers. We're typically looking at the top 20% or 30% of our customers who are driving the lion's share of our
volume and profits, and we have a continued focus on increasing the number of personalized outreaches we have to
those folks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Peter, keep in mind that when we're talking about basket size, it is just the front-end basket and
does not encompass anything – excuse me – in the pharmacy.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Yeah, I understand. My question is more, though, how are you able to parse away the weather
impacts from all the other things going on because the weather theoretically is impacting not just the front-end but the
back-end as well?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, this is Dave. I mean, I think the team does a pretty good job of analyzing kind of by
market in understanding where we quite frankly have stores that on limited hours or stores that are closed and/or
weather, severe weather where we can see the traffic patterns. And so I think we can do it kind of by day, by store, and
so it's not, you can't 100% lock that down but I think the team does a pretty good job of kind of analyzing that and that's
why we give you a little bit of a range in the commentary we provided today.

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Couple of quick questions for you. First, I don't know if you can, I know you don't usually do
this but since we had the impact of weather in Q1, could you help us at all in terms of how things sort of shaped up in
April? A couple things within that, right? One, it seems like underlying script growth for the industry has accelerated
and I was wondering if you saw any of that and what you thought might be the drivers? And then second, how the
front-end business look through Easter with better weather? Anything better there?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ed, those are great questions. Unfortunately, we can't comment on that at this point in time.
So...
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. A question on tobacco. Any thoughts on what you might do with the space behind the
store and whether there is an opportunity to maybe offset some of that sales loss in the back half of this year?
<A - David M. Denton>: This is Dave. I'll start and then I'll ask Helena to chime in. Just I want to be clear on the
tobacco category and as we exit it. While we will come up with ways to use that space, it's unlikely that we're going to
come up with something that's going to materially replace that product line. As you know, the tobacco category at least
from a financial metrics perspective is very productive. So with that, maybe I'll turn it to Helena.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, that's absolutely right. So we're still working on our plans. We've been testing a
number of things. But as Dave said, we certainly don't expect that what we put behind that space will make up for the
lost tobacco sales. What we have really been looking at is, as a question before alluded to, we're increasingly
positioning ourselves as a healthcare company and making sure that our store more and were represents ourselves as a
healthcare company.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: I guess for me just a quick question on the JV with Cardinal. Aside from the $100 million
in annual payments that you'll get from them, I guess the question is do you expect a fairly quick turnaround time after
July in improving your overall COGS by pooling the purchasing with Cardinal? Or will that happens slowly over time?
And the reason why I ask is we've heard about some letters being sent out by the various parties in the other
procurement collaborations in the supply channel to the generic suppliers, where their trying to capitalize on those
quickly. So I'm just kind of curious to get your thoughts on what's going to happen after July, whether there will be
quick improvement? Or is it gradual? Just any color there would help. Thanks.
<A - David M. Denton>: This is Dave. Maybe I'll start here. Clearly, we're working pretty aggressively right now with
both folks from CVS as well as folks from Cardinal to get the joint venture up and running. We still have a little bit of
work to make that happen. So I think the teams are working very collaboratively to make it happen productively. I do
think that it's probably just a little too early to provide too much color on that. I will think it's important that we're going
to figure out ways in which when we get the joint venture up and running that we're going to partner with generic
manufacturers, working to create win-win scenarios for them. And you could imagine that some of that would happen
quickly. I think some of that could happen over time. So the cadence of improvement I think is probably too early to
give much color to at this point.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. All right, great. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Hi. On the specialty, what's the primary lever on getting some of that specialty spend out
of the medical benefit and into the pharmacy benefit? Is it just changes in benefit design?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Mark, this is Jon. So that's essentially it. So if a payor allows it to be paid under
the medical benefit, and it's billed that way, it goes through. They do have the ability to say we're not going to allow
that to be paid under the medical benefit. It has to be moved over to the pharmacy benefit. And the value proposition
there is in lowering cost of goods. So we think it's an opportunity for the marketplace. And again we feel like our assets
position us to help our clients find ways to save money in this rapidly growing area.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: The Coram fits into that as well?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: I'm sorry.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: The Coram fits into that as well, so you can aim people towards your Coram business on
infusion rather than going to a medical facility?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, it's interesting. When you look at Coram, they have people out in 1,200 hospitals
across the country, and they essentially recruit patients one at a time. We believe the opportunity is a very fragmented
market working with payors to reduce the infusion network, funnel more volume through Coram. And there's a value
proposition there for the payor. And it's not just in drug costs, but we can help get patients out of the hospital faster
because of our capabilities to do many of the procedures at home versus in the hospital. And we can also help to reduce
readmission rates. And so as we've been out in the marketplace, payors are very interested in these capabilities and I
think very open to skinnying down those infusion networks, which means more volume through Coram.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Mark, the only other point I want to emphasize is back to the first part of your question is that I
think the data is powerful here. And showing clients, whether it's a health plan and employer, the cost savings

Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. A couple of follow-up questions. First of all, on the specialty –
and especially on SOVALDI, I mean, we are hearing that the payors are looking to narrow the network they're using in
order to save costs, i.e., just gearing their patient population toward pharmacy, their own specialty pharmacies. So
when you think about your specialty scripts or maybe SOVALDI as an example, what percent of that script is coming
from the Caremark population and your other health plan partners?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ricky, this is Dave. We don't provide that level of detail at this point in time. I would say
that just as Jon maybe indicated earlier today in his remarks around how we manage specialty, one lever that is
available to specialty is I'll say narrowing the network, and pushing those – centralizing those fills into a centralized
provider, and we do that in some cases where it makes sense or in some cases we have an open network, but that's an
opportunity.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, and, Ricky, so we have not heard a lot of activity in SOVALDI from payors
around narrowing the network. Most of the activity is around making sure which patients should be placed on the
medication and really the biggest opportunity to lower the cost for SOVALDI is going to be around formulary
management and that will happen in the fourth quarter when these new drugs come to the market and there's more
competition in the hep C class.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then secondly, just on generics, Nexium obviously there is some uncertainty
around the drug. So do you include a Nexium benefit in the 2014 guidance?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ricky, this is Dave. With Nexium, like many other products, there's always some level of
uncertainty in it and our guidance ranges comprehend I guess a series of different scenarios around both that product
and other products.

Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Can you comment on how you would enhance the level or number of services that a retail
store could provide to become more primary care physician-like, in particular around lab? Is that something you're
contemplating bringing to the stores? Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, David, we're doing a number of point-of-sale lab testing today whether it's A1c, we've
piloted some testing for some other disease states and there's a lot of technology out there. And the technology in that
space is moving very quickly and we're evaluating what is in the marketplace. And I think it's not a question of if, it's
more a question of when and finding the technology that we believe is right for MinuteClinic.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. And just in your view in a perfect world, I mean, would these be lab tests that are done
in a store or would blood be drawn and then sent to a lab and then brought back in or a combination of both?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No, I think we're thinking about it as lab testing that's done in the store that really satisfies the
goal of increasing the services that we can provide around the management of chronic disease.

<Q - John W. Ransom>: Hi. I know this is getting late in the call. I just had a quick follow-up to make sure I
understand something. When you're talking to clients now about their specialty trends, what do think the market
specialty trend is now? And what can you bring that number to using the most aggressive tools that you have? Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, John, it's Larry. I mean, I think as I mentioned, in 2013 we saw the specialty trend at –
approach I think it was just a tick under 16%. And we have a variety of models that we share with clients that if left
unmanaged, that trend is going to be in the high-teens. And I'll flip it over to Jon because he's got a very nice
presentation for our clients that show by adopting all of these various programs what the trend could ultimately come
down to.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, and, John, so we think we can actually get a double-digit trend like that down to
almost flat, and there are programs that we have such as Advantage Control specialty formulary that we can reduce
trend by 1.5%; Medical claims editing and repricing that can bring it down 2.5%; site of care medical carve out they
can bring it down 3.6%. I won't go through all of them but there's numerous programs that we have that we've been
building over the last several years that can take these high trend rates in specialty and really make a huge impact on
them and get them down to almost zero if they adopted everything.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Right. And as you look in your crystal ball, say, out to 2016, 2017, what do you see the
overall drug trend being including specialty left unmanaged?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: That's a good question. And at our Client Forum I spent some time actually talking to our
clients about how they should begin to think about their pharmacy benefit, because if you look at utilization being
somewhere in the 2% to 3% range moving forward, you see inflation overall across their book being somewhere in the
7.5% range, you see the generic pipeline subsiding as an example. So we think the trend overall can be somewhere in
the 6% to 10% range if unmanaged, and obviously we're encouraging them to adopt strategies such as more aggressive
formularies, narrower networks, to bring that trend down. And it's interesting, the marketplace I think is very open to
these types of solutions that have been developed.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: John, I think in Jon's presentation at the Client Forum I think there was one of those aha
moments for our clients that recognizing that over the last several years the influx of generics has been a key driver to
bringing the cost trend pretty flat and a reality that as we migrate post-2015 and generics entering the marketplace,
while they're still there at a slower rate than historical averages that they're going to have to do some things differently
and think about things differently, and they appreciate the fact that we're thinking about those things for them and
bringing them solutions.

Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks. A lot of questions have been asked. Maybe I'll ask something that hasn't been asked at
all and you did mention that the strong free cash flow in the first quarter was tied to working capital and could you just
talk a little bit about what sort of you've accomplished in managing working capital and what you think the
opportunities are?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, sure, Meredith. It's really two things. One is we also posted very aggressive growth
rates from an earnings perspective so that obviously helps free cash flow yield. But secondly is we continue to push on
our working capital. I would say, Meredith, there's not kind of one program that we have there that's driving all of it.
We continue to push on AR and AP. I think as we talked about in the past, probably our biggest opportunity continues
to be to enhance our inventory position from a supply chain perspective within the retail stores. If you look and you try
to compare our performance with kind of, I'll say, top performers in the marketplace, we still have anywhere from $1.5
billion to $2 billion of inventory that I think we can get out of the pipeline over time. And the team is working on that
today, there's not one silver bullet to that, it's going to be a lot of little changes that we need to do to really enhance I'd
say our safety stock as opposed to really dramatically changing our SKU count in the stores if you look at it from that

perspective.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. And then I have a question probably for Helena. Based on everything you're saying, it
doesn't sound like there is a point in time in which you will cycle reduced page count or anything like that. Is that the
right way to think about it, that this is an ongoing process of using your marketing funds more wisely? Or will we see
less impact at some point?
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, no, I think your first assumption's right, Meredith. If you look at overall household
penetration of the Sunday circular for the last five years and projections for go forward, it continues to decline. We see
that just continuing at its current pace, and so to be ahead of that curve we've really been investing outside of the
circular. So there's no one silver moment where we're going to cycle something. I think this will continue.

Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George R. Hill>: How are you guys?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good.
<Q - George R. Hill>: I guess first thing, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the PBM. Results were pretty
impressive and if I kind of boil it down to profitability per script or profitability per adjusted script, really strong
growth year-over-year. I guess can you talk about what's driving that there, how much should we think of it that as the
contribution of mix from acquisitions versus just continued improvements in the business? Or kind of what else is the
key there?
<A - David M. Denton>: This is Dave, George. Maybe I'll touch upon that. We don't really use that metric that much.
We think it can give you a – that metric can give you a false positive or false negative depending upon either client
mix, where you are in the profitability cadence of Medicare Part D as they hit the risk quarters through all the cycles
and the benefit levels. I would say, though, having said that, there's a couple things that are driving our profitability we
talked about. We continue to push on specialty and specialties become a bigger portion of our business and we continue
to enhance our performance from a specialty perspective. We furthermore, have worked aggressively to improve our
cost structure from a cost of goods sold perspective, and you've seen us continue to ratchet down and improve our
buy-side economics. And then finally, from a PBM perspective, driven somewhat by our formulary strategy have
improved our rebate yield over time, so all three of those continue to enhance our profitability. And then I'll just say
sliding on top of that is we made some investments over the past several years from a streamlining perspective and our
cost structure is in a much better position today than probably what it was three or four years ago. So, all those
components are contributing to that growth in profitability.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Yeah, I remember that you guys didn't see that as a core metric but even if – as it's the metric
that I continue to look at because other companies in the space use it, very strong improvement even on a tough comp
year-over-year. And then I'd follow up with one more quick one. And I don't know – do guys have any data, and are
you able to break down kind of what is the capture rate or what is the cross-sell as the MinuteClinic business continues
to grow pretty strongly? You guys are posting very strong script volume. Like kind of what's the script capture from
people who show up at the MinuteClinic? And how should we think about the tie between the growth in the
MinuteClinic business to the tie in pharmacy sales?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, there is a tie between patients who utilize the MinuteClinic typically when a
prescription is written at MinuteClinic is 95-plus-percent of the time filled at CVS/pharmacy, something like that. I

would say that MinuteClinic is still relatively small in the grand scheme of as it relates to CVS/pharmacy so it's not a
major contributor of script comp growth but it is a nice complement to our business. And quite honestly, we don't really
think about MinuteClinic as it relates to the front although there's probably some halo into the front of our business.

Our final question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Larry, do you envision adding oxygen therapy or durable medical equipment to your
stable of businesses there on top of the infusion business? And then just secondarily, your primary competitor in the
PBM world was graced with three subpoenas. Do you anticipate seeing similar disclosure in your Q this evening?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Bob. Good morning. In terms of – I think you'll see in our Q later today that we did
receive a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Rhode Island requesting documents concerning
some drugs very similar to one of our competitors as it relates to fees and rebates and obviously we're cooperating fully
on that matter. We have not received a subpoena from the Department of Labor.
And then on your first question, we do not have any plans to get into the oxygen space. We have that opportunity.
When you look at the Coram acquisition, that was part of Apria and we purchased the infusion and the investor kept the
oxygen business. I think, with durable medical, I think we continue to explore what options we may have. We do a
little bit of that today and I think it's something that continues to be on our radar screen that can we do it in an effective
fashion and when I say effective, I'm thinking of convenience of the patient in mind as well as obviously the economics
as it relates to the business.
