Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dane. I would like to thank all of you for joining us today. I will give an overview of our fourth quarter and
full-year results, and then Dave and I will take your questions.
Full-year net revenues for 2012 were $34.2 billion. Net earnings were $7.5 billion. Earnings per diluted share were
$14.13 and our return on common equity was 10.7%. Fourth quarter net revenues were $9.2 billion. Net earnings were
$2.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $5.60.
The operating environment in 2012 was defined by a few significant trends, substantial Central Bank activity, improved
economic data in the United States and continued political uncertainty. For example, actions and commentary by the
European Central Bank played a significant role in moderating concerns about a European link-tail event. At the end of
2011, the ECB announced that it would enhance its long-term refinancing operations to provide term liquidity. The
ECB further demonstrated its commitment during 2012 by affirming its support for the euro and its willingness to make
outright purchases in the secondary bond market.
In United States, the Federal Reserve also took steps to support markets and economic growth announcing further
increases in monetary stimulus during the year. In 2012, the US economy posted stable to improving economic data,
particularly with developments and unemployment and housing. Over the course of the year, the US economy added
nearly 2 million jobs and the housing price index increased by 4% over the past 12 months.
Despite the systemic benefits of Central Bank activity and improved US economic data, our clients continue to struggle
with the complex set of issues facing the global economy and the political backdrop. The most obvious recent example
was a debate in United States surrounding the fiscal cliff. These factors translated into mixed activity levers for our
corporate client base.
For example, global debt issuance increased by 11% year-over-year, with high yield issuance increasing 38%. In
contrast, global equity underwriting volumes were only up 1%, and completed global merger and acquisition volumes
actually decreased 18% in 2012 and remained very low as a percentage of market capitalization.
We experienced lower activity levels in most of our businesses and general risk aversion by our investing clients. This
was offset by improving asset prices and lower volatility, which created a more favorable market making environment.
Although equity and fixed income asset prices trended up over the course of the year, volumes generally declined given
the previously mentioned factors.
For example, US listed equity volumes declined 18% in 2012, and as we all know, the S&P 500 declined by 13%.
While macroeconomic challenges persist, our leadership teams remain focused on enhancing our returns. Drivers of our
long-term success include focusing on our clients, prudently managing our risk profile, and being disciplined about
capital and expenses.
I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up
21% from the third quarter. The increase was due to higher equity underwriting revenues following a weak third
quarter and continued strength in debt underwriting. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $4.9
billion, up 13% from 2011 due to a robust environment for debt issuance.
Within Investment Banking, fourth quarter advisory revenues were $508 million, flat with the third quarter. Goldman
Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A for 2012. We advised on a number of significant
transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Kraft's $36.1 billion spin-off of its North American
Grocery business. While Disney's $4.1 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm and Dollar Thrifty's $2.3 billion sale to Hertz.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter. Ralcorp
Holdings' $6.8 billion sale to ConAgra, the $4.5 billion sale of eAccess to Softbank, and Gambro's $4 billion sale to
Baxter International.
Fourth quarter underwriting net revenues were $897 million, up 37% sequentially as issuance improved relative to the
third quarter. Equity underwriting revenues of $304 million increased 61% compared to the third quarter, reflecting

increased deal activity.
Goldman Sachs was ranked first in worldwide equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2012. Debt
underwriting revenues increased 27% to $593 million, due to our involvement in several significant transactions and a
favorable new issue environment.
During the fourth quarter, we participated in noteworthy underwriting transactions, including AIG's $6.4 billion sale
with remaining stake in AIA, Avalon Bay Community's $2.2 billion follow-on offering, and Clear Channel Outdoor's
$2.7 billion high yield offering. Our Investment Banking backlog increased compared with the end of the third quarter,
it was also higher than year-end 2011.
Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of fixed and equities client execution,
commissions and fees, and security services.
Net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the third quarter. Net revenues within Institutional
Client Services improved as the fourth quarter included an approximately $500 million gain from the sale of our hedge
fund administration business. Full-year net revenues of $18.1 billion for Institutional Client Services were up 5%
relative to 2011, and included a $714 million DVA loss. Excluding the impact of DVA, revenues were up 13%
year-over-year and benefited from an improving market environment with tighter credit spreads, higher equity prices,
and lower levels of volatility.
FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, including a DVA loss of $79 million, and were
down 8% sequentially, as certain businesses reflected seasonally lower levels of activity. Credit revenues increased
significantly as client activity was supported by a favorable market backdrop, which included a relatively benign macro
environment. Robust primary issuance and tighter credit spreads also helped.
Currency revenues also increased. Commodities revenues were higher compared to weaker third quarter results,
although absolute levels of client activity remained pretty low. While rates and mortgages were lower sequentially,
both businesses were strong contributors to the franchise.
For the full-year, FICC client execution net revenues of $9.9 billion were up 10% relative to 2011. Excluding the
impact of DVA, revenues were up 20% compared to 2011, as markets in 2012 were less turbulent and benefited from
an improved backdrop in Europe, modest growth in the US, and strong Central Bank activity.
In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the
fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, up 18% sequentially and included $47 million in DVA losses. Excluding the impact of
DVA, revenues were up 12% relative to the third quarter.
Equities client execution revenues decreased 10% sequentially to $764 million, reflecting fewer client driven
opportunities in our cash market making business. Commissions and fees were $722 million, roughly flat with third
quarter levels. Security services net revenues of $818 million reflected the $500 million gain on sale that was
previously mentioned for the full year, equities produced net revenues of $8.2 billion, consistent with 2011.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $76 million, down from $81 million in the third quarter.
Now I will review Investing & Lending, which includes both direct investing and investing through across various asset
classes, as well as lending activities. Investing & Lending produced net revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter.
Our investment in ICBC produced a $334 million gain in the quarter, other equity investments generated $789 million
in gains reflecting realized and unrealized gains on private equity investments and mark-ups related to public equity
investments as equity markets were stronger in Asia and Europe.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million, largely driven by tightening credit spreads and net
interest income. Other revenues of $355 million consists primarily of operating revenues from our consolidated
investment entities and are largely offset by equivalent expenses.

For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.9 billion driven by a $408 million gain on our
investment in ICBC, $2.4 billion in gains from other equity investments, $1.9 billion of net revenues from debt
securities and loans and $1.2 billion of other investments.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, up 26% from the third quarter
primarily as a result of $344 million in incentive fees generated from the Firm's alternative asset products.
Management and other fees were 5% higher at $1.1 billion. For the full-year Investment Management net revenues
were $5.2 billion, up 4% from 2011 levels on stronger incentive fees.
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $14 billion to $965 billion largely due to net inflows of
$15 billion into other client assets mainly as a result of advisory mandates. Total assets under management were
essentially unchanged.
On a full-year basis, assets under supervision increased 8% as other client assets received $39 billion of net inflows.
We ended the year with $111 billion of other client assets. Assets under management increased 3% reflecting net
market appreciation that was partially offset by outflows.
Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits increased 6% to $12.9 billion for 2012 and translated into a
compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.9%.
It is important to note that our lower compensation ratio in 2012 is in part a byproduct of our efficiency efforts that
began in early 2011. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.9 billion, 24% higher than the third quarter.
Other expenses were significantly higher, reflecting net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $260
million, an increase of approximately $200 million over the third quarter.
Based on the provision taken this quarter, combined with previous reserves, we have fully accounted for the
independent foreclosure review settlement. The fourth quarter also included a $157 million donation to Goldman Sachs
Gives, our donor advised charitable fund.
Finally, depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $100 million driven by impairments to certain
investment entities and our New York Stock Exchange designated market maker rights. For the full-year,
non-compensation expenses were down 4%.Total staffs at year-end were approximately 32,400, down 3% from
year-end 2011 and 9% from year-end 2010. Our effective tax rate was 33.3% for 2012.
During the quarter, we repurchased 12.7 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. For the
full-year, we repurchased 42 million shares for total cost of $4.6 billion. Historically, our financial success has been a
function of broad and deep client relationships, our best-in-class people, a disciplined approach to allocating financial
and human capital and a culture of collaboration and partnership. The value of this partnership is highlighted in
challenging market environments and drove our results in 2012.
Looking forward, we believe that we are well-positioned to expand our client franchise globally. For corporate clients,
we will continue to leverage our strong M&A, equity and debt underwriting positions. For investing in other
institutional clients, we will continue to rely on the quality of our content and execution.
We will remain very disciplined in our approach to expenses, balancing near term benefits to our margins against
longer term revenue opportunities. As we gain greater clarity on regulatory changes, particularly capital requirements,
we will respond accordingly. For example, given the Basel 3 capital changes that we incur as an owner of our own
reinsurance business, we are considering a potential sale of a majority stake in the business.
We have strong risk-adjusted capitalization which provides protection to shareholders against tail events. In addition,
our capital levels also create opportunities. First, it positions the firm to help our clients navigate an uncertain economic
event. It also allows us to provide capital where capacity is diminished. We are committed to effectively deploying our
capital and maintaining dry powder to meet future client needs. We will also return capital to shareholders when
appropriate returns aren't available. Our capital trends in 2012 reflected our measured approach, as our estimated Basel

Tier 1 capital ratio increased from approximately 8% to nearly 9%, despite returning $5.5 billion to shareholders via
share buybacks and dividends.
We are encouraged by the early signs of improvement in the markets and economy, but remain cautious given the
complexity of the risk and challenges. The quality of our advice and execution in today's challenging markets serves as
the foundation for maintaining long-term client relationships and ultimately meeting the needs of all of our
stakeholders.
Everyone in Goldman Sachs remains steadfast in their commitment to serving our client franchise. We have a deep
appreciation for our responsibility to all of our constituents; clients, shareholders, regulators, our employees and of
course the broader financial system. We believe that there is a shared interest among our constituents to manage the
firm in a way that supports economic growth and sustainability. Our firm is fully committed to fulfilling that
responsibility.
With that, I'd like to take a moment to thank David on behalf of the Firm for his significant contributions to Goldman
Sachs over his 32 year career. There is no doubt that our clients, employees, regulators and shareholders have all
benefitted from his unwavering commitment, sound judgment and devotion to the Firm's culture and principles.
As a personal note, I really want to thank you. You have been tremendous partner David and not only during this
transition. I truly can't thank you enough. I look forward to working with you as a Member of our Board of Directors.
For those of you who aren't keeping track, this is David's 55th consecutive earnings call. It is only fitting that he
provides some closing comments. David?
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
Thank you, Harvey. As many of you know, I've spent my entire career at Goldman Sachs, so it's all I know. I always
believed that it was a special place. That is a perception which has been validated over the last several years, given my
experiences during this period of stress.
I've witnessed the strength of our client franchise, the quality and dedication of our people and the commitment of our
shareholders. It was an honor to be asked to join the Board of Directors. I look forward to continuing to serve as a
steward for shareholders in that role.
It is the responsibility that I take with full confidence in the strength of the client franchise, the financial health of the
company and the caliber and devotion of our people.
I would also like to thank all of our shareholders, debt investors and research analysts for their support of the Firm and
me personally. I leave knowing that I'm turning the role over to Harvey who has the skills and judgment to warrant that
same level of support.
Thank you again for listening today and now Harvey and I are happy to take your questions.

David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
Good morning.
Howard Chen, Analyst
I think everyone would acknowledge 2012 was a pretty tough year for the industry, but yes when all said and done the
Firm posted nearly 11% return on equity. Just given where revenues and where you decided accrue comps, can you just
discuss the significant of that, the 11%? Is that a threshold ROE that we should think about that you don't want to fall
below in a challenging environment?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, what I would say about 2012 obviously as you mentioned, certainly some elements of the marketplace were
particularly challenging. What put us in a position to achieve the ROE really were the steps we took over the last two
years in terms of managing expenses and being quite disciplined.
But, in terms of what we were able to achieve in the future, we're going to have to see what the market opportunity
brings to us, but this was the year where, like all years, we took everything into account; performance, the competitive
dynamic and as I said, we benefited from the steps that we took over the past two years. But quite frankly I don't think
we will be pleased with the performance of the environment. It's not particularly aspirational. We'd like to do better.
Howard Chen, Analyst
Okay. Thanks. And then switching gears Harvey, with respect to Investing & Lending, you noted the improved
realization environment and mix. As many of your investments have been in the ground for a few years now, I was
hoping you could provide us some thoughts on how you think about the realization pipeline, give us a little bit more
detail on that appetite to sell today if markets were cooperative?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, the ability to monetize as you know is really driven by two factors, obviously its market performance, but it's also
the idiosyncratic nature of your own portfolio. So, in the past year, obviously there were opportunities. You could argue
that our performance exceeded that of the market place in terms of what you have might expected, but that was this past
year and our portfolio performed well. I think in some quarters it will perform well and in some quarters it won't
perform as well relative to the market place, but the market will drive that. Certainly, over time, what I mentioned
around the world, we feel like we'll see a track of investment opportunities, but in terms of scheduled monetization,
typical to predict.
Howard Chen, Analyst
Okay. Great. And then just finally from me, I realized we're now 10 trading days into the new year, but just given all
that happened at the end of 2012, with the fiscal cliff and so forth, just curious how the year has begun?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Too early to tell. We've only 10 business days into the quarter. You could paint a picture of concern given events in
Europe and certainly events in Washington, it could be disruptive. If you talk to our economist, our economist would

say that we'll see pretty modest growth for the first half of the year in the developed economies and it will exceed that
in the growth economies and maybe the second half of the year, but difficult to anticipate that. We do feel pretty well
positioned from a business point of view whether it's in our Investment Banking franchise and certainly across the Firm
to capitalize on opportunities, but too early to tell.
Howard Chen, Analyst
Okay. I have to give it a shot. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations again David.
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
Thank you.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
It's a new guy. I appreciate it.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Hi, thanks. I think risk weighted assets were down 8% quarter-on-quarter, but GAAP was down only about 1%. I know
those were different animals, so just curious what drove the RWA in the quarter, and then if you had any thoughts on as
we look forward obviously just on what's the passive path going forward for RWA.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I wouldn't focus so much on the quarter-over-quarter move more so, really on the end of last year to the end of this
year. So that's roughly 100 basis points 8% to nearly 9%. And as we've said before as we get visibility into the rules,
we will deploy our teams with tools and we'll be able to react. So what we are really seeing over the course of the year
is the effort to be more efficient with capital and of course the earnings performance. And so we will continue to react
as we get more visibility into all the rules.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
So is that a way of saying as the rules come out I think this quarter, many companies have been pushing through getting
other model approval, this was a little more driven by that versus actual assets going out the door?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We are not in a position to comment on any model approvals.

Okay. How about in a different way and I understand the sensitivity, as the rules come out, I think Goldman's
historically been very good at pushing out whatever the new rules are to the trading desk on the technology on the
desktop and it makes the company more efficient in that manner. Can you just maybe comment where are we in that
process and am I correct to say that, that is how we can envision higher ROEs going forward?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Well, the way I would think about it is, performance is going to drive the ROEs and that will be about our competitive
position and ability to deliver our franchise to our clients relative to others in the context of what the market provides.
With respect to managing our capital, I think you should expect us to continue to be disciplined and when we get
visibility around rules, we will look to be particularly responsive. We want to be very careful of not to overreact before
we have a rule and we don't want to underreact after we have a rule. So, we hope to do more.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Excellent. On the positive side, the competitive landscape definitely has shifted a little bit. I think there's a lot of
pressure under some of the European investment banks to do some form of shrinkage, small or large. Do you view that
as big opportunity? I know that over the past year or so or two, during the European crisis, you guys have commented
that it might be your best near-term opportunity. Is that still in motion and how are you going about positioning for it?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I wouldn't say that it's the best near-term opportunity. I think those things are always difficult to weigh, but I think if
you think about sort of longer-term strategy across multiple years, certainly capacity leaving industry broadly and
specifically opportunities in Europe we think we're well positioned and they look attractive to us, but we'll have to see
what materializes. I think the reason why I focused on near-term is it's very difficult to be too precise about how these
things unfold and certainly when.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Got you. Last one is a quickie. If you schooled in in David Viniar answers, I know it's going to be a quick answer too,
but this year revs were up 19%, comp dollars were up 6% and non-comp was down 4%, that's a fantastic mix for
shareholders. I know we can't predict the future, so let's just make believe for a second that revenues will be flat on the
go-forward basis. In a flat revenue world does comp ratio stay and non-comp expense keep trending lower?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, I think you have to go back again to how we manage the Company and how we think about compensation
specifically. So, there are whole host of factors that go into that. One is going to be how our performance is, and
certainly that's going to be reflected in compensation. The competitive dynamic is certainly in there and then of course
this is a balance issue obviously in terms of providing returns to shareholders. And look, this year, we hope we got the
balance right. As I said, we are not satisfied, we'd like to do better. But, again, it will be determined by what the market
opportunities provides us in the future.
Glenn Schorr, Analyst
Okay. Awesome. Thank you for all that, Harvey.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Michael Carrier, Analyst
Thanks, guys. So, we've seen two quarters where core revenues, they've probably come in at bit better than expected,
not only for you, but the industry. It feels like activity, maybe is stabilizing hopefully improving. But, when we look at
the liquidity reserve, it still seems pretty high. I think in the past you said when the environment gets better you could
see that trend down. So, I guess basically, does that relationships still stand, do you sense any improvement or are there
still enough regulatory uncertainties on liquidity and funding side remained ultra-conservative?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think what I'd say just is, just as a matter of principle, we're always going to be conservative about liquidity. I
like to say there is -- there are two core life bloods to the firm; one is our client and the other is our liquidity. And so
we're going to stay very focused on both. Look, there is a lot of uncertainty in the world and I agree with you, when
you look back over the past six months, certainly, the world feels a bit better, clients generally -- although there is a
fairly significant amount of risk aversion, got better towards the end of the year and we'll see how this year goes. But,
there is still a lot of things in front of the world. So I wouldn't expect any significant shift.
Michael Carrier, Analyst
Okay. And then, just a follow-up on Glenn's question on the RWAs. Maybe just, like, when you look at the rules in
trying to manage the assets and the capital, what percent -- I know it's an easy question probably tougher to answer, but
what percent is the rule that you feel like you have clarity on, meaning like what inning are we in that process, fully
getting clarity so you can manage your assets?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, yeah, that's a hard question. I would say that, I'll try and be as narrow as possible. I would say that, on capital, I
don't know, maybe we are in sixth inning in terms of capital rule visibility. Maybe some people could argue the same,
but that's kind of it using a baseball analogy. I think the broader issue is the collective visibility into all rules whether
it's Volcker, the impact of Dodd-Frank, things that impact globally. And there I don't think we have a lot of collective
visibility into the weight of that and actually I think it's difficult for the regulators to really assess all of that which quite
frankly is a concern for the industry and obviously it's a concern for the global economy.
Michael Carrier, Analyst
Right. Okay. And then last one, you mentioned just the reinsurance business, maybe putting that up for sale just
wondering I mean it might be too early, but any size of the business. Maybe same thing on Investing & Lending you
guys have said in the past there is areas of that business where it's on the lending side. So you'll continue to operate that
business and then there is other areas that will wind down in over time. So maybe any update on the assets or the

revenues related to those businesses and then capital that would be released and redeployed elsewhere?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, not in a position to comment on the reinsurance business beyond what's in the release. What I would say with
respect to Investing & Lending is those are core competencies of the firm and so when we, for example, when we had
visibility on part of the Volcker Rule, we took steps around certain businesses. But at this stage, this will be about how
we adapt to rules as we get further visibility. So, I don't know necessarily that we would say we deemphasized anything
in Investing & Lending at this stage. Now, of course, over time at businesses, like the reinsurance business are maybe
better held in other people hands and we can be a minority owner because of capital reasons, then we'll make those
decisions, but that will be on a business-by-business basis.

Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Then also how should we think about -- I'm not sure how much color I'm going to get from this, I'll give it a shot. How
should we think about a comp ratio on I&L revenues? In my guess is that that would be at a lower rate than it would be
for other businesses in the Firm, but can you maybe provide some color to help us out on that front?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I think it's really important to emphasize the point that when we think about the comp ratio, we think about it in terms
of the aggregate of the firm. And then within that, we compensate it across the various business units and we build it up
individual-by-individual.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Okay. But you'll clearly take into account the revenue mix when you start to think about those allocations, right,
because that's basically what is the sum of the parts?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I would say more simply, we don't look to overpay anybody.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Okay. So then, with that in mind, then you could easily say that given the competitive environment right now for talent
on the street that the improvement in the comp ratio should be at least somewhat sustainable for the benefit of
shareholders here in the near term. Is that fair?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Well, I guess, you could surmise that. As far as I can tell, even as capacity has been leaving the industry, there's been a
huge demand for Goldman Sachs people. And so the competitive dynamic in aggregate may feel much better, but for
very talented people at Goldman Sachs, they are very attractive.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
That's fair.
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
Brennan, it's David. You've heard me say this many times before. I'll just say it again. We don't set a comp ratio. We
don't start the process and say here is the comp ratio. We compensate our people individually and we take into account
the performance of the firm, the competitive environment all the time, and we're always looking at those things. So, it's
hard for us to say what it's going to be going forward.

That's fair. Unfortunately, we have to set a comp ratio in our models, so I got to give it a shot. And then I guess last one
for me, any color on deferrals? I mean, it's been sort of my understanding that you guys have historically had less
deferred comp than peers, which clearly gives you greater flexibility. We're hearing a lot of noise around deferrals here,
given the calendar and where we are, but do you intend to try to keep that flexibility? What's your view on that front?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, there are no deferrals. And I think you are right to say that you have to be very tough when you do that, because
there is a bit of mortgage in the future. And so, no, there have been no deferrals. Sorry, no additional deferrals.
Brennan Hawken, Analyst
Okay. I was going to question like that.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Guy Moszkowski, Analyst
Thanks, good morning. The CFTC obviously pushed back timing of some of the OTC reforms with respect to central
clearing, at least pretty close to the middle of the year. I know this is kind of a narrow question, but I am just interested
in how you think about it. All else equal, would you expect that revenues in FICC from -- or broadly from OTC
derivatives transactions, would be higher in the first-half as a result of just that change or that's not the right way to
think about it?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I think it's a good question. I think that the only case study we have is really history. And when you look back over
history, history has proven that -- a couple of things; one, it's proven that rule changes and the ultimate impact on
market structure incredibly difficult to predict.
I would say -- and I didn't really feel this way about a year ago. I thought that the rule delays or uncertainty around
rules, I didn't think was having any impact in terms of client activity. I do think as we get more clarity on rule certainty,
it may ultimately impact client activity to the positive.

Page 13 of 31
And having said that, I wouldn't trade off that delay for bad rule-making. And I think the CFTC and other regulators
have been pretty thoughtful about taking the steps to delay rules, because the single most important thing is that the
market has an opportunity to adapt, because we just -- we don't want to increase systemic risk, while the regulators try
and put new rules in place. So, I think all these delays have been quite thoughtful.
Guy Moszkowski, Analyst
And from a competitive perspective, just to one of the points that you just alluded to, as the changes in the regulatory
environment, for example, Basel 3 capital requirement get better understood and your competitors move closer to full
adoption, do you feel like the pricing dynamic for transactions that have a big slug of capital has to be priced into them
has become more rational?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I'm not so sure it's necessarily capital rules. I think broadly speaking it's a level playing field, and so we all have the
same rule set. The way we have to differentiate ourselves is by bringing into our strength. We have a history of our
clients wanting capital and we want to differentiate ourselves by providing capital. And so, I think it's really how you
execute. Everybody is going to live with the same rule set.
Guy Moszkowski, Analyst
But do you feel like over the last couple of years, competitive pricing has really been rational with respect to what those
medium to longer-term capital requirements are? And if it hasn't been as much so as you would have liked, do you feel
like it's gotten closer?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I think that -- and now we're getting into more art than science. I think that competitive response as relates to things like
capital changes, that's a very -- that's something that plays out over the intermediate to long-term. In the short run, you
can see irrational behavior by competitors, which can't be explained by any capital rule.
I would say and I am not sure this is related at all to capital, but I do think that the crisis itself at the margin had made
people much more disciplined about their capital deployment. And so, for example, I don't even know if this is an
indicator that you could extrapolate into your question, but in the fourth quarter, there was an amazing amount of block
activity. There were days where David and I were working with our teams in banking and the financing group on
sometimes four or five enquiries.
If you asked me on that particular day in December, did pricing feel a bit more rational, yes. But I couldn't tell you, if
that same day occurred this January, whether or not it would be as rational. But over years, the market makes people
more rational.
Guy Moszkowski, Analyst
Yeah. That's helpful. And then, one last question which follows up a little bit on something that was being talked about
before. In Investing & Lending, as you said, when it became very, very clear that proprietary activities were going to be
precluded, you shut a bunch of that down. What other business adjustments, not necessarily shutdowns, but significant
changes to parts of I&L are you either doing or contemplating, for example, in the lending and distressed debt trading
parts of the business?

Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Well, I would say, there are obviously a number of rules that can have incremental impact there, Volcker being one of
them, but we'll see Volcker when it comes out and we'll respond accordingly. But also those businesses, obviously,
tended to have more capital. And so we have no immediate plans for any changes, but the extension we need to respond
again, we'll do it.

Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays.
Roger Freeman, Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Maybe I'll just pick up there on Guy's question. On I&L, you've kind of got, I think you said, a
decent amount of clarity on the capital portion. There is still other pieces, including Volcker, outstanding, but in some
more of this sort of traditional sort of the equity investments area, is that scenario that presumably you'd continue to
invest and maybe even pick up again, because I think that's been somewhat of a lull, if the returns are there, right? I
mean, you'd like at this just like any private equity investor, just with a return threshold based on the capital
requirements, right?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It would be just like that.
Roger Freeman, Analyst
Okay. And then separately on comp, some of the reduced ratio, sounds like, it kind of came out of the restructuring
efforts over the past year and a half or so. How much of that sort of decline in the ratio would you attribute to that
versus sort of the market environment, competitive environment?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
We don't think about it that way in terms of parsing it. I understand why you'd ask the question. I think that what we
would say is the following, obviously, there was a lot of operating leverage in the business this year and you see the
translation of that in terms of the increased revenues into all the metrics. But in terms of how we think about
commenting, David discussed it earlier. It's going to be performance driven, and then we take all those other factors
into account, including the balance in what our shareholders make.

Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Sure.
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
And I would think that it would be more unrealized on the debt side than realized. So we can come back to you with the
breakdown, but just remember, big part of that is interest also.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Right. I am definitely taking the interest piece out, just asking on the non-interest piece. Okay, and is that --
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, we can follow-up with you. I don't think I'm far off, but we'll double check for you.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Alright. And then on the equity side, we can follow-up on that too?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Sorry, could you repeat the question?
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
On the equity side, the realized versus unrealized, is that mostly unrealized, is that fair?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a bit more than half on that also.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Okay. Alright. And then I know we discussed the clearing question. I just wanted to understand how you are thinking
about managing the potential outcomes here, because as initial margin does get towards the buy side, whether or not it
goes on schedule or is it a little bit delayed. How are you thinking about setting yourselves up for what could be a
changed behavior on the client side when initial margin comes through?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, this is an important question, because you can extrapolate in some respect our strategy and philosophy around Reg
reform pretty broadly in this context. So, it's incredibly important for us to serve our clients as best we can today. And
so, hard to truly anticipate what any rule change, initial margin, for example, will have on their behavior. But, we know
we need to be there for them today. And so we'll adapt as they adapt.

Page 17 of 31
And again, this is a very careful balance, because our view is, it need to be incredibly focused as the rules come into
frame, clearly. I mean, that's obvious. But, there can be quite a penalty, I think, paid for overreacting. And so, if you
ask me -- if I answer the question very narrowly, we have no explicit plans to adjust around that. But, when we see the
rules and we work with our clients, we'll work with them as closely as possible to adapt and make sure that their needs
are fulfilled.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Great. So we have some example of this in the energy market, right, because we've already seen some rule change and
had some behavior move from swaps to futures, and so I'm just wondering if that has given you any sense of
experience with regard to how you might behave as the other products come on-line.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I don't think it is much, for example, swaps to futures, although it could be, and it could end up looking just like the
energy market, but clients of course have been large users of futures for many, many years. And so, they always could
have used futures. So, that was always a choice. I think a good example of regulatory reform impact would be the
collection of rules, whether it was decimalization or Reg ATS, et cetera, in the equity markets in 1999 -- I think it was
in 2000 in the early part of the decade. And I think that had transformational effects, obviously, on the equity markets.
We all know that now in retrospect, and that forced us to make significant changes in our business. We had to reduce
staff significantly back in the day a very small portion of what we did in the equity business was electronic. Now, in
any given day the vast majority of what we do will be done electronically. And so, I think it's hard to predict, but the
key issue is staying very close to our clients during that period, but it's really about how we adapt. So I am not trying
evade your question, I'm just saying it's too early to speculate on how we'd adapt, but we just have to execute.
Betsy Graseck, Analyst
Right. So, be nimble and carry some capacity to manage through it?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I mean, I can't imagine reducing capacity and then trying to rebuild it, that would be really hard.

Page 18 of 31
Chris Kotowski, Analyst
Yeah, good morning. Just kind of always believing that people's actions speak louder than what they can say
sometimes. Looking at your share buybacks and going back to 2010, every single quarter the kind of the share buyback
has been in the range of somewhere between 1 billion and 1.5 billion. And conversely, every single quarter since
late-2010 your tangible common equity at the end of the period has been $63 billion or $64 billion.
So I am curious, which is the target and which is the plug? Is it that you've decided that at this kind of level of
profitability, $5 billion or $6 billion a year is the right amount of buyback or is it just $63 billion, $64 billion is all you
need to run a world-class investment bank and anything above that you can return to shareholders?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I wish the science was that precise, but unfortunately -- fortunate for you all and for us it's not that precise.
It's much more dynamic. And the way I would frame it is, we want to be very conservative about our capital and that's
the first priority. So, we will evaluate it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And certainly now with CCAR, we work
hand-in-hand with our regulators to make sure that we have a conservative capital plan.
Chris Kotowski, Analyst
Okay. But, -- just as a follow-up to that, I guess, in the context of JPMorgan allocating about $40 billion to its
investment bank, BofA, I think it's in the same area code, and obviously all the other banks and European banks
generally have less than that. What would be the argument that you need more than $63 billion, $64 billion of tangible
common to run a world-class investment bank?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Well, as it relates to us, like I said, we want to be conservative about our capital. We also want to be positioned,
because capital can make us, you know can put us in a very competitive, offensive position. I don't know how
JPMorgan and BofA allocate their capital, but probably better question for them.
Chris Kotowski, Analyst
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry. Did you say can I talk about it? I couldn't hear the exact question. I apologize.
Matt O'Connor, Analyst
So the question is, within the FICC trading businesses, have you talked about what's driven by cash versus non-cash?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No, we've not.
Matt O'Connor, Analyst
So, I had one large investment bank when I was talking to them about the whole potential revenue give-up from swaps.
They had noted to me that probably only about 15% of FICC revenues were non-cash, and obviously within that there
would some structure stuff that wouldn't be at risk.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, we haven't talked about it. I'll give you the following observation. Certainly post-2008, there was a real
desire, I think a very rational desire and a natural shift by the whole industry, driven by the clients to really focus on
simplicity away from complexity. So, you lost some of the most what I'll call the most complex aspect of derivatives,
the correlation businesses and things like that, and I don't see those returning. So, I don't see those as lost revenue
opportunities, although who knows, maybe someday far away they will. But I think that because of that, you've seen a
mix shift that was the cash, but that feels to me like it's been in place for a while.
Matt O'Connor, Analyst
And just any comment on whether it's for you or you think for the people overall that 15% is non-cash?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No comment on that.
Matt O'Connor, Analyst
Okay. And just separately, as we think about kind of the FICC revenue drivers, whether it's this year or beyond. I get a
lot of questions that debt issuance has been so strong the last couple of years, how can that we repeated? Credit spreads
have tightened so much, how can that be repeated?
And then obviously, when you talk to people in the business, they remind you that secondary trading has been weak
and has been very low margin business or a lot of low margin business. Could you just talk a little bit about the puts
and takes and if there is any way to quantify the drag from weaker secondary trading or some of the opportunity as you
move away from lower margin areas to higher margin areas.

Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think that in all these businesses and let's just take the securities vision, because you are talking about
presumable cash bond trading and secondary market activity. We benefit from basically the diversity in the collection
of businesses. So credit business maybe busier than the mortgage business in a particular day and/or particular month,
so that's how we think about it.
In terms of secondary volumes, it's not really particularly surprising to me although maybe if you'd ask me this question
a year ago I would have gotten the answers wrong that just given the incredible influx of capital into the bond space,
that managers themselves are not rotating positions as much. It'd been very directional. And so I don't know I wouldn't
be making any forecast that secondary bond trading although would be dramatically lower or dramatically higher the
second half of this year for example.
Matt O'Connor, Analyst
Okay. And then just lastly on the reinsurance business and apologize if you disclosed this in the Q, but within the
equities business you talk about in a footnote there is $1 billion of reinsurance revenues for 2012 is that all one --
driven all by one company or the one stake that you are talking about or would there be a couple of other pieces in that
as well?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
At this stage, I really can't comment beyond what's in the footnote.
Matt O'Connor, Analyst
Okay. Alright. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Jim Mitchell, Analyst
Hi. Good morning. I just would like to get maybe your thoughts longer term I think if we look at the return profile
certainly double digits is positive, but I think a good contribution came from private equity which under the Volcker
rule may shrink over time and the core business being dragged down by still pretty low returns in fixed income, so
when we think not just the next year so to look further out, do you see whether it's long dated derivatives things like
that? Are we just missing that there's significant amount of RWA mitigation over time rather than just looking out the
next year or two but beyond that that is significant enough to get returns up or do we have to see some material
improvement in the business mix to get the returns up in FICC?

So, again, I'm going to sound kind of redundant here. I think predicting multiple years in the future is really hard. I
actually think predicting six months in the future is really difficult. So, again what I would say is the following; we're
going to focus on making sure that our institutional clients can deal with us in any business they want and we want to
be best in class and we fall from perfect. So there's some of these businesses we need to work on and we can be better
and we can take advantage of our improvements relative to competitors.
Jim Mitchell, Analyst
But you should have a view though. I'm sorry, you should have a view though at least internally of what your so
long-dated high RWA type products that you expect to roll off and if there's a lot, do you have any sense or can you
give us any sense of is that a lot, a little or just that would be helpful?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I don't have that data with me, but if you're taking about sort of conditions that are on the books with clients, versus roll
off, passive roll off which we've disclosed previously. We obviously -- I think you should rest assure we study all that.
Jim Mitchell, Analyst
Okay. Maybe just on the liquidity. Can you give us any thoughts on what the new LCR ratio language, how you guys
feel you are positioned for the LCR?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Again, we finished with the strong liquidity position with $175 billion in GCE. We have no immediate concerns
regarding the LCR. We thought it was good. Actually, like a lot of these rules, that the regulators revised the rules in
the process and final rule seemed more thoughtful and well considered than the proposed rule, but no immediate
concern.

Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
Okay. And you have in terms of -- you have given risk weighted assets guidance in the recent presentation of
November of $700 billion relative to about $725 billion in the third quarter. And it sounded to me like a very small
number. I know you don't include proactive mitigation in your number, but I wonder in the $700 billion, how much
growth of risk weighted assets have you included there between the number in the third quarter and 2013 year end that
you have given. Is there material growth in that number?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No, there is no material growth in that number.
Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
And in terms of mitigation, can you give us any more details of how we should look at that considering that you are
talking about how your systems are built in order to allocate capital more efficiently? How should we think about the
$700 billion or what is really achievable even if you talk more in terms of subjective measures.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Kian, I am not quite sure what you are trying to get at, but if you really want details of all this we are happy to
follow-up with you later. We are very focused on this and you can see we increased where we are by about 100 basis
points over the course of the year, if you want more details, we are happy to follow-up with you later.
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
I think the reason why we are struggling a bit with the question is because, quite frankly you'll see this as we do it and
so it's difficult for us to forecast in a way obviously that you'd like us to.
Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
Yes, but you are constantly beating expectations and, kind of your mitigation seems to be much well ahead of the curve
than I think what you are clearly alluding to in the $700 billion which doesn't include any mitigation for your proactive
measures and I get the impression that the number that could be achieved is significantly lower and that's kind of what I
am trying to get to, but we can discuss it afterwards.
Just on the Investing & Lending expenses, to be honest I don't understand that line. I mean you have expense of about
$2 billion to $3 billion. I always think about this business like a private equity business. And your cost income ratio
however is significantly higher and your expense line is higher. What is in these expenses? I would have thought this
should be more like 25%, 30% cost income ratio business, but obviously I don't understand it. So can you explain to me
what these expenses are? I mean, I assume there are only a few hundred people, I assume there are only a few hundred
people in this division.

Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I don't know that off of top of my head. So, why don't we come back and follow-up with you?
Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
But I assume there are only few hundred peoples running --
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I don't have the answer to it.
Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
I mean, there are only few hundred -- I assume, there are only few hundred people running in this division. I can't
believe there's thousands. I would be even surprised if it's 1,000 people. So I'm just wondering why you are having $2
billion to $3 billion of expenses. Is it interest expenses or is it something else, I just don't understand why there's such a
big expense level?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We'll come back to you on it.
Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
Okay. Last question, staffing. Can you talk about -- and you've done a great job on reducing staffing this year. But, can
you talk a little about staffing trends that you would expect to see in your business this year and maybe business or
geography if there's maybe a mixed change?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No. So, there are no plans one way or another I think worth discussing. That will all be driven bottoms up by the
businesses, as it always is, in terms of the opportunities they see and how they are investing around the world in talent.
Kian Abouhossein, Analyst
And should we -- does that mean staffing sounds like it's fair to say that staffing levels today are not or shouldn't be too
dissimilar to the end of this year?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
It would be very driven by the environment.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Matthew Burnell, Analyst
Good morning. Just a couple of, I guess, quick questions for you, Harvey. First of all, in terms of the net outflows in the
non-money market side of things, in the fourth quarter, they were negative net 18. That's down pretty visibly from the
third quarter, but more in line with the fourth quarter. Is that just a seasonal trend or is there something else going on
there?
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
Are you talking about asset management?
Matthew Burnell, Analyst
Yes, on Page 12 of the release.
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
Money markets had inflows in the fourth quarter.
Matthew Burnell, Analyst
I am sorry, I meant non-money market flows?
David A. Viniar, EVP and CFO
I'm sorry. Okay.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No, I don't think there was anything particular there. I think they are just related more to client and investor activity.
But there is nothing significant there.

Matthew Burnell, Analyst
Okay. And then, I guess, in the bigger picture, Harvey, you mentioned that the backlog was up a bit versus third quarter
and up a bit year-over-year. I guess, I'm just curious in terms of your outlook if you care to provide it on M&A, there
seems to be a lot of media attention and I think some client attention on the potential opportunities for M&A given the
potential slowdown in the US and possibly in Europe, in those economies and the cash balances. Is there any greater
expense of M&A volumes coming in --announced M&A volumes coming in 2013 than you've seen in 2012?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Whether or not things are going to be announced, obviously very difficult to predict and I think it's most -- if you talk
to our investment bankers and our clients, what they will say is that the uncertainty in the economic environment
globally and certainly the political backdrop in the large economies has less yields in a position where they have been
quite conservative and you see it translated into all the things you described, large cash holdings, lots of efficiencies.
And so, I think that will be my own opinion, that will be a lagging outcome in terms of when people really feel there is
confidence and certainty, then there will be more motivation to consummate transactions, but very difficult to predict
those as you know.
Matthew Burnell, Analyst
Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.

Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Sorry, I didn't mean to make a laugh out of that question, I apologize. So, look, with respect to the ROE target or the
absence of an ROE target, there are quite frankly over the past several years there's just haven't been enough
information in the marketplace whether it was capital rules, clarity on Volcker, Title VII et cetera and so at this stage
we just don't really have enough information to give you a target. Now, having said that, what you should expect from
us and you will continue to see from us is that we remain committed to superior returns over the long-term and we want
to provide absolute superior returns and relative superior returns. So that's our focus, but we have no target.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
When do you think you'll have enough information on the capital rules Volcker and anything else that's holding you
back from having a formal target?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I think if you have been sitting here a year ago you probably would have felt like maybe there are more clarity, but as I
said earlier, I think the regulators have done a very smart thing, locally and globally, by delaying the implementation,
because it's so much simultaneous change. Even in Title VII itself, which is one suite of rules, the regulators have an
enormous task in front of them in terms of rolling out these rules and so that's just one set. And so we'll have to see.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
The assets are down 2% quarter-over-quarter. What's happening there and should we extrapolate that downsizing the
balance sheet?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
There's nothing meaningful in that. I wouldn't read anything into that.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
The buybacks, you certainly got some great prices during the year, but you went up buying back 8% of your stock, but
shares only declined by 5%. Is there any way to narrow that gap?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No, but I think if you want to go through sort of the mechanics of share count, I'm happy to have Dane and the team
follow-up with you.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
And then compensation, this is lower than last year if you look at the entire year. How should we think about the comp
ratio? I'm talking about the ratio by the way. How should we think about the comp ratio going forward?

So, as we said earlier, we're going to evaluate compensation on a year-by-year basis and we're going to incorporate
everything that you would expect us to, which is performance of the firm most importantly and then the competitive
dynamic and all the other factors that go in and of course we have to get the balance right with the shareholders. So,
we'll evaluate as the year progresses.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
And then last question, David's line was live to fight another day, so Harvey, we want your line, but if you look at the
VAR, it's down again, but you have the election over and it seems like settlements improved in certain areas. I know it's
the equity VAR is up, the other areas are down. So what's Goldman's thought process on taking risk as of today?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Right. So, I wouldn't read too much into the decline in VAR, because virtually all of that's attributed to the decline in
market volatilities and not actual positions on the desk. And in terms of deploying our capital, we feel quite confident
in our ability to do that. So, that VAR number is going to really be driven by client demand and activity, all else being
equal. So, as we continue to see a pickup in client activity, positions may change now. That may translate into lower
things in the number given offset et cetera, but the bulk of what you are seeing in the decline is market volatilities, if
not a reduction in risk for capital commitment.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
Just a clarification on that last point, the VARs what we had to go on is the best indicators in your release and you are
saying we shouldn't really rely on that then what else can we rely on? I guess do you have an apples-to-apples VAR
number that adjusts for the decline in market volatility, or if I simply ask you the question, did you guys position
yourselves from where risk absent what VAR is telling us?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Frist of all I wasn't saying you can't rely on the disclosure. So, I want to be really clear on that. I was actually trying to
give you extra information by saying the following. There are factors that go into VAR, one being the positions that we
have and then obviously a big contributor of volatilities in the marketplace themselves. So, all I am saying is in this
particular instance, the decline was mostly attributed to decline in volatility. It was no top down directive, for example,
to take less risk. All risk taking as I said will be reflective of the client flows and demand for capital.
Michael Mayo, Analyst
Got it. That's clarified. Thank you.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks and sorry about that.

Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
Thanks very much. Harvey, I hate to come back to the Basel 1 risk weighted asset question that Glenn put out several
minutes ago. But I am afraid your answer was maybe too nuanced for me to understand. But, it looks like over the past
few quarters, your RWAs were in a fairly narrow range of between $430 billion, $440 billion and then have fallen quite
significantly in this particular quarter. Can you just help me understand better why that occurred?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
So, the movement there is, I think we're going to see there, and with that we'll confirm, I think what you are seeing
there is probably the knock-on effect of our Basel 3 mitigation efforts having an impact on the ratio.
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
Okay. And just trying to --
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
You asked about Basel 1, correct?
Eric Wasserstrom, Analyst
Correct. Correct.
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer

Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca.
Christopher Wheeler, Analyst
Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. A few questions, if I may. The first one relates really perhaps, not just to you, but to
your peer group in the United States. Having seen Basel 3 in terms of capital pushed out moving to next year,
obviously if we look at Europe, that's not really the case, there is a much closer scrutiny by the regulators particularly
say in Switzerland of the Basel 3 ratios as they stand. And obviously lot of European banks, continue to deleverage.

Page 29 of 31
I mean, do you see the opportunity to actually carry out some slates which look pretty unattractive under Basel 3, but
would look attractive under Basel 1, while we go through this kind of -- this period of transition? Or, will your
regulator actually find that something they would rather you didn't participate in?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
I don't think that the pace of development, for example, of rulemaking whether it's the Basel capital rules work, for
example, in the US much further head on derivatives and et cetera. I don't think that will drive. It could be wrong by the
way. I don't think it will drive material differences in how firms compete in opportunities. I think a lot more of that is
going to be driven by relative competitive position in aggregate.
And so, if you are well positioned in a particular business, at the margin capitals and input, but it doesn't strike me that
the GAAP is so wide. But, in some cases, we are seeing competitors,, for example, in Europe exit businesses. And they
are for sure, there will be opportunities. But, I think for people that are competing and electing to stay in businesses,
you work within the rules that you have and you try and bring your competitive advantage to bear.
Christopher Wheeler, Analyst
I suppose what I'm really thinking is that, for example, as there are a number of European banks are trying to sell
securitized assets which have really high risk weightings, because they are being scrutinized slightly more closely by
the market, but as I said, also by the regulators surely in terms of the US banks there's opportunity to say actually in
terms of reporting we don't have to worry about that from a short-term perspective and the ability to buy some quite
attractive assets and then obviously place them without your clients. I'm just thinking that might be actually quite an
interesting opportunity for you or do you think it's something that might lead to sort of some montage like active
comments really in the place?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No. I mean, we look at Basel 3 over the long-term too. And like I said, I think it's not the pace. Now, having said that,
do I think some European banks and just many institutions around the globe have maybe been a little slower to sell
assets than they might otherwise wanted to be in retrospect. And I think there's opportunities there, but those are
opportunities that our clients are very focused on. If we can be the firm that can bring the collective resources to bear to
actually deliver those assets to our clients then that's a good opportunity for us. But like I said, I'm not sure it's so much
rule-driven as it is situation-specific.
Christopher Wheeler, Analyst
Okay. And then a second question really it's related to what Kian asked you and I guess it's a rhetorical question for that
reason, but can you give us any clue to what your Basel 3 or what portion of your Basel 3 risk weighted assets at the
moment are deployed in Investing & Lending?

No. Not this time.

Christopher Wheeler, Analyst

of jobs in the last few days and what was intriguing which I think something like 6% reduction in Investment Banking
staff but something like 15% in Asia. And I was just wondering you obviously had another quarter, where you were
very tight on staff numbers. But is Asia the market you are still investing in or is it one way maybe you are also
thinking have we perhaps overlaid the putting at this stage and we need to also look at our starting as you obviously are
in the developed markets?
Harvey M. Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer
No. As we look at it today we think the growth markets broadly and Asia specifically were quite attractive. And we are
comfortable with our level of investment.
