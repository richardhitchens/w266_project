MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for
today's conference Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elena Doom
Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Here
with me today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson. This call and
webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor.
Please note that elements of today's presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of
the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret
them in that light. We also identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K
and other SEC filings.
This morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter, and the full year 2012, as well as share with
you our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2013, and finally, we'll leave time for your questions. With that, I'll
turn the call over to Dave Cote.
David M. Cote
Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone.
As you can see, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter despite a still challenging macro environment. As we've
said before, our goal is to be known as a company that outperforms and delivers in both good times and bad, and I think

our performance and track record really shows that.
We had modest sales growth in the quarter, it was up about 1% on an organic basis; yet we still continued to drive
margin expansion, up 50 basis points to 15.6%, as well as pro forma EPS growth of 9% on an adjusted basis and that's
using the same tax rate in both periods.
So, we're starting 2013 with some positive momentum. First, the short cycle order rates are improving slightly overall,
with stabilization in key developed regions and some pockets of growth, particularly in China and some other high
growth regions, and that suggests a modest improvement in end market conditions.
Second, pension is expected to generate income of $50 million to $75 million this year, and that reflects the proactive
funding we've done to date coupled with a higher than expected return on assets last year.
And third, the euro exchange rate is a bit better. Our outlook assumed an average euro-dollar rate of $1.25, and we're
tracking above those levels today but who knows what's going to happen with 11 months left in the year.
So for now, we're cautiously optimistic, but it's just too early to tell what direction the economy is going, and we're all
well too familiar with the issue. Big democracies around the world are still in gridlock over debt, and the U.S. is
kicking the debt can down the road and finding that kick doesn't quite go as far as it used to. All of these factors make
forecasting what's going to happen a real challenge.
So, we think it's prudent to remain conservative given that uncertainty. To the extent the items noted are better, it builds
contingency to ensure we achieve our commitment. We'll update you in March at our annual investor conference as we
always do.
Given the potential economic difficulty, we're staying conservative in our sales outlook, controlling costs, and
leveraging our enablers, the Honeywell Operating System, the Velocity Product Development and Functional
Transformation just like we did in '11 and '12. We're planning conservatively and we're staying flexible ensuring that
we can continue to respond to changes in the market.
We're also in the enviable position of having over $320 million of previously funded in-process repositioning which we
continue to execute, and this will give us a lift in 2013 as well as in future years.
2013 will be another year of outperformance for Honeywell, and our focus on evolving in everything we do to become
better and better creates a bright future even beyond this year. Our strong pipeline of new wins is setting us up for a
multi-year cycle of outperformance.
As example, aerospace was awarded the 737 MAX fleet air system and several other mechanical system wins. They
signed an agreement to provide cyber jet with our Primus Apex avionics and there are also several other unannounced
wins and that's just in aerospace. At the Honeywell level, we finished the year with a record backlog roughly $15.8
billion with new platform wins across many of our businesses last year.
To support this growth, we sustained high levels of R&D spending, up approximately 25% versus 2010. We've also
increased CapEx spending 11% last year and will increase it again this year ensuring that we meet our commitments to
our customers, particularly in PMT.
So from the earlier stages of developing innovative new products that customers value to executing on that delivery, the
Honeywell pipeline looks full. We're developing a thinking company, not thinking as in spending days in
contemplation or thinking as in anarchy so you don't have to do what's requested, but rather thinking as in
understanding why we do things. That concept underlies our big process initiatives like the Honeywell Operating
System, Velocity Product Development and functional transformation. We want to be able to do everything right and
fast.
It's through our continued evolution that will sustain our outperformance. In a slow growth global economy, this
becomes especially important for margin rate growth. These tools have become part of the Honeywell culture along
with our strong operating disciplines and shared best practices; all translating into meaningful productivity gains.

We think that puts us in an excellent position to achieve our 2014 sales and margin commitment as a company. Having
great positions in good industries, the power of One Honeywell, our consistent focus on improving every year in each
of our five initiatives, it really makes a difference. And as always, we'll update you on our progress in March at our
annual investor conference, which it will be focused this year on delivering 2014.
We plan to highlight a number of tailwinds driving enhanced growth and productivity across each of our businesses
which we expect will allow us to deliver on our long-term target and beyond. Again, we have a high level of
confidence that these targets are in range and achievable which makes for a very exciting future, and we look forward
to delivering on that opportunity. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David John Anderson
Thanks, Dave, good morning everyone; thanks for participating in this morning's call.
Let's go to Slide 4 entitled 4Q 2012 results, and I'm just going to take you through the summer results for the quarter,
which as you know came in largely as expected when we gave you our December outlook. Sales for the quarter of $9.6
billion were up 1% on both a reported and organic basis, and on a regional basis the U.S. was up approximately 2%,
Europe was down 3%, China sales were up approximately 10%.
Now sales did come in a little bit better than we expected in December as a result of both improved organic growth in
ACS as well as transportation systems and also favorability in terms of our assumption on foreign exchange, and all of
this drove approximately $50 million in terms of higher sales.
Segment profit was up 5% in the quarter; segment margins expanded 50 basis points. I'm going to walk you through the
individual drivers when we go through each of the businesses in just a moment, but at a high level, productivity
continues to be very strong, more than offsetting inflation and enabling continued investment for growth.
Below the line for the quarter was as expected, which was also consistent with our prior run rates and no surprises
there, and the tax guidance on that, it was higher than normal at 30.6%, which was in keeping with our full year 26.5%
rate that we also guided to.
Now, pro forma earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment for
pension, was $1.10, an increase of 5% on a year-over-year basis. However, if you normalize for taxes, which recall
didn't impact the full year, just the quarters, EPS growth would have been 9%.
In fourth quarter, reported EPS was $0.32, which included roughly $1 billion of pre-tax mark-to-market. This reflects a
discount rate of 4.06% and a return on assets for the year of 13.5%. And finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3
billion representing approximately 150% free cash flow conversion.
So with that summary for the quarter, let's go to a similar format and summary for the full year 2012 on Slide 5. 2012
sales were up 3% on both a reported and an organic basis to $37.7 billion. Segment profit was up 10%, more than three
times the growth in sales demonstrating impressive conversion and resulted in 90 basis points of margin expansion to
15.6%, so it's another record year. And you'll recall that in 2011 we grew segment margin by 90 basis points over 2010,
so an impressive back-to-back performance by Honeywell.
Now all of this resulted in pro forma earnings per share of $4.48, up 11% over 2011. You'll recall we set the bar pretty
high for 2012, and we delivered at the high end of the range. And finally, free cash flow was $3.7 billion representing
over 100% conversion, demonstrating a consistently high quality of earnings and working capital management, while
funding approximately $100 million of higher CapEx in 2012 compared to full year 2011.
So, now let's go to aerospace on Slide 6. And you can see here fourth quarter sales for aero slightly down driven by the
expected 6% decline in defense and space, partially offset by continued good growth on the commercial side.
Now, commercial OE was up 5% in the quarter, air transport up 6%, business and general aviation up 4%, both
benefiting from our strong positions on key new platforms.

Page 4 of 16
And for the year, commercial OE was up 19%, or 12% if you exclude the impact of the prior year's BGA OE payments
and the EMS acquisition, so really kind of giving you, if you want, an organic look in terms of commercial OE growth.
All of that was driven by increased deliveries for both large air transport as well as business jets. We saw the benefits in
growth in Boeing and Airbus deliveries resulting from the ongoing wrap-up in production rate, and also the continued
healthy demand in the mid-to-large cabin business aircraft segment where as you know we're well positioned and we
continue to outperform.
Now, the commercial aftermarket for aero: sales were up 3% in the quarter, ATR was roughly flat, air transport roughly
flat. We saw some moderating growth as expected in business aviation in the aftermarket as we begin to lap
significantly tougher year-over-year comps.
We also saw higher U.S. airline inventories and that weighed somewhat on spares orders in the fourth quarter.
However, overall flight hours remained positive, up 1% in the fourth quarter, and we expect flight hour growth as you'll
recall to be up in the 2.5% to 3.5% range in 2013, which will continue to drive growth in the aftermarket albeit at a
slower rate than what we experienced in '12.
Now for defense and space, I talked about the 6% down as expected in the quarter. We lapped, of course, difficult
comps that resulted from the wind-down of the TIGER program, and we had lower space sales and some other
programmatic completions, but again on track relative to expectations.
For the full year DNS was down 3%, slightly better than we had originally planned for the year. And Mike Madison
and the team – Tim Mahoney and the team really deserve a lot of credit for their pursuit of international opportunities
which are continuing to mitigate some of the budget headwinds that we expect in both 2013 and beyond.
Now margins for aerospace in the fourth quarter expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 19.9%. For the year,
segment margins grew 130 basis points to 18.9% as a result of terrific sales conversion, also driven by commercial
excellence in material and operational productivity. I'd also point out that adjusted for the BGA OE payments that I've
referenced earlier, aero's margins would still have been up an impressive 60 basis points in the year.
So let's now go to ACS on Slide No. 7 and take you through again the highlights for both the fourth quarter as well as
for the full year of 2012. Sales for ACS were up 3% in the fourth quarter on both reported and organic basis, in line
with the full year organic rate of about 3%. Regionally the U.S. was up 4%, Europe was up 1%, China was up 7%
organically with signs of stability in the developed markets and also obviously improvement in high growth regions,
namely China in the quarter.
Let's go through some of the highlights for the major business segments of ACS. For ESS, for energy safety and
security, sales were up 4% on organic basis, reflecting an uptick from the roughly flat sales growth we had through the
first three quarters of 2012.
Now, environmental combustion and control, ECC, saw a significant improvement, up 6% organically in the quarter,
driven by modest recovery in the North America and China markets, but also easier year-over-year comps.
We also saw continued strength in both security and scanning and mobility driven by new product introductions as well
as contract wins, and importantly, we believe the sensing and control business declines have now leveled off. And this
is important obviously because this business has really been a leading indicator for our shorter cycle businesses, and
we're expecting improvement there over the course of 2013.
Process solution sales for ACS were up 3% organically in the quarter. Project orders were down driven by continued
extension of project timing by customers, and also difficult comps versus the fourth quarter of 2011 where we booked
several very large projects. You'll recall us talking about that in the December guidance call in terms of really that
expectation for HPS orders.
Important to note we have seen an improvement in backlog margins for HPS. That's really due to the continued focus
on accretive growth, and it's been a contributor to ACS's overall margin rate improvement.

Finally, for building systems, our building solutions and distribution, BSD, sales were up 1% organically in the quarter.
We continue to see energy orders push out due to a challenging funding and capital oversight environment for building
solutions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe and this has been partially offset by good growth in China and also in
some of the other high growth regions.
Now, I think what really is notable on this slide is the ACS margins, up a strong 110 basis points in the quarter to
15.5%, which by the way is a new record for ACS, and this performance was driven by again the theme of commercial
excellence and productivity net of inflation. For the year, segment margins for ACS were up an impressive 70 basis
points to 14.1%, and importantly, ACS had margin expansion in 2012 in every business.
So, now let's take a quick look at PMT on Slide 8, performance materials and technologies. You can see PMT delivered
another strong year with record sales and segment margins while continuing to invest for growth.
Sales for the fourth quarter for PMT were up 8%, 2% organic, of course the 8% driven primarily by the Thomas
Russell acquisition as well as new product applications in advanced materials. Those mitigated a weak macro
environment across advanced materials.
Now the fourth quarter sales at UOP were up 13% reported, but down 4% organic as expected due to the timing of
catalyst shipments, with a big catalyst quarter expected now in the first quarter of 2013. For the year, UOP sales were
up 17%, 12% organically. They ended the year with record backlog of $2.8 billion, up 49% year-over-year, or 18%
organically, driven in part by a series of major wins for its technology to produce petrochemicals from both natural gas
as well as coal.
Now advanced materials for PMT were up 5% in the quarter, 5% organically consistent with the positive growth we've
seen in some of our other short cycle businesses. However, fluorine products and resins and chemicals continue to see
tough markets overall and we will expect that to continue somewhat in 2013. That said, we also expect a ramp up in
new product offerings as we enter important new products and those are going to provide tailwinds for us over the
course of 2013 into 2014.
Segment profit for PMT was down 6%, but up 11% for the year. Margins in the quarter as expected down about 200
basis points, primarily by the lower UOP catalyst shipments I've referenced and also some unfavorable resins and
chemicals price to raws relationship. However, for the year, segment margins for PMT were up 30 basis points to
18.7%, so a very impressive 2012 for PMT.
And we continue to expect – we get this question a lot – about PMT and in terms of the ongoing run rate in terms of its
margins rates, and we expect that to continue to be in the 18%, 18.5% plus range. Andres and his team will continue to
execute on a number of smart investments and continue to capitalize on growth opportunities that lie ahead, and I'm
sure he'll probably talk about that in our March investor day.
Transportation systems, Slide No. 9, performing well despite the challenging European macro environment. Sales in
the quarter were down 8% organically in TS against a very difficult quarter for light vehicle production in terms of the
industry. We anticipate that industry down approximately 10% year-over-year. However, TS is seeing the benefit of
new platform launches. It's also seeing its higher gas penetration benefits in both the U.S. as well as in China.
Now, we saw some signs of stabilization in Europe as we exited December, coupled with a modest uptick in China for
the fourth quarter. However, we continue to expect a difficult environment for Europe in the first quarter and we think
it's prudent to plan, as Dave said plan conservatively, and watch the market closely while preparing for an upturn later
in the year 2013.
Segment margins were down for TS 130 basis points in the quarter, but just 50 basis points for the year. And, of course,
the margin degradation driven by lower volumes, some unfavorable mix in foreign exchange partially offset by very
strong productivity actions by Alex and his team.
Now we're investing obviously to continue to improve the efficiency and flexibility of transportation systems, and
we've got an overall cost – improved cost and competitive footprint in both turbo and friction, and we're going to see
these benefits driving further productivity gains as we progress over the course of '13 and of course 2014.

So let's now go to Slide No. 10 and just do a quick repeat of our 2013 guidance. As you can see, we're reaffirming
2013. Our '12 results finished as expected, and as Dave referenced, the year-end U.S. fiscal compromise didn't do much
to change our view of the macro environment; that uncertainty still hangs out there.
Now we're still expecting sales to be up on a reported basis 4% to 5%, 1% to 3% on an organic basis. One thing I do
want to point out here is that we planned, and this builds on Dave's point that he mentioned in his opening remarks, for
the midpoint of our guidance to be an average rate of 1.25 for the euro. We continue to think that's the prudent planning
approach. However, as we've indicated on the bottom right of the page, a strong euro or a stronger euro is one of the
drivers that could push sales and segment profit towards the high end of our range, and obviously on the other hand
business mix, other items, could push us to the lower end.
Now, below the line items have some puts and takes but we're expecting the net to be favorable on a year-over-year
basis, and a component of this is that $50 million to $75 million of pension income in 2013 that we now expect, slightly
more tailwind than we indicated when we gave guidance in December.
Now, this positive is driven by the proactive funding we've done to date, and you'll recall that funding in '10, '11 as well
as '12. It's also attributable to a higher than expected return on planned assets in 2012 and partially offset by a lower
assumed rate of return that's effective in 2013.
Now we're still operating with a range for pension income given the form plan estimates which we don't anticipate to
be finalized for a few more months. Now, importantly, on the tax front, we're still planning for a 26.5% rate unchanged
from 2012.
Earnings per share $4.75 to $4.95 up 6% to 11% over the $4.48 for 2012, and we'll continue to generate strong free
cash flow despite higher levels of CapEx spending it will have this year to really fund growth investments.
So in summary, we're sticking with our guidance from December with a higher level of confidence, and with potential
upside that for now we think makes sense, as Dave said, to hold as contingency and could be used among other things
to fund repositioning and other actions in the year given the uncertainty that is still prevalent in the economy.
So, now let's go to Slide 11 and let's talk about the so what of that for the first quarter. For the first quarter, we're
expecting sales as you can see to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion, flat to up 2% on a reported basis.
EPS, we're expecting to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.15 in line with that 6% to 11% increase that we're looking for the
full year for 2013 and represents roughly 23% of our full year guidance, so that's in line with our normal linearity.
So with that, let's take a look at the businesses; just a couple of points on the first quarter for each of them. Barrel we
expect sales to be roughly flat to down slightly on a year-over-year basis driven by a continued modest defense and
sales decline. We're thinking the DNS will be down about 3%, and also some challenging comps on the commercial
side both on the OE side particularly BGA, and also on the aftermarket.
ACS sales we expect to be flat to up 2%. Overall, we're seeing stability in their major end markets with pockets of
growth emerging. We're also expecting low single-digit growth in both HPS and BSD which are in line with those
recent order trends that I talked to you about.
For PMT, we're expecting sales up 7% to 9% or flat to down slightly on an organic basis, and driven by a robust quarter
for catalyst shipments in UOP and the addition of obviously Thomas Russell adding to that reported growth providing
tailwind to us. Advanced materials on the other hand is expecting mid-to-high single-digit declines due to the
challenging end market dynamics and also some lower volumes for PMT.
Finally, in transportation systems, we're expecting sales to be down 5% to 7% driven by continued weak light vehicle
production particularly in Europe as we referenced earlier, and we're also expecting EU light vehicle production that is
the industry to be down again in the first quarter in the range of about 10% and we also expect some continued foreign
currency headwinds, and again that may be mitigated, but we continue to see some favorability in terms of our euro to
dollar assumption.

So as you can see, relatively modest planning assumptions around the top line sales across the business, but generating
again very good EPS growth in terms of our outlook for the first quarter.
So with that, Elena, before we go to Q&A let me just summarize on Slide No. 12. Obviously, 2012 was another great
year for Honeywell, another year of outperformance. We set and we met high expectations, particularly as it relates to
earnings growth in cash generation.
Now we also continue to invest for the future. Doing, as Dave said, smart things that will continue to deliver value in
future periods. Now, as we turn the page to 2013, we're planning another year of strong margin expansion in a slow
growth environment. We've seen signs of stability. The horizon looks a little brighter than it did even a couple of weeks
ago, but nothing suggests that anything less than conservative planning is best at this point.
The Honeywell playbook is working. We're continuing to evolve as a thinking company. We're improving and
leveraging our key process enablers and our productivity tools. We're growing faster than our served markets and we're
doing everything more efficiently to drive continued outperformance versus our peers.
Now, 2013 is an exciting year for us, not just because of what we're going to do this year, but because it's another
yardstick closer to the 2014 targets we set back in 2010. We've got a lot of momentum as we prepare to make the final
push for 2014 with tailwinds across a number of the businesses for growth as well as increased productivity.
And again, as Dave said, this is going to be the focus of our upcoming March 16 (sic) [March 6] (29:20) Investor
Conference in New York City: delivering 2014 from innovation to execution. And as we continue to evolve as a
company, the strong portfolio that we've created, the unified One Honeywell culture and our continuous improvement
process disciplines, these are the keys to how we're going to deliver the 2014 targets and continue to position for strong
outperformance beyond that. So with that now, Elena, let's go over to you for Q&A.
Elena Doom
Thanks, Dave. Just one clarification: so investor conference March 6th in New York City.
David John Anderson
Thank you very much.
Elena Doom
Kevin, if you could now open the line, we'll take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: One of the things that you didn't address in the presentation was cash reinvestment for 2013. I'm
just guessing since you don't have to make a pension contribution, you're probably sitting on a fair amount of cash at
this point. I mean, what's your thought on potentially buying back some stock or are there more deals out there like
Thomas Russell that maybe you can comment on that.

<A - David M. Cote>: Well, a couple of comments then I'll turn it over to Dave, but I think we did go through a bunch
of that in the December call; our plan hasn't really changed all that much. We raised the dividend by 10%. We bought
back some shares in December last year. We're saying we'll hold share count about flat with the fourth quarter this year.
And as we've said in the past, I mean, the policy still hasn't changed when it comes to acquisitions and additional
repurchases, we're going to be opportunistic about what do we think makes sense. So, hasn't really changed from what
we said in December. Dave, anything you want to add?
<A - David John Anderson>: No, I would say absolutely we're on track for that, and you obviously fund the Intermec
acquisition, Dave, during the course of the year. The one thing I would just say is obviously as the acquisition pipeline
continues to be attractive, we're going to continue to leverage our strong disciplines, both in terms of price paid as well
as execution and integration. But that looks good, I think the share buyback is absolutely on track, we're going to have
over $1.3 billion cash outflow for dividends in 2013, and obviously very positive feedback that we're getting in terms
of that continued rate of growth on the dividend. So, that's really the story, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Fair enough. One of the highlights to me in the quarter at least is the ACS margin and we've
talked about this I think for several quarters, things have been progressing really nicely there. I mean, I don't think on
our model we had ACS margins over 58 until like 2016 or something, so you're way ahead of that pace. When you
think about this quarter, the 15.5% number, you reference kind of positive inflation impact and maybe that has some
impact but help us understand what's sustainable in that kind of over 15% level and what may be more transitory or
mix-related.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, for ACS, I mean none of this stuff is transitory. This is kind of consistent with that
concept of evolution and everything that we do that we talked about is we're just going to keep steadily building on
what we've done before. So, I fully expect ACS continues to increase their margin rates, just like I expected in aero, I
expected in PMT and TS and total company. But we're not – very settled, in fact, I can't think of any transitory or
one-time gains that we generally ever let fall through on anything; we tend to use those for repositioning. So, I'd say
very sustainable. Dave? Anything you want to...
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, I'd just say that we have 14.1% margin for ACS for the year, which is a record.
We're going to continue to build there. It's really – we hope we're going to get a little more volume leverage – that
would be terrific. I mean, I think we would see really terrific conversion there given everything that Roger and the team
are doing on the productivity, on the cost side of the equation. So, you're going to see – there's going to be sequential
differences. First quarter is going to be different than the fourth quarter, but when you look at really year-over-year as
Dave said, it's a sustained improvement that we're really targeting. And the business is confident that they're going to
be able to deliver.
<A - David M. Cote>: In the formula, Scott, you know the formula that we're using.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah. No, I think what I was specifically referencing is you do talk about inflation, so I'm
guessing that if there's a price cost spread that's in there that has some sort of an impact that we wouldn't want to model
that going forward. So, I'm not talking about one-time gains or anything like that.
<A - Elena Doom>: Scott, on the price to cost side it's actually slightly unfavorable, but ACS is mitigating that through
strong material productivity, and even building on the performance in the quarter, they also offset a negative mix of
roughly 20, 30 basis points in the quarter. So, I think it's productivity across the board both in terms of operational
productivity and material productivity.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: That's impressive. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: All right. Thanks, Scott.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Nice quarter. So, obviously, you alluded to the fact that you've got a bit more contingency in the plan
due to maybe where the FX rate is right now and some other factors such as pension, but obviously, keeping a
conservative view on the year but I'm wondering if we're in a situation now where perhaps there's actually more good
guys than bad guys as we go through the year, how does the repo pipeline look at this point, and is the policy to
accelerate repo this year and maybe follow through next year, or do you see the potential for maybe a balance between
industrial and repo and perhaps upside to the plan?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, we always want flexibility on repositioning. We're always looking at projects, but as you
know, we've got over $300 million worth of projects that are already funded that we need to work our way through. So
we like having the flexibility in the event that there is a really good idea that comes forward, but just executing on what
we've already funded is going to be a real boost for us going forward. I think we've provided those numbers for this
year, and I don't know about 2014.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah, the incremental benefit that we're assuming is roughly $150 million in 2013.
<A - David M. Cote>: This year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Does that then flow through into '14 as well? Is there an incremental into '14, too?
<A - Elena Doom>: There is, Nigel. Off the top of my head I don't have that and I think that's something that we can
provide certainly in March.
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, the important thing maybe, Elena, just to add to that is we funded on a gross basis
$120 million of repositioning in 2012.
<A - David M. Cote>: On top of what we'd already done.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...we already have done. So, and by the way some very attractive payback projects. So,
what you'll see, Nigel, and we can follow-up on that, and clearly we'll have more about that when we get together on
March 6, that you are going to see there is strong – there'll continue to be strong incremental benefit that will flow into
2014.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Fantastic. And then just digging into PMT margins, I was just wondering what impact the Thomas
Russell acquisition had due to access in accounting in the quarter and you also mentioned unfavorable price rules, and
you guys have done a great job of mitigating the raw material volatility particularly within the resins business, and I'm
wondering has there been a change in the dynamic now where price rules becomes more of an impact going forward?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, on Thomas Russell, we had obviously favorability in terms of – I cited that when I talked
about the reported versus the organic sales contribution that Thomas Russell made. Also, Thomas Russell was actually
accretive in the fourth quarter. We actually had – it made a positive contribution. We had talked about that earlier, just
in terms of the excitement that we have for the transaction both in terms of the tremendous complement that it gives to
our current gas technology and gas positioning in UOP, but also what we think we can do to continue to leverage its
strength, its marketplace strength, in terms of the financial performance. So we saw that in the fourth quarter. We're
going to see it continue to benefit obviously in 2013.
<A - Elena Doom>: But it was margin rate dilutive – yeah, about 40 basis points in the quarter.
<A - David M. Cote>: Margin rate dilutive. Yeah, thank you.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yep, yep. On the price rules?
<A - David M. Cote>: Our price rules, well, RAC has been dealing with the decreasing spread throughout the year. I
don't see the spread getting worse during the course of this year, but that's something that they just work on managing
going forward, and like you said, it's become less -significantly less of an issue for us just in terms of how we manage

We'll take our next question from the site of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein and Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey, so, just first question, is the defense and space view of sequestration changing
and/or changed at all since the fall based on the activities over the last month?
<A - David M. Cote>: No. I would say we're staying in the same place we've always been, and that's playing
conservatively there because you just don't know what those guys are going to do down there.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then you commented on the energy orders push out in BSD. Can you give us
a little more color on what you're seeing there in North America and what your sense is for that changing?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah I think the whole market has slowed down just because state municipal budgets are all
struggling to get money right now to even investigate or look at anything. Even though these end up being cost-free
projects, it still just causes everything to slow down. And that's the phenomenon that we're dealing with, and it's across
the industry.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And transport for next year, I mean given your comments on friction, historically,
I think hoping for breakeven by 2014 and all that, are you still kind of hanging in there for that business unit over the
next six months?
<A - David M. Cote>: As in what sense?
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: As in thinking about their ability to drive to the margin targets, given what's going on in
friction as well as volumes in Europe.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, we think they have a doable plan. We're going to continue to fund the transformation that
we've talked about, and it's not the most pleasant of situations to deal with, but we're going to stick with it.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And maybe just one last, you mentioned the words you mentioned about six times was –
and in the presentation, 2014 and beyond and that we're going to hear about 2014 and beyond in March. Can you just
give us a little clarity and are you suggesting that you might be thinking about more specific targets this year as
opposed to next, or are you just sort of speaking generally?
<A - David M. Cote>: Very generally.

<A - David M. Cote>: The great unveiling will be in 2014 of the next five-year plan.

We'll go next to the site of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, folks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, can you just post us up where we actually finished on pension from a funded status both
in percentages and dollars, and should we expect that you are done funding for really the foreseeable future?
<A - David John Anderson>: We finished at about 85%, maybe a little less than that, in terms of funded status for the
year. I think that's about $3.5 billion dollars in terms of underfunded balance. And I'd say in terms of the second part of
your question, in terms of are we done, I think that's very much TBD. As we've talked about before, and as you're very
familiar, this is a very discount rate sensitive phenomenon. The math is really driven significantly by discount rate and
we talked about this a little bit in December. If you just go back to the numbers in terms of discount rate that we had in
2009, 2010 in the 5% to 5.25% range, you're basically at a fully funded status. So, I think it's prudent for us to have
done what we've done, which is to done the pre-funding over the course of '10, '11 and '12 to be in the position that we
are now. We've seen obviously continued historic lower rates, we've had headwinds in terms of number of our major
markets, so I think now is an excellent time for us to shift that focus, do what we're doing for 2013 in terms of capital
and cash redeployment, but we're going to have to say it's a wait-and-see attitude where hopefully what we're going to
see is some improvement in terms of rates and that's going to really address most of this issue.
Meanwhile, on the accounting side, we're going to benefit here in 2013 as we've said from a little bit of pension income
and we expect that will probably continue into 2014 at about that same level given where rates are today. Again, that is
also interest rate or discount rate sensitive. So, I think for now we feel very comfortable with what we're doing, the
strategy that we've employed, and it will have to be wait-and-see going forward to make any kind of further statement
in terms of beyond '13 or '14 in terms of funding.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great, thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Just to add to that, we wanted to kind of stay in this sweet spot, where at some point rates do go
up, markets will do better, and you don't want to be in a position where all of a sudden you end up with a significant
overfunded plan. By the same token, you don't want to be in a position where you don't have critical mass in the
pension so that when things do get better, rates go up, whatever, you still stay underfunded. So, we've been trying to
manage that sweet spot, and we think we're there. And with just a little bit of help from rates and from market return,
then there should be no need to put money in the pension fund for a while.
<A - David John Anderson>: One other quick thing, David, if I could add which is effective also at the beginning of
this year we've lowered our rate of return assumption from 8% to 7.75%, which we also think is smart, and again is
consistent with our conservative approach on this issue. So, that's another element of the chapter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah, just backing into some rough numbers, so it looks like if you earn your ROA, you
actually earn enough to pay your annual benefits payable and you hold this thing stable as long as discount rates don't
go over.
<A - David John Anderson>: Right. I think that's...
<A - David M. Cote>: Pretty much, yeah.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah. Just on the deal front, do you still see Intermec closing in the May timeframe and given
that Thomas Russell is off to a strong start, have you raised your sights a little bit there on accretion for 2013?

<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say with Intermec, we'll see. But that's kind of the way we're thinking about it now is
sometime during the second quarter. With Thomas Russell, yeah, we're really pretty excited about what that can do for
us in terms of what we can get on the order side. So, I think we can grow that pretty well.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just one other quick one, just thinking about this contingency that's been created
early in the year, should we think of any upside from dollar, euro falling through kind of at the average Honeywell
margin rate, or is there some other complexity there to think about?
<A - Elena Doom>: Jeff, the sensitivity is really for every penny, it's roughly $50 million in sales and about $7 million
of operating income. It's sort of our back-of-the-envelope math that [inaudible] (46:48).

We'll go next to the site of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I have two questions, Dave and Dave and Elena. First, you've done
some very interesting drop-in and complementary acquisitions of late, and you've talked about Thomas Russell a little
bit. Could you just elaborate a little bit and give us a little sense of how some of the other acquisitions have done lately
in terms of complementing what you've done, EMS stands out as another example?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say, well, it's not just the recent past. If you take a look at the whole 10 years, the acquisition
process that we have really works. I mean, I am hard-pressed to think of one that's been bad that was of any
consequence, we had some smaller ones that didn't work out as well as we'd hoped, but nothing has been a big miss.
So, EMS, to your point, stands out because there we ended up getting a $2.8 billion order that we hadn't even counted
on as part of the valuation.
Thomas Russell has been excellent right from the start and we think the opportunity there is going to be even bigger.
We're excited about what we think Intermec can do to broaden our portfolio and so on. We've built a great safety
products presence. So, I think this is one of those capabilities that we really have as a company. It's not something that
we do as a one-off every four or five years, dust off the book and figure out what you have to do. It's more kind of in
the psyche of the company; it's just how we do things. So, they've all worked out pretty well. I can't think of one that
isn't something to brag about.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: No, I agree. I just thought maybe there was something to add in terms of how it's one plus –
I don't want to use the trite expression one plus one is getting three, but there is an element of what you've found is that
– as you've done some of these, there's other market opportunities that have been uncovered and that's what the focus of
the question was.
<A - David M. Cote>: Oh well that part is true. It's one of the nice things about kind of broadening our portfolio is that
we end up seeing more new areas to be able to go into. And EMS is a good example because that has really broadened
the – opened the aperture for aerospace as they think about what they do in that segment.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then to follow-up just to go on aerospace, you've had a number of notable wins; some
are announced and some are not. How are you thinking, Mr. Anderson, about the incremental BGA investments this
year?
<A - David John Anderson>: And, Howard, are you talking specifically about some of the RD&E investment?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes.
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, as we've said, we are looking for aero to be basically flat on a RD&E as a percent
of sales, we talked about that when we gave our December guidance. It's a good question, because I think one of the

challenges we have overall at aerospace is it's an opportunity-rich environment. And despite us being selective, and
that's something that we've been very I think clear in terms of our direction with aero, it's something that I think it's
really served us very well and it's going to continue to serve us very well in the future, the fact of the matter is it's a
robust pipeline. And we'll continue to manage that. And we just – I think it's one of the things that we've just gotten
better at in terms of execution. It also underscores, as Dave talked about, just our operating disciplines and just getting
better in terms of managing innovation, program management and delivery. You're just going to see that translate, we
think, into just even a stronger aerospace in the future, stronger aerospace group for Honeywell in the future, Howard.
And also, it's consistent with what we continue to say in terms of the upside that will translate into margin expansion
and improvement for the group. So, the BGA opportunities are big. As you said, there's opportunities there that haven't
been announced, publicly announced or stated, but we think that pipeline is very rich and we'll continue to manage it
effectively.

We'll take our next question from the site of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, you guys gave a backlog number last year. I think this year you gave just the long cycle
backlog. Last year, I think it was 16.2 of which 74% was going to be shipped in 2012. This year I think it's 15.8. If you
could just give me either the total backlog, and then more importantly, what you expect that long cycle backlog, how
much of that is going to be shipped this year in 2013.
<A - Elena Doom>: Steve, the comparable number that you're looking for is $16.8 billion. In terms of the comparable
number, the $15.8 billion that we quoted is really the long cycle backlog that would ship within 24 months. So there's...
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Gotcha. That's very helpful. On the PMT margins, I think you said going forward 18 to
18.5. You guys did 18.7 this year, but you guided up 0 to 20, so maybe you could just clarify those comments?
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, I think when I was talking about that, Steve, I was talking about longer term
sustainable targets directionally. One of the things that we've been asked a lot is can PMT sustain this kind of
performance, this kind of performance track record. So what I was really referencing was the fact that we have
confidence. Another way of saying it is we have confidence in PMT's ability to do that. The collection of the
technologies that we possess, the market positions, the richness of the NPI, the new product backlog in terms from
research standpoint, as well as what we just see in terms of the continued global macro trends and market opportunities.
And you take an example of that now the addition of Thomas Russell and our key position in natural gas liquids. And
we've acquired a company there that's basically got a U.S. footprint with significant growth continued in the U.S. but
also now international expansion opportunities. That's the type of thing I'm saying in terms of the sustainability is really
what you should look to as opposed to a specific number.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Great. And then one last question just on the incremental pension tailwind. How do we read you
guys as having this kind of like hedge out there as opposed to you guys have been pretty smart in the past about taking
some of this upside and offsetting it with restructuring. Do we read this as there's nothing you really worry about today,
so the likelihood of that just kind of flows through, or that you're kind of out of opportunities for restructuring. Just a
little curious as to why you're kind of not right away kind of calling that out and saying at some point we're going to
offset that with restructuring?
<A - David M. Cote>: Here's the way I would look at it is over the last two, three weeks, let's say, some of the
economic news looks like it's gotten better. But this is not the first time we see two or three weeks that look good

followed by stuff that really doesn't look good at all. And government is still not showing a capacity for dealing with its
debt problems. And we are all concerned that at some point this thing turns again and turns in the other direction, and
we just think the smart thing to do now is to stay conservative and stay prepared. I see very little downside to being
prepared for the downside, and that's the way we're just looking at it, and we're saying, okay, better to have this in our
pocket and be prepared to deal with that downside if it doesn't happen, well, there is restructuring opportunity, there's
let it fall through opportunity, there may be other investments that we'll do. But right now, just because the news looks
a little better the last couple of weeks but we just don't think this is a good time to declare economic victory.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

And we'll take our final question from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, John.
<A - David John Anderson>: Hi, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Good morning, guys. Dave Anderson, you had talked about in your December preview,
Caprolactam headwinds between the capro and the benzene price declines, is there a – just remind me – is there a
formula that we can look at that says for every percentage change this is the impact on PMT and then just kind of the
corollary is, what do you think of PMT margins sort of sequentially as the year progresses based on I think your
previous comments regarding sort of spreads. I think, Dave Cote, you said you expected spreads to remain not worse or
whether in terms of the impact?
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, again, call it the benzene add or the formula that exists in terms of market pricing
gives us a directional indicator, it doesn't give us a precise. You can't plug that in and determine what the outcome is in
terms of the margin or the profitability for RNC or for PMT. Because we serve so many different markets, and as you
would expect, John, it gets kind of complicated, but it is a macro indicator of the health of the overall – that overall
business space, and it's an overall indicator for us in terms of from a planning standpoint directionally in terms of the
profit performance that we expect out of that business. And also an indicator of volumes, because as you would
suspect, when you get weaker demand, some of that translates into weaker commodity pricing. So, that's one of the
challenges that we have going forward.
On the other hand, with PMT, we expect to see continued good margin performance over the course of the year. We are
going to see a very good first quarter 2013, and the reason is that we've been signaling that is we're going to have very
strong catalyst deliveries in UOP; that looks like it's absolutely on track. So, we're going to have exceptional
performance there over the course of the year, but we expect another good year in terms of overall PMT margins. But
like...
<A - Elena Doom>: With a little less variability compared to what we saw at the end of 2012 looking forward to 2013,
because, John, to your point we're going to have lapped the year-over-year impact of the RNC, Caprolactam and
benzene outer spread.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah, or stated differently the second, third and fourth quarters, those are going to be
more consistent and more to one another in terms of the sequential margin rate so we'll see [indiscernible] (58:48).
<A - Elena Doom>: There is a seasonal element to the fourth quarter margin in PMT, which on average can be roughly
150 basis points of a decline driven by really foreign products specifically. But other than that, as Dave mentioned, we
expect there to be much more consistency in terms of the margin rate performance in 2013.

<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Actually, that is quite helpful. I wasn't sure how you would have the confidence if you were –
there was no predictive read through, but that answers that very well. 787, I realize aerospace is very diversified, it's
about flight hours, but you guys have pretty good content on that program. Is there any discernible impact in the guide
even if it's just minor, or is it just not really that relevant?
<A - David M. Cote>: It's not going to have much of an impact. I mean, there are some – there are obviously some
sales from it in the year, but even if they stopped producing, which I find hard to believe, that's manageable for us.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And then just last, Dave Cote, ACS has been and is expected to continue to be an important
source of productivity. How are you thinking about productivity opportunities in emerging markets? And the reason I'm
asking that point is that there are lots of reports of increasing automation proliferation because of rising wage costs in
China and other places. You guys as a company, although you've closed the gap, were behind I would say a few years
ago in emerging markets; you've closed the gap. Is this still a period of time for Honeywell to be investing, or are there
opportunities to also perhaps drive productivity because of these – just because market conditions are changing in the
China and India's of the world?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I guess a couple of comments there. First one is the opportunity for us to be able to
expand outside the U.S. is still significant. While we have grown our percent of sales outside the U.S. from 41% to
54%, 75% of the world's GDP is outside the U.S., so still a lot of room for us to grow. When it comes to productivity,
we look at productivity in everything everywhere and in every country. And we break it out into the two pieces that
we've talked about before, is material and organization effectiveness or OEF. And we look at every business that way
thinking about what's the smartest way to make both of those happen. And that doesn't really change I'd say as a result
of wage rates going up in China or going up in India. Yeah, it's something that you manage, but it's not so
overwhelming that it requires a drastic change in the company or exit stage right or enter stage left, I mean nothing like
that. So, very manageable, and we'll continue to do that within that kind of framework looking at material and looking
at labor and just keeping it as simple as that.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Basically on a net basis, you're still in a build phase very much so it sounds like for the next few
years in emerging markets versus more of a cost phase, if you want to look at that on that basis?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, we always look as you know at growth and cost at the same time. I've never been a
believer that you just do one or the other. So, that's why we've got it teed up in the five initiatives the way we do. So,
we're constantly looking at both. None of this stuff has been a real surprise, but we still see a lot of opportunity to grow,
and we still see a lot of opportunity to take out costs, and just driving those big enablers of ours, Velocity Product
Development, the Honeywell Operating System and functional transformation, there's a lot of margin rate improvement
and customer benefit from doing all three of those, just a lot better than we do today.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
Elena Doom
All right, Dave, I'd like to hand it over to you for final comments.
David M. Cote
Okay. So, while the economic times still remain difficult, we are going to continue to focus on what we can control to
deliver outperformance regardless of the economic conditions. And at the end of the day you have to play with the
economic cards that we're dealt. Until governments truly deal with their debt issues that's just the way it is; we could
wish it was different, but the best thing we can do is just play conservatively, assume that these great things aren't going

to happen, and stay very flexible in what we do in terms of our ability to respond.
So, we're going to continue to evolve the company in everything we do, and you know that word evolution is one that I
use a lot, because I think it's important for organizations, for people, for companies, for processes, because we want to
stay flexible to be able to respond to changing conditions, and we want to be able to improve on all dimensions.
A couple of weeks ago, we had our annual meeting of our top 300 global leaders, and it's just fun to be able to tell you
about the excitement that you can feel from the top 300 people in the world for Honeywell when it comes to what they
know we can accomplish as a company and where we're going. I mean, the feeling was palpable. It was the sort of
thing that really pumps you up.
So as a Honeywell team, we look forward to demonstrating that continued outperformance that results from all that
excitement for all the great ground work, all the great seed planting that our guys have been doing for a lot of years.
Thanks for listening.
