In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking
statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in
our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation material.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Good morning, John, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Certainly the second quarter was very
exciting for Williams, as we seized the opportunity to make an important acquisition that moved us closer to fulfilling
our vision of being the premier provider of reliable, large-scale infrastructure. It really has become very clear to
everybody that this kind of large-scale infrastructure is going to be absolutely critical to allowing North America to
take advantage of its vast natural gas resources.
We also rapidly accelerated our earlier stated plans of establishing WMB as a pure play G&P holdco and continued to
lead the space in dividend growth by very wide margin. At WPZ, we had another strong quarter with operational
performance being in line with our expectations and driving a 30% increase in distributable cash flow at WPZ.
We also enjoyed great progress in execution on a number of very important projects in the second quarter; a
tremendous amount of work going on within the organization on this front. And just to name a few, and you really only
hear about the very largest projects, but a tremendous amount of effort going on across the organization. But just to
name a few, Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon, the condensate stabilizer at Oak Grove in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, the
new ethane line, which is being completed in the OVM area, and we also started construction finally on the Rockaway
Beach Lateral after a very long and drawn out permitting process.
So, for those of you there in New York, you can look out and see some of that work going on and in fact, on the front
of our slide, you see some picture of that. So, that's going to allow us to bring that project in on schedule as well. So a
lot of very big projects that we made tremendous progress on and remain on schedule on, on some of those major
projects.
We also saw continued strong demand for our services with two significant new market-pull projects on Transco that
were fully contracted. And I think it's becoming pretty evident that Transco just continues to line up these hits and I'll
tell you, that's not slowing down in terms of continued business development opportunities just keep coming at us in
that business line. The Marcellus area volumes continued their rapid growth as well with a 31% increase in gathered
volumes as compared to last year's 2Q volumes and we're on track once again to lead the industry on volume growth in
the Marcellus this year.
Our Geismar E&C efforts were in line with plan, and our rebuild was completed last week. Our final efforts on the
expansion will be done by the end of next week. So our E&C team, our engineering and construction team, is wrapping
up and moving out as we now are turning that import facility over to our operations team. Unfortunately, and certainly
this is something we're all very disappointed around here with, but unfortunately we did find a new concern there at
Geismar that is going to require an enhancement to our safety systems that we expect to cause about a six-week to
eight-week delay in the first sales of ethylene in Geismar.
As I mentioned, this is certainly disappointing to us, but as difficult as this is, I'll tell you I am proud of the fact that our
organization will always put the safety of our people first and this is certainly just our organization following those
words with action by having the courage to pause and do the right thing in terms of making sure that that plant is safe
as possible.
So even though this is an out of the norm situation here, I know this is such a big issue, I really would like to take you
back to the appendix and if you'll look back on, I believe it's slide 14 in this deck, and we'll move there on our webcast
even though it's out of order here. You'll see that on slide 14, we show the incredible progress that's been made on the

expansion and the rebuild. And the pre-commissioning efforts, which were all but complete and will be complete at the
end of next week in terms of getting all of our systems turned over to operations. So what does that mean? It basically
means systems like our steam systems, all of our auxiliary systems, and we break those down into about 62 different
systems. And as those are mechanically complete, we turn them over to our operations team for them to take control of
those facilities.
And so as we were finalizing some of the relief valve study that was required as a result of the event last June 13, we
determined, and were frankly a bit surprised, but determined that there was another scenario that we needed to be
prepared for in the event of a blow down or in the event of an error at the plant and a malfunction at the plant. And that
assumption that we embedded has required us to go back in and study the pressure relief system, and we determined as
we did that that we actually had to make some further modification to the relief valve system again. Certainly a tough
decision to do that but again I think absolutely the right one when it comes to putting safety ahead of anything else in
our business.
So you can see here, in July 31, we are started on that relief valve system and modifications. We had a lot of these. The
plant already buttoned up and in many cases, a lot of the systems were dried out. We're having to open the system back
up now, and so that introduces moisture into the system. So when you see that plant dry out, that's basically backing up
on some of the systems that we had already turned over. And so, we think the relief valve system modifications will
take about seven weeks. And in parallel with that as we start to button up, some of those systems will start to dry out
and we'll start tuning up some of the cracking furnaces there. And so that's the second blue part that you see there called
plant dryout and hydrocarbon introduction.
And then finally, moving us to a first week in October, as we start to get into ethylene production. And so, one other
thing I'd like to clear here, that is certainly our target. We think that is a very achievable target. But in terms of our
financial projections, just given the number of issues we face there, we have spread that contingency out and basically
we have the range in our financials now which is basically starting with that first ethylene production running through
the end of the year. And so, that's the range of outcomes that we've got to built into guidance now. So we are building
ourselves some additional contingency in there beyond what our targeted date is there. So that's our detail and we'll be
happy to take any questions on that later. John Dearborn is with me here to help addressing that as well.
Moving on now to the rest of the presentation and on the slide seven, some really impressive growth numbers continue
to be posted for both WPZ and ACMP, and that continues to drive very impressive cash flow growth at Williams, and
this is especially impressive when you consider that in the second quarter, we only recognized about two months of
business interruption coverage there at Geismar. And so, our fee-based revenues in the quarter continued a very steady
march up and to the right. And despite a very mild second quarter in terms of any weather on our pipeline systems, we
still continue to move that up about 7% over 2Q of last year on our fee-based revenues. And I think also important,
we're well over 80% of our reported net revenues were coming from fee-based services in the period.
It also should be understood that much of the big capital investments that we've been making here really over last two
and half years to three years, don't start producing cash flow until the third quarter and fourth quarter of the year, as
Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon and our OVM or Ohio Valley Midstream investments really begin to generate significant
cash flow and earnings here in the last half of the year.
And then, of course, ACMP continues its very steady progress up and to the right, as this group continues to benefit
from this very tight focus on growing the gathering and compression business in the nation's very best natural gas
basins. So, very pleased with the way the business is continuing to expand and we've got a really exciting last half of
the year in front of us.
Now looking at some of these important growth drivers that we've continued to focus on and report to our investors.
One item of significance has been added to this list. You'll see there at the bottom is the AC&P acquisition and in terms
of the results, pretty impressive work by our finance and legal teams this last second quarter moving from a price
agreement with GIP all the way to closure within a matter of about five weeks or six weeks. So very impressive work
by that team and just continues to shine a light on the kind of talent we have around here and our commitment to
continue to drive shareholder value here at Williams.

And so this list that you have here represents a tremendous amount of effort really across the whole organization and
with the exception of Geismar, we were very pleased with the results on this scorecard here as we pause here in the first
part of the third quarter.
Now, there's certainly many E&C projects that are nearly complete and now we're beginning to turn our attention on
the next wave of projects that just keep coming, thanks to our very well-positioned assets and the competitive
advantages that we constantly focus on developing. I'll tell you, that's a very natural part of the way we run the business
here at Williams and a lot of these major, large-scale projects that we take on and the challenges that we take on really
are in support of making sure we maintain some strong competitive advantages in our business.
So moving on to slide nine and looking forward here to this next wave of projects, we see that this list is long and it just
keeps coming. The bulk of the large projects in 2015 come from our Atlantic Gulf region that continue to perform very
well. I think our Atlantic Gulf region continues to execute well and continues to hit its number on a regular basis. And
we certainly are – as we look here into these projects in 2015, many of these are really in the major projects are
expansions of our Transco and our gas pipeline system in the Atlantic Gulf area. Projects like Kodiak, for instance,
really aren't any capital. That's a tie back to an existing facility, and we do have continued, what we would call program
capital as we continue to build out the Northeast G&P. But a bulk of our major projects have really, in the Northeast, a
lot of that is getting out of the way this year, and we've really set ourselves up for a lot of big fundamental growth
looking forward beyond 2014 in the Northeast.
The major projects in 2017 really come on late in the year, but our backlog of projects beyond 2017 just keeps building
and you really should expect this to continue for some time as we bring the combined strength of both WPZ and ACMP
now, and bring those resources together. And the opportunities that that combination brings really is going to be
critical, as the nation here tries to get up on a 100 Bcf natural gas market. We think Williams and the combined entity is
going to very much at the forefront of reaching that 100 Bcf a day gas market here in the U.S.
So moving to slide 10 and kind of looking at the big picture of what this new MLP would be. We couldn't be more
excited about not only the size, the scale of this MLP, but the very consistent focus on being the player in the natural
gas space and natural gas products and derivates that are coming out of this big growth in natural gas. And we think the
combination of Williams and Access just continues to load us towards more and more growth.
Just some important things to note on here that are very impressive. In 2015, an expected EBITDA of about $5 billion.
And in addition to that, continued best-in-class growth distribution of 10% to 12%, which is really impressive when
you consider the scale and what it takes to grow the cash distributions in this business and something of this scale. And
so continuing to be able to do that through 2017 and maintain strong coverages really provides an investment vehicle
that we think is absolutely unmatched. And it's going to continue to give us the kind of firepower to continue to expand
this business larger and larger. So couldn't be more excited about the combination of this business.
And if you look on slide 11, this really conveys the breadth here that Williams has, but it also shows really what ACMP
is doing for us in the upstream piece of our business. And if you think about the way we've continually grown a lot of
our businesses over the years, we basically have linked and levered either the market back into the upstream or we've
taken the upstream, and by that, I mean the gathering and processing business, and move those opportunities
downstream. Certainly nothing's more obvious about how we've done that in recent times, even though we've done it
many times over the years, nothing's more obvious than the way that's gone for us up in the Susquehanna supply area,
and the ability that we've generated many large projects off of that big upstream growing volumes there. So if you look
at that and think about ACMP today on operated gathering volumes, PZ and ACMP are very close to the same number.
And if you look at it on a capacity basis, WPZ's larger part of that's just because of the legacy large-scale assets that
we've had out in the western basins.
But nevertheless, very impressive position in the gathering space upstream and our ability to continue to deliver
services and link that to service opportunities for customers downstream, this basically just reloads our set of
opportunities and continuing to grow that. I can tell you, it didn't feel like we needed a lot of that. But nevertheless I've
got a lot of confidence in not just the assets, but the combination of the people of ACMP and Williams. There's some

incredible strengths at ACMP that frankly we are very excited to have hitched our wagon and a lot we can learn frankly
from expanding the upstream gathering business and the great job they've done there. And what PZ brings to that of
course is the ability to continue to expand opportunities beyond that. So tremendous strategic fit as well as a great
financial fit for Williams and WPZ.
So moving on to slide 12 here, really couldn't be more excited about how we're positioned strategically right now and
thrilled to see the ACMP piece come along. It just further fills our handout and the scale and the opportunity set that we
have and the growth that we have, we think is unmatched and we have a very fired up organization I can tell you right
now; very excited to take on these new opportunities, both at the ACMP level and at the Williams level. So very
excited about the quarter, disappointed with Geismar, but extremely excited about the second half of this year and the
kind of growth we're going to get to witness here in the second half of the year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we'll hear from Christine Cho with Barclays.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning, Christine.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Your other [ph] SD (20:33) revenues in the Northeast doubled quarter-over-quarter even though
NGL production didn't change that much. I'm assuming this was a condensate handling that came on during the quarter.
When did that come on and how much of this 6,000 barrels per day capacity are you using currently?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Jim, could you take that please?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Sure, Christine. Good to talk to you again. That's correct. That's the stabilizer fee revenue and
the stabilizer came on, it was 50% of the stabilizer I should say came on. You can see we have the first phase of 6,000
barrels a day came on in April of this year.
<Q - Christine Cho>: And then how much of that capacity are you currently using?
<A - James E. Scheel>: We're using about half of that today and that's growing as additional wells come online. We've
got about 73 wells coming online for the balance of the year.
<Q - Christine Cho>: And then if your GPM of the gas is 8% or something like that, how much of that is condensate?
Is 10% a fair assumption?
<A - James E. Scheel>: I'm not a 100% sure on that Christine, I'd have to get back with you but I think that's pretty
close. It's probably in the 8% to 12% but I don't know exactly the number.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. That's fine. Also the de-ethanizer getting moved up by a quarter, did this impact volumes
in second quarter at all, meaning did anyone have to shut in wells because the gas wouldn't meet pipeline spec with the
ethane in it?
<A - James E. Scheel>: No. We haven't had any of those issues right now, although that continues to be a concern
Christine. The de-ethanizer had no impact in the second quarter actually. Even if it'd been online, we wouldn't have had
the opportunity to move ethane to NOVA because of some other downstream issues. We're right now working to
commission that asset and it should be up during the third quarter.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. And then, Alan or Don, I think you've told me on a prior call that you guys have
right of first refusal if Caiman decides to exit its Caiman Energy II JV position. But, what about on the ACMP side?

There are some partners who are backed by a private equity in E&P companies, who may or may not want to be a
minority owner in such assets in the longer term. And I would think that they would want to monetize at some point.
Would the combined ACMP, WPZ, MLP have any first rights there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'm not sure what the confidentiality terms are for ACMP on that issue, so would rather not
comment on what their rights are there. I would just simply say that we do feel like we're very well positioned to
consolidate a lot of those assets in the Utica there. I'm pretty excited about between Blue Racer and UEO, what our
opportunities to consolidate look like there.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. And then, while I think it's consensus opinion that the part of the deal of ACMP is
accretive, I think there's some confusion in the markets as to whether or not the second part of the deal adds that
accretion or chips away a little from that accretion. Is there any clarification you can provide?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, it's Don. Again, since the merger is currently being negotiated or about to be
negotiated between the two partnerships, I don't want to go too far in this. But certainly the way we styled it, Williams
would take reduced cash flow in the early period and enjoy higher cash flows, higher growth beyond. So, likely mildly
dilutive initially and then turning around pretty quickly.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator
We'll next move to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good morning guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Alan, in your prepared remarks, you talked about market pull of projects and so forth that
have seemed to have come to fruition during the quarter. I think in your slides you had said that you've got about a
backlog of $25 billion at WPZ and another $4 billion at Access. Any sense on how large this backlog could potentially
grow in terms of order of magnitude? Are we talking in the neighborhood of 10% to 20% or are we talking something
significantly higher, assuming you were able to commercially negotiate some projects and so forth?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I think, couple thoughts on that. One, we may actually see lot of opportunities that
come to us that require less capital. So, higher earnings and better return but less capital as we look at opportunities
between the two. So, I would just say the opportunities may not be measured in capital. They may be measured in
earnings growth. But I would just tell you that the number of opportunities that just keep coming at us along the
Transco system and on the Northwest Pipeline system, as the market continues on the demand side to try to figure out
how to take advantage of all this low-costs gas, and continued confidence in low-cost gas is pretty impressive that
given what a deficit we had in storage this year, and we're sitting at a sub-four gas price, really tells you the confidence
that the demand side has in the supply capabilities and long-term supply capabilities of the gas basins. But what's
developing is a lot of a major downstream pool projects.
And so I would tell you I think a lot of our growth is actually going to come from that area, and our ability to connect
these supplies into those opportunities. And, of course, all of that new gas supply bleeds into both natural gas liquids
and olefins as well. As we produce that gas, we've got to do something with the liquids and find markets for those
liquids.
So, I would tell you rather than the ACMP combination driving a lot of capital increases, I would say it's likely going to
drive, particularly in the Northeast, it'll drive some higher earnings, but perhaps I don't know that it will reduce our
capital, but I would say a lot of it would be just higher earnings in the year.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. A couple of quick follow-ups. We saw some ramps and volumes in the Northeast
and you didn't have any change to your 2015 guidance. Is it fair to say that the way the Northeast acted in the second

quarter is exactly the way you wanted it to? It's running according to plan, and you would expect to see a significant
acceleration in 3Q and 4Q. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the ramp as to how we go from 1Q and
2Q of this year as to how we end up with kind of the guidance for 2015 in terms of where you expect the big pick-up in
ramp acceleration to show up.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That's an excellent question. And I'll tell you, I'm very excited with what we're seeing there
and the engagement. I'm going to ask Jim Scheel to provide a little more color on that. And thank you for asking the
question.
<A - James E. Scheel>: Yeah. I'll answer that in a couple phases. I think we are very excited about the progress we're
making in the Susquehanna supply hub or AVA area. We're right on target, actually probably a little bit ahead of where
we wanted to be. We have a lot of projects coming online during the third and fourth quarters of this year. They'll be on
time, on budget. We're growing those volumes by about 34% versus prior year, as we come out of the year. And
quarter-over-quarter this year, we're up 8%. So, obviously, we always want to do better up there and smash more gas
into the system, but we're right on target with where we want to be.
OVM has been a bit of a different story. It's very consistent with the Analyst Day and the last earnings call. You can
actually see on page 20 of the book that we've lowered our average volumes for the year. That's primarily due to a
number of producers having some challenges at the front end of the year. And so we're seeing a delay on wells coming
online. But we will actually end the year higher. We adjusted the number for the year-end at 420 [wells]. And again, as
I'd mentioned a bit earlier, we have a number of wells. So we have lots of visibility on getting ready to come online.
We have 73 wet Marcellus. And in addition to that, we have some dry Utica wells that's not included in that overall
number that could actually add to some of the volume, but obviously that will be at a bit of a lower rate.
Our biggest issues right now as we look into the third quarter are commissioning the assets that will drive some
incremental fee revenue. You'll see our fee revenues increasing and then just seeing when the producers tie the lines in.
LMM is on target with where we expect for the most part and will end the year about 25% higher than last year as well.
So although there are challenges in the Northeast that we've been seeing around OVM on the producer side, the good
news is, unlike past discussions, the assets seem to have the reliability in order to move the gas and we'll be able to
meet our customers' needs as we go through the third quarter and fourth quarter with the incremental processing
options for them.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. One last question, if I may. Just if we can turn to Geismar. Obviously a
disappointment that it wasn't able to start up on time and so forth. I was just wondering if you can sort of elaborate a
little bit on the safety issues. Did it come up in the inspection process and prevent a permit from being issued or is this
something that you've just decided to do over and above the process and all permits and everything's in place. Just
wondering if you can give just a little bit of color around the safety measures that are being enhanced.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Let me have John Dearborn take that. He's been right, square in the middle of that.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah, and thanks for the question, pretty insightful question as well, the way you ask it.
And to take on the first part of your question as to whether it had something to do with the permits, I would say no, not
at all. It rather, to put it into some context for you, the overall plant and in the overall plant there are more than 750
pressure safety valves throughout that plant and on a regular basis, you go through and you study overpressure
scenarios on these various pieces of equipment and how these valves are expected to control overpressure
circumstances.
And prior to the incident, and then of course as a result of the incident, we were doing overpressure studies and they
were being done in a very prioritized way and a very careful way as well. We have to be very deliberate and very
disciplined in how we go about doing this work. And the work had progressed extremely well. Some of the valves, just
to give you an idea, some of the valves get studied and if we said okay, the valve is fine; and you put the documentation
to the file about how the valve has been re-studied and no further work was needed. And in the prioritization, we left
several, of course, valves toward the end of the study and it was not until early in July, as this study was finishing up,
that the team came to learn about a particular scenario that truly required mitigation.

So as we came to learn of that, the team considered several strategies that could have potentially worked in this
circumstance and determined that the best solution we could have applied was to install several new PSVs. And just so
you understand the number of several is really about 12 PSVs are being installed, and to replace several sections of
piping.
Now it happens that the full impact of this essentially new work on our schedule was not known until earlier this week
and frankly it's what resulted in this disappointing disclosure today. But I just want to reiterate once again that we're
taking this extra precaution here to enhance the safety of our workers and the public. And I hope that provides some
adequate color to everyone on the phone about this entire issue that we're grappling with as we move forward toward
the safe and sustainable restart of the plant.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: No, great. That was extremely helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll move on next to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Hi, good morning. I just kind of following up on Geismar there really quick. I was just wondering
if you guys could discuss a little bit more at length, kind of what the drivers of your range is in terms of first ethylene
production and what could possibly delay this further?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Sure. Glad to bring some color to that. So let's reflect again about what happened back at
the time of the incident, right. This plant went down in a very unusual and a hard way, right, and we had to take some
unusual precautions and go through certain procedures in order to clean it out. And so, certainly, there could be some
potential risks related to some of the equipment as a result of the way it had gone down. Secondarily, I would say
there's always a concern that exists around a restart of a plant, especially when it's been expanded now, as to whether
the systems as designed and as reinstalled work. Take for instance, rotating equipment; sometimes you have to go in
and look at the rotating equipment a second time.
Now, that's historically happened to us; from time to time if doesn't. We don't know anything today that says we should
have any usual worries on this startup. So I have nothing that I know of at the moment. But with an abundance of
caution, we thought it was appropriate to guide that the startup is not risk-free once we're through this next round of
installation of pressure safety relief valves and that's the entirety of the story behind the contingency range that we put
around that startup.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Got it. And Don, I was just wondering if you could just update us on your discussions with the
insurance companies and your recovery expectations and kind of once we get into this outer period, where you could be
above your business interruption insurance. How you're kind of thinking about that, and how that's kind of baked into
guidance.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I'd say now that the plant is substantially complete from a construction standpoint, and
we're moving very quickly toward the startup, most of the facts are now very well known. And obviously, we'll
continue to update our claim as we move through startup. We've retained some expert consultants, if you will, that are
doing studies to support our claim. We plan to present those studies and conclusions to the insurers in the fall. And we
would be hopeful that that would then start the next round of settlement discussions.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: And in terms of, I think you mentioned previously that you expected to user ATM kind of in
2014, be [indiscernible] (37:02) equity markets and 2015 at PZ (sic) [WPZ] (37:05). You put out kind of share count.
Applying some meaningful equity issuance in the back half of the year, I just wanted to make sure that was still your
expectation that you do any incremental equity on the ATM this year, and you'd be largely out of the markets at PZ
(sic) [WPZ] (37:25) next year?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Brian, that in fact is the case. Again our financing plan is pretty well unchanged.
Obviously, the dropdown of the remaining Williams-owned assets is another factor and we're looking to do that ideally

post merger in late 2014, early 2015.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: And then finally, just on the north, I think Cabot mentioned on their call, some infrastructure
issues that they were having which impacted their production in the quarter. I was wondering if you guys could just
elaborate from your perspective what some of those issues were and have they been resolved going forward?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Well, again, this is Jim Scheel. I'll comment on that again. I listened to the earnings call too
and I want to just reiterate, our performance quarter-over-quarter we're 8% more than we were previous quarter and
first quarter's 4% more than the year-end. So, we've been continuing to grow volumes. Obviously we have to do a
fantastic job in coordinating volumes into the system. I think Cabot is probably relating more to the opportunities
missed just buy some coordination on scheduling gas, because actually we were moving more than we have. And
again, as the additional horsepower comes online during the third quarter and fourth quarter this year, we're going to
see a rather rapid ramp up so that we finish the year about 34% more. So again I appreciate the concerns of the
shippers, but we continue to put more gas through that system and are only accelerating that as we end the year.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: And just finally from me in terms of any update, in terms of timing on the ACMP, WPZ
negotiations, is there any update from your most recent disclosure?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Nothing new. I would just tell you, the conflicts committees are working hard and are very
well advised and I think everybody understands the importance of moving ahead with it and with some diligence and
that's exactly what's going on right now.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.
Operator
And next we'll move on to Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning, Abhi.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: In your data book for WMB, you show a revised look at the excess cash flow available
even after the dividend step up, which is around 20% per year through 2016. It sounds like the remaining part of deal
will be maybe modestly dilutive upfront then accretive beyond that. So, I guess, how should we think about the current
and potentially more excess coverage being brought down over time once the entire deal is done?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Abhi, again, yes, we'd expect some of that excess coverage to come off, because one of the
considerations that Williams is making here is moving the distributions we receive really to the ACMP schedule in
terms of those IDRs. So Williams is making, I'll call it a concession there to enable the merger and we think that that's
going to drive significant value long-term, but certainly with some near term reduction in cash flows. However, by
2017 that really turns around and we would expect to have a nice increase in accretion, if you will, cash flow accretion
on a per share basis. I don't know if that answers your question.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Yeah, that helps. And then just a couple of other quick ones. At WPZ, you have a
shortfall this year of about $400 million between the DCF and distribution. So I guess, how should we think about how
you make this up? Is this just with capital raises or do you need any sort of support from WMB, any color there would
be helpful?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: We expect that WPZ's financing plan is largely intact. I think at the midpoint here we
moved the cash flow of about $150 million and as well, we do have an anticipated litigation settlement that we would
expect would largely offset that in terms of cash. So we think not a lot of change there. Just going back to the cash
flow, your first question there, I would point out that our 2017 to 2019 cash tax guidance is an assumed rate of 14%.

And we would expect that to come down somewhat as we continue to add to our capital spending. As you can see, our
capital spending is about $4 billion this year and it declines to $2 billion and change by 2016. It's because we – what
we have in guidance is really sanctioned projects and we have a lot of projects, organic projects that we're working on
that as those are added to guidance and those projects are placed in service, that'll continue to press that cash tax rate
down somewhat.
So just consider that as your building your models. Right now our run-rate seems to be about in the $4 billion range and
if you take that $25 billion and divide it by the six years, you get about $4 billion a year and that's pre-ACMP and
they've been spending about $1 billion a year. So you can think about that as you think about our cash tax rate. And
while the rate looks to be fairly low, remember that that's based on cash distributions received. And if you look at it on
a percent of pre-tax income, which is more conventional, you'll see the rate's quite a bit higher.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just last quick one from me. On the Canadian
projects, can you talk a little bit about what's driving the shift back in CapEx? This is at the WMB, NGL, Petchem
segment level. Are these delays in locking down customers or just a slower than expected construction schedule? Any
color there would be helpful.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Great question. And particularly, the PDH project is what I assume you're referring
to primarily and the other being Syncrude. And I would just tell you that given the kind of increases that we're seeing in
the Petchem space on the engineering construction side and the kind of demand we're seeing on labor and we expect to
continue to press toward. We're working very hard to not get ourselves in a difficult situation relative to schedule and to
make sure that we are pushing away from that risk as much as possible in terms of overruns because as we look
forward, we see a lot of pressure on the skilled labor that it's going to take to build out this infrastructure. And so I
would just tell you that we are making sure as we move forward into that, we don't get ourselves in position where
we're reliant on thinner and thinner resources and lower and lower productivity. And so that's the primary cost behind
it.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator
And we'll move on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. Just sticking with sort of the Petchem and I guess bigger picture, do you see being in
the petrochemical business as a core competence for you or do you think it may be distracting you from some of the,
maybe bigger midstream activities that you have? Should we read into this PDH, maybe delay something around there?
There's some questions around what constitutes qualifying income. I'm just wondering if you can just talk about that
part of the value chain a bit more.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Sure. We continue to see the Petchem business has not, for Williams, not being in
the Petchem business for the sake of being in the Petchem business, frankly, but really as a pull through and a market
outlet for these burgeoning NGL supplies. And so, certainly I would say, it's a little bit different between Canada and
the Geismar facility, because in Canada really, we pursued that many years ago, because mostly that's a processing
business. We're not actually reforming any molecules there. That's being done at the upgraders; we're simply extracting
that through typical cryogenic progressing and then fractionating it just like we do in other sectors of our business.
And so, in Canada, I would tell you the competencies, if you will, are not very different and we've certainly got a very
strong competitive advantage there. But in both cases, in both the case of Geismar and as we would move into PDH, we
continue to look at that as an outlet for our products and a way for us to continue to provide market access for our
customers that otherwise isn't showing up.
So I would tell you that's how we think about it, and we certainly think about it in terms of being more of a fee based
business. I think it's a very good question that you raise and certainly, given the great number of opportunities that we
have in front of us, it's always an issue of capital allocation for us. And it's part of the reason, as I just answered before,

part of the reasons that we're making sure we don't get ourselves into a difficult spot there in that piece of business
because we do see a lot of pressure in getting that business built out, particularly on the PDH facility.
So, in the end I would just tell you, we continue to look at it as a place for us to expand market for us and for our
customers. I think it's very nice compliment to the ethane link that we've had for years and it's a good place to provide
market for our customers. And that's kind of the extent of it in terms of how we look at it. We don't look at it as being
in the Petchem business to be a Petchem player.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Understood, that's very helpful. If I can just shift back to the Northeast, I'm just wondering if
you're seeing any reaction by the producers to some of the gas price volatility and sort of the price declines that we've
seen recently and especially some of the regional basis issues that clearly people are still having there. It sounds like the
issues have been more sort of physical and tie-in challenges and whatnot. But is there any sort of bigger reaction from
producers from the low gas we're seeing in the Northeast?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, no and to be fair, I would say that given the kind of recent pushdown in pricings
that's really just happened here, we've had bouts with it but it's really just pushed down here over the last month or so. I
would say it's a little bit early to call that, frankly. But certainly the activities that we saw in the first half of the year are
just now coming to fruition and there's been quite a flurry of activity on the drilling side, both in the wet Marcellus and
the dry Marcellus up in the Northeast, and now it's starting with some of the dry Utica in the OVM area.
And so that – in the first half of the year, I would tell you that that's been pretty strong. I think it's a little bit early to
call with this more recent weakness in natural gas if that's going to slow much of that down. But so far, we certainly
haven't seen any signs of that. And I would tell you that I think the producers are getting, particularly, in the OVM area,
are getting better and better at understanding what they've got there and are more and more excited about it. So we'll
see what happens, but I think it's a little bit early to say we've seen any kind of reaction at this point.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then just last one from me, on constitution, any update on sort of the regulatory and
permitting process there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Not much to add there. I think we're very pleased with the way the FERC has continued to
press forward on that and we're working hard to work with the [indiscernible] (50:00) and the New York DEC and
communicate to them the importance of this infrastructure and the need to deal with some of the water quality or some
of the water crossing permits that the New York DEC has in their hands. So really kind of remains focused on that
issue and I would say we've made progress, but we haven't solved that problem.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.
Operator
And next we'll move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I think I've just got two questions left. And now I'm
understanding and appreciating your comments around the Canadian PDH facility and labor inflation and the like. I
think prior, we were thinking that maybe this could come to a head by year-end, and so just trying to kind of getting a
little bit more color on what you were saying earlier. Is this something that we should just think of now as more just on
the back burner, more of kind of on hold or is that still progressing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, not at all. There's a tremendous amount of work. We made great progress with the
polypropylene take contract if you will that takes quite a bit of the price risk out of it. And I would just say both parties,
both us and the party that would have the polypropylene take are working diligently to make sure that we've got great
confidence in our estimates and the work plan it would take to construct it in a low risk manner. But I'll tell you, the
work is probably at an all-time high in terms of making sure that we're very confident of where we stand with the
estimate. And we do very much expect to conclude and have it pinned down by the end of the year. And so in no way
should you consider it's on the back corner. It's just a, us absolutely making sure we de-risk it as much as possible

before we move forward.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. Appreciate the clarification. And then just last question and maybe this is on
Geismar with respect to the pressure scenarios that were studied. Clearly ethylene plants are not like processing plants.
So I guess it's not exactly a cookie cutter approach here. And what I'm wondering is that, to the extent that this plant
has been rebuilt or perhaps studied now, maybe with all the different scenarios that are out there from a safety
standpoint, does this in any way make Geismar – I hesitate to call it best-in-class because of what we've gone through,
but as we kind of look forward from this point today, does that in any way help you distinguish yourself from other
plants and how ultimately does that perhaps help or hinder Geismar II?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, Carl, good question. I would say we certainly are coming out of this much stronger
than we went into it both from an operational focus and reliability. And we've worked hard to really improve the older
plant as well as making sure that those learnings were built into the new plant as well. I would tell you that probably the
fact that we've got a team that's been right in the middle of a major construction project like this, that's also looking at
Geismar II. And so it's not some distant memory of the lessons learned. It's kind of real and available, puts us in a very
knowledgeable position to push forward with Geismar II if that's what we choose to do.
So I would just say I'm very thankful that we've got a team that is – this has been a really tough project if you think
about, if you were managing this major expansion project in the first place in and around a plant and then have a major
explosion that isolates us from being able to complete the plant right in the middle of a project. That's a project
manager's worse nightmare. And yet they've hung with it. And so I would just say we've got a team that's very schooled
on what it takes to be successful as we look forward into Geismar II and certainly the team all have a lot of confidence
in pushing forward as we look to the Geismar II opportunity.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. Appreciate the comments. Thanks guys.

Next, we'll move on to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning. Morning, Sharon
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Don, I guess with regards to the dividend illustration you provided, those tax rates. Do you
anticipate those cash tax rate to change materially if the ACMP, WPZ transactions occurs?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: No, Sharon, we do not. So we don't expect that to change. The distributions will change
somewhat. So there'll be some effect, but we wouldn't expect any material change in those tax rates as a result of that. I
think right now, they're driven largely by placing assets in service. And we are in the middle of an appraisal for both
accounting and tax purposes. So there will be some adjustment of estimates along the way as we conclude both the
accounting and tax appraisals that are really key in this process.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And then, I guess, just trying to gauge the potential for the unit exchange ratio to be
renegotiated. Maybe if you could provide some color on some of the key factors management considered when you
determine the proposed exchange ratio.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, we did some extensive modeling in really trying to come to a transaction that we
think was value adding both to ACMP and WPZ unit holders, really trying to balance the considerations there. So,
obviously, a lot goes into it, but that really was the design criteria. We wanted it to be a transaction that we thought
would be beneficial to both partnerships, really trying to strike that balance and that's really what we put forth in our
proposal.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And just a last question. I guess given the IRS' scrutiny on some of the non-core industry
activities in PLRs, at this juncture, is there any concern regarding the PLR for Geismar?

And we'll move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Morning, guys.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Hello, Craig. Morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: So, back to Geismar II prospects, any further updates around the market's capacity to provide
long-term fixed return contracting versus commodity disposed returns?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Don, you want to take this?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, I'm glad to take that. Thanks very much. Not much has changed since Analyst Day,
so just to reiterate where we are there. We got a very warm reception when we put our RFP out to the marketplace and
our interest was oversubscribed quite significantly. What we are doing with this particular investment is we're
essentially trading off that commodity margin to the buyer of ethylene or to our joint venture partner in exchange for a
fee-for-service opportunity for WPZ in total concert with our strategy. And certainly the market's appetite, given recent
and current ethylene prices is quite warm to a provider that's willing to provide on a fee-for-service basis. So we're
seeing very, very warm reception both on the JV side and on the ethylene purchase side for fee-for-service type
arrangements.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And when do you see that? Is that like a 2015, early 2015 period to try to true up some
of those negotiations?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, well, we're going to be working those negotiations through this year and into the
early part of the next year I'm sure. But I think the bigger emphasis here is very much aligned with Alan's comments
earlier about the PDH unit at the strategic level. So, until we're absolutely certain that we've got the right commercial
deals lined up here, and until we're absolutely certain we know how we're going to execute and de-risk the capital
project on an investment of this magnitude, we're going to hesitate to rush our way into a sanction if I could call it that.
So we'll sanction only where we're absolutely ready from both the commercial and the project side.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Got it. And Don, if I could return to the insurance recovery question, if I remember when I
asked at the Analyst Day, the comment was made that debates about recoveries had less to do with debates about what
the true commodity price should be versus taking best care in not only being safe but also being appropriately efficient
in starting up again. Could the fact that you're now delaying startup comfortably beyond the recovery period basically
obviate that issue a little bit and make it easier to achieve recovery since you're kind of taking some of the dime on your
own accord?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, good question. Certainly our claim continues to get somewhat larger because we
believe we've worked prudently to bring the plant back into service. Obviously insurers who have the money in their
pockets are going to argue against that, but we think we have a very solid claim. We think that our outside expects will
help us present our claim in a way that is compelling. And we're optimistic that we'll receive very substantial initial
payments perhaps as early as late third quarter, fourth quarter.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. So you think that much of this could be resolved by the time the plant's actually up and
running?

<A - Donald R. Chappel>: No, I think more likely it's fourth quarter.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Oh, up, yes, the plant being up and running in the fourth quarter. But with a targeted
October date, it could take a bit longer than that is I guess my comment.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I gotcha. And last question kind of a little broad spectrum and big picture, but we got a couple
things going on with potentially a competing NGL line from the Northeast to Bellevue, maybe looking a little better
prospect at the moment and also condensate exports looking more realistic than ever before. There's obviously
competitive pressures but new business opportunities from all these types of events across your system. I wonder if you
all could just comment on any net positives or negatives from these types of events?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I guess if you're just asking generally about the competitive environment that we see
out there, I think we continue to see not so much impact from competition, frankly. We just have so many opportunities
coming at us, that that's probably why I want to say it's the least of our worries. It's certainly low on the list. And really
the – if you think about some of the larger risk to the business, it's more around the macro environment and one thing
we do compete for, frankly we've become very aware of, is we compete for rigs from one basin to the next.
And so I think having ACMP alongside, gives us a little better diversification to that in terms of being exposed to other
big gas basins. But I would say that's really the issue that keeps us focused on getting great market access for our
customers, and keeps us aligned with them, frankly, is that we desperately want to see good market access for the
basins we've invested in. And that's obviously a service we'd like to provide as well in terms of providing better market
access and better long-term markets for their product. And so that's how we're continuing to go about that. But I would
say on the competitive front that we've just got our hands so full with the opportunities that are coming to us and we're
uniquely positioned to win that we're not having to stretch very far beyond that.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. I appreciate it.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.

And our next question we'll hear from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot of for taking my question. Don, just curious, I see the
guidance for WMB, effectively DCF, but I don't think that's something that you reported along with quarter report. So
I'm just curious if you could, either for the second quarter sort of provide on the same schedule as to how you would
guide it, what's the DCF or WMB entity was? And then, is that something that on a go forward you plan to report as
part of the financial?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Chris, great question. Yeah, we have not done that, but we certainly expect to. So, you can
look for that next quarter.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. And any broad framework as to what it might have been for the quarter?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I don't have that number off hand here. I don't know if John has it, but we can get it to you,
we can fax – we can post it on our website.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. Great. That'd be helpful. Thanks, Don.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: And I'd just comment here, again, we're going through a transition here with ACMP in that
our acquisition of the additional interest will now cause us to consolidate ACMP beginning in the third quarter, which
will create some differences in reporting. Obviously we've been reporting on an equity basis; we'll be fully
consolidated, we'll be booking a gain, significant gain in the third quarter to revalue our initial investment in ACMP.
We'll be booking some substantial intangible assets. And we'll have some additional depreciation, amortization related

to those assets as well. So, just kind of a heads up and look forward to quite a bit different presentation. You still get to
the same bottom line here in terms of cash flow, but from a balance sheet and an earnings standpoint, there'll be some
changes in the basis of presentation.

And our last question today will come from Bradley Olsen with TPH.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I know we're running a little bit late. So, I
really only got one question. And now that you've closed the ACMP general partner acquisition, can you comment on
any ongoing efforts to retain key personnel from Access and kind of broadly speaking, how successful those efforts
have been?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. That's certainly something we very much value that organization and their
capabilities and that was high on our list of things to accomplish. And so we did move swiftly and aggressively to do so
and I think we're very comfortable with where we are right now on that front. And so lot of great work by our teams
here at Williams and the team at Access to really address where any of those issues might be and take care of them
swiftly. So I'd say we feel very good about where we stand today and I'm particularly proud of both the organizations
coming together to work at that so quickly.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Okay. Great. So broadly speaking, I guess, it's fair to say that in the Utica and the Northeast
where Access is, maybe most of their capital is being deployed that the team is kind of largely intact post acquisition?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That is correct.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

And that will conclude today's question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong
for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you. Thanks for all the great questions. As you can see, we're very excited about the future we've got in
front of us and this team is, I think, just continues to generate momentum towards this vision that we have of really
being the premier player in this natural gas super cycle. And we're very excited about the opportunities that keep
coming at us and we keep executing on to accomplish that and we look forward to reporting to you in the third quarter
with great continued progress and certainly at the balance of the year. Thanks for joining us today.

And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.
