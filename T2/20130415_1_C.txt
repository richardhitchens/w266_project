Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings
including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone.
This morning we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2013. Excluding CVA and DVA, net income
was $4 billion or $1.29 per share. During the quarter, we benefited from seasonally strong results in our markets
businesses, sustained momentum in investment banking, and continued year-over-year growth in loans and deposits in
Citicorp and a more favorable credit environment. As I've said, achieving consistent high-quality earnings is one of my
top priorities, and these first-quarter results are encouraging. However, although this was a good start for 2013, the
environment remains challenging, and we're sure to be tested as we go through the year ahead.
In addition to our performance across business lines, there were several other areas that I'd want to point out. First, our
capital strength again improved during the quarter, with the Tier 1 common ratio increasing to an estimated 9.3% on a
Basel III basis. And we now expect the ratio to reach at least 10% by the end of this year.
After a very thorough process, we were pleased that our regulators did not object to the capital plan we submitted. And
although the requested returns were modest, the permission to do so, which was based on both quantitative and
qualitative analysis, is meaningful. As I said on my first earnings call, it is critical that Citi be viewed as an indisputably
strong and stable institution, and we made progress towards that goal during the first quarter.
Next, as I've highlighted, we have two areas of intense focus for our company, to reduce the drag on earnings caused by
Citi Holdings and to utilize our deferred tax assets. We made progress on both fronts. We reduced our assets in Citi
Holdings by $7 billion. Holdings assets now total just under $150 billion, or 8% of our balance sheet. And more
importantly, the loss in Holdings was reduced to less than $800 million, driven by improvement in credit costs,
including a $375 million reserve release related to North American mortgages. And we began utilizing reserves as the
mortgage portfolio continues to shrink, credit performance continues to improve, and we've become more comfortable
that the housing recovery is sustainable. As a result, we will continue to analyze this portfolio and adjust our reserve
levels accordingly.
We also did consume a small amount of our DTA during the first quarter. $700 million of DTA was utilized and we're
focused on generating sustainable U.S. taxable earnings, which are the primary driver of DTA consumption.
Lastly, I said on my first earnings presentation that I would soon announce the metrics by which you can measure our
progress. Last month, I presented three targets we aim to reach by the end of 2015. First is achieving an efficiency ratio
in Citicorp in the mid-50% range. Second, we want to generate a return on Citigroup's tangible common equity of over
10%. And third is reaching a return on Citigroup's assets of between 90 and 110 basis points in a risk balanced manner.
These goals will not be easily reached on a full-year basis, but they're the right ones for our company given the
environment. And as I have said, you are what you measure, and we will hold ourselves accountable.
We're executing the repositioning plan we announced in December. But as I've said, driving efficiency needs to be
business as usual, and we're working hard to engrain that into the organization. To that end, as you may have heard last
week, we'll remove a layer of management in our Institutional Clients group so that our six principal lines of businesses
will report directly to Jamie Forese. This simplification preserves the businesses which are core to our unparalleled
global network and will lead to better integration in service of our institutional clients.
Looking ahead, I believe the environment is going to remain challenging. Europe's issues, as the situation in Cyprus
shows, still have the potential to rattle the markets and impact investor confidence. At best, the Eurozone is in a period
of austerity instead of growth. And the ongoing low rate environment, new regulation, and cost of putting certain

legacy issues behind us will continue to put pressure on our earnings. But I am confident we're on the right course, and
I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.
Now John will go over the slides, and then we'd be happy to answer any of your questions. John?
John C. Gerspach
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.
To start, I'd like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were
negative $319 million pre-tax and $198 million after tax in the first quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.06. For
comparison purposes, in the first quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion pre-tax or $800 million
after tax, for a negative impact of $0.27 per share.
In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a pre-tax gain of roughly $475 million related to the sale of
minority investments, which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.10 per share in that quarter. Adjusting for CVA/DVA,
we earned $4 billion in the first quarter of 2013, or $1.29 per share, as compared to $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis
in the first quarter of 2012. Throughout today's earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding
CVA/DVA and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments to provide comparability to prior periods.
In addition, as shown on slide four, there are a few other significant items which are included in our results. First,
operating expenses in the first quarter included legal and related costs of over $700 million compared to nearly $1.3
billion last quarter and $545 million in the prior year. Legal and related costs in Citicorp were down significantly in the
first quarter, to $66 million. However, Citi Holdings legal expenses increased to over $600 million, primarily reflecting
higher legacy legal expenses in the Special Asset Pool [SAP]. Legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated
and volatile as we continue to put our legacy issues behind us.
Second, repositioning costs were $148 million in the first quarter compared to $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012
and $66 million in the first quarter of last year. Given the higher than normal repositioning costs in the fourth quarter,
today I'll be discussing our results excluding the charges in that quarter to provide comparability.
And finally, the loan loss reserve release in the first quarter was $652 million, including a release of roughly $375
million related to the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings. In total, the net reserve release was $86
million in the prior quarter and nearly $1.2 billion in the first quarter of last year.
On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $20.8 billion grew 3% from last year, while
operating expenses of $12.4 billion increased 1%, driven by the higher legal and related costs in Citi Holdings.
Excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges, core operating expenses were $11.5 billion in the first
quarter, down slightly from the prior year. Looking forward, core operating expenses should decline as we begin to see
the benefits of the repositioning actions announced last December.
Credit costs of $2.5 billion declined 16% versus last year. Net credit losses of $3 billion were down 25%. However, the
loan loss reserve release also declined by nearly half to $652 million.
We earned $4 billion of net income in the first quarter, or $1.29 per share, up from $1.11 per share last year on a
comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by the increase in legal and
related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.
Our effective tax rate was also higher in the first quarter at 29% versus 27% last year. We expect our full-year tax rate
to be in the range of 30% in 2013 as a result of both higher expected earnings in North America as well as a higher tax
rate on international operations. The increased rate on earnings outside North America is due to a change in our
assertion that earnings in certain entities would be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. As we have built up capital
in these entities that is adequate to support future investments, we now believe that current and future earnings in these
entities could be repatriated at some point.

Citigroup end-of-period loans were flat year over year at $646 billion in the first quarter, as growth in Citicorp was
offset by the wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 3% to $934 billion.
On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated first quarter revenues of $19.9
billion and net income of $4.8 billion. Year over year, revenues grew 2% and expenses declined by 2%, driven by
lower legal and related expenses in Citicorp. Credit costs increased modestly year over year, as a decline in net credit
losses was more than offset by lower reserve releases.
And we continued to grow loans year over year in each core business. Total Citicorp loans grew 5%, with consumer
loans up 1% and corporate loans up 9%. Citi Holdings had revenues of $910 million and a net loss of $788 million, a
significant improvement from prior periods, driven by lower credit costs. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $149
billion of assets, down $60 billion or 29% year over year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 8% of
total Citigroup assets.
Turning now to Citicorp, on slide seven we show Citicorp's pre-tax earnings by business, excluding the impact of loan
loss reserves, on a trailing 12-month basis. Through the first quarter, pre-tax earnings grew to $21 billion, an increase
of nearly 30% over the prior 12 months, driven by Consumer Banking and Securities & Banking.
Slide eight shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues of $5.1 billion in the first quarter
were down 1% year over year. In Retail Banking, revenues were down 3%, as loan and deposit growth was more than
offset by spread compression in this low rate environment. Cards revenues, on the other hand, were flat versus last
year, as lower average loan balances were largely offset by an improvement in net interest spreads, as we benefited
from both an improvement in yields as well as lower funding costs. Sequentially, total revenues declined 4% on lower
mortgage gain-on-sale margins as well as seasonally lower cards revenues.
Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were up 4% year over year, reflecting higher volume related costs and
repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency savings. On a sequential basis, expenses declined on lower legal
and related costs. Credit costs of roughly $900 million increased 12% year over year. Net credit losses declined by 23%
to $1.3 billion, driven by an improvement in cards. However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower,
at $370 million this quarter.
Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, increased by nearly 20% to $1.4 billion.
Overall, we continued to see progress in our North America Consumer franchise. Average deposits continued to grow,
up 10% year over year, including 17% growth in checking account balances. In branded cards, accounts also grew, up
3% from last year. And for both card portfolios, we saw continued expansion in net interest spreads.
On slide nine, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. On this basis, both revenues
and expenses grew 3% year over year. In Latin America, revenues grew 6% and expenses were up 7% from last year,
as spread compression slowed revenue growth while volumes remained strong. In Asia, revenues were down slightly
versus last year and expenses were flat. And in EMEA, revenues grew 2% with a 2% decline in expenses.
While International Consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression in certain markets as well as the
impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Asia, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the first
quarter. Total average loans grew 4% from last year. Card purchase sales were up 7%, and investment sales grew 24%
year over year. Based on this continued volume growth as well as expected efficiency savings, we currently believe
both Latin America and Asia will return to positive operating leverage on a full-year basis in 2013.
Credit costs of $829 million in the first quarter were up 6% from last year on higher net credit losses due mostly to loan
growth and portfolio seasoning.
Slide 10 shows our international consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in our International Consumer
portfolio remains strong in the first quarter, with stable to improving credit trends on a sequential basis across each
region. In Asia, the NCL rate returned to below 1%, with 90-plus-day delinquencies at around 50 basis points. And in
Latin America, the NCL rate was fairly stable at 4.6%. We continue to believe that the NCL rate in Latin America
should normalize around 4.5% by the second half of 2013.

Slide 11 shows our Securities & Banking business. Revenues of $7.3 billion grew 8% from last year and 50% from the
prior quarter. Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were up 22% from the prior year, with higher revenues in all
major products. Revenues increased 6% sequentially, and overall Investment Banking wallet share continued to
improve in the quarter.
Equity market revenues of $826 million were down 10% from last year, due in part to the impact of lower volatility on
derivatives revenues, and increased 78% from the fourth quarter on higher cash equity volumes and improved
derivatives performance.
Fixed income market revenues of $4.6 billion declined 3% from last year as rates and currencies revenues were down
from a very strong prior-year period, partially offset by growth in securitized products. Sequentially, fixed income
revenues were up 69% on improved results across all products.
Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $333 million in the
first quarter, down 7% from last year, primarily related to loan sale activity, and down 12% sequentially on lower
average loans and a slight decline in spreads.
Total operating expenses of $3.6 billion were down 4% from last year and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher
incentive compensation. Net income of $2.5 billion grew 17% year over year and more than doubled versus the prior
quarter.
Moving to Transaction Services on slide 12, revenues of $2.6 billion were down 4% from last year on a reported basis
and down 2% in constant dollars. Treasury & Trade Solutions was down 3% in constant dollars, as loan and deposit
growth was more than offset by the impact of spread compression globally. And Securities & Fund Services revenues
grew 2% in constant dollars, as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads. While spread
compression dampened revenues this quarter, the volume drivers for Transaction Services continued to show
momentum. Average trade loans grew 20% year over year. Average deposits were up 10%. Assets under custody grew
by 8%, and SFS settlement volumes grew 5%.
Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 3% from last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant dollars, mainly on higher
volumes; and down 5% sequentially, due in part to lower legal and related costs. While spread compression is likely to
continue to impact revenues in the near term, we believe we can achieve revenue growth and a return to positive
operating leverage on a full-year basis in 2013.
Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were flat versus the prior year, while expenses of $568
million declined 28% on lower legal and related expenses. Assets of $280 billion included approximately $83 billion of
cash and cash equivalents and $143 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities.
Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $149 billion in Citi Holdings or roughly 8% of
total Citigroup assets. The $7 billion reduction in the first quarter reflected $2 billion of asset sales, $4 billion of net
paydowns, and roughly $1 billion of cost of credit. As you can see on the slide, other assets in Local Consumer
Lending [LCL] increased during the quarter by nearly $3 billion. These are primarily loans held for sale where we were
in the process of a transaction but had not yet closed as of quarter end.
On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $910 million were up 15% year
over year, as higher revenues in the Special Asset Pool were partially offset by a decline in Local Consumer Lending,
driven by declining loan balances. Citi Holdings expenses increased 23% year over year to $1.5 billion, driven by
higher legal and related costs in the Special Asset Pool. Excluding these higher legal costs, core operating expenses
declined 18% year over year to roughly $860 million. This decline reflects declining assets as well as the expiration of
certain transition services agreements related to prior sales activity.
Credit costs declined 44% year over year to roughly $750 million. Net credit losses declined significantly to $930
million. And the net loan loss reserve release was over $350 million, including a release of roughly $375 million
related to North America mortgages.

Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 16, rep and warranty reserve builds and legal and
related costs continue to weigh on Citi Holdings. On an operating basis, however, excluding these items and
repositioning, we maintained a modest positive operating margin again in the first quarter. Credit trends were
particularly favorable, with North America mortgage NCLs declining to $630 million, roughly 60% of which were
offset by reserve releases. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America
mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 36 months of coverage.
On slide 17, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the first quarter
of 2011, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 28%, driven by $18 billion of
paydowns, $8 billion of asset sales, and $8 billion of net losses. In the first quarter, we sold $2.8 billion of loans,
including $1 billion of delinquent mortgages and $1.8 billion of current loans. A significant portion of the current loans
were reperforming mortgages where we had previously modified the loan and it subsequently remained current. While
we are, of course, encouraged by the sale of these reperforming mortgages in the quarter, it is still unclear whether
buyers will have an appetite for additional sales of this nature, and we will continue to test the market.
We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net losses in the portfolio, down 50% since in the first quarter of 2011
to $630 million, even while roughly $76 million of losses were accelerated into the recent quarter as a result of the
continued actions we are taking to fulfill our commitments under the National Mortgage Settlement, or NMS. We
expect to fulfill our obligations under NMS in the second quarter. However, we will continue to modify loans under the
OCC foreclosure review settlement announced last quarter, which we estimate will pull forward $30 million to $40
million of losses into each quarter for the remainder of 2013.
On slide 18, we have showed delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans.
Thirty-plus day delinquencies improved by 19% sequentially to $6.1 billion, with improvement in both portfolios.
Residential first mortgage delinquencies fell 20% sequentially to $4.8 billion, driven by asset sales as well as fewer
new entries into the early buckets. And home equity delinquencies also improved by 15% to $1.2 billion.
On slide 19, we show our net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was roughly flat year over year
at $11.9 billion, and declined 2% sequentially due to a lower day count. Our net interest margin increased by one basis
point to 294 basis points in the first quarter. On a full-year basis, we believe we should be able to maintain our net
interest margin above the 288 basis points we achieved last year. However, there will be quarterly fluctuations. And in
particular, we expect the net interest margin to decline sequentially in the second quarter by a few basis points.
On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics through the first quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated Tier 1 common
ratio increased to 9.3% versus 8.7% last quarter. And our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was 11.8%, including the impact
of the market risk rules which became effective at the beginning of the quarter, up from 11.1% on a comparable basis
last quarter.
In summary, our results for the first quarter reflected a continued challenging operating environment, with spread
compression globally and elevated legal and related cost remaining as headwinds. Against this backdrop, we continued
to grow our core business while beginning to reduce the earnings drag from Citi Holdings.
In Securities & Banking, we again demonstrated our ability to grow revenues while keeping expense discipline. And in
Consumer Banking and Transaction Services, we continued to grow loans and deposits year over year while
maintaining a high-quality credit portfolio.
In Citi Holdings, assets are now less than $150 billion, and the net loss was less than $800 million this quarter, even as
we continued to face elevated legal and related costs.
And finally, our liquidity and capital positions remain strong, with estimated aggregate liquidity resources in excess of
$370 billion and an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 9.3% at quarter end.
Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to grow volumes to compensate for the impact of the low interest
rate environment. And we remain on track to achieve the $900 million of efficiency savings expected this year from our
previously announced repositioning actions.

With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much. So I like this closure. On 17, you showed us that 60% of NCLs were
offset with loan loss reserve releases. Between the sales and then just improving conditions in general, should we be
thinking 60% offset is the right number, or should that grow over time as the portfolio shrinks and the market keeps
getting better?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Glenn, I would say that if the portfolio continues to demonstrate improving credit trends and
if the market – housing market remains stable, you should assume that we would likely increase that percentage
coverage as we move through the year.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, cool. The comment, John, that you made earlier related to the tax rate in certain
international entities -- is that a comment on thoughts on repatriation? I guess it's the same question. Is it at all related
to what I think is a growing subsidiarization trend, meaning the U.S. pushes foreign banks to hold more capital in the
U.S.? Now are other markets doing that? How much is that a risk that we should be thinking of, trapped capital around
the world for you guys?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That is an ongoing area that I think everyone is looking at, but that's not what's driving this
decision. Glenn, when you look at the requirements under APB 23, one of the things that you've got to assert is that the
capital in the offshore legal entities is to be permanently reinvested outside the States. And specific legal entities, and
here think in terms of our bank in Singapore and our bank in Ireland, we've built up now substantial capital. And as you
look at the capital levels, we have enough capital to meet the investment requirements that we see out into the future.
And so it's likely that at some point in time, current earnings and the future earnings in those legal entities could be
repatriated into the States. And therefore, we're going to provide the U.S. taxes – the differential between the U.S. tax
rate and the local tax rate on those earnings.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay; I got that. That's very helpful, thanks. Last one. So post stress test where you had super
high capital ratios after the stress test, you have very high Basel III now and growing pretty quickly. That leads people
towards getting real excited about next year's CCAR. Just the question I have is how do the rating agencies thinking
about removing some of the implicit government support and the OLA [Orderly Liquidation Authority] coming rules
play into your role about Citi's ideal capital structure?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Those are all things that are developing and maybe will get further developed as 2013
unfolds. For now, we're waiting to see what rules come out regarding OLA.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Has there been any pre-funding of it? In other words, I thought I saw you do some sub-debt
issuance and your funding costs have come way down given your good performance.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, to the extent that we've had debt maturities, we've rolled over some of those
maturities, although we've been in the process of reducing long-term debt. I think you've seen us issue some preferred
stock in the last couple of quarters. That's -- you take a look at the capital structure, we think preferred stock is a piece
of that structure that we need to do some issuance with as we think ahead to what the Basel III capital requirements are,

Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning. John, on the expenses, I was wondering. You mentioned that on
the core expenses of about $11.5 billion, we should start to see those start to come down as you get the repositioning
benefits. Is there a new range of core expenses we should think about over the next couple quarters?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, John. We're staying with what we said at year end, and you should expect, as we just
said, to see the core expenses decline over the next couple of quarters.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: From that $11.5 billion, is that right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct, correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on the legal repositioning side, I think you just said volatile and
likely to remain elevated. Is this the neighborhood we should think about, or too tough to predict?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say it's too tough to predict. I think if you take a look at legal expenses, though, what did
we run last year, $2.8 billion for the full year or something like that, and now you've got $700 million or so in the first
quarter. I'll leave it at that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, I wasn't sure. I appreciate it. Okay, so you're running at the same pace as last
year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Roughly on average.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then in terms of the net interest income, your net interest income dollars
fell in the first quarter. I assume there are some day count pressure, and you mentioned the NIM outlook. Was just
wondering, though. Do you hope to grow the net interest income dollars in 2013 given the earning asset expansion
you're doing?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm sorry, John, what was the...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Do you expect the net interest income dollars to grow this year in 2013? You were
down on NII in the first quarter sequentially. I'm just wondering if -- you mentioned the NIM outlook. I was wondering
if you think...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We don't – John, I don't give net interest revenue outlooks. That gets into really going
forward looking. On a day count basis, though, if you take a look at the average net interest revenue for us, it was about
$132 million in the fourth quarter and the same number in the first quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay; got it. And then last thing for me, on the DTA, could you give us some sense of
the drivers of the consumption, how much from improving just U.S. net income versus other factors that might have
been in play?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, if you look at the moving pieces of the DTA, there's about $100 million of DTA that
was actually added by the CVA/DVA loss. Citi Holdings losses added about $500 million of DTA, and then Citicorp
earnings actually consumed – enabled us to consume about $1 billion of DTA this quarter. And then the balance of
$300 million basically came out of OCI.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, so hard to run rate this or to give an outlook, I guess? It will still bounce around
a little bit? Do you have any outlook on the consumption or the ability to consume?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, you have to think about it this way. As long as we can continue to do some growth in
U.S. earnings, that should be helpful. And that includes winding – further wind-downs in the Citi Holdings losses. And
also, the change in the APB 23 assertion -- that change in the effective tax rate, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, those
incremental taxes will also serve to offset the DTA.

billion.

Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just wanted to drill into the litigation charge, which went into SAP. As you pointed out in
that slide at the beginning on the significant P&L items, at least in the comparable periods, most of those significant
legal charges were in Citicorp, and I think you were carrying them in Corp & Other, if I remember right. So the change
in the geography to put it in SAP indicates that there's something related to the type of assets that are in SAP. Could
you tell us a little bit more about what the, I guess, probably $500 million or so implicit in SAP in those litigation
charges are? And is it a reserve build, or is there something specific that you're dealing with there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Guy, we don't comment on specific legal accruals unless we're announcing a settlement of
some sort. But think in terms that we certainly put the legal accruals in the business -- or in the segment, that is, that is
going to be impacted by the matter for which we're setting aside the legal reserves.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay; fair enough. If we look at the operating expenses in LCL and we look through some of
the noise there, that has been running around $1 billion a quarter, and it came down to about $825 million. Is that a step
function that we should think about run rating as you are seeing meaningful reductions in, for example, foreclosure
servicing and the like?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Certainly, as we continue to sell off non-performing loans, one of the benefits that we look
to achieve by the sale of the non-performing loans is to be able to bring down the servicing expenses on those loans.
I'm not going to encourage you to necessarily run rate $825 million. But you can assume that one of the things that we
aim to do through the loan sale is to target those loans that not only are producing higher levels of NCLs, but that come
with them a higher level of servicing costs.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great; that's helpful. Turning to Citicorp and looking at Global Consumer in North America,
I know it's not a real big thing, but you've sustained a pretty steady growth rate of commercial markets loan assets. I
think you're up almost 20% year over year to over $8 billion. Again, it's not huge when you put it in the context of, say,
some of your competitors, but it's a pretty significant growth rate. Is this an area that you've been targeting for much
more significant loan growth, and how are you doing that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, actually, Guy, that's true. That is an area that Cece and her team have put particular
focus on over, I'll say, the last year. Maybe it has been the last 15 months. But that's definitely an area where we see an
opportunity to expand, and we've grown both deposits and loans in that market.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And is it targeted at particular industries? Is it largely branch-based?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's definitely branch-based, and there is certainly – there are certain industries that we have
targeted. I believe that, at least in the last couple of months, the small energy companies have been a particular standout

for us.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful; thanks. Final question is just on the cautious commentary. Mike said
something like we're sure to be tested. I'm just wondering if there's anything specific that he's looking at there that is
giving him pause.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Guy, I would say that as we look around the world that you can just look at growth rates
around the world and continue to see the world is a very uneven place, with growth rates in the emerging markets
around 5%, growth rates in the developed market space around 1%. And you can see the volatility and reactions,
whether it's to slowing growth in China this morning or whether it was Cyprus issues. And so I think the world
continues to be somewhat of a fragile place, and I expect the markets to remain volatile.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay; great. Thanks very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Quick question on the long-term debt. You guys reduced it about $85 billion last year. It has
certainly been helpful to the margin. With OLA or anything else like that, do you see that slowing this year? What's
your outlook on long-term debt?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, we'll give a little bit more perspective on that when we do the fixed income call next
week. But I think you can already see some slowdown. I believe end-of-period long-term debt only came down about
$5 billion or so quarter on quarter.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So we're not quite at the pace that we were last year.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. So expect that slower reduction from here?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It certainly is not going to be at the pace it was last year, that's for sure.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Got you. And just maybe on the capital side, is it still expected that when you transfer, so
finalize the deal with Morgan Stanley on the JV, it would add around 30 to 40 basis points to your Basel III ratio?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Assuming that Morgan Stanley were to call the entire 35%, yes.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right, right. Okay, fair enough. And then lastly, as the mortgage environment continues to
looks better, the housing environment, is there any improved outlook on some of the discrete assets in Holdings like
One Main? Clearly, profitability seems to have been improving there. But I don't know how you guys feel about the
funding markets and the ability for someone to buy that.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Jim, we continue to look at all those. And as you've seen when the prices and the terms are
right, we'll act against that. Clearly, the recovery in housing helps not just the mortgage portfolio, but also helps on the
consumer side in general. So we continue to watch that, but we've got no reaction today to plans there.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay; fair enough. All right, thanks, guys.

Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple questions. One is on the S&B expense ratio posted a very low 49%. I'm just
wondering how you're thinking about what a normalized expense ratio should be in that segment.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think that as we looked ahead and you look out for 2015, we've already given some degree
of where we think the expense ratio should be longer term for Securities & Banking. We said overall for Citicorp, we
would expect an efficiency ratio of 55%, and I believe that embedded in that was an expense ratio less than 60% for
Securities & Banking.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And the low ratio this quarter, does that suggest you're not paying – you don't pay
out on mark-to-market gains? Is that right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think it's awfully hard to judge long-term efficiency ratios on one quarter. So there are
always going to be revenues that don't repeat and there's an expense base that's fixed. And all things to be that, I'd love
to have four quarters strung together like the first quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Sure.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But that's not the way we've actually built the expense base.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right, I just wanted to clarify that. And then on the capital ratio, obviously strong
increase this quarter of 50 bps up in common Tier 1. And rolling the camera forward, it looks like you'll be
significantly north of 9.5% obviously by year end as long as the curve doesn't move up too much. So the question is
how do you think about using some of that capital? And a two-part question; one, would there be – would you have any
interest in buying portfolios? I know you can't buy depositories, but maybe assets and put some of the capital to work
that way.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure; so, Betsy, a couple things. One is from a capital perspective, you're right. We'll
continue to build capital as we go through the year. As I said in my opening remarks, I think that we should probably
finish the year on a Basel III basis somewhere probably north of 10%.
I think we'll continue to look opportunistically at things out there, so I think the Best Buy transaction was an example
from a portfolio that we saw. And we thought it made sense from a business fit, from a credit profile, from a synergistic
perspective with other parts of our business. We'll continue to look for those situations as they present themselves, but
nothing really too overt in terms of being aggressively on an asset purchase perspective.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And if something did come up and you had to choose between doing something
that made sense for you from an acquisition perspective versus hitting the 10% plus at year end, would that – does the
10% matter? Is that a goal that you – is that the primary goal?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think the 10% does matter. What we know is we know that the 9.5% is a real number.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: What we don't know today is we don't know what the right buffer is because we don't know
what it means to be above or below the 9.5%. So I think we would certainly look at any opportunities with a balanced
eye towards those things that we think make sense for the intermediate and longer term versus the shorter-term capital
tradeoff. Tough to say; we'd have to look at the situation.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just lastly, would you have any interest in going back and asking the
regulators for an additional buyback request over and above what you were granted in March this year in this calendar

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi, first a couple of specific questions, then one broader question. So what is your Tier 1 Basel
III common target?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: From a target point of view, Mike, two things. One is we said that we expect to end the year
above 10%. And I think what Mike just said is, he thinks 10%, we think 10% is a reasonable figure to think about right
now, just as we're trying to assess what is the appropriate level of buffer to have or maybe not have above 9.5%. So
right now, we're thinking in terms of 10% overall.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Does that expectation include the 30 to 40 basis points from the sale of the rest of the joint
venture?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. In order to finish the year in Mike's numbers, as far as being above 10%, that doesn't
require Morgan Stanley to call the entire 35%.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So that would be bonus on top of the 10% if it happens?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, and let me just be very clear. We do expect Morgan Stanley to at least call the 15%
which is due this year. We're not counting on them calling the additional 20%.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Separately, you've mentioned repatriation. Is that part of your tax planning strategy so that you
can use more of the DTA?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. Repatriation of the earnings that we're applying the taxes on doesn't really involve the
DTA. By providing the taxes, we're driving down the DTA. If we were to dividend those earnings, that could provide a
little bit of a benefit perhaps in the actual utilization against the foreign tax credits. But that's not something that we're
actively planning on right now.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, a question for Mike. This is the first conference call since the March 5
announcement about the longer-term positioning. And on the March 5 call, Mike, you said we've got to prove the value
of our model. And I was wondering how you would see evidence of that proof.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think if you look at all the operating aspects of our model in this quarter, markets in
banking, CTS, Consumer, I think all had reasonable to better than reasonable quarters. I think if you look at both from
an absolute perspective and importantly from a relative perspective, on the banking side of things we continued to grow
market share, which is an important approach to how we look at the value or the increasing value of our franchise. And
I think importantly, Mike, what we've done, as John showed in one of the slides, the sequential growth that we've
actually shown in our Markets and Banking businesses as well as our Consumer businesses over a reasonably extended
time period. And so I think the business has performed well, and I think that we've shown this quarter a good sample of
when the franchise performs right what value it can drive.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: As a follow-up, I agree the numbers beat consensus. The stock is up 3%. But the stock is still
down 90% pre-crisis. The ROE, with all the encouraging signs, is still only 8% versus 20% before the crisis. So if we
look back, say, in two or three years, what would be the larger evidence that proves the value of the model?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: You've got to really separate a couple things in there. One is the numbers that you're citing,
and appropriately so, are inclusive of the drag of Citi Holdings. And so again, one of the things that we're focused on,

reducing assets, reducing that drag. And as we go forward, we will hopefully see some of those things get behind us. I
think as Betsy said, we did hit some fairly robust efficiency ratios out of parts of our Markets businesses and other
places. And so, we'd like to take what is happening in one quarter and continue to build on that and create more
sustainability around it. So I think those would be good milestones of progress.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And we've laid those things out as far as the targets that we've got on the table for 2015,
both from an efficiency goal point of view in Citicorp, and then ROA and ROTCE targets for Citigroup.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So is it fair to say those three targets will ultimately be the proof of the value of the model?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: At least the value of the model up through 2015.

Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Hi, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: A couple of questions to clarify what's been talked about so far. Just on the repatriation of
foreign earnings into the U.S., I know you talked about the DTA impact of that a little bit, but I just wasn't totally clear.
If that were to happen, that does lower DTA, correct?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: By providing the tax, the U.S. tax, we've already lowered the DTA. If I had – let's just work
through an example, Matt. If I've got earnings in a legal entity that has a 12.5% tax rate, like in Ireland, and I have no
intention of repatriating those earnings, they're going to be permanently reinvested outside, the only tax expense that
would hit the P&L would be the 12.5% local tax. Now what we're saying is current and future earnings out of that legal
entity could be repatriated. It could be dividended back into the States at some point in time, which means now that you
would need to provide the differential between the 35% statutory U.S. rate and the 12.5% local rate. So that 22.5%
incremental tax that we're providing is both an income tax expense that is impacting the P&L. You see it reflected in
our effective tax rate. And because it's a U.S. tax provision, it serves to reduce the DTA.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, so it's helping you right now whether or not you actually repatriate the earnings?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's correct.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, that's helpful, and then just another follow-up question. In the beginning comments,
you said something like you laid out the three targets for 2015 and then said you won't reach these on a full-year basis.
Did you mean full-year in 2013 or full-year 2015? What was that comment?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Those are targets that we set out or Mike set out a month ago for the performance of the
franchise for the year 2015. Those were our targets. We wanted to get Citicorp efficiency ratio at 55% or better. We
wanted to drive for Citigroup a return on tangible common of 10% or better; and a return on assets, average assets, for
Citigroup between 90 and 110 basis points. Those are the targets that we are still working towards.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, got it. And then separately, sorry to put you on the spot here a little bit, but we've
had a very big move in certain commodities the last couple of days. And I know you guys had significantly reduced
that business broadly speaking within your FICC areas a couple years ago. But are you sensitive to big price swings on
some of these commodity prices out there?

Your next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So a couple questions on the decline in delinquency in North American mortgage within
LCL. I think you guys said that $1 billion was in sales. Was the rest primarily in charge-offs?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, let's just go over the numbers. We did about $2.8 billion of sales in the quarter. About
$1 billion of those were for delinquent loans, and the other $1.8 billion would be current loans.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Right. So the delinquent loans were down 140 bps in the quarter, linked quarter. So that's
like...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: ...1.4%-ish, right? So $1 billion was in sales. So was the rest charge-offs of the decline?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Some of it was charge-offs. Some of it was just an improvement in delinquency trends.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Delinquency trends, great. How did that break down? Was it primarily charge-offs?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't have that, I'm sorry.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then in the sales of the loans at this point, what kind of discount is necessary to
sell those loans at this point, and how would that flow through the P&L?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Actually on some of the sales that we've done, we did it at book value or above, so those
don't really have a loss associated with them. In general, Brennan, I would say it's going to be different for every
tranche of sale that you do because every tranche is a different point in the delinquency spectrum. And so depending
upon the quality of the loan, where it's delinquent, is it a modified loan, you're going to get a different discount rate. We
did see an improvement in pricing this quarter though. I'd say that basically across the entire spectrum of mortgage loan
sales that we looked at, I would say that pricing improved somewhere between 5% and 10 percentage points higher this
quarter compared to similar activity that we would have been looking at in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And I think you've mentioned that you've got $3 billion in Other that is basically
loans that are available for sale that you're in the process of selling. Is that similar to the $2.8 billion mix of delinquent
and current mortgage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Brennan, some of that $3 billion the $2.8 billion. In other words, when we enter into a
contract to sell loans, let's say mortgage loans, we would take those loans then out of the mortgage portfolio and move
them into held-for-sale. It's not available for sale; it's held for sale. So these are transactions where we've got a signed
contract; we just haven't closed as yet. So some portion of the $2.8 billion of mortgage sales that I referenced in the
period, some of that is in the held-for-sale account and will be cleared out by the end of this month.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And for these sales of delinquent mortgages, did that have a lot to do with, I think, on
a Basel III basis, RWAs within Holdings dropped somewhere around $6 billion. Was a lot of that driven by these sales,
or were there other factors going on? Could you lay that out too?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: When we look at doing a sale of any asset in Holdings, I think Mike has talked about this.
We look at it both, and especially when it's in a delinquent mortgage, you look at it as far as what's the level of
expected future credit losses that we expect on that mortgage; what's the cost of servicing that mortgage. And clearly a
component of it would be what are the capital costs associated with continuing to hold that mortgage. So we look at all
of those various aspects of it. I think if you looked as far as the drop in the Basel III assets for this quarter, it's probably
a little bit heavily weighted towards the SAP portfolio again as opposed to the LCL portfolio.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, okay. That helps, and then last quick one. The pending sale of the Turkish operations,
is there anything we can think about as far as expectation for operating expense declines on the back of that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, I think what we said in the press release is this is not a material transaction. It will
have some; you'll see some drop-off in revenue. You'll see some drop-off in expenses, but it's not material.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question will come from the line of Jeffery Harte with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: It may be a bit picky, but looking at the International Consumer loan growth, 4% year over year
is quite a bit lower than we had been seeing, sometimes north of 7%. Can you talk a little bit about what appears to be a
declining growth rate in the International Consumer loan business?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, you've got – I think you've got two different drivers. Jeff. What you may want to do is
in the investor deck, if you go back to one of the pages that we have in the appendix, slide 29, and we actually break
out the various drivers in constant dollars, split by region. And I think what you're going to see is a little bit of a
different story depending upon the region.
If you look at it, we're still getting, I think, reasonable growth in Latin America. Latin America, it slowed down a little
bit in the first quarter as primarily the Mexican economy slowed down a little bit. But still on a sequential basis and you
take a look at the average loans, we're still growing card loans, and there's some seasonality. Normally, you're going to
have a little bit of a lower first quarter anyway. So we're still getting growth in Latin America out of cards and the
Retail Banking loans.
The issue for us remains Asia. And if you stay on that same slide 29 and take a look at Asia, on an average card basis,
it's flat. And quite frankly, you can go back to the first quarter of 2012 and we have flat average loans. You're looking
at $19.7 billion, $19.8 billion, $19.7 billion, $19.8 billion. And then you take a look at the retail bank average loans,
and again they're flat. So we're getting growth in some of the countries in Asia. We're getting decent growth in Hong
Kong, in Singapore. The issue – and I hate to keep bringing it up. Korea is just – it's a drag on us right now and it's one
that we just have to work our way through.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. It's tough to quantify, I know. But looking at Securities & Banking, you had a good
quarter, maybe some of the trading not up year over year. We've been conditioned recently to see a big drop-off in
activity levels in the second quarter. As we see I guess other things like better pricing in the North American mortgage
loan portfolio when you're selling, can you give any color or insight into what you're seeing as far as risk appetites by
investment clients out there?

<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think, Jeff, clearly a lot of the stance of the central banks out there and the availability of
credit I think we through the first quarter continue to see risk on. I think if you look at the underlying dynamics of the
business, first quarter 2012 was a terrific quarter in terms of G-10 rates and currencies. This first quarter, strong
performance in terms of our securitization revenues and in particular in North America I think as well as pretty good
contributions out of our local markets in FX businesses, so I think a good mix there. But I think as you see in the
securitization markets and some of the robustness there and I think you look at the calendar, clearly there's an appetite
for people and their willingness to continue to put on credit risk here. So we saw that through the first quarter.
But as I said, the world I think remains a challenging place, and you can just see in some near-term moves when you
get a Cyprus or you get certain things, investors do have the tendency to pull back pretty quickly from the markets
when those situations arrive. So I think we're going to have to watch that carefully.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And finally, the North American mortgage portfolio, the delinquencies got a lot better
sequentially. Have you and I missed it, or could you give us any kind of thinking on what might be a more normalized
level of losses in that portfolio? I'm trying to just get maybe a feel for how much better you think things can
theoretically get credit-wise in that portfolio.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, Jeff, I'm not going to be able to give any forward guidance as to where we think a
normalized rate is in the Holdings mortgage portfolio. We do see, as you can see, the credit performance is improving.
And if you go back to one of the slides that we've got in there, slide 17, you can see that we've seen credit losses
continue to decline in that portfolio. And we would expect to see declining losses into the future. But I can't give you a
"normalized" rate on this particular portfolio.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay, thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right.

Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great, thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Moshe.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Thanks. Not to beat the North American mortgage to death, but do you have a sense? Could
you tell us how much of the portfolio you think would be saleable at or above book value?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, I can't.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay. But in the same – you had previously talked about the average life of the portfolio. I'm
assuming with the sales and such that the average life is declining. Is that fair?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I have to tell you, Moshe, I haven't tried to – I haven't even tested the guys on what
they now think the average life is.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: I guess the reason I'm asking is as the number of months of coverage goes up, if the average
life is coming down, it seems like the two of those are going in both in the right direction and eating – one should be
eating into the other pretty aggressively at this point.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: If the average life is coming down, I would agree with you. I just don't know that right now.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay, all right. And you addressed a couple of questions ago about the growth in consumer
loans in Asia a little bit; anything else in terms of programs or things that you've got to show better results in parts of
that? Are there any things that we can talk about?

<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: I mean are there parts of the portfolio that you're seeing any better results that you can talk
about?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, and I would say in a lot of Asia, and I think I called out before Singapore and Hong
Kong, we are seeing good sustained growth in the 8% to 10% range for revenues, and you can see growth in some of
the key drivers there as well. But there are just a lot of different countries. I mentioned Korea before, but it's not just
Korea. As there is deleveraging, there are regulatory constraints being put on several countries throughout Asia. And so
we're facing some headwinds in Australia, in Taiwan, and in Korea as well. One item that I think will help us later in
this year, we can begin card sales again in Indonesia beginning next month. And so that's a market that we've been
limited in for the last two years.

Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Hello, thanks so much. I just want to refocus a little bit on the North American Mortgage
operations of Citicorp. I note you did ramp up the originations quite a bit over the last year at around $18 billion in the
last quarter. However, at the same time, the servicing portfolio continues to decline, and I don't see any additions to the
size of the mortgage portfolio in Citicorp. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color of what you see
there. Are you planning to try to increase your market share in Citicorp in mortgage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Mortgage for us is not a big business. We're very focused on executing on the mortgages for
our Retail Banking customers. So as we've looked at a lot of the mortgage origination so far, it has really been more
heavily weighted towards our branch business than anything else. But as you've seen, the rate lock volume that we put
through in the first quarter, it actually is down slightly year over year, and it was up a bit from the fourth quarter. But
the mix is very heavily weighted towards our branch operations.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay, so there's no reemphasis to try to earn more money in that sector.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: None; we're not looking to significantly grow share in mortgages other than with our
existing Retail Banking base.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay, thanks. And then just quickly, I was wondering if there was any impact in the
quarter on the appreciation of the Japanese yen.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: There certainly is. But from an overall point of view, if you take a look at both the impact of
the yen, the peso strengthening, overall, the FX impact on our EBIT is zero.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay,; great. Thanks.

show the 90 days past due. And they seem to be coming down steadily, but the charge-off level is staying high, so I'm
curious. What is the dynamic? Is there something unusual going on there?
And then the second question is, on Friday there was a Dow Jones news story about you were looking to sell the
Brazilian credit card business. I wonder if you can comment on that. Is that business part of Citicorp or Holdings? And

I would have thought Brazilian credit cards would be pretty core.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's a lot of questions, so Brazilian cards is part of Citicorp. We don't comment on
newspaper musings.
Regarding the delinquencies and the NCLs in Latin America, we have had a bit of an increase in the NCLs, and that has
primarily been due to the seasoning that we've had in certain credit card portfolios in Mexico. And so we understand
that the NCLs are a bit elevated right now, and that's why they've grown to that 4.6% that is on one of those slides. But
we do believe that by the second half of the year, the overall NCL – excuse me; I'm just losing my voice -- the overall
NCL rate in Latin America should normalize at around 4.5%. So we don't see that as being a continuing upward trend.
And I think if you look at some of those statistics, and we give you the 90-plus days past due, you can see the fact that
in Latin America, the 90-plus is either been flat from a cards point of view or it has actually been improving in the
Retail Banking business.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: That was my question, why the delinquencies were down and the charge-offs were
flat. It's not a pattern you normally see.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, it's just the seasoning of some large credit card portfolios in Mexico. But that should all
settle out by the second half of the year.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: Okay; thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. I guess good afternoon at this point. Sorry, just a quick question, a couple of
quick ones. I guess to focus on Korea, is there anything in the recent activity going on in Korea that has you more
worried about the potential for -- quote-unquote -- fixing Korea in the timeframe you've been talking about over the last
six to nine months?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, not really.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then it does sound a little bit as if you are a bit more hopeful of the possibility of
selling assets out of Holdings. But at this point, you're just – at this point it's still a little uncertain as to the potential
investor or buyer demand. Did I hear that correctly?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then I guess just quickly in terms of the mortgage market, can you give us any
indication in terms of – you mentioned a little bit about the focus on that business relative to the branch population. Do
you have any metrics you can provide us in terms of what percentage of that population you're currently serving in
terms of mortgages and where you'd like to get? And as mortgages decline, how should we think about the operating
costs in that business coming down?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I can't give you any statistics. I don't have anything with me that would point towards
potential penetration of the Retail Banking client base for mortgages. I'm sorry.

Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.
<Q - Leanne E. Penala>: Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just had one on
capital return. Clearly, with a very positive stress test result behind you and you mentioning that your Basel III Tier 1
common will likely be above 10% at the end of the year, how should we think about the progression, the midterm
progression of capital return? Should we assume a more gradual increase in your payout ratios, or is there a possibility
of a larger stair-step next year given your excess capital positioning?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think, Erika, right now it's early to call that. Clearly, one of the things that is important in
this is not just the quantity but the quality of earnings. And I think that as we go through the year and that makes itself
more transparent, that will probably dictate how we think about that.

Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, a couple of questions. Mike, you mentioned that things slowed down a little bit with Cyprus,
or Cyprus had an impact. How have the first two weeks of this quarter been given Cyprus, et cetera, from a trading
standpoint?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I would say certainly slower than the very fast start to the year, but volumes are decent.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay, okay. And because it all started in March, so from March have we seen things improve a
little bit, or still just steady-ish to where it was in March?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: No, Vivek, it's a little hard to go week to week. We had a reasonably good quarter in the
first quarter. I don't think that April looks like January.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. John, I have a question for you just to follow up on the Latin American question that came
up earlier. Early delinquencies in Latin America seem to be up pretty sharply in retail loans. They were up 21% linked
quarter. How does that square with your outlook for losses coming down back to 4.5% given the sharp jump?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Beautiful question, Vivek. If you take a look at page 15 in the supplement and where you
see those increases, go back to the third quarter and you're going to see a similar increase in the third quarter. There is a
mortgage book of business in Mexico that we actually operate through payroll accounts, but they're on a 60-day
payment schedule. So we get a payment every other month. So you're going to see some variability in the delinquencies
as you move from the first quarter where we get a payment in February, to the second quarter where we get payments
then in April and June. And so by the end of June, the delinquencies are back to where you would normally expect
them to be. They'll rise again in September and they'll decline again in December. It all has to do with that one
mortgage portfolio in Mexico.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay, very helpful. I have one last question for you, John, which is the comp-to-revenue ratio in
the first quarter of 2013. Can you give me a sense of what that was and what your full-year target is for 2013, maybe
either you or Mike on that full-year target too?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, we don't comment on comp ratios.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you, a couple of questions. First, on the legal costs, I know they are legacy legal
costs and they're very lumpy and hard to predict. Can you guys tell us? Is there a statute of limitations? Has it run out
on all those legacy problems, or is there still potential for new litigation that could add to those lumpy legal costs?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The one thing that you have to assume is that the legal community is very creative. And so I
would say that there always is the opportunity for additional litigation, even in matters that you might otherwise think
would have passed the statute of limitations. I don't think lawyers have statute of limitations.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Another question was your cost of funding obviously improved this quarter. and
when you look at your deposits and recognizing you have more of a global footprint than the two big banks that
reported on Friday, but even still their cost of funding for their deposits is about a third of yours. Do you think we could
see yours fall meaningfully over the next 12 to 18 months as the outlook improves for Citigroup?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The costs, are you talking about deposits specifically?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Yes, you're at 73 basis points and they average about 25 basis points.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Don't forget, a lot of what you're probably looking at from a peer institution, they would be
operating in the U.S. and in the U.S. environment. We have a much more global deposit base.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Correct.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And so even though we're dealing with a rather low interest rate environment around the
world, a low interest rate environment in the U.S. is going to be different than a low interest rate environment, say, in
Mexico.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Very good. Moving on to credit, I noticed in the non-performing asset page or your
non-accrual page, there was an uptick in the corporate non-accrual loans in Citigroup. What was that due to?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: A couple hundred million dollars or something like that?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, it's just – there are a few. You're always going to have a little bit of an episodic
increase or an episodic decrease. There's nothing really there.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And then finally, you mentioned about Asia and the impact that Korea is having on
that business. What percentage is Korea as a percentage of the balances, the loan balances, in your Asia portfolio?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I can't give you the exact percentage, but you'll get a glimpse of it. We have got a page in
the back of the book that lays out, I don't have the page reference, but there's a page that will lay out – I think it's page
32 that will actually give you the amount of loans that we have in key countries. And so if you look in the consumer
credit, consumer loans, Korea comprises about $24 billion of our consumer loan book.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Hi, guys. I've got a question on expenses. You guys had – and it was helpful in terms of
talking about positive operating leverage expected this year for Latin America, Asia, in Consumer and GTS. How
should we think about North America Consumer? What do we need to see happen before we get to see positive
operating leverage there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say we still have – we've got to get more revenue production out of the U.S. card
businesses.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And any idea in terms of the timing or higher rates required as well?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think it's a function of – again, it's a business that we're in the process of repositioning. I
think that still in all, if you take a look at the U.S. consumer, there's a decent amount of deleveraging still underway. I
certainly don't see any releveraging necessarily on the part of the U.S. consumer other than refinancing mortgage loans
and perhaps taking out more student lending. Maybe auto loans a little bit; we're not really in that business. But from
our point of view, getting more growth in the revolving balances, that's going to be a challenge over the course of the
next couple of quarters.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks. And then in terms of the expense savings that you've previously laid out and you
were targeting $900 million for this year, how much of that, if any, has been realized in the first quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: There's just a very small amount of that that has actually been realized in the first quarter. A
lot of the people that have been notified to date, they exit beginning in March. There's a 60-day notice period. And so
those are savings that will accrue more towards the latter half of the year.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it, thanks. And then in terms of just the backdrop, as Mike has laid out early on, in
terms of things still challenging and perhaps a little bit tougher, are there more levers to pull beyond the 1/1 savings
that you've already laid out, if indeed things are worse? How should we think about that?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think as we said, we're focused on really trying to manage expenses in terms of BAU and
trying to get more efficiencies into the business. We've recently announced that we've brought somebody in externally
to help us do that. The businesses are going to be focused on that. So we're mindful of the environment, clearly with an
eye towards the expense side of things. But today, we're not going to talk about any big levers.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks, and then a couple ticky-tack questions. In the Corporate/Other line, sequentially
in your slide deck page 13, you had mentioned how linked-quarter revenue improvement was less negative this quarter
versus last, I guess partly driven by hedging activities. What was that, and how should we think about that going
forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hedging activities, there's something that is very difficult to predict. I think you'll see that
we end up with some fluctuation in that line all the time. And this is where we have some macro hedges against
elements of the business. But it's very difficult to predict.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And that was a net positive meaningfully this quarter, and...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not to – I don't have a huge positive feeling in my head about it. But I just don't have the
information in front of me. I'm sorry.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. And then the last ticky-tack is just on the liquidity. That continues to be pretty
strong. Do you have your actual LCR ratio handy? I think last quarter maybe, it was around 118%.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I think we actually ended last quarter at 122%. I think we estimated it at 118% at the
point in time we did the call. And then when the calculation was finalized, it actually increased. And we're in the
process still of doing those calculations, so I don't have a comparable figure in front of me at this point in time.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And do you have a target for that? Will that drift lower as you deploy excess liquidity,
since you're already above the required?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: What we've said is that, certainly from where it was, when it was above 122%, we said that
it could drift somewhat lower. But again, this is another one of these ratios where the minimum requirement is 100%.
And so we need to maintain some buffer above that 100% just in order to be sure that you're not going to pierce it at
some point in time. We haven't formalized exactly where we want to set that buffer.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it, thank you. That's helpful.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.
