MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to AIG's Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being
recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you, Katie. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain

Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and I appreciate being with all of you. This will be my last call and it's been a five-year period of a lot of
excitement. And this quarter reflects a lot of hard work on behalf of all of the people of AIG. As I know you all know,
we started off with a daunting task of stabilizing this company, then paying back America, and we've done that with a
profit. And since the re-IPO of the company in 2011, what we shared with all of you is we have to rebuild the
foundation of this company and do it the right way and build a great company and expect that our stock will follow and
not lead what's happening with AIG.
And so, you can see the solid performance in this quarter. We've talked about making sure we execute our capital plan
and it starts off with selling non-core assets, which we've achieved with ILFC in an outstanding sale to AerCap. We've
also been able to repurchase and continue to repurchase our shares, but we said to you also, that in addition to
dividends and share buybacks, it's very critical that we focus on our coverage ratio. So you've seen us take advantage of
the debt markets and reduce our debt with high coupons, and in some cases, re-issue debt, giving us a net benefit
because of the lower cost of adding on that new debt, because we don't have a leverage ratio problem, it's a coverage
ratio problem that we're working to fix with the rating agencies to make sure that we maintain, and quite frankly,
expect to improve our credit ratings.
You see strong results across all of our businesses. Property Casualty has been working really hard to get it right in
terms of its risk selection and making sure that we get value over volume and that takes a long time. The written
business, we don't see the results of it until it's earned and we see what the loss ratios are, but you can see that
improving along with a higher degree of confidence in the reserve, which we've been saying for several years now, that
you'll see very small movements plus and minus in the reserve as we go forward.
UGC was the business that we were going to sell for practically nothing. You can see strong earnings come out of that
business. But what's important is, rising tides, all boats rise, the fact is UGC is way out in front of that and has a risk
selection model that is quite different than the industry. And being part of AIG gives us a lot of flexibility, especially as
you look at their ability to manage their capital needs as it goes forward. And Life and Retirement continues its
excellent run, as we're becoming a stronger and stronger competitor in that space.
But as you know, succession is very critical to a company and make sure that the company gets it right. We've spent a
lot of time thinking about the lead candidates here within AIG. The good news is we did have a strong bench. And I am
pleased that Peter has taken over as CEO of this company. He comes with a bulk of experience both on the Street, in
the fixed income markets in particular, which is where most of our net interest income comes from, and has spent the
last three years really getting into the nuts and bolts of the Property Casualty business from a risk perspective – a risk
selection perspective using big data in a way that helps us analyze to make sure that we're putting on the right risk
because of the long tail nature of those risks. So he's done an outstanding job and I know that he will do an outstanding
job in the future.
So what I'd like to do now is officially pass the baton to Peter who will pick up the rest of this call and take you through
that. And again, it's been an honor to serve as part of AIG and all the people of AIG and to be proud – I am very proud
to be part of that team with all of them. Thank you very much.
Peter, turn it over to you.
Peter D. Hancock
Bob, thank you, and I'd like to thank Bob for the remarkable leadership he's shown over the last five years. And I've
experienced four and a half of those years and it's truly the most extraordinary four and a half years of my professional
career. So I think that the employees, shareholders, and the U.S. taxpayer owe Bob Benmosche an enormous thanks for
the contribution he's made. And his leadership is awesome to follow, but I shall do my very best to continue the legacy
of leadership of this company. So I'm really honored to have been selected by the board of directors to lead the
company going forward.

There's three points I'd make. One is that there will be no abrupt change in strategy. This is clearly a vote for continuity.
We're on the right track, we're in execution mode. Second, I remain very committed to focusing on value versus simply
bulking up the volume of the company. And third, I will not be replacing myself with a head of Property Casualty
sector. So beyond that, there will be obviously some changes over time and I'll commit myself to remaining very
transparent with our shareholders as we fine-tune and refine our strategy going forward. But I think that this is
ultimately a choice for continuing to execute the strategy that we have a great deal of alignment around in the company.
So over to you, David, to go over the quarter.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to extend my thanks to Bob for his leadership, his
courage, and direction. It has been an honor for me, as well as my colleagues, to serve with you, Bob, so many, many
thanks.
Now this morning, I'll go over our financial results including the impact of capital management and our solid operating
earnings performance. I'll also highlight our outlook for continued sources of capital management going forward.
Turning to slide four, you can see after tax operating income for the quarter was $1.8 billion or $1.25 per diluted share.
Our operating return on equity was 7.7%. Since our earnings are tax-affected and we are not paying tax to the U.S.
government given our NOLs, our operating ROE, if you were to exclude the DTA from average equity, was about 160
basis points higher, or about 9.3%.
Reported net income was $3.1 billion, including a $1.4 billion non-operating after-tax gain on the sale of ILFC, and a
little over $325 million after tax litigation provision for legacy matters and we also had some other non-operating
items.
Second quarter book value per share, excluding AOCI, benefited from the net impact of all of these items and was
$67.65, or an increase of 10% from a year ago.
Our growth and operating income, which is shown on slide five, reflects improved insurance operating earnings for
each of our core businesses. Collectively, the DIB and Global Capital Markets, or GCM, delivered another solid quarter
with over $500 million of operating earnings, reflecting the mark-to-market appreciation in the DIB and the unwinding
of certain derivative positions in Global Capital Markets.
We continue to proactively and opportunistically reduce the DIB's footprint. In the second quarter, we executed on a
make whole call for the March 2015 maturities of $750 million, and subsequent to the quarter end, we redeemed a total
of $2 billion worth of DIB debt, comprised of nearly $800 million of 2016 notes, and $1.25 billion of 2017 notes. We
used cash at the DIB and GCM that was set aside for that purpose.
At the end of the second quarter, we had about $8.1 billion of net asset value between the DIB and Global Capital
Markets. We expect that the actions that we will take will result in the release of that capital to Parent over time as the
maturities of the liabilities and the underlying assets and derivative positions are monetized and settled. Also in July,
Global Capital Markets took a significant step in unwinding its remaining Super Senior Credit Default Swap portfolio
by terminating swaps with a net notional of about $9 billion, thereby reducing the notional amount of that portfolio
from about $15 billion to around $6 billion.
Pursuant to the closing of the sale of ILFC to AerCap, we now record our 46% equity interest in AerCap's earnings.
The $53 million reflects an estimate of the partial quarter of ownership, as well as ongoing basis differences between
our pick-up and the reported AerCap results. We will have differences from time to time in our estimates and the actual
results because of timing. Such differences will be trued up in subsequent quarters.
Corporate expenses were just over $280 million in the quarter, above our expectation of $225 million to $250 million
quarterly run rate for 2014, as we recorded an increase of about $50 million related to short-term incentive

compensation for the entire firm. We would not expect this to reoccur in the next quarter. Our reported operating
effective tax rate for the quarter was roughly 33%, slightly above our previous outlook of 31% to 32% operating tax
rate for 2014.
The growth in the earnings from foreign jurisdictions where earnings are not permanently reinvested and the treatment
of the AerCap earnings pick-up contributed to the higher tax rate. Our expectation is for an all-in operating tax rate of
somewhere between 33% and 34% for the remainder of the year.
Our strong capital position as of the end of the quarter is shown on slide six. In May, we received $2.4 billion in net
cash proceeds upon closing of the ILFC sale, and following the updating of our internal stress testing process, our
board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2 billion of common stock.
During the quarter, we deployed $1.1 billion towards the repurchase of approximately 18.1 million shares of common
stock, and we currently have about $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Following the end of
the quarter, an additional 1.7 million shares were delivered to us with the full completion of the ASR, which was
initiated in June. We also distributed $179 million in dividends to our shareholders in June.
With respect to debt capital management, we have actively managed our cost of debt and our debt maturities.
Following the quarter end, we purchased, in tender offers, about $2.5 billion worth of high coupon hybrid debt and
senior debt securities at the Parent company.
In unrelated transactions, we also issued $2.5 billion of debt comprised of $1 billion of 2.3% 5-year notes and $1.5
billion of 4.5% 30-year notes. We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management and expect that an
improving earnings profile, particularly from our core insurance businesses, will positively impact our coverage ratios
going forward.
From this strong capital position, you can see on slide seven, we received cash dividends and loan repayments from our
insurance subsidiaries of $1.6 billion during the quarter. And that was made up of about $700 million from Property
Casualty and almost $900 million from Life and Retirement. This brings year-to-date cash distributions to $3.2 billion.
We continue to expect $5 billion to $6 billion in cash distributions from our insurance subsidiaries this year.
In addition to these distributions, we received tax-sharing payments, primarily from insurance businesses, of about
$500 million in the second quarter or almost $800 million year-to-date. Tax sharing payments are expected to amount
to about $1 billion in 2014 and roughly $2 billion in 2015. Our current expectation is that our tax attribute DTA would
be fully utilized by 2020 or 2021.
Over time, we will look to our monetization of our deferred tax assets, a portion of our after-tax operating earnings, as
well as monetization of non-core assets for capital management purposes. At year-end, the DTA was approximately
$17 billion, our current DIB-GCM net asset value is a little over $8 billion and our 46% equity stake in AerCap shares
had a carrying value of about $4.6 billion as of June 30.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will recognize a non-operating gain related to the previously announced $650
million settlement with Bank of America. We also expect that this settlement will provide an additional benefit by
allowing us to utilize substantially all of our capital loss carry-forwards. We do not expect this settlement or other
litigation-related items to meaningfully impact our expectations for ongoing capital management activity.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David. Property Casualty's second quarter results continue to demonstrate our focus on underwriting
discipline and risk selection. While we've said that no one quarter marks a trend, we're pleased to report that Property
Casualty reported second quarter operating income of $1.4 billion, our second highest quarter of pre-tax operating
income in over three years. Our focus remains on balancing growth, risk, and profitability right across AIG.

Turning to slide eight, AIG Property Casualty net premiums written increased slightly from a year ago, excluding the
effects of foreign exchange, as growth in our consumer lines was offset by lower production in commercial.
Property Casualty's accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 62.7, an improvement of 0.5% sequentially or 0.8 points
higher than a year ago. We continue to expect the accident year loss ratio to decline for the remainder of the year, but at
a slower pace than we've seen in the last couple of years. This quarter included positive net prior year development of
$14 million. Our practice of quarterly reserve reviews continues to give us confidence in our current reserve levels.
Our expense ratio declined 0.4 points from a year ago, as lower acquisition costs were offset by an increase in general
operating expenses. The general operating expense increase reflects our Japan integration costs, some of which have
been deferred from the first quarter into the second quarter.
Our expectation is that a little less than half of the $250 million of expected integration costs will be incurred this year,
with the balance to be incurred in 2015. Through the first six months of the year, we have completed about half of the
actions associated with the fourth quarter 2013 severance charge of $265 million. We expect annualized savings to
exceed the amount of the severance charge and to emerge later in 2015. We continue to expect expenses to remain
relatively flat this year compared to last year and to decline in the second half of 2015.
Turning to slide nine, Commercial Insurance net premiums written declined slightly from the same period in the prior
year, primarily from our decision to walk away from certain risks. We saw growth in our global Financial Lines
business, as well as in Specialty Lines. However, we continue to see a competitive market in certain Casualty lines and
in U.S. Property cat as a result of overcapacity in the market.
Commercial Insurance rates overall were unchanged in the quarter and up 1% in the U.S. from a year ago. While
overall rate trends are a metric that we and others disclose, we believe it is the granularity and agility of our pricing
strategy that has the greatest impact on our margins.
The broad product cycles of the past have evolved to a much greater pricing dispersion across industries, geographies,
exposure layers, and individual accounts. Our focus on pricing each risk appropriately leads to our confidence in
accident year loss ratio trends and continued risk adjusted profit growth.
The accident year loss ratio as adjusted in Commercial increased to 66.4 from 62.2 in the quarter a year ago, as a result
of higher severe losses. We indicated last quarter that severe losses could be volatile and that was the case again this
quarter. We view some volatility in severe losses as consistent with our diversified global Property portfolio. Most
importantly, our global Property business continues to deliver positive risk-adjusted profitability.
Turning to slide 10, net premiums written for Consumer Insurance increased 4% excluding the effects of foreign
exchange. This growth was driven by sales of Life and Health products in Japan, as well as growth in our personal
property business in Japan and the United States. In Consumer, we continue to focus on improved underwriting quality
and targeted growth in key markets where we can achieve meaningful scale.
The Consumer accident year loss ratio as adjusted improved 4.5 points from a year ago to 55.7, reflecting rate increases
and improved loss experience in Japan Auto, and rate actions and coverage changes in the U.S. Warranty business. The
Japan Auto accident year loss ratio as adjusted did benefit from seasonality. Therefore, we expect to see this ratio rise
somewhat in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect Consumer to show improvement in its accident year loss
ratio as adjusted compared to last year.
Slide 11 provides our investment returns and portfolio composition. Our asset allocation strategy is intended to
optimize portfolio diversification to maintain stable portfolio risk while enhancing yield. Our alternative investment
returns for the quarter slightly outperformed on our 8% return expectation, but were down compared to the strong
year-ago quarter. With respect to capital management, we remitted $701 million in cash dividends to the holding
company during the quarter. We also made tax-sharing payments of $276 million in the quarter and are on track to
meet our expectations for contributing additional capital to the parent.
Turning to slide 12, Mortgage Guaranty's operating performance continues to improve with operating income for the
quarter of $210 million. Operating income for the quarter benefited from $89 million of favorable prior year reserve

development. The delinquency ratio of 4.8% for the quarter continued to fall, as the volume of new delinquencies
declined and cure rates improved. Our current delinquency count is the lowest it has been since late 2007. Mortgage
Guaranty continues to benefit from its broad customer base, leading market position and improving housing market. As
the highest-rated U.S. mortgage insurer, United Guaranty is well positioned to compete as the industry evolves.
In closing, AIG Property Casualty continues to advance on its strategic initiatives, work collaboratively across AIG
businesses and further build value for all our stakeholders.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay to discuss Life and Retirement results.
Jay S. Wintrob
Thank you, Peter, and good morning to everyone. Beginning on slide 13, the second quarter of 2014 was another strong
quarter for AIG Life and Retirement. We extended our record of consistent performance, generating nearly $1.2 billion
of operating earnings, and delivering both top line and bottom line growth.
Our operating income benefited from strong growth in fee income as separate account balances increased for the
seventh consecutive quarter. Net flows were over $6.3 billion during the last 12 months, further increasing the scale
and reflecting the product and distribution diversification of our businesses.
Life and Retirement generated nearly $2.6 billion in net investment income in the quarter, with the slight decline from
the prior-year period primarily attributable to lower returns on alternative investments. We maintained a cost of funds
at historic lows in our Fixed Annuity and Group Retirement businesses through disciplined pricing of new business and
renewal crediting rates, and a run-off of older business crediting relatively high interest rates. These trends helped to
partially offset the pressure on base investment yields in the current low rate environment.
Now, in addition to strong earnings, Life and Retirement delivered $886 million of cash dividends and loan repayments
as well as $642 million of non-cash dividends to AIG Parent in the second quarter. The Life and Retirement businesses
have distributed nearly $6 billion of cash and non-cash dividend to AIG Parent over the past 12 months. The segment
ended the quarter with shareholders equity, ex-AOCI, of $34.5 billion, $1.3 billion higher than a year ago.
Sales were strong during the quarter, reaching nearly $7.4 billion in premiums and deposits, an increase of 9% over the
year-ago period. Growth was driven by our Retail segment, which delivered a 15% increase in premiums and deposits
from the year-ago period.
Retirement Income Solutions, which includes our individual variable annuities and fixed index annuities, achieved
another record quarter of sales, generating nearly $2.6 billion of premiums and deposits. The increase in the quarter
was principally driven by index annuity sales, which were $305 million in the quarter, up from $55 million in the
prior-year period. Variable annuity sales were up 4% or $90 million in the quarter over the same time period last year.
Both lines benefited from product enhancements, expanded distribution, and continued strong demand for guaranteed
lifetime income benefits.
Fixed annuity sales reached nearly $1.1 billion in the quarter, tripling from the year-ago period. Sales remain steady
despite the low interest rate environment, as fixed annuities continue to be very competitive relative to bank CDs and
money market alternatives.
We continue to serve our distribution partners and enhance our franchise through successful new product introductions
that offer consumers the retirement security and protection they are seeking and need. We've designed product features
with income options that consumers value, while also ensuring that we achieve our target IRRs and maintain an
attractive risk profile.
All of these factors have led to strong sales momentum. It should be noted that rising interest rates and strong equity
market conditions in the second half of 2013 resulted in record sales levels and growth rates in the second half of 2013.
Without similar market conditions in the second half of this year, we would expect lower sales growth rates in key
product lines versus the prior year.

Assets under management in Life and Retirement increased by more than $39 billion, or 13%, over the last 12 months
to reach $333 billion. Growth in AUM was driven by an increase of nearly $14 billion in separate account assets,
attributable to strong sales and account balance appreciation. General account assets increased by nearly $6.5 billion as
a result of unrealized gains in the fixed income portfolio and positive net flows into the general account.
Our stable value wrap business grew significantly over the last 12 months, increasing by over $12 billion in AUM. We
plan to continue to develop this business, although at a slower pace of growth. The diversified mix of our assets under
management reflects the balance of our business and we're pleased with the growth we are achieving across our product
suite.
Slide 14 provides our line of business comparisons. Both Retail and Institutional pre-tax operating income increased
from the year-ago period. Growth at the underlying business was somewhat muted by the strong net investment income
results we experienced a year ago, specifically attributable to outsized returns in alternative investments and the strong
performance in certain commercial mortgage loans and structured securities. The Retail segment benefited from strong
sales and net flows in variable annuities. Together with favorable equity markets, this resulted in higher variable
annuity account values and fee income growth.
Disciplined pricing, crediting rate management, and the run-off of older business with relatively high crediting rates
helped to offset some of the impact of declining base investment yields on spreads in the Fixed Annuities business and
the fixed account component of the Group Retirement business.
The Institutional segment benefited from higher fee income in Group Retirement, which was largely driven by growth
in assets under management from equity market appreciation. Surrender rates in both our Retail and Institutional
businesses declined year-over-year as the persistency of our business improved in the quarter.
Consumer demand for Retirement Income Solutions remains very strong. As mentioned in previous quarters, over the
past four years, we've redesigned our products to reduce risk to AIG. 75% of our $27.6 billion variable annuities with
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, includes strong de-risking features such as the VIX indexing of our rider
fees and volatility control funds. In addition, we require minimum allocations to the fixed account, which also reduces
risk.
Nearly half of our index annuity sales in the second quarter included guaranteed lifetime income riders. In designing
these features, we applied the same product development and risk management expertise we built into our variable
annuity business.
Slide 15 shows our trends in yields and spreads. The base yield in the quarter was 5.17%, down from 5.35% in the
prior-year quarter and 5.32% in the first quarter. This decline in part reflects a difficult comparison to prior quarters due
to the strong performance of commercial mortgage loans and structured securities in the comparative prior periods.
Additionally, new money reinvestment rates remain lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio as a
result of the sustained historically low interest rate environment. Should rates remain at current levels, we would expect
a 2 basis point to 3 basis point quarterly decline in the base yield.
We continue to actively manage crediting rates on our in force block, and remain disciplined in our new business
pricing as demonstrated by the declining cost of funds for both our Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement businesses
year-over-year. Further, at the end of the second quarter, 71% of our fixed annuity and universal life account values
were at minimum guaranteed crediting rates. This is down from 73% at year-end, thus providing us with further
opportunity to reduce our cost of funds in the future, should the low interest rate environment persist.
Slide 16 shows our investment portfolio composition, which remains stable and continues to be highly rated. Total net
investment income does fluctuate from period-to-period as can be seen in the alternatives line and other enhancements,
which reflect the mark-to-market nature of certain investments. The decline in net investment income from a year ago
is primarily the result again of alternative investment returns coming in close to our expected 10% annualized return
this quarter compared to the exceptionally strong returns experienced a year ago.

So to sum it up, it was another strong quarter for earnings and distributions to AIG. We continue to execute on our
strategic initiatives, which include growing our distribution organization, increasing the productivity of our
wholesalers, affiliated agents and financial advisors. We're also successfully leveraging our strong relationships with
distribution partners to increase penetration of our broad retail product portfolio, build on our market leading positions
and offer competitive and profitable retirement income solutions. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in our
institutional businesses where we can achieve the most attractive risk adjusted returns, but the continued low interest
rate and tight credit spread environment leads us to maintain strong pricing discipline.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A. Liz?
Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you, Jay. Katie, could we open up the lines to Q&A please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Good morning. Peter, first question I had is just a follow-up on your comment that you will
expect the accident year loss ratio to decline at a slower pace in the back half of 2014. Does that change your overall
P&C combined ratio goal that you've put out there or your 10% ROE goal overall or does that just push it out a bit?
That's my first question.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think, simple answer, just pushes it out a bit. I think that we're clearly experiencing some
headwinds in the pricing of U.S. Property cat, which is an element of our Commercial business. But there's softness in
a couple of other sectors as well. So the pace at which we get to our ultimate profitability goals is a function of market
conditions. But certainly our ambition is to get there. And at this point to speculate on the exact pace is to speculate on
the market cycle. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are diversifying our book of business so we're less subject to the
cycle and are progressing on sub-segmentation at a more and more granular level so that we have greater confidence in
these trends in a more sustained way.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. And then just a related question. If you strip out the noise, it doesn't appear that
accident year Casualty results and Commercial improved very much this quarter. First question, is that right? And
secondly, what's going on behind that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that the Casualty area has gone through the greatest change. So an enormous
re-underwriting of the book over the last four or five years, a quite considerable change in our claims practices and so
the emergence of loss trends has a fair amount of noise in it. So our actuaries are being quite cautious in recognizing
improvements, and we are always on the lookout for any emerging threats. So I think that we feel confident that the
Casualty businesses move from a significantly RAP negative line of business to now earning its cost of capital. But we
still see room for improvement and growth in this sector, as we apply more refined underwriting tools and better claims
practices. But, John, do you want to elaborate on that, anything further?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: I think that's right. And, Tom, there wasn't real improvement in the Casualty loss ratio in the
quarter, that's right. But the accident year loss ratio pressure was really in the quarter driven by short tail losses, not just
of the year, but on the attritional side as well. Some of it in the U.S. weather related losses, some of it in non-property
short tail lines as well. But to Peter's point, we've done a lot of hard work on the Casualty side and we do expect a bit of
improvement in the loss ratio performance in that business going forward.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Got it. And then just one for David on capital management. The, first, $960 million legal
settlement that occurred in July, was that accrued for in 2Q results or is there some loss forthcoming in 3Q related to

that?
<A - David L. Herzog>: That had been previously accrued.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Got it. And then is it fair to assume the $2.5 billion refi of the higher coupon hybrids in
debt, we should take that as a sign that you really don't need to reduce leverage on a go forward basis in terms of
financial debt? I take that to mean that, because that obviously improves your coverage ratio. And if that's the case, can
we then further assume that pretty much most if not all dividends and tax-sharing payments would be available for
share repurchase after you've paid interest and corporate expenses?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, first of all, we don't give guidance, Tom, on specific composition of our capital
management. It's opportunistic and it's taking advantage of market conditions, our view of the environment and our
balanced approach to both equity and debt. So I wouldn't – I'd be careful making any sort of broad based assumptions
about what we will or won't do with respect to the mix of debt capital management and equity capital management;
they're both important.
We obviously remain committed to capital management and lowering of the cost of our overall cost of capital and we'll
do so. I think you can look to, as I said in my remarks, a portion of our after tax operating earnings, the DTA
monetization and the monetization of noncore assets to fuel that capital management going forward. So we will
continue to be active in both debt capital management and equity capital management for the foreseeable future. That's
a critical value driver for us and we'll continue to do that.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you for taking my call. So first, let me say, Peter,
congratulations on your new role; and Bob, I think we'd all like to say thank you on behalf of AIG's investors, really it
was very dark days. And with your leadership and all the firms' hard work, it's been really a dramatic recovery. So we
all wish you the best in your well-deserved retirement.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Thank you.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: If I could, two questions. So, Peter, the pricing environment has changed a lot in the past
couple of quarters, pricing is now flat and you're seeing pricing actually fall relatively notably in Property lines. How
can we get comfortable with this? You're saying that you're going to manage to value over volume. You said perhaps
Property is still at positive RAP, and you're going to maintain against your pricing targets. But it's a little – it's hard to
see from the outside what your pricing targets are, what RAP is by line of business, what RAP you're targeting, for
example? And ultimately, I'd love it if you could just sort of walk us through how you're thinking about your current
rate adequacy by line of business, maybe on your RAP measure or on – even simpler, what are the target combined
ratios you guys are actually trying to get to and where, on the business you're writing today, do you think you still
actually have rate need?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I think first of all, let's put the pricing environment in perspective. The pricing
environment three and a half years ago, when I started the job, was massively inadequate in the United States, but
reasonably adequate in Europe and the rest of the world. There's been tremendous upward movement in pricing,
steadily quarter after quarter, since that point and so we've had a good improvement in the pricing environment across
lines, all lines of business in the U.S. And the pace of that increase has slowed but has reversed itself narrowly in U.S.
Property cat. And that's really where the greatest impact of alternative capital and the reinsurance soft market has had
an impact.

We have been diversifying away from U.S. Property cat for about five years and are diversifying our Property portfolio
around the world. So we've diminished our exposure to that particular cyclical phenomenon.
I think that the use of RAP today equips our underwriters and our account relationship managers with much better tools
to make a well-balanced judgment over how to manage the portfolio of multi-line relationships with customers to take a
balanced view of short- and medium-term profitability across lines. And so while we may not want to renew at the
same scale as previously, we certainly want to be relevant to our customers and offer capacity at maybe a different
attachment point where we feel we're getting a better value for the risks that we're taking.
So I just think we're much better equipped to deal with the inevitable cyclicality in the pricing environment and we
have a tremendous diversity of business by geography and line, so that we can redeploy the capital to where it's best
rewarded in a customer-friendly way that maintains valuable relationships. But I don't know whether, John, you want to
elaborate on that.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yeah. I think, Josh, what I would add is that it's not a market, right. There are many markets
around the world, and outside of the Property cat market in the United States, the rate environment was quite stable. In
the U.S., in fact, we're – as you know we have our biggest exposure all of our other major lines of business, so our rate
increases in the second quarter, so longer tail lines. We saw good discipline in the quarter, albeit not at the same rate of
increase as we saw earlier in the year and last year.
But we were disciplined in the quarter about the Property cat business in the U.S. We walked from more than $200
million worth of Property cat business in the U.S. As Peter mentioned, from time to time we moved up on programs
where we had important customer relationships or saw attractive opportunities at different parts or different layers in a
program.
And Peter mentioned the diversification. We saw good middle market Property growth. We saw good growth in
Property outside of the United States. We've had a large limits initiative underway, a highly engineered portfolio
growth initiative over the course of the last several years. That all performed reasonably well in the quarter.
So it's, again, it's kind of not one market and it's not just about price either. We've invested a lot in risk selection,
managing our mix of business, important claim improvements and more granular pricing strategy. So obviously price
matters ultimately, but there are other techniques that are important levers for us as well.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: And I just would add that the One AIG that we talk about, when you think about our
global footprint and how we are coming across to our multinational clients, we bring the full AIG to each country.
We're – up until a couple of years ago, each country was on its own. So part of what you see here is the transformation
of the company to a more global company, not because we're in many geographies, because we operate as One AIG to
our clients around the globe and that's helped us a little bit here as well.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: So, thank you. If I ask just a – I'll just ask one follow-up on that. If pricing is being a bit more
of a headwind, how would you walk us – can you walk us through the other initiatives you'd use to try to achieve the
low-90%s combined ratio? And is that still a realistic prospect given that the environmental tailwinds have
fundamentally shifted? Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I think that if the softer segments are so pervasive that the pricing adequate segments
don't make up for the lost volume, clearly fixed costs become a very major focus, if we're going to avoid negative
operating leverage. So that's going to be an important thing to focus on. It's something that we started focusing on long
before this change in the pricing environment, because we always believed that managing down our fixed costs was
essential to not feeling tempted to price the marginal deal to maintain volume.
So I think that continued focus on sustainable expense improvement, use of shared services, use of automation,
modernizing our infrastructure, gives us the flexibility to back-off on volume when it's not properly priced and then
scale it up again when it is. So I think that managing the cycle is dependent on continuing to work on our core
infrastructure.

<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Great. Let me ask you a quick technical question. Charlie and John, you guys – just trying to
parse what you've said about reserves and the fact that Commercial accident year loss ratios, especially with backing
out severe losses, have been basically stable for the past year. Should we be interpreting that you're sort of basically –
you're basically holding your accident year loss ratio picks flat and that's the reason we're not seeing improvement and
that you're just intending to let the favorable development in Commercial sort of eventually sort of power through – and
sort of demonstrate – bringing you guys to your low-90%s combined?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yeah. Josh, I would say that it's a mix of up and down in loss picks, but as shorter tail losses
move more towards normal levels. As I said, we have had elevated levels of short tail losses through the first six
months and the second half last year, and we're comparing against a better than expected first half of last year, I would
add, as we move to more normal levels because the longer tail loss picks are slightly ahead of where they were a year
ago.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. Thanks. Good luck from here.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Charlie, you want to chime in on this?
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: I think John said it well. I mean, every quarter, we do look at our Parent accident year loss
fix against loss cost trend and rate change. And as John said, there are adjustments in each direction and I'd consider
where we've set them to be absolutely our best estimate at this stage.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. Thanks. Good luck from here.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes. Thank you. I guess this one's for David. You talked about the amount of capital that still
resides at the DIB and the Global Capital Markets business, but it's beginning to run-off quicker. When should we
expect some of that capital to begin to get freed up?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. Thanks, Jay. And I'll lead off and maybe Brian and the team back in New York can add
on. We've said over the course of the period of 2000 up until about 2018, the – about 80% or so of the liabilities will
mature in the normal course if we do nothing. We've obviously been more proactive and opportunistic in calling some
of those. I think the dynamic that is – that will impact the amount of capital that gets freed up is actually as the
underlying assets monetize, because we're paying off the debt essentially with cash that we had accumulated. And so
there's not a great deal of capital charge and a capital tight up in the term debt and the cash that's sitting there. So again,
we still would expect a very significant portion of the capital free up over that period of time. Maybe, Brian, if you
want to add a little more color?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Yeah, no, David, I think you hit the key point. As we've said in the past, some capital will
be freed up between now and 2018, but the bulk of the capital will come out post 2018. The way we run the DIB is
through something we call the [ph] ACE test (50:54) that ensures we have adequate net asset value and adequate
liquidity to meet both contingencies and obligations as they come due. And, as David said, as assets monetize, as the
ML3 assets pull to intrinsic value, that capital will get freed up. And in some way it's also more a function of our ability
to proactively go after the liabilities or having to wait until they actually mature.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Okay. Thank you, Jay.

<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones and then may be a broader question. On the
Consumer business in the U.S., the combined dip below 90%, just wanted to get an understanding of sort of what
happened there, how much of that was the re-price warranty business and is that sustainable for you?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Kevin, why don't you take that?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, the warranty is an important part of the improvement. As
you, I think, are aware, we had an elevated loss ratio in certain products last year and we took quick underwriting
action which took hold. But in addition to what we did in the Warranty, we've also been consistently filing some rate
improvements in the PCG Property portfolio which is starting to earn in.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it. Okay, great. And then same question on the MI, it looks like the underlying, if we
back out the development, was just below 60%, how should we be thinking about that business?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'm sorry, the mortgage insurance?
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Yeah, the MI, United Guaranty, it looks like ex development ran at a sub-60% combined.
Is there anything in that "underlying" that we should think about or is that kind of where you expect you'll be running
that business?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: It's a business which will have a very attractive combined as long as the housing market
stays as firm as it is and as long as employment trends stay as firm as they are and so we think about it with a cat load
that's over and above that steady state combined ratio against the cyclicality. But it's a very attractive return on risk
business at this point in the cycle, and as you can see from the delinquency trends, very, very attractive. About two
thirds of the business or the results are on business post crisis, so it's a cleaner and cleaner reserve book at this point.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. And then just last question. Just talking about reserves there a bit. I mean, when we
think about – we talk a lot about the combined ratio at the P&C company, I mean obviously, the mix of business is
changing from what you wrote historically. How should we think about capital – the capital you're going to need on a
run rate basis to sort of run that business as the reserves for some of the longer tail lines run off, some of which you're
not really writing anymore? Is that something that we should be sort of thinking about as you – especially if you
potentially stop growing or grow less quickly than in some of these capital-intensive lines? Thanks.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes. I think that we have explicit runoff portions of the Casualty lines which we show in
corporate and other that consume a certain amount of capital and that runs off. And then there is certain sub-segments
which are still in the Commercial line segment where we're deemphasizing and shrinking certain long tail lines which
are capital intensive. But that capital frees up gradually as those – the tails of those businesses start to play out. So I'd
say it's a 4-year to 10-year sort of time horizon for that capital to be freed up. But it's quite substantial and we're
redeploying that freed up capital gradually into shorter tail lines where we're getting a better return on risk. And so I
think that we are somewhat opportunistic in terms of where we deploy that capital and we have a lot of different
choices because of the breadth of our franchise.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: So, Mike, I would say, in the commercial portfolio, at the end of 2010, Property was about 16%
of our net written premium and is now close to 25%. At the same time, our specialty classes and financial lines grew a
bit as share of the total, too, largely coming at the expense of U.S. Casualty over that period of time.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: And I should add that, with that increase in Property, there has been no increase in our P&L,
because we've been diversifying away from the U.S. Property cat exposures.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thanks and good morning. Peter, two questions for you. One, you initially mentioned that you saw
– you would see no abrupt changes in strategy and were focused on continuity. Does that mean you anticipate any
changes in strategy?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I anticipate changes in strategy as the opportunities arise, but nothing that I would want to
signal at the moment, because I think that Bob and I have been highly aligned on strategy for the last four and a half
years. So unless something in the external environment changes abruptly, in which case we might have to consider
abrupt changes. The team as a whole has really coalesced around our current strategy and is in execution mode. So I
think that's really the signal. This is a great confidence in the team, great confidence in the momentum that we've built.
And changes in strategy will be largely refinements in the execution.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. The other question I wanted to ask is, for you to maintain the
head of the Property Casualty business, do you view that as a temporary situation or perhaps permanent? Given the size
of AIG, it feels like that's a pretty big load for one person to carry, running more than – or essentially being Chief
Executive Officer plus being responsible for the largest single unit of the company. And related to that, have you
received commitments from other leadership of AIG to remain at the company?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So in the Property Casualty, increasingly, John and Kevin, running the Consumer and
Commercial segments, have assumed the broader strategic leadership that those two very large segments deserve. And
we are very focused on making the whole company more – flatter in the hierarchy. And so we want to minimize the
layers of management between the CEO and the trenches to improve our responsiveness to customers and markets. And
so it's, in my view, redundant to think about the Property Casualty layer going forward. The leadership that John has on
the Commercial and Kevin has on the Consumer provides absolutely the right amount of strategic leadership that's
needed. So I don't see any challenges there.
And as far as the commitment of the senior leadership of the company, I think we've all been through a lot together
over the last five years. There were plenty of reasons for anybody to throw their towel in over the last five years. I'm
very hopeful that everybody who went through the challenges of the last five years looks forward to the next five years
with as much enthusiasm as I do.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you very much.
