provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Daniel T. Henry
Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I will start on slide two, so the first quarter 2013 summary financial performance. So total
revenues came in at $7.9 billion for the first quarter of 2013; that's 4% higher on a reported basis and 5% growth
year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. So that's the same FX-adjusted revenue growth that we've had for the past two
quarters. Pre-tax income came in at $1.9 billion, up 8%. Net income came in at $1.3 billion, up 2%.
So net income grew at a slower rate than pre-tax income in the first quarter because in the first quarter of 2012 it
included a tax benefit realized on certain foreign tax credits and we had no such item in the first quarter of 2013.
Diluted EPS was $1.15, up 7%. EPS grew at a faster pace than net income due to share buybacks. As you can see,
shares outstanding on the bottom of this chart are 5% lower year-over-year.
ROE is 23% for the quarter compared to 27% in the first quarter of 2012 and this is due to the three charges that we
took in the fourth quarter of 2012, which was about $600 million. So the ROE is calculated using net income for the 12
months ended March 31, 2013, therefore it includes the fourth quarter of 2012. And that's divided by average
shareholder equity. Excluding those three charges in the fourth quarter, adjusted ROE would have been 26%, and you
can actually see that calculation in Annex six to the slides.
Moving to slide three, which is metric performance, you can see that billed business came in at $224 billion. It grew at
6% on a reported basis, 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. So the same FX-adjusted growth rate that we had in the fourth
quarter of 2012, despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter of 2012, because it was a
leap year.
Cards-in-force grew at 5%, the same as the fourth quarter. Proprietary cards grew at 2%, which is comparable to the
growth rate we've seen over the last several quarters. Growth in average basic cardmember spending reflects continued
strong cardmember engagement and cardmember loans continued modest growth, growing at 4%.
Moving to slide four4, so this is billed business growth by segment. And as you can see on the chart, total FX-adjusted
growth, the red line, in the first quarter of 2013 was 7%, consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Each of the
business segments is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012, except for GCS, which is Global Corporate Services,
that's the green line, and you can see here that the growth rate for that segment has moved down slightly, as T&E
spending grew at a slower rate than total billings growth rate in the quarter. 2012 was a leap year so we lost one day of
billings year-over-year, which negatively impacts billed business growth rate in the first quarter of this year by about
100 basis points.
Going to slide five, so this is billed business growth by region. So you can see that the U.S., which is the dark blue line
with the diamonds, grew at 7%, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012. And while each of the other regions had
their growth rate slow a bit in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, in aggregate, total FX-adjusted growth
rate of 7% is consistent with last quarter.
So now we have slide six. So this is the U.S. consumer-managed cardmember loans. The bars are the dollar amount of
loans. The light blue line is the U.S. consumer loan growth rate. And the new line is the green line and that's the U.S.
industry revolve growth in each of the quarters. So the 4% growth in loans is driven by growth in billed business.
Loans are growing at about half the rate of the growth in billings on lending products. Our loan growth continues to
outpace the industry, as you can see by looking at the green line. So for example, in the fourth quarter of this year, we
grew at 4% and the industry growth rate was 1%.
The last point I'd make is that while loans grew 4% year-over-year, loans decreased sequentially on a seasonal basis
from the fourth quarter. And as you'll see in a minute, credit performance continues to be excellent.

Slide seven, so this is our revenue performance. Total revenues grew 4%. That's 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. Discount
revenue came in at 4% and this reflects 6% growth in billed business, partially offset by a 1 basis point decline in the
discount rate and higher cash-back rewards.
Net card fees increased 7%, and this is reflective of higher average fees per card, primarily due to fee increases and a
greater mix of premium products. Travel commission and fees decreased 3% as worldwide sales decreased 3%.
Business travel declined 4% while consumer travel sales increased 2%. Other commissions and fees decreased 2% and
this is the impact of some modest cost of cardmember reimbursements, partially offset by higher Loyalty Partner
revenues. Other revenues is lower by 3% and this is primarily due to a favorable revision of our liability for uncashed
TCs in international markets in the first quarter of 2012, and it's partially offset by higher gains on our sale of ICBC
shares in the first quarter of 2013.
Net interest income increased 10% and this is a combination of 3% increase in average cardmember loans, and increase
in the worldwide net interest yield to 5.9% from 9.2% a year ago. Now, a portion of this increase is due to the reversal
of a reserve for cardmember reimbursements that we've set up in prior periods, and without it, the increase would have
been slightly lower. It's also influenced by a decline in funding costs for our Charge Card portfolio.
Moving to slide eight. So this is provision for losses. You can see the total provision for losses increased 21%. Charge
Card provision increased 10%, primarily driven by higher receivables, which are 5% higher than a year ago.
Cardmember loan provision increased 30% or $63 million, and this reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans
compared to last year. Our reserve release of about $100 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a reserve
release of $200 million in the first quarter of 2012, and this has the effect of increasing provision by $100 million,
partially offset by approximately $50 million less in write-offs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter
of 2012 due to improved credit performance. So this all nets to a $63 million increase in the lending provision. So
provision is increasing while credit metrics are stable, and you'll see that over the next several slides.
So slide nine is Charge Card credit performance, and if you look at the left charge, this is the U.S. charge write-off rate.
So this has ticked up and down slightly over the past few quarters, but I view this as stable over the period. On the right
side, you see the International Consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio, and this also has remained
stable. Both of these metrics are at historically low levels.
Moving to slide 10, so this is the lending credit performance, the left side is the net write-off rate and this metric
continues to be stable. The right side is the 30-day past due and the same is true here. This metric continues to be very
stable.
So these metrics are at historically low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. Now, as I say each
quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but to achieve the best economic gain when we
invest.
Next is slide 11 so these are the lending reserve coverage ratios. So each of the metrics, whether it's reserves as a
percentage of loans, reserves as a percentage of past dues or the principal months coverage are lower in the first quarter
of 2013 compared to last year based on the improved credit metrics and are trending slightly lower than the fourth
quarter of 2012 as we continue to sustain historically low credit metrics. Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate
for the risks that are inherent in our portfolio.
Slide 12 so this is expense performance. You can see on the bottom right that total expenses grew 1% year-over-year.
Marketing and promotion expense decreased 2%, reflecting lower brand advertising, partially offset by higher card
acquisition spending. And I'll cover this in more detail in the slide.
Next is cardmember rewards expense and this increased 4%, reflecting higher spending on rewards products, partially
offset by slower growth in membership rewards' ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the
first quarter of 2012. And I'll cover this in more detail on the following slide.
Cardmember services decreased slightly. Total operating expense grew 1%, well within our target of growing total
operating expense less than 3% for the next two years and I have a slide on this later as well. The effective tax rate was

32.9% in the first quarter of 2013. This compares with 29.2% in the first quarter of 2012. The lower tax rate in the prior
year includes a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits.
Moving to slide 13. So this is marketing and promotion expense. So, marketing expense in the first quarter of this year
was $621 million. That compares to $631 million in the first quarter of 2012, so down slightly. As you can see from the
chart, it's also down slightly for marketing as a percentage of revenue. So, all the way on the right, you can see the
percentage for the first quarter of this year was 7.9% and for last year in the first quarter it was 9.3%. We remain
committed to our objective of having marketing and promotion expense to approximate 9% of revenues on an annual
basis. While in the first quarter of 2012 this percentage was 8.3%, if you look at the chart on the right, you can see that
we increased spending in the second through fourth quarter to achieve our annual rate – to achieve our annual
objective. And you can see on the left-hand chart that 2012, for the full year, came in at 9.2%. We continue to invest in
our business despite the slow growth economy.
Slide 14 is cardmember rewards expense. So rewards expense in the first quarter of this year was $1.52 billion. That
compares to $1.467 billion in the first quarter of 2012, a 4% increase. So cardmember rewards expense is a
combination of rewards on co-brand products and membership rewards expense. Within membership rewards is a
combination of expense on points earned in the current period and this is included in the chart along with co-brand
expense in the dark blue section of the chart. This section of the bar basically grows with the growth in billed business.
Membership rewards expense also includes expense related to changes in the membership rewards liability for points
previously earned. This is the green section of the bar. As you can see, this portion of expense in the first quarter of
2013 is lower than the first quarter of 2012, as the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013
was less than the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012. The ultimate redemption rate in
the first quarter of 2013 is 94%, the same as it was in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Next slide is slide 15, operating expense performance. In the quarter, as you can see in the lower right, operating
expense increased only 1% versus the prior year as we continue to focus on controlling expenses. Our expense
performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next
two years.
Salaries and expense – salaries and employee benefits decreased 1%, reflecting a decrease in employee count of 1,100
people compared to the first quarter of 2012. Professional services increased 4%, reflecting increased investments in
the business and higher legal fees. Occupancy and equipment increased 8%, driven by higher data processing costs and
software amortization.
Other, net, decreased 2% and this is resulting from a favorable impact related to hedging our fixed-rate exposures
versus an expense in the first quarter of 2012. So this is an accounting adjustment we need to record. These hedges are
functioning exactly the way we intended and, over the life of the hedge, it all nets to zero.
Now we'll go to slide 16 so this is expense as a percentage of revenue. Now adjusted expense means we're excluding
credit provision. On the left side, you can see six years of history, and on the right side, you can see the most recent five
quarters. Now, 2010 and 2011 reflect elevated investment levels. In 2012, we committed to migrate this ratio over time
back towards historical levels in two ways: first, through revenue growth and, second, our plans to control operating
expense while continuing to invest in the business.
In the bars for 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2012, the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and
cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on the chart on the right, we are making
substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues.
Moving to slide 17. So these are capital ratios. In the first quarter of 2013, Tier 1, Tier 1 common and total capital
ratios increased due to an increase in capital during the period, primarily driven by capital generation of $1.5 billion –
this is a combination of $1.3 billion in net income and $200 million raised from employee plans – offset by capital
distributions of $1.1 billion and this is $800 million in share repurchases and $300 million in dividends, as well as a
decrease in risk-weighted assets, mostly due to lower cardmember loans. Tier 1 common capital ratio of 12.6%
provides the company with a strong capital position.

Next is slide 18. This is the total payout ratio so this is the percentage of capital generated through net income returned
to shareholders through dividends or share repurchase. On the left-hand side, we see the past five years. On the right
side, we see the most recent five quarters. In 2012, we returned $4 billion or 98% to shareholders. Now, the share
repurchase in the first quarter first quarter of 2013 was governed by our CCAR submission in January of 2012. And so
for the quarter we returned 70% of net income. We plan to increase our dividend to $0.23 per share from $0.20 per
share next quarter, a 15% increase for shareholders. We are also moving ahead with plans to repurchase common
shares that would total up to $3.2 billion to shareholders during the remainder of this year for a total of $4 billion in
2013 and up to an additional $1 billion in the first quarter of 2014.
Next slide is slide 19, our liquidity snapshot. Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our
next 12 months of funding maturities. As you can see, we have $20.9 billion in excess cash compared to funding
maturities of $17 billion for next year, thereby meeting our objective.
Next is slide 20 so this is our U.S. retail deposit program and it shows you the deposits by type. As you can see on the
right, deposits increased by $1.1 billion in the quarter with direct deposits increasing by $2.5 billion and you can see
that on the left side of the chart. We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time.
So, with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance,
especially given the slow growth economic environment. In the quarter, spend growth continued to be healthy and was
relatively consistent with the past several quarters despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first
quarter of 2012 because of leap year. We also saw average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace
the industry. Moderate loan growth and slightly higher net yields led to a 10% increase in net interest income. At the
same time, lending loss rates remained near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 5% on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent
with last quarter. This reflects the sluggish economic environment and the negative impact of having one less day in the
quarter versus the prior year.
In the quarter, operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year as we continued to focus on controlling
expenses. Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense growth at an annual rate of
less than 3% over the next two years. We are also continuing to invest in the business and expect full year marketing
and promotion expense to be approximately 9% of total revenues, in line with our historical average.
EPS growth of 7% outpaced revenue growth, reflecting the progress we have made on controlling operating expense
and our strong capital position. We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through
dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios.
The results of the recent Fed's stress test underscore our capital strength and our ability to remain profitable even under
severe stress assumptions. This strong capital position provides flexibility for our planning to – for a 15% increase in
our dividend during the second quarter and allow us to balance the capital needs of our business with the potential for
significant share buybacks. We recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we
continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to shareholders,
even in an extended slow growth environment.
Thanks for listening, and I am now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ryan Nash representing Goldman Sachs. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Thanks. Hey, Dan. When you think about your outlook for revenue growth, it came in about 5%
on an FX-adjusted basis this quarter, a bit lower when you factor in the FX, so if you'd assume that the revenue trends

remain consistent over the next few quarters, how should we think about OpEx growth for the remainder of the year? I
know you're saying less than 3%, but assuming revenues were to stay at the 5% level, do you think we should end up
on the lower end of that range?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So as we talked about, saying having growth of less than 3%, we really haven't factored in
exactly where revenue growth is going to come in. So I don't think that's a factor in terms of our commitment to keep
OpEx growth at less than 3%.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And...
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So at the FCA and we try to give a variety of scenarios in there in terms of what the potential
outcomes could be when you vary both revenue growth and operating expense growth and share repurchases, to give
you a sense of how those – each of those items could affect EPS in several different scenarios.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay. And just in terms of the spend volumes, can you give us a sense of how they progress
during the quarter? And, at this point, have you seen anything that points to a pullback on the part of consumers from
higher tax rates?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So, our spending levels, on an FX adjusted basis, have been pretty consistent over two
quarters and we didn't see any stark trends within the quarter, so whether the change in the tax rate is having any
impact, it's not really something that we can discern within our numbers.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
[ph] The next (29:39) question today comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Yeah, thank you. I was hoping if I could get, like, some specifics around the gain that you
guys had from the sale of the ICB (sic) [ICBC] shares as well as kind of the benefit from the reversal of the reserve for
cardmember reimbursements. And then secondly, I was just wondering how far we were into the restructuring that you
guys have undertaken, and at what point during the year will we hit a level of operating expense, ex-marketing without
that overhead? Thank you.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. So we – as it relates to the ICBC shares, we put a hedge on that in the past and have
effectively locked in the gain. As you have seen over the last several quarters, we're taking that over time and the
reason we're doing that is to enable higher levels of investment funding – investment spending to help generate
business momentum. So it's a locked in gain we have and it's our time – plan to take it over time.
With respect to your second question about the reversal of a reserve we put up previously, related to cardmember
reimbursements, we had come up with an estimate in the fourth quarter. Upon further refinements, we realized that the
amount that we were going to reimburse was actually lower than our estimate. It's a relatively small amount, but it did
have an effect on the increase in the spreads, so I didn't want people to think that that was a permanent increase, it's
really the only reason I spiked it out, but it's not really a large number at all as it relates to our income.
In terms of restructuring, we announced restructuring in January. The impact of employees leaving American Express
is actually going to take place over all of 2013. Some have left in March, but others will not leave until later in the year.
So we're only going to get a portion of the benefit from that action in 2013 and we'll get an additional benefit in 2014,
as some people would've been here for a portion of 2013. So it's going to come to us very gradually over 2013 and
2014. And I would say, most employees – the first employees to leave were probably in the March timeframe, so
there's a limited amount of benefit from that in the first quarter. So we'll really see it come to us over the next seven
quarters, I would say.
The very good control of operating expense is just our continued focus on operating expense, which we really started
last year, which is rolling over into this year, as we see the proper control on expense as a way of creating resources so

that we can invest in the business, some of which takes place on marketing and promotion line, other portions of that
actually take place on the operating expense line. So I know even though it was only one question, I hope I got each of
the four parts correct.
<A - Richard Petrino>: You there?
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks. Good evening. Dan, I had a follow up question on slide 16, on the detail that you
gave on the expenses. So you're clearly making progress on reducing expenses, but I wanted to kind of make sure that I
was thinking about the commentary that you guys had made correctly. You referred to how in the past that you
intended to get that expense ratio down to historical levels and I thought that you had said in the past that 2007 was
kind of a good benchmark so that kind of 67% level. And you're at 69% now in first quarter 2013 and you know we see
the progress you've made there, but should we be thinking – is that in fact a fair way to be thinking about it, that that
69% over time is going to move towards 67%? And I know you guys don't want to get locked into a timeframe, but is,
call it, the next 12 months to 18 months or so kind of a reasonable timeframe to be thinking about?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so we – I think what we said is we want to move back towards historical levels, and
2008 and 2009 are low because it was during the crisis, and 2010 and 2011 are high because we had elevated levels of
investment. So we don't want to lock in exactly on the 67%, but we certainly want to head back in that direction. How
much we actually take this ratio down to will depend on lots of things, including what our revenue growth is, what's
taking place in provision and what we're aiming for in terms of what we want to free up for investment capacity. So, all
those things work together in terms of the pace and the level that we take this ratio to.
<Q - William Carcache>: Okay, thanks. And finally as a follow up, can you give a little bit more color on what drove
some of the weakness in GCS billed business? And then should we expect reserve builds for the rest of the year or
should we be looking for more releases? And then I guess the last part of that is the travel commissions and fees were a
little bit lower than what we were expecting, so I wondered if there's any kind of – if maybe you could – if there's
anything behind that and any kind of impact from the restructuring that we should expect to impact this line item?
Thanks.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. So let me talk to GCS, so Corporate Services. So really across the board, we've seen
lower spending in T&E categories, right? And we're seeing better strength outside of the T&E categories. Corporate
Services is primarily T&E type of spending, and so that's where you seeing it come down. And it's relatively broad
geographically, so I think it's just lower T&E type of spending is what's causing them to be lower, and that actually ties
into travel commissions and fees, right? So if T&E spending is lower, then that line is going to be impacted. Worldwide
sales were down 3%; that's the main driver. Now travel – business travel, was down 4%, consumer was actually up 2%,
but business travel is much larger than consumer travel, and so that's what's yielding the lower sales. So it's the activity
in this particular category.
In terms of reserve, what's going to happen with reserve? So we've seen them come down for the last couple years.
Actually in the fourth quarter we had a slight reserve build but a return this year to a release but a release that's much
lower. The way our models work, they use the last 12 months' worth of information to do the modeling to the extent we
get to a point where the quarter that's falling out is at about the same level as the metrics we have in this quarter then
you're going to have a relatively stable provision. So it's the relationship of what's kind of falling out in the model and
what the new quarter going into the model is. So I think most people are anticipating that reserve releases are not going
to be in 2013 what they were in prior periods.

The next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Yeah, thanks. Dan, could you walk us through your thoughts behind your revised buyback
request under the CCAR process? You only missed the Fed's Tier 1 common buffer by 3 basis points, but then in the
subsequent request lowered the buyback request by $1.5 billion. Was it communicated to that you would not be
allowed to return in excess of 100% of earnings or, alternatively, did you just want to make sure that you had a really
conservative request around 100% that you were confident that they would approve?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Right. So we – they never said to us you can't be above 100%. I think Stage 3 is in fact above
100%. And they had said that before our submission and subsequently, so that was not it. Our initial plan, we asked for
an increase in our dividend to $0.23. We asked for a share repurchase of $4.7 billion over the remainder of 2013 and $1
billion in the first quarter of next year. Our revised submission, we were asking for the same $0.23 dividend. We
dropped our request from $4.7 billion to $3.2 billion this year and kept the request for the first quarter of next year the
same.
So when we prepared our initial submission to the Fed under the stress scenario, it was based on our own internal
analysis and that internal analysis yielded a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 9.2%, which was above the 5% minimum
threshold that the Federal Reserve has set. However, when the Federal Reserve did its own modeling, it generated a
contingent that dropped us below that 5% minimum amount. Now the good thing is both under our scenarios and their
scenarios, even in this stress situation, we have a cumulative process over the nine-quarter period. However, the Fed's
projection of the loan-loss provision was $3.1 billion higher than ours and was actually $4.6 billion higher than the
analysis they had done the prior year, right? So in 2012, their estimates and ours were relatively close.
Our estimates for 2013 with similar assumptions were – 2013 and 2012 were similar, okay? What the Fed has come out
in the report that they published, they said that some of the reserve models that the Fed was using this year had changed
substantially or were newly implemented. So it was that change that caused us to fall below the 5% minimum. Now, as
we thought about our revised submission, we didn't want to put in a submission that just eked us barely over the 5%,
and we said when we go back to the request that we had made in 2012, we thought that was substantial in terms of what
we were returning to shareholders, and that's what really drove us at the end of the day.
And based on that, when you do that and reduce the share buyback request under the Fed's stress scenario, our Tier 1
common ratio comes in at 6.42%, a healthy amount above the 5%. So that was really our thinking in how we set or we
submit a request.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Okay, got it. And then on a separate tack, when I look at a year or so back, the delta between
your billed business growth and loan growth was 10% plus, and I understand you were telling us then you would
eventually expect lend to follow spend and those would converge, but now it's relatively tight. I guess there's only
about a 240 basis point difference between your proprietary billed business growth and your loan growth, which is
actually a little bit tighter than I would expected given your more spend-based model. Is that relationship in line with
what you would've expected or is it a sign that you're getting more growth from your revolvers than you are from your
transactors here?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So if you went back to pre-crisis, our loans grew at about the same pace as the growth in
billings on lending products, okay? That separated wildly during the crisis as consumers simply decided to deleverage.
What we have said, I think, is that what the growth of loans is going to be in relation to the business is totally
dependent on our customers, right? They're going to decide what amount of leverage that they want to have, although
intuitively at least in the near-term it didn't seem that we'd move back to where we were pre-crisis.
In the fourth quarter, loan growth came closer to billings growth, but in the first quarter, the growth in loans was about
half the rate of the growth in billed business, and it's kind have been about that level for several quarters. Now whether
it goes up or down from there, as I say, it's depending on the customers. We give products to customers. We give them
the opportunity to revolve if they choose.

As you know, probably, a number of customers that we have that have lending products that are actually transactors
pay off every month is in the high-20s, right? But if those customers choose to revolve, the product is designed to allow
them to do it. So it will be driven not by us, but by the choice of the customer, and we'll rely on the credit capabilities
we have to properly monitor that. And you can see that while we're having loan growth, even though really no one else
in the industry is at the moment, our credit metrics are excellent. So it's – it'll really be driven by the behavior of the
customer.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Okay, thanks.

The next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with the Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Dan, sort of looking at billed business in the U.S., I mean effectively your growth rates, you
could argue, accelerated a bit and you've got the banks and JPMorgan sort of coming at the affluent side. I mean I guess
my question is, do you still think you're gaining share? How is growth so stable and good? I mean is there anything
specific in terms of sort of an income breakdown where the super-affluent is maybe stronger? Or are you just seeing
across-the-board decent numbers?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: I mean our customer base is primarily an affluent customer base, and as I said before, we don't
see any discernible impact of taxes on our base. As you said, in the U.S., we've had some pretty consistent performance
over the last several quarters that we're pleased with, given where GDP is and the fact that it's a sluggish economy.
We've always had the fact that lots of our competitors want to be in our space, and we need to continue to innovate and
provide terrific service to customers to maintain the kind of performance that we have. But we haven't done any
analysis to distinguish by income level within our customer base. But it's pretty good performance over a broad base of
our products that's giving us this stable growth.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Thanks. And then – I'm sorry – in terms of the Chase/Visa deal, some have suggested that
maybe that could be a competitive risk to Amex because of the closed loop. I mean is there anything specific that they
could do that's incremental? is there any sort of incremental competitive threat from that, that you see today?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, they're trying to replicate our closed loop. I think people realize that that has value. But
the number of customers that can actually operate within that space is limited, right? It has to be a Chase customer at a
merchant that uses their merchant-acquiring process. And when you add that all up, I don't think that's a very large
piece of the total universe. So, is it something that will enable them to achieve growth? I think it likely is, but I don't
see it as a large threat as our closed loop covers all our merchants and all of our customers.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Thank you.

Now we'll go to the line of Ken Bruce, representing Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thank you. Good evening. Firstly, I appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks as it
relates to the marketing and promotion expense and expense levels in general. I want to make sure I understand some
of your comments there and my question will tie in with some of the others. But, firstly, the – you'd mentioned that
marketing and promotion expense running at 7.9% in the quarter, likely going to go higher just in terms of where you
expect to run it on a more stable-state basis. And I'm trying – I wanted to make sure that that's – your outlook is for
marketing promotion as a percentage of managed revenue to rise? And then, within the context of your marketing and
promotion expenses, you had pointed out that brand advertising was down and acquisition costs – or acquisition
spending was up. And I want to – maybe you can dimensionalize if there's been any changes in terms of what is the
discretionary side of the expense versus what is more cardmember behavior, if you've seen any change in the outlook
for where you want to invest, whether that'd be geographically or within products and get a sense as to how you're

looking at the investment horizon? If you could provide some color around those areas please.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So what we've said is our objective is for marketing and promotion on an annual basis to be
about 9%. It's not a forecast but that's our objective. I was just pointing out that last year we had brought marketing as a
percentage of revenue down in the first quarter. We've done that again. But, again, we aren't changing our objective of
being at that 9% level. The commentary to say we took brand down a little bit and acquisition up a little bit wasn't to
say we've had a strategy change in terms of the mix. It was just to say during this quarter when we had lower expense it
was coming more from the brand side and that our acquisition engine, to bring in customers, was actually at or a little
above what we've had in the past. So it was really just to give you a sense of how we allocate it within the quarter.
Every year we look at all of the opportunities we have in terms of where we spend our marketing dollars, whether it's
on brand or charge in the U.S. or charge internationally or lending products or co-brand products, and we have pretty
refined models in terms of what the expected economic gain of each of those investments are and that's what really
drives where we put the dollars. Obviously, it's a lot easier to measure when you do an acquisition because you can see
the actual cards that come in and we have a pretty good idea how they're going to perform.
When it gets to things like brand advertising, we don't have that nice mathematical calculation. We know there is a
certain amount that we want to do and if you do – if you have good products and good brand advertising that's where
you want to be. But it's really driven by which investments give us the greatest economic gain that'll drive what
geography and what product we put the investments behind.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: And, as a follow-up, are you – when you look at brand versus acquisition expenditures, it feels
that the branding is very discretionary but ultimately has a longer payback window versus the acquisition investments
that you may be making, which are harder to pull back. So I'm trying to get a sense as to how much of this may be in
reaction to meeting some shorter-term financial objectives versus any change in the overall outlook for investments in
your business.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, I think we need – so all the marketing and promotion, just about – maybe not 100% but
a very, very large is completely discretionary, right, that we can decide to either do or not do. So it's not like a fixed
cost of having employees within the company. So it is just a matter of – we – I think we recognize that we can take
marketing and promotion down in any quarter or for a couple of quarters in fact, as we did back in 2008 and 2009, and
there is really no negative impact to the franchise. We couldn't do that longer term. So this is just in – recognizing in
the first quarter, we've taken it down some. We're committed to hit the objective that we set and we chose in this
particular quarter to have brand come down and acquisition go up but that can change from quarter to quarter
depending on what we're endeavoring to achieve.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Great. Thank you very much.

And next we'll go to the line of Chris Brendler representing Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Dan, if you could talk to me – touch on the lending
business one more time; the margin seemed to pop up a little bit in the first quarter, anything going on there? Is it
sustainable? And also just stepping back a little bit, the lending business also seems to be going fairly well. As you
mentioned, you're growing receivables better than almost anyone in the industry, the margins are healthy, credit is at
all-time lows. Any change in strategy around lending? And, given the weakness in other parts of the business, is there
any desire to increase your focus on lending? And can you just comment at all on your use of teaser rates currently?
Thanks.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: All right. So I'll start with teaser rates. So we – others are using balance transfers with zero for
a certain period of time. That is not a strategy that we are following. So we're not growing loans by putting teaser rates
out there. The growth in our loans is coming by – as a result of cardmember spending, billed business spending on our
products, which is what we want them to do. Coming out of the crisis, we did have a shift in our lending strategy, right?

So we wanted, coming out of the crisis, to be focused on premium lending, right? So that was a change and that's really
a change that we put in place back in 2009 and we've continued to execute against that.
We've shared information about what percentage of lending customers actually are transactors and that has increased
quite a bit over the last several years. And, as a result of the premium lending strategy, we are focused on cards that
have higher spending on them. So we've also shared the percentage of customers who have a tenure of less than two
and a half years with us. Today it's a lot less than it was, again, five years ago because we're bringing in fewer cards,
right?
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Right.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: That's helpful from a credit perspective as well. So I think we're putting a number of metrics
out there to show that we're not only talking about a premium lending strategy but actually executing against it. You
can actually see that as average cardmember spending in the whole base is going up. So that has been something of a
change because of some strategy changes that we made a couple of years ago.
Lending products for creditworthy customers are products that have very good economics associated with it and so we
want to grow both Charge Card and premium lending. And, as I said before, which ones we're actually investing
against is based on the return that we think we'll get out of each investment.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Any comment on the net interest margin? And then also....
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: No.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: ...separately, can you also comment on fraud? I'm starting to hear more and more
concern about fraud, the lack of EMV in the U.S. and just your plans to start issuing EMV cards in the U.S., an update
there. Thanks.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. So net yield is at 9.5% in the quarter, up about 30 basis points from last year. I made a
comment that a part of that increase had to do with an adjustment of a reserve so I wouldn't expect it to stay at exactly
9.5%. Coming out of the crisis – or actually coming out of the new regulations that we had, we had said 9% was about
our yield prior to those regulations and our intent was for our yield to be about 9% after those regulations with the
changes we made in our products. So we have achieved that and slightly more. So, on our lending products, we're
getting good growth, low credit losses and good yields. So that's a pretty good combination to have, right? So we're
very pleased with how our lending products are performing.
As it relates to fraud, our fraud losses are less than half of what we see across the industry and I think that's the benefit
of having very good processes to monitor. That's probably one of the benefits of the closed loop. And we have not seen
any notable tick-up in fraud in our core business.
As relates to EMV, we have started to put EMV chips on some of our premium products, or products for customers
who travel extensively so that they have the best utilization possible, quite frankly, outside the U.S. But I think
gradually, within the U.S., we've put EMV onto our cards over a number of years.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: So no big rollout planned for this year then?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: It's going to be a very gradual rollout over several years, I would say, so no big push to do it
in 2013. It's a gradual undertaking for us.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Great. Thank you so much.

<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Hi.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of questions. One is just on the travel segment. Travel segment had been relatively
weak, thinking about just airline and airline seat capacity and I am wondering how much that may have impacted your
first quarter in terms of billed business.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah. So, as I think I mentioned before, the reason that Corporate Services was down in terms
of growth rate – the growth rate was lower was that we were seeing weakness in T&E spend compared to our average
so that, in all of our products, it's a bigger percentage of Corporate Services so it had a bigger impact there. So it was
impacting growth in the quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. But no sense of degree of impact?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: It's hard to tease out exactly. I would say that was lower but overall we're very pleased with
our aggregate growth rate given the sluggish economy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure. And then on slide 5, just looking at the different billed business growth rates per
region, it's interesting they're somewhat coming together fairly tightly. And I'm wondering how you guys are thinking
about that. Is this a new normal where distribution of growth rate across the globe is likely to be running more similarly
or do you have a different outlook than what you experienced this quarter?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah. So I think there'll be times where it moves together like it is now and I think there'll be
other times where it broadens again, let's say. So EMEA is slower than the other regions and, until they figure out
exactly all the issues that are in front of them, it could well be that EMEA stays in the lower part of the chart. We think
JAPA is being impacted by China. So it's good growth rates but not the growth rates that they had in recent history.
That impacts countries like Australia. So it's really very much going to be driven by the economies in those regions in
large part.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure, okay. And then just lastly, a couple of questions on Bluebird; I wanted to understand
the impact of adding the checking feature and the FDIC insurance on Bluebird and if there's been much in the way of
any effort to expand the merchant acceptance to attract more Bluebird spend.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So Bluebird products or all reloadable products are accepted across our whole network, right?
So you can use any of those products in any location where an American Express product is accepted.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: The FDIC insurance we put on because we've learned from some customers it may matter and
also to load certain checks like government checks or your tax refunds bond that had to be FDIC insured. And, in terms
of the check writing, we just want to have a full suite of options for customers so it's the best possible product for them.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Have you seen any uptick in growth rate beyond what you were experiencing before post the
FDIC announcement?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, it just went on so it's hard to measure but we are seeing healthy growth in reloadable
prepaid across that product set.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then the question on the merchant acceptance – I get it that Bluebird is accepted at any
merchant who accepts Amex. So I guess the question is, does a reloadable prepaid card user seek a potentially different
kind of merchant in addition to the merchants that Amex has today?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So we – so it's possible. But we do have an initiative to – so we've always had initiative to
expand merchant coverage. Signing up small merchants is a particular initiative within 2013 where we're trying to
expand it. So it's very much in line. So it'll be good for customers who use reloadable prepaid. It'll be good for our
customers who use our [ph] Corporate Card (62:48) as well.

All right. Next, we'll go to the line of Brad Ball with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Thanks, Dan. A lot of my questions have been asked. Just – you mentioned that you were
experiencing higher cash back rewards. Is that a contra-revenue item and how many of your – what proportion of your
customers are using cash back?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So cash back rewards is a contra-revenue, and cash back is a good product. I don't think we
actually break out the percentage but it's still a reasonably healthy product within our suite of products.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: And is it a product that resembles the products that are in the market, 1% type cash back on all
spending, that kind of product?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, each product is a little different. But it's basically a percentage of spend you get and
sometimes there's higher rewards in particular categories, either on a product feature basis or on a promotion basis.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Okay. And then one other; you had mentioned that other revenue were helped by higher Loyalty
Partner revenues.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yes.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of the contribution there and just broadly how are
you tracking to the $3-billion target for fee revenues?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So Loyalty Partner is a substantial business. However, it is one business in a very large
company. But they are performing nicely, very much in line with our expectations and it's one of the spots that we think
is going to help us achieve our $3-billion target. As we said, we're halfway through the timeframe of achieving that
target, which we still think is appropriate. It will be different fee businesses like Accertify, LoyaltyEdge, Loyalty
Partner, reloadable prepaid that we're looking for to get us there.
As of 2012, we stood at $1.5 billion. That was up 15% from the prior year. We recognize $3 billion is an ambitious
target, particularly in a sluggish economy, and we have a fair amount of work to do as we go forward. But Loyalty
Partner, reloadable prepaid are two examples of how we're diversifying our base and we expect those to ramp up as we
head towards the end of 2014 which is when we're shooting to be at a run rate of $3 billion.

<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Could you just start the – Moshe, could you just start the sentence again because I didn't
catch....
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Yeah, sure, no problem. Yeah. Basically, you had said that with respect to reserving that you
look at the forward 12-month losses and if a quarter drops out that had higher losses and in that exact analysis, taken
literally, your losses are down 3% or 4%. So the reserve drop we saw is – seems reasonable. How do you factor in the
idea of growth because you've gone from 14 months of coverage at the current rate to 13 months which implies that
you're not leaving as much room for either growth or any kind of deterioration in the existing rate?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: We actually use 12 months looking back, right? So we use historical information to feed our
models. That's what's driving the reserve.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: All right. And the loan growth has nothing to do with it, expected loan growth?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: No. We're looking at the behavior of our portfolio, right? And if we have loan growth, we're
assuming inherently that that loan growth will have a similar loss aspect to it as our existing book of business, and in
any event, we're not putting reserves on our books today for loans that we put on in the future. So this is what is the
reserve you need for the loans that are on your books at this moment.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Got you. Okay, thanks.
Daniel T. Henry
Okay. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call. Take care.
