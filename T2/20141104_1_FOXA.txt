And with that, I'm pleased to turn it to John.
John P. Nallen
Thank you, Reed. As you have seen in today's earnings release, our fiscal 2015 year is off to a good start overall with
our first quarter results reflecting double-digit percentage increases in total company revenues, segment EBITDA and
adjusted earnings per share.
I'll expand on this later, but note the consolidated results from our DBS businesses are included in our reported results,
and will continue to be until the closing of the sale of these businesses to BSkyB.
The first quarter's financial results were driven by strong top line revenue growth. With total company revenues of
$7.89 billion, up 12% compared to the first quarter a year-ago, reflecting double-digit increases in our Cable Network
and Film segment.
Total segment EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.78 billion, up 10% over the $1.62 billion reported a year-ago. This
increase was principally led by our Film and Cable Network segment, partially offset by lower contributions from the
Television segment. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced our total EBITDA growth rate by
three percentage points.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.04
billion, as compared to the $768 million we reported in the first quarter a year-ago.
Included in this year's result is a net after-tax gain reported in equity earnings of affiliates of $172 million, principally
related to BSkyB's gain on the sale of shares in ITV. Excluding the net income effect of this gain and last year's gain,
from participating in BSkyB share repurchase program as well as the amounts reflected in other, net, first quarter
adjusted earnings per share were $0.39 this year versus $0.33 in the prior-year, an 18% improvement.
Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable
Network segment, where overall total segment revenues increased 15% from last year, highlighted by a 15% increase
in affiliate revenues and 11% advertising revenue growth.
With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 18%, primarily from higher average rates led by the
RSNs, FX and Fox News as well as increases from the conversions of our new channels FS1 and FXX. The inclusion
of the YES Network, this year also contributed to the growth.
Our reported international affiliate fees were up 8%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 16%,
partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily in Latin America.
The first quarter advertising revenue growth of 11% reflects domestic advertising increases of 10% led by the RSNs,
FX Networks and Fox News; and reported growth at the international channels of 13%, driven by strong year-over-year
increases at STAR.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the first quarter of $1.04 billion, was up 5% over the prior-year, reflecting a strong
revenue growth, which was partially offset by a planned 21% increase in expenses, primarily related to higher sports
rights and entertainment programming costs.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 15% from increased contributions at Fox News, continued strong
underlying growth of the RSNs as well as the impact of consolidating the YES Network this year.

Contributions from the FX Networks were below last year, but this was expected due to increased costs for additional
hours of original programming including; The Strain, Tyrant and Sons of Anarchy at FX and the launch of The
Simpsons at FXX.
International channel EBITDA contributions were below a year-ago, as strong double-digit local currency EBITDA
growth at FIC was more than offset by both the continued investment we're making in STAR Sports including this
quarter's cost for the India-England cricket series and a negative impact from foreign exchange rates.
At our Television segment, first quarter EBITDA was $174 million as compared to the $231 million in the prior-year.
This decline largely reflects higher programming costs at the FOX Broadcast Network, primarily from the combination
of additional hours of scripted summer series, higher program cancellation costs and higher rights fees from the new
NFL contract.
Total segment revenues were unchanged from a year-ago quarter, as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was
offset by a 5% decline in advertising revenues, primarily due to lower general entertainment ratings at the Broadcast
Network.
Now, turning to our Film segment, we reported record first quarter EBITDA of $458 million, a 40% increase over the
year-ago results, driven by a 17% increase in revenues. This quarter's results include several successful theatrical
releases including Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Maze Runner and The Fault in Our Stars, as well as strong home
entertainment contributions from Rio 2. Quarterly results also include increased earnings contributions from our
television production businesses, led by increased syndication and SVOD revenues.
Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $207 million in the quarter, a $17 million increase over the prior-year. This
improvement reflects higher subscriber revenues at Sky Deutschland, partially offset by higher programming costs of
Sky Italia from their broadcast of the FIFA World Cup.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $4.7
billion in cash and $20.2 billion in gross debt. This debt position reflects the $1.2 billion of new long-term debt we
issued in September, recognizing that we have approximately $1 billion of scheduled debt maturities over the next 12
months.
With regard to the stock buyback, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion of Fox A shares from July 1 through
today, and we're on pace to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe, we previously announced.
So now, let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015. And as a reminder, and as I indicated on our last earnings
call, with the Sky transaction expected to close shortly, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses
for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion.
Chase will provide more commentary in a moment to round our businesses. And while we have one quarter under our
belt, we've seen some puts and takes in the last few months as against our original expectations for fiscal 2015.
Clearly, the initial ratings at the FOX Broadcast Network for the new broadcast season are below our original
expectations. Additionally, the continued strengthening of the dollar, results in lower reported U.S. dollar EBITDA
from our international businesses, particularly the Fox International Channels.
On the plus side, our Filmed Entertainment businesses are performing above initial expectations; and as importantly,
our domestic Cable Network businesses continue to perform in line with our expectations.
So considering these balancing factors and based on all the assumptions inherent in our current projections, we
continue to expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 will be in the high
single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.
Now finally, since the Sky transaction is expected to close within the next couple of weeks, I thought we would provide
a few comments related to how it will affect our reported financial results once completed.

The DBS segment results will no longer be included in our consolidated revenues, EBITDA, or depreciation and
amortization after the closing date. We'll also no longer report any minority interest related to Sky Deutschland's
results.
For reference, the consolidated DBS segment results will have contributed only around 1% of our annual total adjusted
earnings per share in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015.
For the periods after the closing, and excluding the impact of BSkyB's purchase price amortization, we do not
anticipate the transaction to have a material impact on our fiscal 2015 equity earnings from affiliates. And finally, we
do not anticipate the transaction to have a significant impact on our anticipated effective tax rate going forward.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chase.
Charles G. Carey
Thanks, John. As John noted, we got off to a good start with our first quarter results, keeping us on plan to achieve our
financial targets for this year and next, as we laid out last August. While we are experiencing some headwinds at the
FOX Broadcast Network and from negative foreign currency trends, we have considerable momentum and strength at
our Cable Networks and content businesses to drive overall results.
At RSNs, regular season baseball ended strong, and the new hockey season is off to a solid start. At Fox News, this past
quarter, the channel hit an all-time high in ratings during primetime weeknights and was Cable's most-watched channel
overall.
At FX, we're seeing continued momentum from our original programming effort, giving us even more confidence in
the investments we're making. Likewise, the landmark deal for The Simpsons as an anchor for FXX has already paid
dividends with record viewership and overall ratings that rank FXX as Cable's fastest-growing network on a
year-on-year basis.
Fox Sports 1 has also delivered steady ratings growth over the past several months and is showing momentum as new
rights come to air. With the college basketball, NASCAR, FIFA Women's World Cup and the U.S. Open launching in
coming quarters, FS1 is on track with our plan.
Internationally, our channels business, FIC, delivered a solid performance, despite a tough economy in Europe and
currency headwind. In India, our entertainment business continues to build on our leadership position, and the
India-England cricket matches propelled our sports channels to new heights.
We were also thrilled to recently lock up the World Cup Cricket rights into the next decade as an anchor for our sports
business.
At our Broadcast business, we clearly had a difficult start to the new season. The rebuilding process we began this
summer, led by a new management team will take some time. Gotham has had a solid start and Brooklyn Nine-Nine
has performed well on Sunday night. We look forward to a few mid-season premieres like Empire, but we know we
have work to do. Still a couple of hits can make a big difference in this business. On the sports side, the NFL is off to a
strong start and we were pleased to see the World Series go seven games.
Another source of strength in the quarter were our content businesses on both the Film and TV side. This strength looks
to continue with Gone Girl and upcoming releases; Exodus and Night at the Museum, as well as increasing global
demand for our Television content by digital platforms.
As you're all aware, we will soon close on our agreement to sell Sky Italia and our stake in Sky Deutschland to BSkyB,
which will create a pan-European Sky business. Our firm belief is that a united Sky will be more efficient, innovative,
and effective in launching new product, ultimately creating a better value proposition for both consumers and
shareholders.

In summary, our first quarter reflects the steady underlying growth of our core businesses, giving us confidence in our
ability to hit our 2016 target and create long-term value for our shareholders.
Before turning to questions, I'd like to address three industry issues getting a lot of attention: the state of the TV ad
market; trends in network ratings; and the impact of digital platforms on viewership and traditional business models. A
number of people claim that these three issues portend new challenges for our business.
The television advertising is shifting into new digital platforms, that ratings reflect a decline in the viewership of our
product, and that new over-the-top digital platforms will undermine traditional business models.
My first observation is that these concerns are overblown particularly in the short-term. The television ad market is a
mix story, but the issue is primarily the economy. Pricing has actually held up pretty well, but volume is a bit softer
than expected due to a lack of confidence, leading businesses to buy short-term or keep the money in their pocket.
Actually, our core Cable Networks each saw solid growth in advertising this last quarter.
On the ratings front, network ratings are down, but the issue generally is not popularity of content, particularly hit
content. The issue is that an increasing amount of viewership is occurring in ways and places not reflected in traditional
network ratings. And as it relates to new digital platforms, the traditional bundle, while mature, continues to have real
leg.
[indiscernible] (16:20) overblown today, these are real issues that while challenging also present real opportunities for
us. On the advertising issue, the priority for our industry is to develop the capability to offer a more effective and
efficient message combined with a more engaging consumer experience that increases the value of our messages to
both advertisers and consumers.
To address the decline in traditional network ratings, we need to more effectively measure and monetize the viewership
on these new digital platforms and devices. We need to achieve this goal, while recognizing that the consumer is going
to demand more choice and control in tomorrow's digital world. For example, if we want the consumer to use a robust
VOD service instead of a DVR, we have to make it a better experience.
When it comes to the emergence of new digital platforms, we actually view this as the most exciting and important
opportunity for our future growth. To start, it means, there'll be increased competition for our content. It also means,
we'll be able to engage the consumer more directly to create a more exciting and valuable experience. The emergence
of the new digital offerings also doesn't spell the end of the traditional bundle. In fact, we believe the traditional bundle
offers great value to consumers and will be the primary consumer package for years to come.
However, we also recognize the traditional bundle is fraying at the edge due to both millennials with different lifestyles
and economic pressures in tough times. There'll be a gradually increasing number of consumers that want more choice
in programming options.
We believe that most of these customers will still want to bundle the programming as a foundation. It just may be a
somewhat different bundle and proposition. The key challenge for us is to build these choices in ways that fairly
compensate us for our content and brands, and do not undermine more established business models.
Overall, we recognize that we're in a period of change, but we truly look at this as a glass half-full opportunity. There's
a real chance for us to build exciting new areas of growth, if we can create more exciting choices for customers and
more valuable proposition for advertisers, while maintaining a discipline that enables us to manage the trade-off
required to ensure fair value for our product.
There'll be winners and losers as this process evolves. We believe exploring digital demand and platforms with content
in the sweet spot; and within the content world, we believe those with hit content and brands at scale are best positioned
to come out on top. We look forward to tackling these opportunities.
With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.

Reed Nolte
Thank you, Chase. Now, Chase, James and John will be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question in queue will come from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks. So, my one big double question is, could you, Chase, or James, John,
whoever, talk about the use of BSkyB proceeds? You said, you'd be closing in the quarter. You have a lot of money
coming in, and you haven't changed your target capital returns.
And then the second thing is, just to follow-up on Chase's comment on demand for content. There's a view in the
market that the demand for television content is exceptionally strong on a global basis. And I was just wondering, if
you could change that focus a little bit to film. Your film numbers have been great, and you seem pretty bullish on the
outlook for your titles. What do you see, in terms of changes in trends, on whether it's on a global basis, or even
domestically?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess, in the BSkyB proceeds, yeah, I mean, we do expect those proceeds in the next week
or two weeks. But, it isn't going to drastically change our plans.
As John said, we've got the buyback in place. We're on course for it. We recognize we'll have access liquidity that will
result from this. And, it hasn't changed our longer-term goals and we think it's the right place to get to. We recognize
we won't be there at the end of this buyback, but we will continue to work to get to the place we think we should be.
And that's going to be through the combination of initiatives that we've talked in the past; investing in our core
businesses, returning capital to shareholders, and we will do that and continue to do that over time.
In terms of demand for products, the film demand, we feel really good about. Certainly internationally, you continue to
see growth and even domestically. I think, there's been a lot written about box-office this year. But, I think if you look
at certain demand in digital, probably one of the more exciting arenas for us in the Film business, in the U.S. has been,
the really pretty dynamic growth in the digital and home entertainment space. And I think that will continue to build
and we've been excited about the Digital HD initiative we had to put our films out in a new window, a bit ahead of
DVDs. And we think, that's a business we feel very good about, it's obviously, beyond just the year we've had. We
think Film business continues to have real demand around the world.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Operator, could we have next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Chase, and one for John. So, Chase, you talked about the new
digital models that are emerging for distribution. When we hear that, it's often mini-bundles and virtual MSOs, like the
Sony project we're hearing about. So, how can you make sure that, if that's the digital bundles we're seeing going
forward, that your RSNs are part of that package. How do you navigate what people want to do is perhaps
[indiscernible] (22:56) without RSNs.

<A - Charles G. Carey>: I mean, I guess, realistically the RSNs are not different than any other channels we have.
And we are engaged with – there are a lot of players who seem to be, wanting to enter this space. You touched on a few
of them. We're doing our own continued work and analysis on how best could we develop these opportunities.
And we're looking at it from all directions. And as we do, I guess, as I said in the opening comments, we're going to
ensure that both individually; and in aggregate, we develop these opportunities in ways that don't simply undermine our
existing core businesses. And we think we have the breadth and strength of product to be able to do that.
I think in many ways as you look at some of these offerings, I think they'll in many ways likely reinforce the
attractiveness of a bundle of content. And I think as it comes to sports, I think what you'll find is, there's a reason sports
has the highest costs. It's because it's the most important product. And it is the product people first and foremost want to
access on these platforms.
So, I think we are going to, I use the phrase, disciplined and manage the trade-offs to make sure, we want to be
proactive, I think we want to be a step ahead, not a step behind of leading into developing these business models. But,
we think we have an array of content that are really fundamental to anybody's content experience, and look to work
with third parties as well as do our own work to figure out how do we develop these opportunities.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks. And then for John, you know your cable expenses grew 21% this
quarter, can you give us a reminder of what the cadence will be for the rest of the year on Cable Network expenses?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Yeah. I think what we've indicated that for the year, we expect high-teens growth. I mentioned
that on our last call. I think you'll find the biggest step up will happen in the third fiscal quarter. And that's most notably
because of the sports cost at STAR for the Cricket World Cup.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Michael. Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. I have two. James, can you talk about the Shine-Endemol deal. TV
production is an area where I think everyone's quite bullish. And in many ways, you guys are sort of selling your asset,
one of your assets in that space. It's going to move below the line, which is a different trend than Fox has been
following, which is to consolidate more. So why is this the right strategy in TV productions for the Shine asset?
And then I just had follow-up for Chase. It sounds like you're exploring, at Fox, your own over-the-top potential
product to address the broadband-only subbase. I just wanted to see if you'd flesh that out? Your comments earlier,
sounded like you were heading at least exploratory and looking at that type of offering?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Ben. On the Shine-Endemol transaction, look, I mean, first of all, the
television production business that remains totally consolidated or the businesses that remain wholly consolidated
within 21st Century Fox, i.e., TCF TV and our production capability in places like India and around the place,
remained very important to us and a much, much larger than the Shine business, for example.
Really with Shine and Endemol, we saw an opportunity to create something as a joint venture that was really in order
of magnitude greater than what the individual parts were. We felt that with Shine and Endemol coming together, we
could create something that was on an independent production basis really a world leader. So, it was really
opportunistic to be able to create something that we feel – we hope it's going to be awaiting some regulatory clearances.
But, we would hope that we're closing that transaction before the end of the year. And we think it's a very, very
attractive business.

Now generally speaking, we've been seeking over the last number of years, as you mentioned, to kind of simplify our
operating model to have probably fewer joint ventures and fewer minorities and things like that, but I don't think we
want to foreclose opportunities to ourselves that are really unique in being too orthodox about that.
This is one of those unique opportunities where the Endemol asset and the core assets and Shine really fit together very
well. And we felt that and we do believe that it can be something that's a very special new company formed. And we
decided to take that opportunity as opposed to leave it out there.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: And, I guess, I just add maybe one reality of Shine, because it is not consolidated, the profits
of Shine won't be going forward...
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Yeah.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: ...won't be in the place. But again as James said, I don't think we want to be locked into any
particular. We want to be opportunistic. And this is a way for us to really be part of a very unique globally leading
production company.
In terms of digital, we're looking at everything. When I say looking at it ourselves, I think what I mean is, we're not just
responding to third parties that want to put together bundles of products and offerings, we're making our own analysis
of what do we think consumers want. So, it was not implying there's anything imminent we're doing on our own.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Okay.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: [indiscernible] (28:29) we're not going to be just simply reactive to what we think – what
should be the models out there for consumers in the marketplace. And I think we want to make sure we are proactive in
forming our own judgments about what types of bundles and what types of offerings, and what are the other ways in
which we can create attractive offerings that are additive to our business as it exists today.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Alexia Quadrani with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. My question is on your earlier commentary about measurement being a bit
of an issue, in terms of, there's a fair amount of viewership that's not captured in ratings. I guess, I'd be interested in
your commentary on how you think that might change going forward? And can it change going forward, and can you
capture some of that viewership? And then just a follow-up, sorry if I missed it, but could you give an organic
advertising gross number for cable?
<A - John P. Nallen>: So, if I look organically, I'll give it both on domestic affiliate and domestic ad, which is really
excluding the YES Network. So, on affiliate, it would be low double-digits; and on domestic ad, it would be mid
single-digits. Organically, which excludes the YES Network.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah. And in terms of monetizing viewership across all these platforms, it's really, I guess,
there are a multitude of ways we need to pursue that. Some of its measurement, I think we all recognize that there are
issues in terms of the quality accuracy of the measurement devices today. I think it's an issue, I wouldn't say it is the
issue, but I think it's an issue we need to deal with.
We're still not measuring some of the mobiles being the most obvious one, some are measuring viewership in that. We
still only move from measuring three days to seven days, there's obviously a lot of viewership that happens beyond
seven days. There are ways we need to make and create consumer experiences, I talked about VOD versus DVR is one

of the things we'd like to do, is create a better experience for consumers that may have the opportunity to have
messages in that, that they find more attractive and more rewarding than a DVR. So, we can shift viewership from a
DVR to a VOD experience, you know that's positive for us.
We need to make these messages more interesting to consumers, more engaging to consumers, I think you'll find just
simply giving them a choice between two ads makes them more engaged, because they feel like they have some control
over it.
So, it is really doing an array of things that we need to take advantage of that enable us to monetize our viewership
much beyond traditional [indiscernible] (31:27) that we have today. We are selling into some of these digital platforms,
but clearly we don't have the targeting and other dynamic tools anywhere close to where we want them to be. We're
really in sort of the first inning of trying to develop that. Fortunately, there is a focus on it. We are starting to make
some headway, but we have a long way to go.

Thank you. That will come from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. Thanks. Chase, in your sort of concluding comments there you seem to have real conviction
that some of the softer dynamics in the ad market have more to do with macro weakness than secular share shift of the
ad pie from TV to digital. What gives you that conviction? Are the advertisers definitively telling you that? Are you
seeing any differences across categories?
Also are you seeing anything in terms of cancellations in calendar 1Q that would tell you something? And I guess,
lastly, you've unified ad sales across Cable and Broadcast under [indiscernible] (32:34) now. Will you be doing
anything differently now that you sort of have a unified platform for TV ad sales? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit all of those. Certainly, a big part of it is talking to those in the
agencies and the advertisers and really what you mostly get back from them is a comment that there is a marginal shift
to digital and that marginal shift is probably going to – is certainly a direction, I don't think it's a – it's not a one-year
phenomena. There's no question, there are values being offered in these digital platforms that people want, need to
meet, that advertisers want and are better for consumers, that's why we need to offer them.
So, it will keep going that way, but at this point, it is from all the people we talk to, whether it's advertisers, clients, and
the like, it's a pretty modest shift and what you get back is much more of the issue is, confidence in the short-term
economy and how they feel about it. We do hope the holidays, new budgets in January will put some money back in the
advertising system. But, it is basically sort of our analysis and our interacting with the wider array of players that we
deal with in the marketplace. And what was the other?
[indiscernible] (33:59) I guess in many ways the restructuring we did there is sort of recognizing the changing business
we're in. And I think aligning, we had Cable and Broadcast separate, I think we felt to be opportunistic, it made more
sense. We had already taken that step in sports, so we're clearly taking that step now across the board. And
increasingly, it's not just Cable and Broadcast, it's these digital platforms and developing new capabilities that need to
go across all these platforms.
And I think, we recognize that we need to look at it much more holistically and figure out how do we monetize this
viewership from a top-down philosophy that takes advantage of and all the trends that we see emerging, and we thought
this structure really is a structure that's built for the world we're going to compete in going forward, as opposed to the
world that we've competed in looking back.
<Q - David Bank>: And cancellations, I'm sorry, I might have missed the answer there in calendar 1Q?

Operator
Thank you. That will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi, thanks. First for John and then for Chase. John I think the 13% international ad
revenue was what you reported. Can you please give us that on a constant currency basis; and then, John one other one
also on your guidance. Wondering on those puts and takes as your guidance imply a recovery in Fox TV ratings from
here or does it imply similar ratings performance that we've seen going forward?
And then, I guess bigger picture for Chase, as we talk about these digital platforms, Internet-delivered video taking
share of the market, the buyers of ads seem to be getting a lot more sophisticated, whether it's ROI analysis,
programmatic buying and the like.
So, I guess, the question is, as a seller of new digital ads, be it dynamic ad insertion, so forth over the next several
years, are you investing in the data technology on the sell side of your ad business? I'm talking about things like digital
inventory yield systems, custodial systems, and the like, so that they could better interface with those digital ad
exchanges or programmatic ad buyers in the marketplace?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Let me cover your first two financial questions. On the international ad growth reported at 13%
it's about the same on a constant currency basis. And that's principally, because the real big growth in the quarter on
advertising was at STAR, where the rupee really is unchanged year-on-year.
And then, for the puts and takes on the network, it's our best estimate really, where we think the ratings will be
particularly on upcoming programming. We've got pretty well locked in, obviously what we know at this point, so
we've taken our best estimate right now as to what we think the upcoming shows will rate.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I guess, I'd say on the Broadcasting side, we don't really – relative for this year and
next, I guess, if we go back to 16%, the assumption we had a year-ago, we almost assume we're getting back to that, so
whether it's other business is covering it or using up a degree of what probably, I guess, I call a cushion that was in
those numbers, is probably the reality. And likewise for this year, I think we've made realistic assumptions for it, but
they probably – given where we are today – assume a shortfall in the Broadcast business against our expectations,
covered by upside in other businesses for this year.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Right. Notably the Film business.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: In terms of the data, developing the tools, we need – and the capabilities we need to really
take advantage of the digital world, I mean, the simple answer is, yeah, we're doing a lot of it, and we're doing it, I'd
say, we're still midstream – not even midstream, we're probably in the early stages of it, but certainly not just starting
and whether that's creating databases or technical capabilities, whether it's for ad sales or whether it's how we more
effectively use our own time to promote and market our own products, we're engaged with third parties that obviously
bring us an array of expertise both in, how do we analyze data, how to manage data. And third parties that bring
capabilities, in terms of a much more dynamic ad experience, the messaging experience.
Then, we have [indiscernible] (38:46) with all of them to really figure out how do – we develop these certainly take
time, but it's a priority for us to develop the capabilities to really take advantage. Look, we think our product is the
product first and foremost that people want in all these platforms. And so, it is, I use the phrase a glass half-full. I think
it really is a glass half-full, that there's a lot of upside for us, if we can tap into and build those capabilities to better
monetize our viewership, while creating a better consumer experience. And so, certainly that's a big priority for us

<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi. Thanks. Yes. So, Chase or James or whoever you've mentioned, several times the changing
consumer behaviors in these new platforms, you've specifically called out VOD and DVR and some of the over-the-top
stuff. All of that is conceivably ad supported. So, I'd love to get your specific current thinking on the SVOD window, in
particular. And the value you're getting from your content there versus the fact that it does take viewers out of the ad
supported world. And how you think about the role of the SVOD window going forward and also relative to who and
what that plays in that?
And then a quick follow-up, if you don't mind, would just be, would love to hear any comments, on any differences
between the national ad market and the local broadcast ad demand environment. If there's any differences there, and if
there are any differences, maybe why difference in confidence between local and national, or maybe the fact there's
more digital substitutes for national advertisers? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think in the issue of how do we think about the platforms that are ad free. I think in many
ways to go back to what I was – we were talking about earlier, is we need to make sure, however, we distribute our
product, we're getting fair value for it. I think as we look at, and obviously, we can get value in two ways, we can get it
in advertising and we can get it through subscription fees or license fees.
And through those combination of factors, we need to make sure we get fair value. That we realistically get ad free
platform, it adds more value than an ad supported platform, certainly at this point in time. And the value, whether it's a
subscription fee, it's a license fee, should be reflected in it. It's important for us to continue to figure out how do we
evaluate and engage with all of these places. Netflix is up, you know Netflix and Amazon our ad free platforms, we
license our product to them. We think we get compensated and I think it's important for us to be disciplined in our
license fees to get compensated for an amount that recognizes that product is going to be displayed ad free.
I think in a larger context, I talked about the fact that consumers are – they're going to have more control over the
experience and more choice over the experience going forward. We want to give those consumers – we want to find
ways to give those consumers choices. Those choices just should be fairly valued.
So, if that means accessing content on platforms that don't have advertising, then we need to get compensated through
the payments that exist. If it's a dual revenue platform, we get compensated in a different way. So, I don't think we'll
look at it and say we're going to try and discipline the world to say every platform has to be an ad supported platform, I
think there are ways we can get properly compensated in value, if it is a platform that doesn't have advertising.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: In national versus local?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: In national versus local. There's always differences. Some of it – I wouldn't say they're
dramatic [indiscernible] (42:57), different political swings locally where in some places you have politics playing a
large role; in other places, a very limited role, national side of that clearly being different.
I think different advertising sectors probably buying a bit. I think there's some advertising sectors, electronics and the
like that are more adhered to national buying than local buying. But, I wouldn't say, they're dramatically different,
dramatic differences today between sort of the national side and the local side.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Todd. Next question, please?

Thank you. That will come from John Janedis with Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thanks. Chase, this seems like an ad market, where more than usual, there are maybe some haves
and have-nots. And I just wanted to ask, given your rights, is there any evidence sports programming is taking more
share, maybe at the expense of general entertainment networks or your [indiscernible] (44:05) Cable Networks? And
then more broadly, what are you seeing from the auto category? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I mean, I think you're in a – I mean, I think it's certainly true that – well, I won't say
[indiscernible] (44:16), strong programming is doing better, but that I think, whether it's – and clearly, we see it and
strengthened the NFL which has done well. You look at our Cable Networks which competed well I think, whether it
was Fox News or FX or the RSNs, so had strong – and that's a mix of entertainment and sports product. All
competitively did well. We had – in each of our core Cable Networks, we saw advertising growth.
So, I do think clearly, strong unique programming and sports is the most obvious example. I mean, some of it's just we
got the ratings hold up better, you have less fragmentation. The live nature of sports does enable to stand up, just stand
up and its ratings stuff continue. I think the NFL were pretty close to flat year-on-year at this point with the NFL
season.
So the strength of sports programming, I think in many ways, certainly positions it well for these marketplaces. But, I
think it is generally true that, sort of, successful programming will do better. And I think that's going to be in many
ways an increasing part of the story.
<Q - John Janedis>: Anything on auto?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: So anything what?
<A - John P. Nallen>: On auto.
<Q - John Janedis>: On auto?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Auto [indiscernible] (45:44).
<A - Charles G. Carey>: In the omni-auto category? The auto category probably, today is, I mean, is one of those that
has probably been a bit of a disappointment. Auto sales have been great, and yet it seems to be a place where the auto
advertisers are – certainly, year-on-year, the category Is down and they're keeping – it seems like they're keeping more
of the money in their pocket. Hopefully, some of it comes back into the market and maybe with fresh budgets or the
fall, but – and/or the holiday season. But the auto category, for the strength of the auto market, kind of maybe there's –
it's not been a strong category year-on-year.

Thank you. That will come from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan Salmon>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Chase, just to go back a little bit to the ratings question. As some of
those improvement start to roll out, particularly around mobile measurement, which Nielsen's been very visible on
lately, we've been hearing a little bit about network ad sales folks trying to figure out whether they want those rolled
into the regular TV ratings, and I think a lot of this has to do with rates of monetization on digital and mobile versus
traditional linear.

Could you give us a little bit of color around how you guys are viewing that? As these improvements come along, how
you expect to roll them into how you're selling? And then just a quick one for John. You mentioned programming
cancellation costs at Fox this quarter. Should we expect – at Fox Broadcast, rather, should we expect a little bit of that
to continue with some other recent news around cancellations there in this coming quarter?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think, actually, I mean, I think that's an issue that realistically we're very much in the midst
of evaluating and analyzing. And I think there's – this is a real question as you get these digital platforms where, again,
consumers have more control. What's the right way to approach it, and are you better off with sort of premium
advertising with more capabilities that have less volumes than linear? I think as an audit start, I mean, you have to sort
of say you look at the ad load that exists in our traditional business, and it's pretty heavy, and clearly maybe one of the
things that make the DVR appealing is the ability to not just control to find what you want, but to manage your time in
terms of the advertising that's there.
And so, I think there is a question of, are we better off getting premium dollars by creating different opportunities for
advertisers and different experiences for consumers? People add these days, they're sort of saying you can watch a large
ad break or you can watch a short ad break and at the end of it interact with, answer a bunch of questions about the
product.
That's a way to create a different – just one example, but there are an array of examples that we can use to try to create
different experiences for consumers that would monetize this in new and different ways.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And, Dan, to follow-up on your question. Yes, clearly, we made announcements in the last few
days around programming that we're either shortening or canceling, so we'll absorb the cost of that in the quarter, but
that's reflected in the guidance that we put together.
<Q - Dan Salmon>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Dan. Operator, could we have next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: A question for Mr. Carey. In your prepared remarks, you suggested there may be
opportunities to engage the consumer more directly via OTT offers. Assuming that Hulu is part of that mix, can you
elaborate on what changes you'd like to see occur at Hulu to make it more relevant relative to some of its competitors?
Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess, what I really mean is, the more you understand what a consumer wants to watch and
what they like and don't like it, obviously gives us a lot of insight into creating a better experience. And whether that's
the programming or trying to suggest choices or even get down to what sort of advertising and promotional messages
are relevant to them is all part of it.
One of the attractions with Hulu is, it's a leading digital platform we have today that through which we're only
obviously a part owner, but we have an opportunity directly engage with the consumer. And there's no question the
more we are able to directly engage with the consumer, understand the consumer, develop data and information about
what that consumer likes and is interested and wants to do, the more we think we can make that a rewarding experience
for the consumer and one in which we can create value out of it with our array of partners.
So, I do think we think the ability to participate more directly with the consumer, whether it's through Hulu or others
and develop a much better understanding of our consumers and the type of databases we were talking about a few
minutes ago and information and capabilities. Certainly, with Hulu, we have a vehicle that's able to do ad targeting that
does not require third parties. We're not sort of a step removed from the process of creating targeted ads, we can
directly create a platform that enables us to target ads to the consumers and Hulu and that opportunity certainly exists in
other over the top platforms.

<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jason. Operator, at this time, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you, sir. That will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Couple of questions on regional sports networks: earlier today
Dish spoke about RSNs as being somewhat more at risk in an environment where consumers have more selection over
the types of packages that they buy. At the same time, they were positive on Disney, which of course is very exposed to
a national sports network in their business model, so I guess I have two questions.
First, when you look at your existing agreements, or you look over the next couple of years, how much risk is there at
your regional sports networks of your distribution partners moving your networks to different tiers perhaps that aren't
as broadly distributed? Are you able to protect yourself from that type of shift in offering?
And second of all, just given that you do have exposure to both regional sports networks and a national sports network,
can you talk about the affinity for the regional sports networks versus the national sports networks and whether it
makes sense that a national sports network would be more valuable to the consumer, to a distributor than the regional
networks? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Hey, first, let me be clear, our regional sports network business for us, is a great business. It
has been one of the most successful and probably as important as any business we've had in many ways. It has and
continues to be a real area of growth and I think the reason is clear.
At the end of the day David Hill used to say sports are tribal, which ultimately means local. Local sports are the heart in
many ways of what makes a community tick. We think these regional sports networks are great businesses. I think
we've proven ability to manage it. The fact that we have a breadth and depth of not just regional sports networks helps
distinguish us from others in the business, but the fact that the regional sports networks are part of a broader portfolio
of sports that cut across national networks and the Broadcast Network truly enables us to create really clearly
distinctive and unique opportunities for consumers to engage in sports across the board.
We think this sports programming is going to get nothing, but more important and more valuable in a digital world, and
we realistically feel great about it. I guess I didn't see the Dish comment, I guess it shouldn't be lost that they have a
deal with Disney, so I guess sort of saying, defending the reason for doing a deal after you've already done a deal is
probably a bit self-justification as opposed to rationalizing something up front.
But we feel great about the regional sports networks in terms of value. Obviously, I don't think you can generalize. Not
every regional is the same and obviously not every national sports network is the same. Our national sports network
continues to increase in value as we've added key rights to it. We think it is uniquely attractive to a large segment of
consumers out there, in many ways must have programming.
If you look at the breadth of content that's going to exist from sort of baseball to NASCAR to soccer to UFC to golf to
college sports, basketball, football. Uniquely important. We'll value it fairly and accordingly. The regionals have
played a different role in each of their local communities.
And we feel very good about the future of each and we feel, while there is some linkage, clearly I think as a whole it
makes us stronger, I think of it as a one-plus-one is three to have the breadth of sports we have across the Fox Network,
the Fox national sports networks, and the regional sports networks, each at the end of the day while they are part of a
larger whole, each appropriately stands on its own two feet. And we continue to be excited about it; and again, I think
our track record in continuing to build them speaks for itself.

<Q - Michael Morris>: And on the question of, if there's risk of perhaps more tiering of the regional sports networks
relative to where they are right now, is that a legitimate concern within the agreements or are you somewhat protected?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, it's not how we built these businesses. It's not how we built the businesses. We've done
deals as recently as the last month and certainly that's not where we are going.
If you tier these, they have a completely different cost and you'd have a completely different proposition. It would be a
very different consumer proposition and you'd be disenfranchising and in many ways, obviously, it would cost a lot
more if you tiered it, and you'd be disenfranchising in many ways consumers who would say that's the most important
programming in the bundle, I've been buying. And that has not been again how we built it, and it's not the base around
– the model around which we've continued to build it.
And we continue to engage with our distributors and continue to have, to build. We think this bundle as a whole, again,
has great value for the consumer for, to the degree you have noise around it, I think sports is a critical part of that
bundle.
I think if you started to unbundle things, you may well find the consumers wish for the days of the bundle, that the real,
the best value proposition for them is the ability to buy a breadth and choice of programming that includes sports. And
that is certainly the path along which we continue to build our businesses.
