Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our First Quarter 2013
Earnings Conference Call. With me today are several members of our senior team including, Don Seale, our Chief
Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rathbone, Chief Financial Officer, all of whom
you will hear from this afternoon.
Our first quarter net income was an all-time best of $450 million or $1.41 per diluted share. It did include a large
non-operating land sale. But even without the benefit of this gain, we posted our second best ever first quarter results in
revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share. In addition, the operating ratio of 74.8% was our
second best for a first quarter.
Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 2% from last year. Overall volumes
were up 3%, as increases in intermodal units of 9% were offset by a 4% decline in coal traffic and flat merchandise
volumes. Don will provide you with all of the revenue and volume details in a few minutes.
On the expense side, our continued focus on productivity and efficiency resulted in operating expenses remaining flat
with last year, and John will review all of those details with you.
The big story for the quarter was the quality of our service. The composite service index improved 50 basis points over
last year to 83.3%. System average speed was 24.2 miles per hour, a 3% improvement. This increased velocity created
additional capacity, and our network is running as fluidly as I have ever seen it. Mark will provide you with all of the
operating details in a few minutes.
And as all of you who follow us know, all of these metrics are intertwined. The fluid network leads to better service
and the ability to control cost. And the combination of continued investment in our system, along with efficient
utilization of our capacity, will allow us to grow our franchise for years to come.
Now at this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team. And then I'll return with some closing
remarks before we take questions.
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was down $51 million or 2%
compared to first quarter of last year, as $131 million decline in our coal market more than offset revenue gains
achieved in intermodal and merchandise.
With respect to yield, revenue per unit declined by 5%, due to a 13% decline in coal RPU. Merchandise revenue per
unit was up $70 or 3% and intermodal revenue per unit was flat compared to first quarter 2012. Negative mix and price,
mostly associated with export coal, accounted for $85 million of the overall revenue decline for the quarter and fuel
surcharge revenue was down $51 million.

On the plus side, higher volume contributed to a positive $85 million into the revenue variance. With respect to
volume, total shipments for the quarter were up 3% and strong intermodal gains more than offset declines in coal and
merchandise. Merchandise results were mixed as two of the groups metals and construction, and agriculture
experienced declines, while first quarter volumes for chemicals and automotive increased year-over-year, while paper
volumes were flat.
Now turning to the individual market segments. Coal revenue was $635 million, was $131 million or 17% for the
quarter. As we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012, weaker demand across most markets contributed to this decline, along
with a materially weaker pricing environment for export metallurgical coal.
Our largest decline in volume occurred within the utility sector, which experienced a decrease of 21,000 loads or 9%.
Continued reduction of stockpiles, which were built as a result of weak demand in the 2011 – 2012 winter, was the
largest single contributor to this decline, coupled with competition from natural gas.
Overall, this had a more pronounced volume impact at our longer haul southern utilities, which were down 16%, while
shorter haul northern utility volumes declined by only 3%. Export volumes were up 21% in carloadings and 25% in
tonnage for the quarter, due to increased handling of thermal coal and increased met coal shipments through both ports
of Baltimore and Lamberts Point.
In the U.S. market, domestic metallurgical volumes were down 14% for the quarter, due to weaker steel production and
the continued impact of the RG Steel bankruptcy, which we reported last quarter, a comp which we will clear
beginning in the third quarter of this year. And finally, industrial coal volumes was down 10% due to weaker demand
and improved equipment efficiency at selected coal-fired industrial plants.
Now turning to our intermodal network. Revenue in the quarter reached $573 million, up $46 million or 9% over the
first quarter of 2012, driven by 9% higher volumes. As depicted on Slide 5, the volume gains in intermodal came from
both our domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 7%, due to continued highway conversions and
the opening of new Crescent Corridor lanes in the quarter, while organic growth across our international accounts
boosted international volume by 13%.
As in previous quarters, we continued our strong focus on increased efficiency across our intermodal network. During
the quarter, 95% of containers in both domestic and international market segments moved on stacked cars, a metric
which highlights loading efficiency and equipment utilization. This was a 5 percentage point improvement, compared
to the first quarter of 2012. And in turn, total intermodal crew starts were only up 1%, on a 9% volume increase for the
quarter.
Now turning to our merchandise markets depicted on Slide 7. Merchandise revenue was up 2%, reaching $1.5 billion
for the quarter. This increase came as a result of higher revenue per unit for the quarter, which was up 3%. Reduced
domestic raw steel production, which was down 8% in the quarter, combined with the impact of the RG Steel
bankruptcy, contributed to an overall decline in steel volumes of 7%. Aggregate shipments were also down for the
quarter due to a weaker highway construction market and declines in frac sand, as natural gas drilling rig counts
continued to decline in the quarter. This combination of factors led to an overall 6% decline in metals and construction
volume.
In our agricultural markets, reduced corn volumes to processors and the impact of ethanol plant closures contributed to
a 3% decline in shipments, though we saw strong gains in fertilizer and soybeans for the quarter. Fertilizer demand is
particularly strong this year due to low carryover grain inventories and anticipated increases in acreage to be planted
this spring.
On the plus side, chemicals volume was up 10%, due primarily to growth in crude-by-rail business, which accounted
for over 13,000 shipments in the quarter. Automotive volumes were up 2%, despite a slight decline in projected North
American vehicle production during the quarter. And paper and forest products volumes were essentially flat for the
quarter, as a rebound in the housing market contributed to 11% improvement in lumber volumes, which was offset by
weaker volumes of graphic paper.

Now concluding with our outlook. The market ahead continues to be mostly positive, but we face continuing
headwinds across our coal markets. Competition from natural gas and flat-to-declining electricity demand will continue
to impact our utility coal franchise. But firming natural gas prices reflect some relief in utility dispatch curves looking
ahead.
With respect to export metallurgical coal demand, we see continued sluggish demand in Europe and slowing shipments
into Asia. In the met export market we've seen some marginal improvement in world pricing. In this regard, we're
continuing to price our services on a quarterly basis, and in view of improving world prices some modest increases
were applied for met coal export starting April 1 for the second quarter.
But with that said, U.S. coals will continue to be challenged to remain competitive from a total cost perspective, which
makes this market choppy and uncertain at best. Also, thermal coal exports will face lower yields associated with the
weak API 2 Index into Europe.
In view of these challenges in both met and thermal coal exports, we do not expect our export volumes for the rest of
the year to be as strong as those in the first quarter. And finally, with respect to domestic met coal here in the U.S., we
see a weaker market ahead until we finally clear the RG Steel comp in the third quarter.
Turning to intermodal. We anticipate a continuation of solid opportunities for highway conversion as we launch new
service lanes and ramp up volumes at our newly opened terminals. We also expect continued growth within our
international segment, though at a more moderate pace than we saw in the first quarter.
In merchandise, we continue to expect growth in three of our five business groups in the months ahead led by
chemicals, automotive, and housing-related materials. In the other two markets, metals and construction, and
agriculture, we anticipate flat to modest declines in the first half, with an improving outlook for the second half of the
year.
Wrapping up, in summary, we expect that our diverse market base will continue to provide volume growth ahead,
despite the challenges that we face in the coal market. And we remain committed to market-based pricing at levels that
equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation over time, as we provide excellent service to our customers.
Thank you for your time. And Mark, I'll now turn it to you for the operations report.
Mark D. Manion
Good. Thanks, Don. And good afternoon, everyone. Based on preliminary safety data, our first quarter performance
stands at 0.72. That's equal to the same period last year. Positive improvements in our safety processes continue to
increase our employee engagement and provide a solid foundation for future performance.
Moving to the next slide. Our composite service metric continues a trend of year-over-year improvement. For the first
quarter 2013, composite performance stands at 83.3%. This represents an improvement over the full first quarter last
year, and it's important to point out that this was accomplished despite a more normal winter this year, compared to the
very mild conditions we experienced last year.
Turning to the next slide. And one of the key components of network velocity, train speed, system average train speed
improved 3% over the same period last year.
Turning to terminal dwell. We did see a modest increase in terminal dwell of just under 1%, but that was driven
primarily by a deeper reduction in our end-of-year operations, in response to reduced customer demand over the
Christmas and New Year holidays that abutted weekends. However, since the beginning of February, our terminal
dwell performance has been improved over the last year.
Moving on to the next slide. Building on the progress we've seen over the last several quarters, improved velocity and
other productivity initiatives are the drivers behind the improvements you see here. Overall, we've reduced crew starts a
significant 5% against a volume increase of 3% and a gross ton mile increase of 4%. As Don referenced, we've been

able to manage 9% increase in intermodal volume, with only a 1% increase in crew starts.
Coal volumes decreased 4%, but we were able to achieve an 11% reduction in crew starts. And similarly, despite
general merchandise volumes being flat, we were able to reduce crew starts by 2%. Concurrently, we've reduced T&E
overtime by 9%, in addition to a re-crew reduction of 5% over the same period last year.
Velocity-driven equipment rents have been reduced 4%, while carloads per locomotive have improved 6% and gross
ton miles per gallon have improved 2%. We continue to manage our manpower and asset base commensurate with our
traffic volumes and improvements in our network velocity. Our active T&E workforce stands at 11,540, a nearly 6%
reduction over last year. At the end of the quarter we had approximately 600 employees furloughed or on retention
boards within the transportation and mechanical departments. From an asset perspective we had 239 locomotives in
storage along with approximately 8,500 freight cars.
In addition to the velocity and productivity improvements that we reviewed on the previous slide, we will continue to
adjust the manpower and asset base commensurate with our traffic volumes. As I mentioned last quarter, we're also
pursuing opportunities to right-size the network.
Turning to the next slide. This is a great example of a right-sizing opportunity: the closure of the Roanoke, Virginia
Hump operation. Enabled by network velocity, efficiency and changing traffic flows on February 25, we ceased
humping operations at Roanoke. Traffic once handled at Roanoke was redistributed to other yards, utilizing existing
capacity without impacting network velocity.
Along with the projects I outlined last quarter and with additional initiatives like Roanoke, we are solidly on track to
meet and exceed our $100 million expense saving target for 2013. Thank you.
And now, John, I'll turn it over to you.
John P. Rathbone
Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the first quarter. Let's start with a summary of our revenue.
As Don described, our 2013 railway operating revenue of $2.7 billion was the second highest first quarter revenues on
record. Total revenues declined $51 million or 2% compared to last year's $2.8 billion first quarter record. Fuel revenue
of $274 million were $51 million less than last year and we experienced an unfavorable fuel lag of $23 million during
the quarter.
Slide 3, displays our total operating expenses, which increased slightly for the quarter. The resulting $691 million of
operating income was down 7% compared to 2012 and our operating ratio increased 1.5 points to 74.8%. Both
measures rank as second best first quarter operating results.
Turning to our expenses. The next slide shows the components of the $3 million increase and I'll go over each of the
components in detail.
As displayed on Slide 5, fuel expense increased by $16 million or 4%, driven largely by higher diesel fuel consumption
and prices. Diesel fuel usage grew 2%, relative to a 4% increase in gross ton miles, a reflection of operating efficiencies
and ongoing fuel saving initiatives. Our diesel fuel price for the quarter decreased to $3.19 or 1%.
Depreciation expense increased by $3 million or 1%, reflecting slightly lower depreciation rates, resulting from a
recently completed equipment study that partially offset the effect of a larger capital base. The new rates reduced
depreciation expense by $8 million this quarter. This favorable effect will continue for the remainder of the year.
Purchased services and rents increased by $2 million, reflecting higher professional fees, and increased automotive and
joint facility costs that offset lower engineering and [ph] hauling (19:41) services. Equipment rents decreased slightly
due to improved network performance, which more than offset the effect of increased intermodal volumes.

Materials and others fell $12 million or 5%, due primarily to reduced equipment and roadway material usage from
lower repair activity, which should increase as the year unfolds. Also, for the remainder of the year, we anticipate
higher casualty expenses as we lap the favorable personal injury claims development we described in the second and
fourth quarter of last year.
Next, compensation and benefits decreased by $6 million or 1%. Reduction in employee activity levels reflecting
improved productivity and reduced payroll taxes more than offset $15 million of increased pay rates.
Turning to our non-operating items, other income is up $106 million, including a $97 million land sale gain in
Michigan. This involved the sale of 135 miles of track to the State of Michigan for high-speed passenger service.
Returns on company-owned life insurance were up $7 million, and interest expense on debt was up by $9 million due
to increased net borrowing. Income before income taxes increased $43 million or 7%, due primarily to higher
non-operating income, partly offset by lower operating income.
Excluding the land sale, pre-tax income would have been $600 million or 8% lower. Income taxes totaled $247 million
and the effective tax rate was 35.4%, compared to 37.3% in 2012. The decrease was primarily related to a $9 million
retroactive benefit from January's tax law changes.
Net income from the quarter was $450 million, an increase of $40 million or 10% compared to 2012. Diluted earnings
per share were $1.41, up $0.18 or 15% compared to last year. As noted earlier, our first quarter record results included
the land sale in Michigan that generated net income of $60 million and increased earnings per share by $0.19.
As shown on the next slide, cash from operations covered are capital spending and produced $344 million in free cash
flow. Cash from operation was amplified in the first quarter of 2012 as accounts payable returned to normal levels. We
accelerated payments at the end of 2011 as a part of our SAP implementation. Our 2013 free cash flow supported $157
million in dividends and $33 million of share repurchases.
Last year's results included higher share repurchases as well as proceeds from borrowings. Our first quarter 2013 share
repurchases reflected a cautious approach as we weighed uncertainties in Washington. As the economy continues to
grow, for the remainder of the year, we intend to increase share purchases.
We remain confident in our ability to generate free cash flow and access debt markets. We will continue to prioritize
investing in our business, committing to our dividend and applying incremental cash towards share repurchases, guided
of course by our economic outlook.
Thank you for your attention. I'll now turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, John. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern had a good first quarter this year with near record operating
income and operating ratio, even in the face of continued significant weakness in our coal business. As I've said
previously, coal continues to be the wild card in our business outlook, although we do see some signs of stability, with
gas prices now at $4 plus per million BTUs, slow growth in generation demand, and the price of met coal stabilizing
and possibly even starting to tick up.
On the intermodal side, we're continuing to see growth in our business, driven in part by the completion of most of our
Crescent Corridor infrastructure, along with a great service product. And as Don told you the outlook for our
merchandise business is somewhat mixed, but with some anticipated growth in three of the five business groups.
In general, we see an economy that will continue to grow, albeit at a slow pace. As I stated at the outset, the other big
story at Norfolk Southern continues to be the level of our network operations. As Mark told you, our first quarter 2013
metrics exceeded the first quarter of 2012, even with more adverse weather conditions. The economies we are
recognizing as a result are significant, and at the same time our customers are receiving a constantly improving service
product, which will help drive further volume growth and pricing improvement.

As I've stated many times, at Norfolk Southern we believe that superior service, going hand-in-hand with a focus on
safety and operating efficiency, are the best ways to grow our volumes and revenues, which in turn will drive
increasing returns for our shareholders. We're confident in our strategy and our ability to execute it. And our first
quarter results are a strong indication that it's working.
Thanks. And I'll now turn it over to the operator to field your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In order for everyone to have an opportunity to participate, please limit your
inquiries to one primary and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of
Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Oh. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the
decline in the yield in coal, maybe just bracketing how much of that is associated with the change in mix versus how
much is the reductions you had to take in price for export coal?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good afternoon, Chris. This is Don. As we discussed in the calls in the past over the last few
quarters, our met coal pricing has been adjusted downward to reflect the world market, which, as you know, declined
from $330 per ton down to $160. It has improved back up to $170, but we're still in the range of 25% to 30% declines
year-over-year in met coal pricing, and we will continue to face those headwinds until we clear part of the second
quarter, as we complete the second quarter.
Also, with respect to mix, we handled 2 million tons of export thermal coal in the first quarter versus about 600,000
tons of thermal coal handled in the first quarter of 2012. It's good business for us, but it is lower revenue per car –
lower revenue per ton than the met coal, as you know.
The other moving parts that I mentioned in my remarks was our longer haul southern utility business was down 16% in
the quarter. Our northern utility coal was only down 3%. And as we've discussed in the past, the revenue per car
differential of those two books of business is 50%. So it's material.
One other quick comment, a little color, Chris, hopefully, that will answer your question fully, our utility business for
the quarter, 31% of that book was shorter haul utility business in Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana, and averaged only about
25% to 30% of our normal revenue per unit of utility coal as a whole.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. That's really helpful. I had just one quick follow-up, not to give you a hard time, but can
you just talk about the rationale behind not buying back stock and waiting to see what's happening in Washington. I
mean, you've got a very strong balance sheet. You generated a lot of cash flow in the quarter and now the stock's 20%
higher than it was three, four months ago. So maybe you've missed out on an opportunity. Can you just take us through
your rationale there?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: Yeah, as we finished the – as you know, you have to use a planned purchase. And as we
looked at the fiscal cliff, one of the issues, as we slowed down purchases going into the fiscal cliff, because of the way
those programs work, we were precluded from entering the market until after earnings release in January. So the whole
month of January was basically lost to us as far as purchases. Then we reentered the market. Our intention, but albeit at
a lower rate – and you're quite right, we did miss certainly a buying opportunity during that at very favorable pricing.
But going forward, we expect to resume our share repurchases at more historic levels.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Thanks, good afternoon. Maybe just sticking on coal, can you talk a little bit about where
inventories kind of ended the quarter? Maybe where you think we are kind of in April with the utilities?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good afternoon, Chris. Our utility stockpiles we ended the quarter with 41 days on average
through the network. That's about a 7.5% reduction from the fourth quarter.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay. And relative to normals, how does that look?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The northern utilities in our network are normalized now. We are approaching normal
throughout the north. The stockpiles have been pulled down. The weather's been colder through the Midwest and
Northeast. Our southern utilities are still marginally above target.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the coal to gas switching or maybe gas
back to coal. With prices above $4, I know on the average and maybe a little bit higher in some cases on the breakpoint
between the two, but have you seen any kind of marginal demand come back to coal from gas?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yes we have, Chris. The NYMEX delivered price of gas is now $4.25 – $4.25 per million
BTU for May. And the shoulder months of March and April have been fairly cold, so we've seen demand – electricity
production continue fairly strong or at least an uptick in it. So with those gas prices and the pulldown in gas storage, we
have seen marginal dispatch of coal in our network pick up.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good afternoon. And I wanted to ask you one on the export coal side. I guess if I
look at the coal stocks, in general, they haven't been so healthy recently, so that would kind of give me concern about
the coal market. And I'm trying to figure out how to interpret your comments. I think, Don, you said that your pricing
on export coal, on met would be up a little bit, which obviously is favorable. But it seems like you're also saying maybe
tonnage is down. So I was just wondering if you could provide some more comments on how you look at the met
export market and kind of tonnage and pricing, in say, second quarter versus first?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, I'd be glad to. We see the second quarter met coal pricing being marginally better than
the fourth quarter and first quarter. There's been an uptick, as I mentioned, back up into the mid $170s on worldwide
met coal prices. The spot increases we took for a quarter, April 1 for the second quarter, I will tell you were very
modest.
So on met coal, in general, continued headwinds with respect to demand. We do see a little bit of slowing of demand in
Asia. So we expect met coal pricing to hold, but we certainly don't see it rebounding.
Now with respect to thermal coal, the API 2 Index into Europe got as low as $82. It's moved back up to the $86 range,
$86 per ton, so it's recovered somewhat. We still see opportunities for thermal coal exports in the second quarter
moving through the year, probably not at the 2 million ton level that we handled in the first quarter though.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: So how would you think about the met tonnage in second versus, met export in second
versus first? Is it kind of similar? Or what would you think about the tonnage side?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I would say that we see some softening in the second quarter versus the first.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. And can you offer an overall comment on pricing. I guess if I look at some of
your other yield lines setting aside coal, they were probably a little weaker than I might have anticipated. Paper and

clay was down, chemicals was down, maybe that's mix, intermodal was down a touch, but how do you view the overall
pricing environment outside of the coal market?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Pricing market remains solid, Tom. Let me take one business group and give you some color
in the merchandise area, which may help with your question. And I'll take the chemical group. In chemicals, as I
mentioned, we handled about 13,000 carloads of crude oil in the quarter, a substantial increase; that's very good
business for us. But it is not moving at the average revenue per unit for chemicals as a whole. Also, we had a
polypropylene movement out of Chicago that was high rated that is no longer moving. That will be a negative comp for
chemicals at about $6 million per quarter for the balance of 2013.
So when you look at chemicals and look at RPU, just those two things, if you take those into account, and it starts to
explain how the RPU looks versus the overall pricing, which continues – pricing continues to be solid.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Great. Thanks for the time.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna International. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Thank you. Just looking at the coal business, which seems to have stabilized at a run rate of, I
don't know, 25,000 to 27,000 carloads a week and while that's a far cry from the 33,000 to 34,000, you were at several
years ago, it seems as if things have bottomed, which as we know is the first and the most important step. Is you sense
that that 26,000 or 27,000 run rate – I know there's a lot of moving parts and pieces in it – is it substantial enough
baseline for you to move off of and drive the cost savings?
I guess, you'd – someone answered the question earlier with the $100 million target and your confidence around the
cost savings there. But maybe if you could just talk about is your sense that the absolute coal traffic on the network
today is roughly where it's going to be, at least for the foreseeable future? And what gives you confidence in your
targets on the $100 million in expense take out?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: With respect to where the coal market is, it appears to us that we are approaching or we are at
the bottom of the trough possibly. And as you well said, there are a lot of moving parts in that, a lot of changes in
length of haul. So as southern utility coal is down double-digits, 16%, northern utility coal, down only 3%. And then
we have a lot of our utility coal as a total moving shorter haul up in the Midwest. It's good business and we're getting
rapid turns on the equipment, so revenue per asset is very high.
And as Mark mentioned we had a 4% decline in volume and 11% reduction in crew starts for the coal business. So we
are seeing some operating leverage and cost leverage in the way we're managing that book of business. So we think we
are seeing a bottom here.
One of things that we also think we're seeing is natural gas production in terms of rig counts going to a level that might
support $4 to $5 gas. And if we stay in that $4 to $5 per million BTU gas range, coal is going to dispatch at a higher
rate than we saw it dispatch in 2012.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Got it. And my follow-up would be simply the other piece of the puzzle here in terms of traffic
mix being intermodal. To be able to grow volumes 9% on top of – I think you said crew starts were up a percent or so
demonstrates, I think...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: 1%

<Q - Matthew Troy>: Yep, some of the leverage there. Could you talk about just intermodal network capacity? And I
know you said you're at 95% double-stacked. But whether it's train length or whether you can drive it through better
yard productivity handling and asset turns, how much more intermodal business do you think you could handle without
adding significant resources to the network? Thank you.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah. Let me take a stab at this. This is Mark. Keeping in mind that, of course, we've got
some intermodal trains out there that are upwards of 10,000 feet long. But on the average, those trains are more in the
neighborhood of 5,500 feet. So you can see that there are a lot of trains that have a lot of capacity. And when you look
at the good story of these intermodal terminals that have been newly built and expanded and we're in the process of
growing the business in those, that's just a great opportunity to fill those trains out.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Understood. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - William Greene>: Yeah. Hi, there. Good afternoon. Don, did you mention – I might have missed this, but were
there any liquidated damages or take-or-pay revenues that occurred this quarter that we need to think about as we
model forward?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good afternoon, Bill. No, we did not have liquidated damages revenue in the quarter.
<Q - William Greene>: Okay. Do you expect to have any going forward? Would this be something that it'll be
material enough that we should be modeling it?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No.
<Q - William Greene>: Okay. And then, Wick, I'm hoping we can get your views on the trade-off between kind of
volumes and price? We've talked a long time in the rail industry about inflation plus pricing and clearly Norfolk's
having success kind of winning share, if you will, or getting the volume whether it's from new customers starting on
your lines or what not. But if we look at the OR metric, Norfolk for a long time was sort of top of industry. That's
slipped a little bit. There's some mix effect there. But maybe you can talk a little bit about price and volume and how
you think about that? And getting back toward the top of the industry on margin, how you think about these things
that'd be helpful?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well. When my good friend Don and I talk about the trade-offs between volume and
price, we always end up saying we want both. And I will tell you that we are very rigorous in our thinking about
margin and about price whenever we are pursuing new business or for that matter renewing a contract with current
business. And I think we'll be able to continue to do that in the future successfully if, at least in part – and substantial
part, because we are really giving our customers a very, very good product.
And I will say parenthetically that over the past year the number of our customers that I meet, and I meet a lot of them
who have just, without any prompting at all, started to talk about how well we are doing for them is really
unprecedented in my career.
So I think that we have that capacity to do both. But I do think that you raise a good point and something we have to
think about with our franchise, which is that we have a different mix, every franchise is different. We clearly have a big
intermodal business, which has a different operating ratio set of characteristics than coal. We like our intermodal
business. We think there are great opportunities out there and they're great opportunities at prices and at margins that
will ensure that we earn an adequate return and grow our income.

And those are the two goals that we always have in mind. We have to earn an adequate return obviously, first of all.
But then we want to grow our operating income and our earnings per share, and we see the intermodal business as one
of the levers that we can continue to pull to do so. So in terms of getting to where we rate with other folks in terms of
overall operating margin, I think you have to take mix into account. But I can assure you we're focused on getting the
right price, continuing to grow volume and grow our earnings at good levels of return.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit here on
the intermodal question. You've painted both [ph] USX (43:20) and yourselves have painted a nice picture of the
conversion opportunity from truck. Many of the factors that have led to that conversion have been around for a while,
but we really are seeing it pick up now, and I think it's on the basis of your improved service offering and the capacity
you've built out there. When you look at that opportunity, it's still a really big number that you've identified as a
potential conversion. Can you talk to us about your strategy on how to convert that over to rail? And is this something
that we continue to see high rates in the early days? Or is it more of a longer-term, kind of grind away at it over a
number of years?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we think there's clearly a very large opportunity and let me just kind of take as
a microcosm of the way we think about the world. You're very familiar all of you I know with our Crescent Corridor
initiative. That set of initiatives, which includes new capacity and new services, a number of which we turned on early
this year, is aimed at a truckload market that today is running between 5 million and 6 million truckloads per year, out –
moving between the south and the southwest to the north and the northeast.
Our initial efforts are targeted at trying to pick up about a million of those loads. But when we're successful doing that,
we can continue to add capacity. We can continue to add infrastructure. And we think this is a long-term game in terms
of converting truckload traffic to the rails for all of the reasons that we've talked about before. Our – the issues with the
highways and congestion; the very significant issues that many truckload carriers have finding drivers.
Our economies and our emissions and all of things that make us a – in many ways to many of our customers, a more
desirable way to ship. So we think this is a long-term growth opportunity for us, and we're going to continue to pursue
it aggressively.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And as you build density, I think, density's a really important part of that game and I think
whereas intermodal has been an average contributor from a profitability standpoint that would indicate that it's going to
get obviously better than average. Can you talk to us without talking about profitability – I know you're careful around
there – but just as an improvement? Is this something that improves slightly compared to historical? Or are we seeing a
big step function in profit improvement as you build density?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I don't think it's a single big step function. But there is absolutely no doubt that
the more units we put over the network, particularly as we do it efficiently in terms of crew starts and the like, the
profitability of the traffic improves. The other thing which Don talked to you about, which I think is very important
over the long-term is all of the other initiatives on this productivity side that we have involved in our intermodal
network today.
Certainly the more efficient use of equipment is good, and we have seen margin improvement as a result. We have
more initiatives out there. So I would tell you that, while we're always working on our, not only the profitability of
intermodal, the profitability of all of our traffic, we will continue to see it rise. And certainly growing volume while
managing costs will be a significant component of margin improvement.

<Q - Walter Spracklin>: That's great. Just a quick housekeeping, if I may? Mark, you were guiding us down for
employee head count toward the end of the year. You've had a good – you declined a little bit here again in the first
quarter. Should we consider this to be the staffing level you're comfortable with through the year? Or do we see further
declines from this point?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We'll see a little bit more decline as the year goes on. Our T&E probably is going to stabilize
at around the number we are right now. And as I think I mentioned on the last call, our engineering department, we've
got an initiative to reduce throughout the year about 300 people. So not a lot, but reduction throughout the year from
attrition in engineering.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. Wick, I just wanted to follow-up with some
comments that you had following Bill Greene's question there. Obviously, a lot of railroads are targeting improved
profitability across North America. But it sounds like there's some different OR's on the business on the East Coast.
Does that mean structurally that the East Coast carriers just aren't going to be able to see as much improvement that's
targeted in the other regions of North America for railroad performance?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, I wouldn't say that. I think internally we have targets for improved profitability,
just like all of the other carriers. The railroads are a franchise business and every one of these franchises is different in
terms of where we go, who we serve and the breakdown of our relative lines of business. But we have good goals for
improved profitability and we're pursuing them. And I wouldn't say that we would compare unfavorably to other folks.
The other difference, if you're comparing the East to West, is clearly length of haul. And that has some impacts on the
financial side as well.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, and maybe I can just follow-up on that. Wick, your intermodal pricing –
obviously, there's a lot of mix shifting across your book of business. But we've heard that intermodal rates are just
harder to get up in this environment with trucking struggling to get rate increases with their customers. Is this just an
investment phase that we should view Norfolk really building out the density of the network and pricing will come on
the back-end?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, let me say that obviously – and I'll let Don comment on it too – obviously,
we're in a slightly different business in most of our intermodal activities in that we're a wholesale function working
with some terrific partners. So that has an impact on pricing as well. And, clearly, as you mentioned and Don has
shown this to you before, the world of truckload pricing has a big, big effect on what happens in the intermodal world.
But Don?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, truckload pricing continues to evolve. We have the hours of service changes that are
pending that more than likely they look like they will be applied in July, that could take out as much as 5% productivity
out of the current truckload driver base, which we think will start to move truckload prices later in this year.
Something though that hasn't come up in this last couple of questions is we were talking about highway conversions,
but I want to remind everyone on the call that we also have a very healthy portfolio of international business....
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Right.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Which was up 13% in the first quarter; our domestic business was up 7% . So the
international business is very good business for us as well. It is lower revenue per unit because of marine containers –
moving in marine containers, than say the domestic freight that is generally moving in boxes supplied by us or one of
our intermodal marketing companies.

So you have to take that into account in terms of the overall mix. But I would just remind you that international
business continues to expand as well. And we think truckload pricing, especially with respect to domestic, will continue
to evolve and the hours of service is something you should look at.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Hey. Great. Good afternoon. Don, if I can just hit on the coal again, just on the overall
pricing. You were down double digits the last two quarters. You noted you comp against the down 20% declines on the
export, particularly as you wrap around April. The thoughts on the back half here, you've got easier comps? Or do you
still expect pricing to be down double-digits?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ken, good afternoon. As we move through the second quarter and finish the second quarter,
get into the beginning of the third, those headwinds will start to diminish with respect to the year-over-year price
comparisons with respect to met coal.
The thermal coal that we're taking on is new business. As I mentioned, in the first quarter last year, we only handled
600,000 tons of thermal coal. We had 2 million tons in the first quarter. We expect thermal coal to continue to move,
maybe not at that first quarter level, but it will be up, compared to last year, and that has a lower RPU that you'll have
to take into account with respect to revenue per unit.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Wonderful. And just following up on the intermodal side, you noted a lot of new – I guess
with the expansion on the terminals, are these new customers? Are these expansion now that you've got more capacity?
Maybe you can kind of walk through a little bit on where the volumes are coming from?
And then just a quick one for, Mark, I guess, what do you do with the locomotives after they're stored for a while? Do
you eventually just get rid of them, same with the cars? Or do you – or you keep them for volume rebounds?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ken, on the first question and then I'll pass it over to Mark on the locomotives. We're seeing
new customers enter the lanes that we are opening up, the 34 new lanes with respect to Crescent. And I'll give you an
example, we are seeing increased activity from the Southwest into the Mid-Atlantic, as well as Mexico into the
Mid-Atlantic with new customers, new shippers that have not been in those that particular point – set of point pairs
with us before.
Of course, we've also got business ramping up with existing customers, and those existing customers would be
beneficial cargo owners like Walmart, Target, Procter & Gamble, Lowe's, Home Depot, et cetera.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Ken, if I could answer your locomotive question. Our locomotives that are in storage
essentially fall into two categories. One is as a surge fleet and that's approximately 100 locomotives that are high
horsepower, ready-to-go that we put out there if we need them for business volumes, or weather conditions, or
whatever the situation may be.
The balance of the locomotives, for the most part, are your lower horsepower, yard and local locomotives. And those
are older locomotives that we primarily use for rebuild opportunity. As you may know, we have had an aggressive
rebuild program for about 10 years now, primarily up in our Juniata locomotive shop, and many of you on the call have
seen that facility. It's a real great asset for the corporation. And we take a locomotive that is essentially 30 years old or
so and rebuild it and give it another life for another 20 years. So that's what those locomotives are used for.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Appreciate the insight. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good afternoon. Wanted to ask – you mentioned that gas has moved up and certainly
that's been a bit of a change and that could be a positive on the coal side in terms of dispatches from a utility coal
standpoint. But I would think it also could mean some kind of resumption of drilling in the Marcellus as gas becomes
more profitable again. Where's the threshold where you would expect to see some of that merchandise traffic that's
fallen off begin to really pick up? And we saw that hit you guys in Q3, so obviously the comp probably gets better then.
But even before that in Q2, is there an expectation if gas really moves that we could start to see some more activity
there?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Justin, this is Don. In our view – in my view, the producers of gas are seeking a realistic
market price. And I think that we'll see production coincide with market prices where returns can be generated for the
activity of drilling. Certainly, if we see demand continue to pick up, should we see LNG exports or should we see more
alternative uses of natural gas for chemical production and demand pickup, we could see production increase, which in
turn would provide us with an uplift in frac sand shipments and additional input commodities to support the drilling.
But my view is that the gas producers are looking to produce gas at acceptable returns and $2.50, which was the
average in 2012, was not an acceptable price.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Sure. But we're not there, so what's the price that you think that is kind of the cutoff in
terms of that friction point?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: As I indicated earlier, I think that $4 to $5 range. We've got a lot of people telling us that $5
average gas may be a settling out point ahead. And if that's the case, I think it's good for the economy. We're
competitive in the world market for sure. The chemical industry continues to prosper. And certainly coal competes
much more effectively at $5 gas across all the basins, including Central App on the dispatch curves.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Yeah. In terms of train length on the intermodal side, I mean, 10,000 feet sounds like a
pretty lofty goal. I mean, how much of your network do you think you could actually get to that type of a train length.
And when you think about the incremental margin ongoing from 5,500 to 10,000 feet on a train, is it right to think that
there's very little cost involved with actually lengthening the train out that much?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Those longer trains are pretty much reserved for our hot corridor between Chicago and the
East. And that, as you probably know, is a double-track and in some places triple-track and four tracks.
For the most part, the rest of our system is pretty well aligned with a maximum train length of about 8,000 feet. In some
places a little bit less than that and that has to do with the length of our sidings. So we're selective by lane as far as
filling out our trains, but keeping in mind that with that average train length of 5,500 feet, there's still a lot of
opportunity, including a lot of opportunity in that Crescent Corridor that's gauged along that 8,000 foot range.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Got it. And then in thinking about the cost involved with lengthening a train from, let's
say, average to that 8,000 foot mark, I mean, is there an extra locomotive? A lot more handling involved? How do you
think about the additional costs as you lengthen out that train?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, that's the beauty of it. You still have one crew. In most cases you've got the same
complement of locomotive power. So as we add volume on to trains, it's a real win for us.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: That's great. One last one, just curious as I think about this crude-by-rail franchise that
you guys have been building out, it's obviously small. Some of the properties fall in Conrail territory. And I'm just
curious how you guys think about the competitive dynamic for any jump-ball business that you may go against CSX

for? And how those competitions will be structured?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Justin, we're looking at our crude oil franchise like we look at all of our business. We're
looking to provide very good service to the refineries that we are working with. We're customizing the service and
we're pricing it at levels where it generates the proper reflection of that value for the service. So we're fortunate that we
serve multiple refineries in the Delaware, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey area, and a couple down in Louisiana,
Alabama markets as well. So we're looking at it as we look at all business, and we're looking to provide really solid
service for the refineries, as well as making sure that we generate the proper value for that.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Let me build on the point Don is making too here, which is this is a business in which
competing on service matters, because these are very expensive assets that they are employing in the terms of the
railcars. And if we can provide faster, more efficient service, it means lower capital investment for someone who's
providing those cars and that could be a big factor in this business.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Great. Thanks so much for the time, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen Securities. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm going back to intermodal for a moment here. Obviously, you
mentioned the hours of service, has some of this growth that you've been seeing in intermodal been because the hours
of service fear in the shipping community? And do you expect that maybe to ramp up a little bit here in 2Q just before
the change?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, we don't think there's a ship ahead or conversion ahead. We've been experiencing
double-digit growth in our domestic business for the last three, four years. I think it's more of a function of our
intermodal network, and the value of our service across that network, and the fact that we're delivering a very good
service right now at a very high level.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: And in terms of the pricing, obviously, thinking of truckload as maybe the ceiling, that's been
kind of sluggish right now and that's at a 2% type range. But post the HOS changes, do you think there's going to be an
ability for Norfolk to take some of those domestic intermodal rates up?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We certainly hope so. As trucking capacity and productivity is impacted by the hours of
service, and, of course, as Wick mentioned, fuel efficiency, highway congestion, driver challenges all of that remain as
obstacles in trucking. And we certainly see a wide range of customers wanting to increase their participation in the
intermodal space.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, great. And if I can...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Excuse me, go ahead.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: No, I'm sorry, please keep going.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I was going to mention sustainability from an environmental standpoint, a lot of receivers, a
lot of the beneficial cargo owners have targets for sustainability to actually put more of their traffic on rail to improve
their carbon footprint.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. That's great color. If I can, one quick housekeeping, I think there was a call-out for a tax
item in the quarter. Was that a $9 million retroactive tax gain, did I hear?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: Yes, it was, based on the legislation that passed January the 2nd.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. Thanks for the time as always, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, guys. Good evening. Sorry to do it, but I got one last one on coal. Maybe if we could
think about the yield sequentially, so we've got the met rates that you took up a little bit in second quarter, but maybe
the met or the overall export volumes ticking down a little bit, and the domestic volume starting to recover a little bit.
Should we be thinking about – just on a sequential basis relative to that $18.50 a car in first quarter, should that be
coming down a little bit in second quarter? Or because of taking up the met rates a little that can go up just
sequentially?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Sequentially, in terms of revenue per car, it all depends on the ultimate mix of metallurgical
coal to thermal coal in the export market. If thermal holds a little bit better than we think it will at this point, obviously,
that will have an impact on revenue per car. I will tell you though that the increases that we took on met coal April 1, I
used the term modest and I will reemphasize modest. They're not large enough to start driving revenue per car in a
material way.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, and you just – it's too early to know based on your – but your sense of exports coming
down a little bit sequentially and thermal coming up a little bit sequentially, directionally does that feel like yield
should be down sequentially?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah. From the first quarter to second quarter, we think both thermal and met will be at a
lower level in the second quarter than we saw in the first. In fact, we think it'll be at lower levels than across second,
third and fourth quarter, for the balance of the year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: That was a comment on volume though, right, Don.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That's correct.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then with the met increases that you put in, the spot rates that we're seeing, seem to
be right now, a good amount below the second quarter benchmark? Are your increases holding or are you not able to
keep those?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: At this point, they're holding.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Great. It's been a long call. I'll pass it off to somebody else. Thanks.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks. Good evening. Could you remind me how much capacity the intermodal terminal
expansions will add on the Crescent, in terms of the number of incremental carloads that that will create? And how
much of that has already been completed at this point versus what's planned in the next year or so?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We could barely hear that question here, but I think you were asking about incremental lifts
across the corridor, specifically the Crescent Corridor?
<Q - Justin Long>: That's correct. And in terms of the incremental carload opportunity that that could create?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: We have added in our terminal network about 850,000 lifts of incremental capacity. Now a
lift obviously generates more than one load over the course of the year. Wick had mentioned a million loads that we're
targeting in the Crescent Corridor. We have adequate – more than adequate capacity to obviously to take that 1 million
loads on, plus more.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. And that's based on terminal capacity that's come online as it stands today?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Correct.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. And is there any way of framing up how much these projects are impacting your volumes
today? And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of if this was a key driver to growth in intermodal in the first quarter? Or if
you think the more significant benefit will be felt when this capacity starts to really get filled in the second half of this
year and into 2014?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I'll just give you some percentages of growth in the first quarter year-over-year. The Pan Am
Southern Corridor was up 9%. Our Crescent Corridor volumes were up 7%. The Heartland Corridor was up 20% and
the Meridian Speedway volume was up 15% year-over-year.
<Q - Justin Long>: Gotcha. Thank you. That's helpful and I appreciate the time.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Quick question on a couple of expanding sectors. Through week 16, I think
motor vehicles, year-to-date, look up over 3.5% and the first quarter RPU look like it's improved more than 5%, both
pretty good. Can you comment on your auto franchise expectations for the mid-term? As well do you expect to benefit
from the new capacity coming online in Mexico in the next few years?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: With the latter part of the question first, we do expect to benefit from the five new assembly
plants under construction in Mexico. We also expect to benefit from new production that is moving from Japan and
from Europe to the U.S., where the U.S. is being used as a manufacturing platform for both the domestic U.S. market,
as well as the export market abroad.
You probably have noticed or heard that Toyota just announced this week that they're moving the ES300 Lexus
production from Japan to Georgetown, Kentucky. We serve that plant for Toyota at Georgetown. So that will be a
source of growth ahead. We continue to have dialog with other manufacturers with respect to potential new auto plant
locations.
And in addition to that, we've seen major expansions at BMW at Greenville, South Carolina; Mercedes at Vance,
Alabama that we serve, as well as Honda at Lincoln, Alabama. So we've got some major expansions with our current
automotive production base, and more is coming from abroad. And we see good growth opportunities ahead in our
automotive network.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. And the other sector I wanted to ask about is housing, finally, improving in some
regions. And I think also year-to-date you've increased lumber and wood products volume over 13% from the prior
year something like that. A strong improvement...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: [indiscernible] (1:11:11)...
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Sorry?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, 11% up in lumber. Yeah.

<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: A strong improvement, but based on what you're seeing from your customers, do you
expect this to even accelerate this year? And I guess not just center beam, but also in intermodal box car, aggregates, et
cetera, all across sectors, can you comment on your expectations for total exposure to housing?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I can't give you a number at the current run rate of our exposure to housing. You've seen that
starts are now approximating a million, which is a good recovery from a low of 520,000 that was the trough. Certainly,
we have a range of products that we handle in housing as it recovers and it's everything from lumber, plywood, OSB,
different products like polyvinyl chloride on the chemical side that goes into pipe manufacturing for housing.
So there is a range of products from cement, chemicals, aggregates, lumber that go into housing that would benefit us,
as it continues to improve. And we're seeing some of that across not only our center beam traffic for lumber, but we
have a healthy cement franchise, as well as products moving in box cars.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And do you think the current improvement year-over-year, year-to-date is representative
of what you expect for the rest of the year.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We do. If we stay at this current level of housing start volume, over the million unit level, we
see that type of activity we saw in the first quarter, we got the favorable comps year-over-year and we will see that
level of growth for the rest of the year.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Just a quick follow-up on the comp line, there was a $7 million payroll tax in
there. Is that just a one-time thing or that's a recurring thing that's going to be going out throughout the year?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: That's recurring. That was – the railroad unemployment insurance was reduced by 1.5% that
affected all of us and – or, well, affected us by that $7 million, and should not – it should carry on
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Great. And then just, Don, a quick follow-up on the coal length of haul, It seems
like you're saying that the longer haul southern utility business was coming down and that was having a negative
impact on length of haul. What else was going on inside of coal that was actually compensating for that because it
looks like overall length of haul was up by about 5% in the quarter year-over-year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The export increase of 21% volume, 25% in tons was generally longer haul to the ports. And
that was a counterbalance. And then as I mentioned previously, we had another counterbalance in the other way with
about 8 million tons of short haul utility coal up in the Midwest that averaged somewhere in the range of about 60 miles
per car.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay, excellent. Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet.

<Q - Tyler Brown>: Hey, good afternoon. Hey, just a quick question for Mark. But, Mark, can you provide any update
on where we are with the movement plan or roll out, maybe in terms of like your gross ton mile coverage? And when
do you think you will be fully rolled out there? And has this been a component of your efficiency gains? Or is that
something we'll see in the future?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: I think we've seen the kind of the beginning of the efficiencies from movement planner. It's
still really early because it is fully deployed on two and we're working on three of our divisions. But we see that being a
pretty aggressive rollout as we continue and we should have that completely rolled out by the end of 2014.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay, perfect. And then just kind of one other operations question, but just in terms of network
planning, how difficult is it for the network to take on maybe kind of a coal basin shift, let's say to Illinois, in
conjunction with your crude oil business that continues to grow. I assume most of that traffic is kind of east-west. Does
that pose any design issues? Or do you feel that capacity is adequate there?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, absolutely adequate there and when you think about that lane, we have a tremendous
amount of capacity there.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay, perfect. And then just – kind of housekeeping, any update on CapEx?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: We're still targeting it a little over about $2 billion for the year.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Perfect, thanks.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: It's been a long call. Thank you for taking my question.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Kind of it's tail wagging the dog, but when I look at crude-by-rail, you gave a nice
breakdown intermodal and how the economics change as you add cars to trains. How much of the crude-by-rail is
moving and manifest versus unit train right now? And as you grow this business at 20%, 25%, 30% rates, can you talk
about where the critical mass is to where you start moving more on unit train basis?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Our current split on crude oil is about 65% unit train and the balance is moving manifest. And
if someone has a car set, where they have 100 cars plus, they generally want to move that in a unit train. We don't
dictate whether it moves in a unit train or manifest. The shipper and the refinery working in concert with each other
does that.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: You bet.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Jeff.
