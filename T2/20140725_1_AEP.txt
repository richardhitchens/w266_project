MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Electric Power Second Quarter 2014
Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, your
conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Miss Julie Sherwood. Please go ahead.
Julie Sherwood
Thank you, Alice. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings webcast of American
Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website,
AEP.com.
Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future
results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.
Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer;
and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.
I will now turn the call over to Nick.
Nicholas K. Akins
Okay, thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today at our second quarter 2014 earnings
call. I am once again pleased to report a very positive quarter for AEP driven by strong regulated company results with

a continued emphasis on the Transmission business as well as our Regulated Utilities. Additionally, our Unregulated
Generation, Retail and River Operations divisions performed well for the quarter.
So the headlines for the quarter are positive. AEP delivered GAAP and operating earnings of $0.80 per share compared
with $0.69 GAAP and $0.73 per share operating earnings for the second quarter of 2013. Year-to-date 2014 GAAP and
operating earnings have now resulted in $1.95 per share compared with $1.44 GAAP and $1.53 operating for the same
period in 2013. We are reaffirming our earlier adjusted guidance range for the year of $3.35 to $3.55 per share and
remain committed to our 4% to 6% growth trajectory based on our original 2013 guidance range.
AEP is allocating another $100 million of incremental capital in 2014 to our Transmission business. As you may recall,
we'd previously allocated $200 million of incremental capital to Transmission in the first quarter so we are executing
on our plan of advancing the Transmission business model. Additionally, ETT has been rated by Baa1 by Moody's and
is now paying a dividend to its owner, so good news from the western front.
Growth in our service territory continues for the quarter with weather normalized load increasing 2.3% overall for the
year so far, excluding the effects of Ormet, the industrial load that went bankrupt last year. In fact, once again
excluding Ormet, during the second quarter, the industrial load was up a healthy 4.5% and 3.4% year-to-date driven by
the shale gas, petrochemicals and all industrial sectors with the exception of mining.
Commercial and residential loads continue to be up for the year as well. Brian will cover the load growth in more detail
later, but we're pleased with the energy transition that is occurring in our territory and what that means for load growth
in the future.
Cost containment activities resulting from culture and lean processes continue on target and we remain committed to
reinforcing these activities throughout the company. We'll have more to talk about on that issue later on.
So the fundamentals of operational excellence, capital and O&M discipline and open and collaborative culture that
defines our ability to meet challenges and finally the focus on the execution of our business plan and supportive
infrastructure development and the customer experience is intact at AEP, and once again exemplified by second quarter
performance. But we still have much work to do as we redefine an AEP that delivers consistent quality earnings and
dividend growth while meeting the challenges of the future. So let me add a little context to some of the areas that you
might find of interest.
On the regulatory front, APCo in West Virginia filed a base rate case on June 30 requesting a rate increase of $226
million, of which $45 million is a vegetation rider. Our earned ROE in the West Virginia jurisdiction of APCo is 5.8%
as filed with our current approved range of 10% to 10.9%, so an increase here is definitely warranted. We don't have a
finalized procedural schedule for the case but we expect it to conclude by April of next year.
Also, PSO filed a non-unanimous settlement with only AARP as the only outlier that essentially keeps present rates in
place with the addition of an AMI rider that increases revenues by over $7 million in 2014 increasing to over $27
million in 2016, so we are pleased that the parties continue to recognize the value of infrastructure development to
improve the customer experience.
Before discussing our initial thoughts on the EPA's Clean Power Plan, let me switch you over to the next page of the
presentation material to my favorite equalizer chart. Overall from last quarter, the regulated operations' ROE has
moved up to 10.1% from 9.9% last quarter. So let's start moving across the page.
Starting out with Ohio power, their ROE is about 14% now but we expect by year-end their ROE should come down to
around the 12% range. For APCo, the combined company certainly masked the disparity between Virginia and West
Virginia ROEs. Virginia is in pretty good shape. Its ROE is around 10.8%, which is within the earnings band of 10.4%
to 11.4%. And as you know, we're working on West Virginia with the rate case so that will be filed and certainly we
expect to make progress there.
From a Kentucky Power standpoint, Kentucky is still, as we have mentioned in previous quarters, their ROE is low due
to the transfer of the Mitchell plant, so while their earnings are up the equity balance is significantly up so it drives the
ROE down. We'll file a rate case at the end of 2014 that'll reflect a full recovery of Mitchell and expect this case to be

effective in July 2015. In the meantime, there could be increases in ROE given there is a mechanism that off system
sales would inure to the benefit of Kentucky Power if you reach certain thresholds, so that should come up a little bit.
I&M, with rate cases completed in early 2013 and strong plant performance adding to off system sales, I&M is
currently earning an ROE slightly higher than authorized at 10.8%. Their authorized ROE is 10.2%, so not too far out
of line there. And they certainly have made a lot of progress in that regard. And it's noteworthy that they've filed for the
additional five solar facilities totaling 16 MW as well, so really a lot of positive things occurring over in the I&M
jurisdictions.
PSO, as I mentioned earlier with the rate case, the reduced ROE is really actually occurring from the O&M that's been
moved for generation expenses during the quarter, so that advancement of O&M of the $60 million, some of that went
to PSO and that's what's pulling their ROE down somewhat. So we expect that to improve as well.
For SWEPCO, it continues to be a lower ROE given that we still have yet to get the disposition of the Arkansas portion
of the Turk plant taken care of. There is work in progress to try to address that situation. In the meantime, there will be
several initiatives that are underway, including a Texas filing to recover transmission costs and then lean programs to
lower costs and generation distribution. But as we go forward, we will certainly be looking after the election in
Arkansas to really push forward with the activities around the Arkansas portion of Turk.
AEP Texas has favorable ROEs primarily because of the impact of securitization but they're also doing well from a
distribution perspective as well.
AEP Transco continues to improve. You probably see a sizable jump there from 9.7% last quarter up to 11.4%. As we
told you last quarter, their ROE would increase, particularly in line with the true-ups, adjustments, that occurred that
were just now booked as a result of 2013 adjustments. So very good progress in the transmission area.
So that pretty well much wraps it up for the equalizer chart and certainly we're making a lot of progress in that regard
and we know what the areas are that we're working on so you can expect continued improvement in that area.
As I said earlier, our lean activities are progressing very well. We're not letting up on the progress here because it is
part of our cultural transformation and redefining how we do business in the future. So Brian will be reviewing the
details around the lean activities in a moment but I did want to point out some of the examples of what we were seeing
from areas such as generation and distribution.
At Cardinal plant, they bought a truck to load all the welding materials in one place. It was mobile so that they wouldn't
have to go back and forth to get inventory for parts. And that significantly saved time in terms of addressing tube leaks
and other areas to get generation back more quickly.
The South Bend storage yard, de-cluttering and organization of storerooms and toolkits so that work times can be
improved. The engineering group created new documents to enable faster response times for projects to our customers
so that it certainly improved the customer experience.
Cook Nuclear is going through lean activities and one of the first in the country to go through that type of activity and
we're significantly already have a reduced targeted refueling outage duration and the costs associated with it. So there's
a multitude of process reviews to eliminate redundant activities and those that don't add value. So obviously we're very
careful with that, with the nuclear side, but certainly it's something that we should do so that we can work smarter at the
Cook Nuclear Station.
Just to give you an idea of the range of the things that our employees are coming up with, at Amos plant, they reviewed
the plant's barge unloading system that led to a $6 million investment to be made but it reduces coal costs by $10
million per year. Very positive.
And then a smaller change, but I think no less important, is in APCo Charleston area, an employee noticed that we were
discarding flagging vests and we started to decide to wash them instead and save $6,000 per year. Now, I know that
sounds small but that's one employee coming up with a $6,000 per year idea and with our 20,000 employees, that's
$120 million. So it's those kinds of things that will have to work indigenously within our organization at levels

throughout the organization to ensure that we continue to get the benefits of the lean activities and the efficiency
changes that we're making. So I'm very proud of what our employees at the front line are accomplishing in their lean
activities.
Lastly, I want to give AEP's thoughts on the EPA Clean Power Plan. From the outset, I want to reiterate AEP's
commitment towards achieving a balanced portfolio of resources that provides clean, affordable and reliable power for
our customers. While much progress has already been made toward reductions in emissions categories, including
carbon dioxide, and while further progress is certainly being made, rational timing and targets are absolutely critical in
achieving the substantial reductions in CO2 emissions contemplated by the EPA plan.
As Administrator McCarthy has mentioned on several occasions and I want to reiterate here, is that this far-reaching
plan is a proposed rule and has yet to be finalized. So as we look at the proposed rule, the current plan is much too
aggressive in many states and in fact is a multivariable equation that doesn't solve within the timeframe given.
To force a change in resource mix, system dispatch and market conditions along with navigating a myriad of
state-related review processes covering many issues while not impacting reliability in such a short timeframe could
result basically in a convoluted mess that turns the foundation assumption building blocks of the plan into pipe dreams.
The idea of natural gas generation to run at 70% capacity factor when neither the plants, natural gas pipeline system or
the electric system is in place to support it is not credible. Or to expect 6% efficiency gains on coal units to occur when
only about 1% is viable, even if capacity factors remain high, which won't happen because we have a forced dispatch of
other resources ahead of low-cost coal, and that's just not credible either. Moreover, to expect energy efficiency overall
to improve 1.5% per year when EPRI itself, Electric Power Research Institute, has determined that only 0.5% to 0.6%
can be achieved annually certainly goes beyond aspirational thinking.
As a CEO, I'm all about aspirational visions but this must be – but it must be grounded in reality. These are state plans,
not AEP plans or other market participant plans, so we must be able to have time to work with a multitude of different
stakeholders, including the states and the EPA, to determine a course and be able to execute on the myriad of different
processes and approvals to make this transformation occur.
AEP is committed to working with the EPA, just as we did during the Mercury Rule comment period, which is far from
over by the way, given 2015 pending retirements of coal-fired generation have yet to occur. AEP was right about the
analysis of the Mercury Rules and we will continue to be factual and collaborative during the upcoming comment
process.
As an aside, speaking of the units retiring in 2015, 80% of them were called upon and ran during the second quarter, a
quarter that was essentially no extreme weather conditions and certainly there were outages being taken, generation has
to take maintenance outages during that part of the year, but it's incredible that 80% were called upon just a year in
advance of their retirement.
Briefly in regards to the unregulated generation, if I could talk a little bit about that, we continue to review with the
Board the options available to us regarding the future of that business and we continue to reinforce the value of the
unregulated generation through market reforms, hedging of our generation through our retail and wholesale businesses,
and advanced regulatory initiatives such as the development of purchased power arrangement.
This PPA initiative not only supports Ohio generation but provides a valuable hedge to customers against volatile
market conditions. Any decisions with regard to the unregulated generation business will be made on a timely basis to
maximize shareholder value.
Speaking of shareholder value, every capital decision we make is based upon our ability to move capital to
infrastructure development, particularly transmission and the regulated operations. For those of you thinking about
M&A, the way we look at it, because we have about $2 billion of incremental transmission projects over the next four
years looking for capital, we made a $200 million "acquisition" in the first quarter, a $100 million acquisition this
quarter at a good return with virtually no delay, no premium, and accretive to shareholders. That's our standard for
investment.

So in a nutshell, we have had another great quarter centered on the fundamentals we laid out for our investors over two
years ago. You can expect us to stick with our plans to be a regulated utility, to drive effective capital and O&M
discipline, and continually adjust to the challenges ahead.
Thanks and I'll now turn it over to Brian. Brian?
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone.
On slide five you will see our comparison of 2014 results to 2013 by segment for both the quarter and the year-to-date
periods. I plan on focusing your attention this morning mostly on the second quarter results. For those of you who are
interested in the year-to-date comparison, you will find that in the appendix. I will say that the drivers we discussed at
length during the first quarter earnings call remain the drivers for the year-to-date results.
For the company overall, operating earnings for the second quarter were $390 million or $0.80 per share compared to
$0.73 per share or $357 million recorded last year. These results, when combined with the first quarter, pushed first
half 2014 earnings to $950 million or $1.95 per share compared to $1.53 per share or $744 million earned in the first
half 2013. Looking at this slide, you can see that each business segment is either equal to or above results recorded in
2013. With that as an overview, let me step you through the major earnings drivers by segment for the quarter on slide
six.
Second quarter earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment were $0.31 per share this year, comparable to
the results of last year. Rate changes across many of our jurisdictions added $0.06 per share for the quarter. The
increase in rates is a result of incremental investment made to serve our customers.
Higher wholesale power prices and the availability of generating fleet bolstered off system sales, which benefited both
customers and shareholders, resulting improved earnings in the segment of $0.03 per share. Normalized retail margins
contributed a penny per share to the year-over-year growth. Weather for the quarter was comparable to last year.
The quarterly increase in margins was offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and other items. The increase in
O&M adversely affected the quarterly compares by $0.07 due to higher generation maintenance costs, an increase in
transmission service expense, and higher employee-related costs, partially offset by lower storm expense this year. The
higher depreciation expense resulted from increased investment in plant, reducing earnings by $0.02 per share.
The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.18 per share for the quarter, $0.03 higher than last year.
Rate changes added a penny per share for the quarter and transmission revenues were higher due to customers who
have switched suppliers in Ohio as well the effect of increased investment. These favorable items were partially offset
by higher O&M expense due to higher transmission, distribution and employee-related costs.
The Transmission Holdco segment continues to grow, contributing $0.10 per share, a $0.06 improvement reflecting our
continued significant investment in this area. From June of last year to June of this year, this segment's plant grew by
nearly $1 billion, a 92% increase.
The Generation & Marketing segment's earnings of $0.20 per share adds $0.02 to our quarterly comparison. This
segment benefited from higher wholesale power prices and lower interest expense resulting from a very low weighted
average cost of debt for generation resources.
AEP River Operations contributed a penny per share to earnings, $0.03 higher than our 2013 results due to
improvements in demand for barge freight.
Finally, Corporate and Other results were off $0.07 per share primarily due to the interest income benefit recorded last
year from the resolution of the U.K. windfall tax item.

In summary, our earnings performance during the quarter remains strong, largely due to a combined favorable $0.09
per share from our regulated segments. In addition, the competitive segments also contributed to the year-over-year
growth in earnings. These results, along with the strong performance in the first quarter, allowed us to advance
spending into 2014 from future years, as we announced in April. This leaves us well-positioned within the guidance
range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share.
Let's take a look at slide seven where we can review normalized load trends for the quarter. As I make comments about
industrial and total load on this slide, my remarks will adjust for the impact of the Ormet load. You will remember that
Ormet, our largest customer at the time, ceased operations in the fourth quarter of 2013. The convention for adjusting
for Ormet is meant to give a sense of how our industrial and total load are recovering in more of a going-forward basis
since Ormet is expected to return to production. In the charts, the numbers are presented with and without the effects of
Ormet.
Before we dig into the quarterly numbers, let me make some comments on year-to-date normalized load. Every one of
our operating companies experienced total normalized load increases year-to-date. The increases ranged from 0.6% at
Appalachian and Wheeling Power to an impressive 4.6% at AEP Texas. In addition, four of our seven operating
companies experienced growth in all three retail classes.
Turning to the quarterly comparisons on the bottom right of the slide, you can see that overall weather normalized load
was up 1.3%. This is being driven by industrial load, which was up a remarkable 4.5%. This marks the third
consecutive quarter with positive growth in industrial sales.
The company experienced growth in seven of our top 10 industrial sectors for the quarter and nine of the top 10 for the
year. The lone exception is coal mining, which was down 3.5%. The quarterly sector leaders are: pipeline
transportation, up 30.4%; chemical manufacturing, our second-largest sector, up 11.1%; and oil and gas extraction, up
10.5%. We will talk more about the impacts of shale gas developments later.
On the upper right of the slide, you will see that commercial sales were up 0.4% for the quarter and have experienced
positive growth for the last four quarters. We now believe that we are on track to notch a positive annual compares for
the year for the first time since 2008. Four of our top five commercial sectors have experienced year-to-date sales
increases, the only exception being the retail trade sector, which was down nearly 1%.
On the upper left of the slide, you will see that residential sales were down 1.5% for the quarter. While residential
results varied by quarter, they are up year-to-date and are expected to be positive for the year.
Turning to slide eight, let's review recent economic data for AEP's service territory. Looking at estimated GDP for the
quarter, growth for AEP at 3% continues to outperform that of the U.S. at 2.5%.
On the upper right of the slide, you can see that economic growth in our western footprint continues to outpace the U.S.
and our eastern service area, which trails U.S. growth by half a percent. In the bottom left quadrant, you will see that
positive job growth in AEP service area trails that of the U.S. as a whole by 0.4%. Similar to GDP growth, job growth
in AEP's western territories outpaces both the U.S. and AEP's eastern service areas. For AEP, we have experienced
strong employment gains in the natural resources and mining, leisure and hospitality, construction and manufacturing
sectors.
With that segue, let's turn to slide nine to see how big of an impact the U.S. shale gas development is to AEP's
industrial growth. In the first quarter of 2014, we thought it was notable that industrial sales in AEP shale counties grew
by 30% versus non-shale counties, which had decreases of 1.7%. For the second quarter, that contrast becomes more
even pronounced as industrial sales in our shale counties increased by a dramatic 39% over last year's second quarter
and our non-shale counties saw industrial sales decreases of 1.6%. This shale country surge in industrial sales is
significant for AEP because 17% of our industrial sales are located in shale gas counties.
The bottom chart segments industrial sales growth by major shale region. As you can see in our eastern footprint,
industrial sales are growing fastest in the Utica and Marcellus regions. In our western footprint, we are growing fastest
in the Permian and Woodford regions, while sales are down slightly in the Eagle Ford region.

Looking forward, we are anticipating significant oil and gas related load increases in our shale footprint. We have
recently updated our shale related load forecast and the incremental capacity requirements through the end of the
decade have increased by over 20%.
In Ohio, the Department of Natural Resources has just announced that from 2012 to 2013, oil production in the state
increased 62% and natural gas production increased 97%. In addition, the ODNR noted that general drilling permits
issued in the state were 583 in 2013 and are expected to grow to 700 this year and to 800 in 2015.
Turning to slide 10, let's review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total capital remains unchanged
relative to last quarter at 54.2%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt, have improved modestly
from last quarter and remain solidly in the BBB and Baa1 range at five times and 20.3% respectively.
Our qualified pension is now fully funded at 100%. This is great news for our customers, employees, retirees and
investors and reflects significant investment in and de-risking of the plan over the last five years. This is noteworthy
given that our pension funding stood at 73% at the end of 2008 and was only 82% funded at the end of 2010.
The weighted average duration of the assets now more closely matches that of the liabilities at about 10.2 years, and at
100% funding, our targeted allocation of fixed income assets rises to 60% from its current allocation of 55%. We plan
to make contributions to the plan at roughly the estimated annual service cost of about $75 million. Finally, our
liquidity stands at about $2.9 billion and is supported by our two revolving credit facilities that extend into the summers
of 2016 and 2017. We have worked hard over the last several years to achieve the financial strength demonstrated on
this slide and believe that we are well positioned for the future.
Turning to slide 11, let's see if I can't wrap this thing up. The company is off to a strong first half of 2014. For the
quarter, all of our business segments were equal to or greater than last year's results, and for the year-to-date all of our
business segments exceeded last year's numbers.
On top of those results, we are executing on our commitments. We previously stated that we were going to accelerate
transmission investment when possible, expand our lean and continuous improvement initiatives, and shift costs out of
2016 and into 2014 where it makes sense. I'll spend a few moments giving an update on the progress we've made on
those commitments.
First, starting with the goal of accelerating transmission investment; in addition to the $200 million increase that we
announced after the first quarter, our year-to-date results give us the confidence and the cash to advance another $100
million into 2014. This increased investment will fund Merc-mandated projects, reliability projects related to
generation retirements and new customer connections. This will bring our forecasted 2014 transmission capital spend to
a total of $1.9 billion.
In regards to the continuous improvement efforts, employees have now completed lean initiatives at seven of our
generating plants with plans to complete an additional five during 2014. Our DC Cook nuclear plant also started
deploying lean earlier this year. Seven of our 32 distribution districts have completed lean initiatives, with six starting
in July and scheduled to be completed this year.
The first of five regions in transmission field operation started lean this month. In addition, numerous corporate groups
such as IT, supply chain, procurement and fleet, and commercial operations are applying lean principles and practices.
In places where employees have engaged in lean initiatives, we have identified cost savings through more efficient
work practices and better utilization of the contractor work force.
Finally, in regards to the cost shifting initiatives, we have accelerated approximately $60 million of expenses from
2016 into 2014. This means that our customers will get the benefit of those activities sooner than initially planned, and
it means that the company can prudently manage with some of the benefits of the strong 2014 earnings have allowed.
Most of these costs are being shifted into the second half of 2014 and include activities related to plant outages and
other customer-focused activity. It is fair to conclude that the company is making progress on its commitments in these
areas.

Finally, we are reaffirming our 2014 operating earnings guidance range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share. We are pleased
with our earnings performance for the first half of the year, mindful of a mild start to the summer and confident in our
ability to perform within the range.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Hugh Wynne from Sanford
Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning. How are you?
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Very well. Congratulations on a strong quarter here.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thanks,
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your comments on the new proposed regulation
on CO2. And I was wondering if I could maybe draw you out a little bit on how you see the rule being implemented in
the states where you have generation? I appreciate that you're submitting comments and that the rule will be changed
but are you anticipating any particular form of regulation in the major states where you have coal-fired power plants?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: So, that's a great question. I don't know that I have a good answer at this point. I'm not sure
anybody does. We're working extensively and have outreached to all of our states trying to understand exactly what this
plan means. And you know, even our generation, we're just a part of each state that we serve and that's why I stress
these are state plans. So we've got to go through the process with them of understanding the generation that's out there,
the commitments made around the generation, what that means to the overall plan for the state response. And some of
our states obviously have taken a very aggressive view in terms of litigation and it remains to be seen how that whole
process will work out.
I think this plan is more far reaching than anything that's ever occurred before. And when you change dispatch order of
units within states, when you change resources within state and give guidelines that are pretty significant, that really
minimizes the other options available, it really makes it challenging for the states. And that's something that we're
trying to work through the process to fully understand.
We'll get back with EPA on the facts that we see from a state-by-state perspective and have discussions about it and
specific examples of areas that are of concern, and we'll have to work it out. But I really can't tell you what the process
at this point. As you know, the rule provides for 2017 and then 2018 if the states decide to get together, which that will
be interesting in itself. As one participant in part of that overall plan, it's hard to imagine how this thing is all going to
come together in that timeframe. And then many of the requirements really hit in 2020 so you really don't have much
time, probably not enough time, to get what you need done.
So this thing has a long way to play out and I think certainly the comments to the EPA are critical and certainly the
EPA needs to be cognizant that these states are dealing with very, very detailed, very complicated issues and also the
companies involved. So, Hugh, that's a long answer, long way of saying we don't know at this point.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: I appreciate your time on that. Thank you very much. Have a good day.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. And also want to thank you guys – I know you
implemented it at the beginning of the year, but for the new disclosure methodology. It makes understanding AEP a
little bit easier to do.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I'm happy about that comment.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: One question on the transmission side. When you're – you did this in the first quarter and
now you're doing it again in terms of updating your transmission capital spending guidance for the year. Can you give
us a little more insight on where that spending is occurring? Meaning either specific jurisdictions, specific transco or
even whether it's just embedded within the VIU, T&D or is it actually at the transco sub? Just trying to tie together your
CapEx versus your segments.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: It's occurring all over the place but primarily in Ohio, Oklahoma and Indiana. They're
RTO-mandated projects, they're other projects, reliability projects, customer connect projects. About 70 – as I recall,
about 75% of the mix was in the transcos and 25% was in the regulated operating companies. So this is all block and
tackle mandated spending and we have a list of projects and it's not like we're just allocating another $100 million to
transmission and say, go find something. We have a list of what exactly those projects are by individual project. And
it's, I don't know, Brian, it's like 20, 25 separate projects on the page that certainly show the detail.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: So does this mean that you're moving stuff that you had planned on doing in kind of 2015,
2016, 2017 into 2014? So maybe 2014 CapEx, you're kind of accelerating the earnings power but you're not necessarily
making, I don't know, the year-for-year five earnings power higher? Or is this an increase in capital spending if you
think about a three- to five-year budget?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: So it is, obviously, first of all taking care of that green section of the graph, the incremental
transmission that we had for the year. And then we also advanced some projects from future years into this year. But
that doesn't mean that all those – there's no additional identified projects along the way. There's a lot of other activity
going on. The green sections were only defined projects that we knew exactly what they were and where they would be
done; and then of course the work continues on continued rehabilitation of the grid from a transmission perspective and
additional projects. So while it's advanced from future years, that doesn't mean that there won't be incremental projects
as well.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And last item. And, Brian, this may be more of a detail one. On the O&M change
for 2014 you talked about, can you reiterate what's the amount? And you said that it's largely going to be second half of
2014. And which parts of the business is that actually impacting, meaning VIU, T&D, elsewhere?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's going to impact all of them, Michael. It's about $60 million and it's going to impact the
Vertically Integrated Utilities and AEP GR in terms of plant outages. And it's going to impact all of them in terms of –
it's going to impact Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission & Distribution Utilities in terms of some
transmission forestry spend that we're going to do. And then there are other customer-related projects that'll be in all of
the segments that we deal with where we'll be trying to pull those costs forward.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: So it's costs that you will pull forward into 2014 but therefore wouldn't necessarily have
recurring in 2015?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, it's really – we're trying to take those 2016 costs out because you know we have that
challenge associated with the capacity revenue falloff in 2016 so we're trying to take costs out of 2016 and pull them
into 2014 and then not have those costs be recurring in 2016. So if it's plant outages, if we can get ahead on
transmission tree trimming that we then get the benefit of that for our customers in 2014 but will not have the resulting
spend happening in 2016 to help us fill that gap.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated and congrats on a good quarter.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Sure thing.

Your next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Listen, I guess just, Nick, just going back to your comment on the Ohio generation, you said
you'd addressed it in a timely fashion and enhanced shareholder value. I guess can you give an update on progress
you're seeing as far as long-term contracting of those assets as an alternative to keeping them? And then with the
pullback in power prices and that sort of thing, is that having a bearing on potentially delaying when you guys would
want to do something hoping for a better environment, particularly after AES pulled their project?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: The way we look at it is the way we originally told you, I guess last year or the year before,
we're looking for certain things and certainly the hedging of that generation is critical, certainly from AEP retail and
wholesale side. We continue to work on the PPA issue in Ohio, focused on trying to bring some sensibility around the
risk that customers are taking on in Ohio. And certainly the market areas that we've been working on with PJM and
others to enhance capacity and then with the energy markets themselves improving on average, those are all things that
help us determine what the future of that business looks like.
And obviously, we're not just stopping there. We're looking at all the cost structures around that business and really
treating it like any other investor would treat it. So it's really important for us to reach those milestones to fully
understand what the valuation of that business looks like in the future.
And then the one thing we have is time to focus on those activities and make a decision. All along the way we're
keeping our Board up to date on what market conditions look like, what the areas look like in terms of the options
available to us. And that's all I'm saying at that point is we will decide what to do with that business when we feel like
the time is right to make sure we maximize shareholder value.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: So that sounds like 2014 will be consumed with – or part of 2014 will be consumed with
making a decision but there's not necessarily anything getting done this year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, so 2014 obviously is a year where certain milestones have to come into play. We have
several. We've already gone through a capacity auction that was improved. We still have some changes that are
permeating through PJM with the demand curve and so forth. We've got other things we're doing and we believe that in
2015, like I mentioned with 80% of that capacity running, it's going to retire mid-2015, so the very real impacts of the
retirement of that generation is going to be reflected to the capacity and energy markets. So that will give us a real view
of what that valuation looks like.
And also from a cost standpoint, Chuck Zebula is doing everything he can do to get the cost structure itself down. And
with the lean activities, the plants are running very differently than what they ran in the past. So all those things are
coming together and 2014 is a year where we're going through the process, determining what the milestones are and
what the options are available.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Thank you for that. I guess just one other question on the load growth trends. Obviously there's
a lot of enthusiasm in the first quarter trying to decipher between weather and usage was a question. We saw residential
kind of taper off comparably in the second quarter. How are you guys feeling about the outlook for demand growth
kind of beyond 2014? And are you as encouraged today as you might have been, say, at the end of the first quarter?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I'd say we're just as encouraged because if you look at residential, for example, quarter by
quarter it was pretty high change in first quarter and then it shows a slight decrease in second quarter. A lot of times,
residential sort of gets skewed from quarter to quarter based upon whether it be number of holidays, whether it be areas
where we're having to – residential parties may be dealing with their loads in different fashions in different parts of the
year because you could have like last year, there was that federal furlough that was done that people stayed home,
residential went up. So this year, it sort of shows it goes down during this time last year.

So it's things like that that will make the residential sort of come in and out each quarter. I tend to look more at the
averages of residential load. You don't see that so much with commercial and industrial load. And with commercial
showing a consistently positive and then in particular the industrial continues to expand, it expands more every quarter,
that's a good thing because we've always said industrial leads commercial, commercial leads residential. So I think it's a
good indicator for the future.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: On Dan's question just on the Ohio generation, is an outcome in Ohio around the PPA a gating
issue for your decision?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think certainly it's part of the decision process but I think the real reason why we're doing
the PPA arrangement, number one, is bring some stability to the generation in Ohio. The second reason, obviously, is
our customers are at risk in terms of the volatility of the market so it's important for us to get some measure of that in
place. It's just like you buy fuel or anything else or a stock portfolio, you're in it for the long term, you're in it for the
short term. Long-term capacity and energy needs to be there in Ohio.
For the first time, Ohio is short and Ohio is going to be a purchaser on the market if it's not careful in reinforcing the
value of this generation. So yeah, it's a big part of the decision process for us because you make very different decisions
about generation unless you have long-term purchase power arrangements whether they're [ph] form at the (44:55) the
base rate or within the retail side that we're talking about. So there's an opportunity there and I think there's legitimate
concern on the part of many, including the industrials. And they should be concerned and that's something I think that
we're focused on answering that question during this year.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Just switching gears, the cost shift from 2016 to 2014, should we think about that as allowing
you to get to the 4% to 6% or putting you comfortably within that 4% to 6% growth 2015 to 2016?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I think all of the activities that we talked about doing, the lean initiatives, the cost shifting
and the incremental transmission spend are meant to have us inside that range.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thank you.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: There are a number of other factors that will impact where we land in that range and they're
the normal factors that you normally think about: load growth, our ability to contain costs and wholesale energy
pricing.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And also keep in mind that what we've done so far is what we've been able to identify and
the prospects of what's happened so far from the lean activities and so forth. So as far as 2016 is concerned, we still
have a lot more work to do. We obviously wouldn't have put out guidance for 2016 if we didn't feel comfortable we
were within that range. Where we're at within the range is a – will be a measure of how much work we can get done
from this year and 2015 into 2016. And then, obviously, in November we're going to give a view of what we see
happening with additional guidance that we provide then.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thank you very much.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning. You gave some good color in the presentation on the growth of shale gas
activity. Is the kind of growth that we're seeing, is this in line with your expectations? Is it accelerating above your
expectations? Can you give a little more color on the degree of activity that you're seeing?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think in some cases it's above our expectations because – and I know I heard the other day
our president in AEP Texas said that we have in the last year put in like 20, 25 – about 25 substations in that territory,
which means we're connecting a lot of load. And we're doing more in terms of transmission. The substation in a box,
we call it, but the skid stations, so that we can connect these customers more quickly. We're expanding that effort
because we definitely want to keep up with the expansion that's occurring. So I'd say it's ahead of expectations in areas
and it's probably at expectations in others.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Stephen, one of the things that we saw last year was a lot of the shale gas load that we
expected to come on earlier in the year last year did not come on until later in the year. And whether that's logistics
problems, permitting problems or whatever it was, it was stacked up and really didn't come in until later this year –
later last year, earlier this year. As we're looking forward, our shale gas related forecasts are actually increasing from
the base that we had. As we looked to the end of the decade, we just had to increase our load forecast for those regions
by 20% given some updates that we've had on some of the developments in those areas.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. [ph] And just wanted to ask you (48:52) about that increase of supply. We've seen a lot
of volatility in local gas prices. Do you have a point of view on the impact either near term or long term just on all this
increase in shale gas and what that might mean for local gas prices versus what you might see quoted on Henry Hub?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, we're seeing some pretty significant basis differentials around our combined cycle gas
plants. Waterford, for instance, which takes off with Texas Eastern at Zone M2 has frequently been trading at a
significant discount to Henry Hub; whereas our Lawrenceburg plant, which is on Texas Gas Transmission zone 4, is
frequently trading at a $0.25 premium to Henry Hub. So even in our own service territory, areas that are not that far
apart, Indiana to Eastern Ohio, we're seeing some pretty significant basis differentials.
When you're in the production area and they don't have the infrastructure to take the gas out of the production area,
we're awash in gas and it's depressing prices. In places where you don't have those constraints and you're pulling from
the Gulf, you're trading at a traditional premium to the Henry Hub. So it's impacting local prices pretty significantly in
our service area.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: A little caution on that, when you look at the volatility of prices, it's a matter of perspective
how much the prices are coming off. It's still higher than our coal prices. And when you look at the retirements that are
about to occur next year, you really wonder what it's going to do to natural gas prices going forward. And even to
depend on it even more with the Clean Power Plan, it will be amazing to see what the effect could be because I think
the price is moving around in a relatively thin volume level. So you see storage creeping up a little bit. Well, it wouldn't
take a hot summer, we'd lose storage if there's a hot September. But when you retire generation, particularly that's
running as much is that generation is running, it's going to move to natural gas and I would fully expect energy prices
to move up as a result.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thanks so much for the color. I appreciate it.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yep.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Not to specifically ask about M&A, but there is in Texas a utility that looks like it's for sale
potentially. And you guys are in Texas. But also you made some comments in your opening statement about potential
M&A and what you were looking for. And I'm just sort of wondering about the potential deployment of leverage and
whether or not you see opportunities such as Encore or what have you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, so, I guess first of all the patent M&A 101 answer, we look at a lot of things. But
certainly when you make a decision like that, it continues to be more of a strategic move. And with the amount of
transmission spend that we have available to us, like I said, with no premium and I fully expect the Texas process to be
pretty robust, it remains to be seen how that process is actually going to work out and in fact, who all is involved with
it.
But our course of action is what we know today and that's focused on the transmission investment that we have
indigenous that we can continue to improve earnings per share for our shareholders. And anything else beyond that
would have to be something that achieves a strategic hurdle that overcomes the transmission spend and that's a hard
thing to do these days.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then I just wanted to turn back to Ohio and this PPA rider. Generically speaking,
what's the interaction you guys are having generally speaking with officials in Ohio and their thoughts about fuel
diversity, what the market is providing them, and their appetite or their policy perspective on potentially going for
something like the PPA rider or what have you, a sort of a hybrid situation in terms of if they want to have more fuel
diversity or what have you or if they're willing to sort of just go pure market kind of thing? Just what kind of –
incrementally, what have been getting from, as you're getting further in the process, from the officials in Ohio?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think there's legitimate concern. Now what happens, I think probably the – you already
have a test case out there with the ESP filing that we made last December that has a PPA for the OVEC generation. The
staff recommended against it. But they said, well, Commission, if you decide to do this, this is how to do it. So
basically they punted to the Commission. And it'll be a matter of the public policy in Ohio what the result winds up
being but that will be a clear indicator and you probably will see more of that as we go forward because there's a huge
amount of generation out there that is at risk. And from an Ohio perspective, it needs to be locked in in some fashion.
Now that might not be all of it, but certainly just as you do with any other portfolio, there needs to be a long-term
approach and for Ohio to depend upon PJM market conditions to preserve some sense of lack of volatility for
customers, that would be a huge error. So we continue to have discussions. And there are obviously others like
industrials who are concerned about it from an economic development perspective in Ohio. There's concern about it
from that perspective. And we'll continue to shake the tree on that and I think that's important for us to progress. So I'd
see that playing out this year.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Any sense of any sort of timing? I mean, you said this year but I'm just sort of wondering
do you think, is it going to be just basically, should we check out the ESP process? Or do you think there might be
another way this might manifest itself?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think certainly the ESP case is a clear indicator because that may be the first thing that the
Commission actually deals with. But there could be other filings that we would make as a result as well.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I wanted to clarify a couple of points. First on the transmission side, on the slide that you laid out for
us, the base case and the high case, so just to be clear if I look at the 2016 numbers, you still have about a $0.06
differential earnings-wise between base and high. So does some of the incremental investment that you've made capture
that? Or when should we see that $0.06 starting to get captured visibly from our side?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, so you should – it's inclusive in that and you should see that rolling through when the
projects are completed.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: With the very short lag that we have on transmission spend, as we make incremental this
year, you'll start to see that in earnings next year.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. Okay. Then secondly, on your Ohio thinking, Nick, as you laid out the various milestones, et
cetera, is it still a scenario for you to look at that portfolio and think of either a tax-free spinoff or a sale to unlock some
equity value? Is that still something you're considering? Or is the focus primarily on trying to make it "as you'd really
like" as possible?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think all those options are still open because we have to credibly look at this business, do
everything we can to fortify the value of it, and then make decisions about what the optionality is concerning those –
that set of businesses. And I think we're looking at that in terms of maximizing shareholder value and you have to look
at all the options when you do that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: If I have heard you right, the EEI is probably not the forum where you'll give us your strategic
conclusion but maybe year-end earnings call next year? Would that be the kind of timeframe we should be looking at?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I certainly would be hesitant to talk about the timing of that. I doubt that we'll be
saying anything about the disposition of our decisions on those particular assets at that point in time. November will
really be a time where we focus on the guidance for the forward-looking years so you'll see a new version of that. But
in terms of the unregulated generation, we'll have to see how the processes move through in Ohio and other areas.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question. Can you just remind us for budgeting planning purposes, what is the weather
normalized load growth you assume for this year and kind of normalized longer-term?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: In our budget for this year, we were assuming negative 1.1% including Ormet, and excluding
Ormet positive 0.1%. Obviously as we've come in hotter for the first half of the year weather normalized, we would be
off those numbers today and we generally don't reforecast what the individual components going into the guidance
were once we get into the year. We have been forecasting negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% in our guidance and we will
be revisiting that as we work our way towards putting together more formalized guidance at EEI.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thanks, Brian. Thank you.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thank you. We probably have time for one more question, operator.
Operator
Thank you. And that question will come from Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks, guys. I'll make it quick since you've answered a lot of the stuff I wanted to ask. Looking
at one of your slides, your date, you've put 36% of your volumes at the generation resources business into the spot
market. Obviously, you've done very well because we had a lot of volatility in the first and second quarter but prices
are off quite a bit. Did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve in the second quarter to hedge out at
better prices some of your load for next year? Or do you expect to run substantially open again?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: They're continually hedging in the market and really those hedges have continued to be of
benefit to us.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: My question is did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve that have since
fallen off precipitously to change the mix of what you might be putting into the spot market next year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Greg, we've taken some advantage of that, but a significant portion of that portfolio is going
to be open to spot markets going forward, probably in that 30% to 40% range.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Take care.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep.
