I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation. Second
quarter sales grew slightly to $6.0 billion with underlying sales increasing 2%. Results were mixed across end markets
and geographies, as slow global economic growth, lower confidence, and suppressed business investment, especially in
mature markets. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 39.8% and EBIT margin of 14.9% improved 20 basis points
led by 50 basis points of business segment margin expansion. Earnings per share of $0.77 increased 4% and free cash
flow grew 18% to $477 million. Second quarter results reflected solid execution in a business environment struggling
for certainty and momentum.
Next slide, P&L summary. Net sales of $5.960 billion grew 1% limited by macroeconomic sluggishness. Operating
profit decreased 3%, as an increase in gross profit was offset by higher pension and stock compensation expense. EBIT
increased 2% with 20 points of margin expansion, helped by lower structuring, and currency gains. Earnings per share
grew 4% to $0.77 benefiting from the $156 million of share repurchase in the quarter.
Next slide, sales by geography. Underlying sales in the U.S. grew 1%; Europe decreased 3%; Asia grew 2%; Latin
America grew 8%; Canada was flat; and Middle East and Africa was up 19%. Total underlying sales increased 2%.
Currency translation and divestitures each deducted about half a percent such that net sales increased 1%. Strong
growth in emerging markets of 6% offset slow market conditions in mature markets.
Moving to slide five, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 6% and free cash flow grew 18%,
reflecting strong year-to-date cash generation. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points from prior
year but improved 140 basis points sequentially after a slow start to the year.
Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin improved 50 basis points, including a 30 basis point
headwind from higher pension expense. Corporate expense increased $20 million primarily from the stock
compensation program overlap. Pre-tax was up 2% and the tax rate received a small benefit from the R&D tax credit.
Moving to slide seven, Process Management. Process Management net sales grew 8% and underlying sales increased
9%, with the U.S. down 1%; Asia up 14%; Europe up 7%; Latin America up 13%; and Middle East and Africa up 36%.
Solid investment continued in oil and gas, chemical and power end markets and growth was led by the systems and
solutions business. Underlying orders grew 3% led by Asia up 16%. U.S. demand has slowed due to higher natural gas
inventory and robust growth in the prior year. Margin expanded 170 basis points benefiting from volume leverage, cost
containment and currency gains. Unfavorable mix remained a headwind due to lower maintenance investment in the
U.S. The rate of growth is moderating but should remain solid in the near term supported by near record-level backlog.
Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net and underlying sales decreased 6%, the U.S. down 1%;
Asia down 3%; Europe down 15%; Latin America up 11%; and Middle East and Africa flat. Industrial goods market
conditions remain weak, especially in Europe with the power generating alternators business the most challenged.
Industrial motors and electrical drives demand remained soft as well. Growth was solid in the hermetic motors business
driven by HVAC compressor demand. Margin contracted 140 basis points as volume deleverage more than offset cost
containment programs. Nonrecurring dumping duties received in the prior year resulted in a 30 basis point headwind as
well. We expect weakness in global capital goods end markets to continue in the near term.
Moving to slide nine, Network Power. Network Power net and underlying sales declined 4% with the U.S. down 2%;
Asia down 6%; Europe down 3%; Latin America up 8%; and Middle East and Africa down 10%. Weakness continued
in global telecommunications and IT end markets. Underlying sales in the network power systems business declined
slightly due to sluggish data center markets. Demand in Europe continues to be a headwind. Sales declined at a
double-digit rate in the embedded computing and power business. Margin declined 110 basis points, as volume
deleverage and other cost increases offset cost reduction programs. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure
spending expected to remain slow until macroeconomic growth accelerates.
Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales grew 7% with the U.S. up 8%; Asia
up 4%; Europe up 8%; Latin America down 5%; and Middle East and Africa up 26%. Growth was strong in residential
air conditioning markets with the U.S. up 23% due to residential construction and favorable comparisons. The
commercial air conditioning and refrigeration businesses were soft with transportation particularly weak. Comparisons

eased in Europe as well. Margin expanded 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost containment offset unfavorable
mix from lower-margin residential growth. Residential air conditioning markets are expected to moderate but grow
steadily in the near term. Commercial and refrigeration demand is expected to remain slow.
Moving to slide 11, Commercial & Residential Solutions. Commercial & Residential Solutions net sales declined 4%,
while underlying sales grew 2% as the Knaack business unit divestiture deducted 6%. The U.S. was up 5%; Asia
declined 5%; Europe declined 3%; Latin America grew 3% and Middle East and Africa decreased 39%. U.S.
residential markets continue to reflect steady demand. Growth in the residential storage business was particularly
strong. Margin expanded 30 basis points benefiting from cost reductions and the divestiture mix impact. Modest growth
is expected to continue in North America residential end markets in the near term.
Finally, slide 12, 2013 outlook. After weaker than expected end market demand in February and March, April orders
continued to trend downward with trailing three-month underlying orders expected to be negative 5% to 0%. Business
confidence continues to deteriorate and global economic growth lacks strength to drive an increase in business
investment, resulting in a productivity trap. We do not see an obvious catalyst to improve economic growth in the next
six to nine months.
Based on current conditions, the revised 2013 outlook is as follows. Reported and underlying sales growth is now
expected to be only 1.5% to 2.5%; EBIT and pre-tax margin are expected to be approximate equal to prior year; and
earnings per share are expected to be $3.48 to $3.58, up 3% to 6% from prior-year. An updated outlook by segment
will be provided at the Electrical Products Group Conference on May 20, 2013.
And with that, I will pass it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Frank. Welcome everybody to the conference call, I appreciate you joining us. I also want to
thank the tremendous support of all the OC members, the business leaders and global presidents, and all the corporate
key staff members as we drove through this first half and this second quarter. Yes, we delivered growth of sales,
earnings and cash flow this quarter, but clearly not at the pace that we wanted to see as we left the quarter and in
particular March. Late March and all throughout February – or late February and throughout March, we saw orders
weaken and now we've seen April orders in the last couple of days and they have continued to weaken. The second half
of February and on, we've seen a significant change in the pace of business spending around the world. Yes, there are
pockets of growth like U.S. residential, Middle East oil and gas, Latin America oil and gas, but other parts of the world
clearly have taken a step back and are waiting to see where they want to spend their money.
In April in particular in the last couple of days, we went out and really pushed hard to find out where things were
coming and the orders came in worse than expected and we quickly got to realize that based on March, based on April
and what we're seeing with also the push-out of improvements in gross fixed investment forecast in the near – in the
most recent quarter and also the next quarter, we clearly see there's going to be a slowdown on our sales and potentially
actually a negative sales quarter here that we're facing this quarter.
Over the last 30-60 days this GFI flip has really has bothered me given the words you keep hearing that things are
getting better and now all of a sudden you're seeing business are holding back and are pushing out their spending.
They're spending money but they're being very cautious just like us. Our capital spending in the first half of the year is
slower, just working the replacements, new products and smaller increments of new capacity, as I refer to that
productivity gap, basically our underlying sales growth right now is less than our productivity improvements, and
hence we don't have to spend nearly as much capital; and I believe every business out there based on the levels of
profitability and productivity are seeing the same thing, we're not alone in that area. Therefore after seeing the March
and the Q2 close results and now the weakest April orders and the GFI spending improvements being pushed out we've
had to reset our earnings and sales expectations.

Underlying sales now – we were talking about being in the 2% to 5% range – now will be in the 1.5% to 2.5%. EBIT
margin will be basically flat plus or minus a tenth. EPS will be in the $3.53 – or going from $3.53 to $3.63 down to
now $3.48 to $3.58, basically a nickel off our forecasts that we had presented in February. It clearly is a step down in
the pace of business. Still growing, still delivering profitability, but the activity level is significantly lower than you
would expect just 60 days ago.
Our asset management and cash flow remained extremely strong in the first half and we do anticipate record levels of
operating cash flow and free cash flow. With our current capital allocation, about $1.2 billion going to dividends, about
$0.5 billion into acquisitions, we now have increased our share repurchase into the $800 million to $900 million range,
probably closer to $900 million, this year for fiscal 2013. It is our intention to return a minimum of 60% of our
operating cash flow to shareholders in 2013 given the slow growth environment and given that we do not see any
significant acquisitions that we must accomplish this year.
The same fundamental issues that we had been working on and discussing in February are still there, but we're dealing
with a much slower growth market. Europe has continued to weaken, more negative than before. We most likely will
be at – our sales most likely best be flat and most likely slightly down. Brazil has weakened but still growing and China
has weakened but still growing. Again, we're seeing pockets of growth and what we're going through right now as we
drive towards this 2% underlying sales growth, which is less than last year's 2.6%, we're having to go and reallocate
where we want to put our money for those growth programs and for the investments that we want to see to drive the
improving growth as we go out in the later years.
We are driving record levels of profitability, EPS and cash flow, but growth will be the big issue.
We will continue to focus on improving Network Power and also continue to free up resources for the rest of this year
to set up into – and invest in other areas for future growth and improve our profitability as we go forward, ending in
2013 going into 2014. Net-net, second quarter was not nearly as strong a quarter as we wanted, but the first half came
in almost exactly what we thought. The big issue for us right now is based on orders and based on the current
expectations of GFI in the next two quarters, we cannot deliver the 2% to 5% underlying sales growth. Therefore we're
going to have to pull back our earnings per share growth and our second half will not see that stronger pickup that we
initially had forecasted.
Overall, it will be a good year, but the growth is going to be the key issue for all of us in the business world and we're
not seeing it right now; the consumer spending business is being very cautious. Our cost structure is in good shape. We
are reallocating some of our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, so fundamentally we're in good shape from a
profitability standpoint and we feel good about what's going to happen here as we go forward, though it's going to be
lower growth.
I mentioned back in November that I actually did expect one negative growth or EPS growth this year and I said most
likely it'd be the quarter. I believe it will be the third quarter. I believe that we'll be at best flat, most likely slightly
down in sales based on a three-month rolling underlying order pace which will, again, be more negative when we get
April numbers finalized and present them in the next couple of weeks, and that will drive most likely lower sales or flat
sales. And because of the very, very difficult comparisons of profitability last year as we recovered from Thailand, the
third quarter profitability is an extremely tough hurdle, and I would say that we'll most likely have a down third quarter
earnings per share and then recover as we go back in the fourth quarter. I said the same thing back in November and
now that we're here, in the order pace, that's what's going to happen as I look at it at this point in time.
So with that, I want to again, I want to thank all the people around Emerson for the hard work they put into the first
half. Clearly growth is a big issue for us and we're having to redirect our resources to deliver that growth and find that
growth. And with that I'll open the lines and take questions.

[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Hi, thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Hi. So firstly, I guess, on Network Power, you called out other costs being a drag on the
earnings year-on-year in Q2. The decremental margins in Network Power have been pretty big, sort of 40% or 50% for
three quarters in a row now. Can you just talk a little bit about those other costs, what's going on in the mix, and if you
think that we can get a year-on-year growth in EBIT in Network Power in any quarter this year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I mean, from our perspective, as we look at it right now, if you look at this quarter, in
particular we did have some very challenging mix from the Network Power systems business in particular as they
looked at a slowdown here in projects in North America and a further deterioration in Europe. We have gone out and
launched as this quarter finalized some new incremental restructuring efforts that will have an impact for us in the
second half of this year that will drive an improvement in the second half profitability, but as I look at the basic
network power systems business profitability, it will improve as it has historically in the third and fourth quarters and
we'll see a little bit improvement in the sales as it historically has done, that's the way that seasonal business works, but,
we do expect continual improvement as the year goes on, and the restructuring has already been launched and that will
help us in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then within Climate Tech, you talked about some moderation maybe in
some of the stronger markets recently like U.S. residential. Is that just in comparison to the 23% growth number you've
called out or are you saying there is a general kind of market slowdown as well in HVAC?
<A - David N. Farr>: From our perspective right now what we're seeing is April was cold and wet and so we're seeing,
you know, we had a good – we had a good three or four months in U.S. residential and now a slowdown is occurring
because of the weather more than anything else. So there are customers who are keeping their inventories very tight and
they're driving back and forth based on the pace of what's going on the weather in the near term and it's not been very
good. Overall, Climate Technologies had a good couple months in orders and now I expect their orders to actually be
negative as we get into this month and next month because more of the weather retailed than anything else.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks. And just lastly, quickly on process, you have a – you called out the mix from U.S.
aftermarket being weak. Is that something you think can come back? It's just a short-term thing and as long as the
facilities are running, aftermarket should snap back soon or there's no visibility really on when that can happen?
<A - David N. Farr>: Historically, it does go in lumps and we had a very long – it stayed up longer than I thought last
year on the North America MRO, there was a lot of investment, as you remember, our process business last year was
up well north of 20%. I would expect that we'll start improving as the rest of this year, maybe not this quarter but the
next quarter, the fourth quarter and going into next year as our customers digest what money they – the capital they did
bring in and they're putting in place and so this is pretty normal, you have the surge and then all of sudden they back off
and they surge again. So I would expect probably another quarter of tougher comparisons in the OEM or the
aftermarket and then maybe the fourth and first fiscal quarter next year getting better.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Great, thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Dave, could I just make sure I understand also, in terms of how you articulated the change
over the last couple of weeks, the thing that really moved you to lower guidance relative to where you were a couple
weeks ago, was it really the April – just what you were seeing in April orders?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think there're two things that caused me to change. I watched the close and seeing how things
closed as we closed in early March and then the April orders and the third thing, as I looked at the push-out of the
forecast by quarter as we're seeing the economics come in the last couple weeks; what's happening is they keep saying
GFI around the world's going to improve but they keep moving it a quarter. And so they did the same thing to us here
in the second quarter, so there wasn't any incremental improvement and [ph] absolute (21:44) second quarter GFI that
we look at, and there was going to be improvement in the third quarter – last third quarter, has now been pushed out
again. And they haven't changed the year much, but they just keep pushing it. And therefore, the combination of those
three things as I sat there and after we put out our 8-K, said look at, you all, this thing is not going to – coming back.
And then, when the orders came in, I said it's pretty clear to me that we have – the next couple months, the next couple
of quarters could be challenging and we better address these issues. That's why.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And the second question is around the margin expansion on the volume. So the
reported number was 20 basis points, but then thinking about pension and the Industrial Automation issue and the stock
comp and all of this, I mean what were you thinking you achieved on kind of a more normalized basis in the quarter
and what does that make us think going forward, particularly as I recall you talking about those price/cost tailwinds that
you currently have and used to have and the question of whether those will continue. I mean how does that come out
and how are you thinking about it?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't really – Steve, we don't go and normalize and taking stuff in and out because you know
what happens is things hit us from time to time, and so we have to absorb that and so I don't look and say, hey, we
really did $0.05 improvement. But clearly we had a little bit higher margin improvement – EBIT margin if you take
those things out. But the way I look at it is, I'm trying to figure out how to improve my EBIT margin all in. And, so –
and that's the way I look at it. So I don't sit here and peel things back to make myself feel good about a higher margin.
We firmly delivered to our shareholders this EBIT margin for the quarter and that's how we look at it; it was a 20 basis
point improvement and that's how we looked at it. If I parse this thing, I can make myself feel real good all the time.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. So how about the price/cost side of it then?
<A - David N. Farr>: The price/cost right now – the price/cost, I mean the costs are coming down; there's no doubt
that the input commodities right now are – what we call our net material inflation, has actually continued to get better
for us or – it's lower so therefore the issue is our costs are coming in are better and therefore the price environment for
us at this point in time, you know, the [ph] Gap (23:57) is okay and I most likely will have a situation, if the materials
stay down there, I'm going to have – pricing'll be tougher for us to get and to hold, because we expected net material
inflation to start getting higher as the year went on, and now it's starting to be more negative. So, we'll be fighting that
as the year goes into second half as people look at the pricing for some of the commodities. So, right now it's okay, and
I'd rather deal with the more negative net material inflation than trying to hold back price than trying to deal with a
higher inflation environment from my perspective right now. Does that make sense?
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. It does. And your typical lead time when you start seeing that material inflation
steadying and the price lead time or lag time for that is – usually you can hold it for a quarter or two or a couple
quarters?
<A - David N. Farr>: You're looking at one quarter typically.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Yeah.
<A - David N. Farr>: Some businesses it's one quarter, some businesses it's two quarters, so it's on average I'd say
three to four months.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay, great. I'll hand it off. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Wood from Macquarie; please go ahead.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Can you talk about your China and other emerging market trends, the 6% growth that you
reported there? Do you think about that as a function of the market growth or is this that your investments that are
leading to outperformance there? And if you could just talk about the outlook for those markets?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we – emerging markets look pretty good to us right now. We continue to make
investments, the emerging markets you could have a good quarter, bad quarter, and you move back and forth, it's a little
bit more volatile – although, I could say the same thing about Europe, but right now when we look at our emerging
markets we see China continuing to grow. We'll probably see China grow somewhere between 4% and 5% this year
and across the board as, you know, based on the markets we serve, doing pretty well, they'll – a little bit less I would
have thought we were going to be more like 5% to 8%, but I think the underlying economic environment in China is a
little bit weaker.
Southeast Asia continues to grow nicely for us, high single-digit. A little bit weaker because obviously China impact
there a little bit. India is a marketplace that's holding up but I'm very nervous about it, but it's still holding up for us as
is the Middle East and Latin America. So overall I see pretty good growth in emerging markets for the rest of the year.
What we're concerned about is obviously now we're going to have a negative out of Europe, which we thought maybe
we'd get this to break-even in sales growth, but it's not, it's going to be a negative and I expect a weaker U.S.
marketplace. So the actual – from my perspective right now, based on the recovery in the U.S., which has been pushed
out and muted a little bit and then obviously Europe continuing to weaken. So emerging markets are going to do pretty
well based on the investments we've been making over the last couple of years.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Okay. And then you also mentioned the rationalization in embedded. Is this just procedures
you're going through before selling the business or is this something that you might decide to hold on to with trying to
improve the profile of that embedded business?
<A - David N. Farr>: We started this process last year and as the market continued – we thought the market had
stabilized as we started our fiscal year but that was a fake and it's continued to drop down as you've seen in the near
term in the embedded customer base though. What we've continued to do is take out product lines and customers that
just do not support what we consider the profitability and the capital needs of that business. So we have continued to
take out business and therefore hurt our sales that we think that just makes no sense long-term for this business. We're
making decisions in this business that are right decisions for either us or whoever the future owners are going to be.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Christopher Glynn>: I have a bigger-picture question stepping back on Network Power. If you look at the
CAGRs you had laid out in February for 2012 to 2015, you'd be backing into Network Power, having the strongest
performance in 2014 and 2015. And wondering just if that remains reasonable or if some of the data center growth
drivers of the past have kind of played themselves out and maybe take a cycle off?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know, I mean in the last 60 days I haven't done a new forecast for 2014 or 2015, but clearly
the spending needs of this industry are still out there. I just think people are being very cautious right now. I still
believe it will come back and it has and there's always – there's a lot of trends going on, but we try to take those into
consideration of both the positives and the negatives. So, I haven't really looked at 2014 or 2015 again in 60 days, but
my feeling is that business will return to growth and as we move out of the embedded power computing business we'll
see some reasonable growth in the network power systems business. So I still say it will come back.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Okay. And are you more positioned now as agnostic between transformerless and more
hardened data centers?
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, yeah. Our transformers product's out and has been now for – since six or seven months ago.
So, we're in very good shape there now and we have that capability around the world.

And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research, please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, what you said about kind of your deal placeholder and share repurchase kind of explicitly
suggests deals are not a priority and that's obviously not a new statement relative to what you said in the last few
months or so. But just stepping back and looking at the portfolio, I mean there are some things you maybe have to do –
change the complexion of IA is probably kind of the biggest one. I mean how should we think about how you address
that if there's urgency to do it or even if there's kind of a practical way to get at that relative to what the targets might
be?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I don't think it's changed anything. I've said in the past we continue to explore different
ways to try to add to that space be it through ventures or going to do acquisitions, and but at this point in time it's not
my priority at all. My priority is to continue the sale and finish the sale of an embedded power computing business and
then finish the stabilization of the network power systems business and then get a return for my shareholders. So, at this
point in time we're doing small product line acquisitions; we're continuing to work on those and we will continue to
work on those. Those are primarily focused right now on our Process Management and Climate Technology and that
will be the focus for the next six to nine months. As we generate the cash, we're going to pass it back to the
shareholders at this point in time. Our balance sheet is extremely strong and if one of the opportunities that we've
discussed in IA comes forward, an opportunity comes up – I discussed this with the board a couple of times a year –
we'll move forward, but right now that's not where we're focusing on.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just thinking about this share repurchase announcement then, Dave, so 70 million
shares, call it roughly $4 billion or maybe more than that at today's prices, you're doing $900 million this year; should
we assume this is kind of a four or five-year process then to get that much stock out or given the liquidity you appear to
have, why wouldn't you step that up?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's because right now from my perspective it's going to be a four or five-year process just like it
took us almost five – not quite five years for the last time. I mean we did one five years ago, same thing. If we see – I

will make one change in that – if we see that the market stays moderate growth and we do not see the acquisition
opportunities and we continue to generate the cash, then clearly we could look at taking that up a little bit higher and
accelerating that but at this point in time I still believe that you're going to see some acceleration improving the
underlying market growth and we will continue to push acquisitions and one of them will pop as they always do. So,
our plan basically says four or five years. It can be faster but right now it's four or five years.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, great. And then just one other final one if I could. So it sounds like the process backlog
is still pretty strong. I guess "near record" means it's down a little bit but more importantly what does kind of the
margin mix look like coming out of backlog the next year or so between projects and aftermarket and how should we
think about margins?
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean the process margins right now are going – they're going to operate this year about the
same level they operated last year. It's not that much change. We'll have a quarter – the flow-through this quarter was
not that exciting but I mean we had less North America. I mean, obviously, with – if we had a strong North America
you'd have a higher margin. But right now, I would say their margin for the year at the EBIT level is going to be very
close to what it was last year, probably up slightly. And the backlog looks pretty good, the backlog actually – if you
just look at it purely, the backlog was actually was flat with last year if you adjust for it. And so our backlog is, versus
last year it was down slightly versus the first quarter is up slightly.
So we have the backlog right now; the question is executing it. And so from my perspective, our backlog did improve
slightly in the second quarter across the board. And it's still a little bit down versus last year when we had – we were
absorbing that obviously the Thailand flood across the whole company. So we had the backlog. My concern is this the
last five or six weeks this underlying order pace and it's not just one, if you look at the underlying order trend charts
where all the businesses are trending downwards and they have been quite significantly and so – and with the GFI
moving out it's pretty clear to me in the near term we're not going to overcome that, and it's just the fundamentals of
what's going on at this point in time.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Doesn't this feel like 2008 to you?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, we're not coming off that high a level. No. I mean, there's been very little recovery in the
market space since – this is like we get a couple good months, maybe a couple good quarters and then things soften up
again, so it's a very tough world out there right now and we're trying to flex around our resources for growth and our
restructuring based on what's going on in our capital so we're all – there's a lot going on, a lot of moving parts.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right, thanks, good luck.

little faster than Emerson?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know if I look at – as you know my feeling is about quarter, it's very difficult. You know, I
feel like overall in the – excluding embedded power and computing, we did very well this quarter. I mean, I know in
Climate we did very well from a growth standpoint. I know the residential guys did very well this year. I know that on
a global basis the network power systems did very well and process I think did extremely well again this quarter. So, I
look at those trends, I feel very good but I look at more – you've got to look over – as you know, I don't count out
performance against anything unless you're looking at 12 months because one quarter doesn't make much difference.
But overall the underlying growth of 2% in total is pretty good given what we faced as the macroeconomics out there.
So it's not enough to drive I would say incremental margins and incremental higher margin and incremental growth for
us at the bottom line because we're running at high levels of profitability right now, we're running at high levels of cash
flow and we're finding – trying to find that pockets of growth and as soon as you find one and you start mining it you
lose another one. So, overall I feel pretty good about it -
<Q - John G. Inch>: Go ahead, sorry.
<A - David N. Farr>: The other big issue is our largest customer has been in huge inventory reduction now for two
quarters, Caterpillar. And that's taken a significant growth out and we understand that and we participate in that and
we're a close associate of them and we deal with that issue. But that's hurt us a lot in Industrial – in that whole industrial
segment because of what they've done with that inventory and that will come out and they've taken a lot of inventory
out of that company in the last two quarters.
<Q - John G. Inch>: When you mentioned orders slowing since the end of February, is it – and you mentioned that it
is broad, meaning it is touching all your segments, did you see kind of an accelerated pace of project activity being
pushed to the right or was it...
<A - David N. Farr>: It's not projects, it's more day-to-day. It started – really – we felt it towards the end of February
and it really kicked itself really hard in the second half of March and we see it throughout April. It's not projects, the
projects are moving pretty well as we anticipated, the project wins, the project closed, the project scope; we see that
they haven't changed. It's the day-to-day spending that we're seeing people being very cautious where if I'm going to
add some kind of incremental capacity, am I going to do this, I'm going to do half of it, and I'm going to slow it down.
And it's no different to the way I'm acting with inside Emerson right now too to be honest.
<Q - John G. Inch>: It makes sense. So what happens if we get to six to nine months out and the world hasn't really
changed from Emerson's standpoint? Would you consider – I mean you have a lot more flexibility than other
companies, right; your balance sheet and so forth. Would you consider more of a say broader action solution to try and
perk things up? Could we say a bigger restructuring action in Europe or something else or..?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't think so, I don't – from the standpoint of picking things up, trying to go out and do some
big acquisitions, the answer is probably not. I don't see it unless I can figure out how to create value. Or two, from a
restructuring standpoint, we've been restructuring quite heavily, as you know, from late 2008 until early this year and I
think, from my perspective our cost structure's in very good shape, we're running at very high levels of profitability
right now. The cost structure – our repositioning around the world is very good and so we're going to be trying to mine
for pockets of growth and try and figure out how to get some growth and I think that gains can be playing out here, it
could play out for a couple of years, you're right. If we see no fundamental improvement in demand or underlying
growth, then we're going to be looking for those pockets of growth out there.
<Q - John G. Inch>: That makes sense. And just lastly, how did your China business do sequentially? It looks – I see
it had an easier compare year-over-year, but what happened to China as the quarter progressed?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think the – I mean – we're going to look at the hard numbers. My gut tells me China did better
in the second quarter. Yeah, we did slightly better in the second quarter.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Hi. Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Industrial Automation, how are you thinking about the business? I know you took a fair amount
of restructuring out. Just from a margin standpoint and you have got the Cat issue right now and that will play itself out.
But when you start to see them grow, how do you think the leverage plays out there? It seems like it's running pretty
lean, your position for some pretty decent leverage once you start to see some growth.
<A - David N. Farr>: You saw last year we leveraged as we came back and I think that we'll leverage right back up
again. It's a business that has from a restructuring standpoint we've got a few things we're doing this year and they'll be
done and so our cost structure is going to be really finely tuned, so I think from the standpoint, as we see Caterpillar
come back on, which they will, they'll get their inventory out and corrected as we see some of the other industrial base
pick back up, we'll see that profit margin pick back up again. I feel good about that. Our cost structure right now,
they're holding their deleverage pretty well right here with the cost structure they have, so I feel good about that but
we'll come back up like we have historically.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: And just back on the M&A, you talked potentially about doing bolt-ons, $500 million or less.
What's your view on that now?
<A - David N. Farr>: We took a deal to the board today for a little bit over $400 million bolt-on.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. So that's still intact as you look out the next several months?
<A - David N. Farr>: The number one – we've been working – we have a pool and we work a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot.
And in this environment right now we've not been able to get a lot broken free. But we have several in the process
world, one in the Climate world we're working right now. And not anywhere else at this point in time. So from my
perspective, we're going to continue to try to find the bolt-ons and court them and work them because in this
marketplace that would be the best chance that we want to get unique technology and new market space and add more
value for our shareholders.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. Then last one for me. What's the updated CapEx number for the year?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know, right now we didn't change it $700 million, but last year I think we did around $665
million to $700 million. One of my directors asked me today what do you think, and I said can be somewhere in
between there.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: They're trying to make sure that I'm not stripping out capital unnecessarily, so there's no reason
– I think we're – our plan is pretty well set. My gut tells me it will be less than $700 million and it will be more than
$665 million.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay, got you. Thanks very much.

<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey, Dave. I was hoping, when you talk about the color regarding April orders, it was
interesting you didn't want to blame it on one geography and a lot of people have been finger-pointing at Europe. But
could you just give us a sense of how the fall-off in orders trended from the major geographies?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't have that detail. I'll be very honest, I don't have that. I went out early and got them
because I knew – first of all, I had a board meeting yesterday and today and we also want to announce the earnings and
set the quarter up for the year. I can't even – I mean, I can't guess. I know what it was like in March but I can't – it's
hard for me to say – I'll have that by the time we get down there EPG stock, give me some more days for that to come
in, they won't be coming here for another – formally coming in for another two or three days, so I don't have that.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Qualitatively, does it feel like it's broad-based or is it more centered in Europe?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'd tell you what, I would say, based on what I saw in March, I would say April is the same and
it would be Europe, it would be some of my U.S. industrials, I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't see some weakness in
Latin America and Brazil. But I think China is okay. I think Southeast Asia is okay. Based on what I'm hearing from
people. But I was – Frank Dellaquila and I just came back from Europe and man, that's not doing very well at all right
now.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: And I just want to go back to your answer to Jeff's question regarding whether it felt a little bit
like 2008. And I was thinking that would be a question that was along the lines of the pace of the deceleration, the
types of orders that are falling off and said your comment was we are not coming from that high a level. But maybe you
can just talk about how much this feels like 2008 or whether it doesn't. And it didn't sound like big CapEx projects are
getting pushed out, but more of the short cycle. But just could you clarify that?
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, I look at – 2008, keep in mind 2008 we had a very strong economic environment
coming at us from 2007, 2008, and then it just – the bottom fell out, from our perspective as you look at that. This one
here is we just started coming back up, the industrial business had just started coming back up since late 2012, as I look
at the businesses. And then they sort of – they came back up at a moderate level and then they sort of flattened out and
now they've rolled. Nothing I see or feel says you're going to have a sharp – I don't see a sharp drop-off, I see a fighting
at low levels of growth and if you even look at the indicators that tell you that you don't see a lot of excesses, you see –
you're going to be just a fighting some negative growth and some positive growth, that's what we're seeing right now
but not a sudden drop-off. I don't see that contraction. 2008, the markets contracted very rapidly as all of us ran scared
about money and so we all stopped spending so rapidly. I don't see – that's not the same thing right now. We're being
cautious, I'm still spending money but I'm spending at a pace a lot less than we originally thought. It's a different feel
for us.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Okay, that's real helpful. And just the last one for me maybe for Frank, is that a lot of the
companies this quarter have been showing a bigger benefit from the R&D tax credit, but yours did not look as
meaningful. Was there anything going on there?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: No, nothing, it's just the usual; it's just not as big for us as it is for some.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we got a moderate pickup. We probably get as much offshore as we did onshore, so it's
very moderate.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Dave, you mentioned freeing up resources to invest in other areas for future
growth. I mean can you maybe fill that out a little bit in terms of what you mean by freeing up and what you're kind of
viewing as the priority areas to deploy?
<A - David N. Farr>: From my perspective is if I see the market improvement delaying in some of the industrial space
or even certain pockets of Climate Technology space, we're taking some of that money and re-deploying from some of
that incremental growth programs back over to process or back in some of the emerging market space at this point in
time. So the business leaders, we set out that $45 million, $40 million of strategic money every year at the beginning of
the year and with the business leaders meet with the OC members and Charlie, Frank, myself, Ed, and Craig, all will
debate with the business leaders and we reallocate, we'll pick the money back out of one area, to the guy say hey, we're
not going to spend nearly this year, things aren't picking up, we should just hold off on that and we'll reallocate back,
maybe into some of the emerging markets or some of the other technology plays, so that is something we've learned
how to do the last couple of years, what I call the start-stop type of marketplace and we're going through that right now
as we get ready for the second half of this year and as we get ready for the beginning of next year. And then things
move again, we'll push the money back over. So that's what we're doing right now Shannon, that's what I'm talking
about.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: So process and emerging markets kind of the two big areas that you would...
<A - David N. Farr>: The two guys right now are getting it.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then I understand the productivity trap, but I guess just from a macro
standpoint, I mean there has been so many things weighing on business confidence, what do you think the current
priority list is in terms of things that are really holding people back?
<A - David N. Farr>: In the U.S. it's primarily the onslaught of regulations coming at us and things that we're all
trying to digest both from I think from a customer standpoint and my standpoint and most likely the customer
standpoint. In Europe I think that the fact that money for the small medium-sized businesses, which a lot of our
customers it's still extremely hard to get and they're being very cautious at investing so – because they can't get the
money from the banks, so that would be the European scenario. China, I think the big issue is they have plenty of
excess capacity. And going back – Frank just pointed out to me, he said the two things that all of us are a little bit
struggling with our customer base is the health care costs are coming at us. It's already starting to hit us. And some of
the customer base is right now are starting to say, they're going to have to spend a lot more money there and then
finally I think would be the tax policy. People are still been hoping that we get some kind of clarity on tax policy
relative to where we invest and maybe we can reallocate our cash flow around the world. But right now we're getting
no clarity on that, so I think businesses are going to be extremely tight with the money and a lot of businesses are going
to send that money back to the shareholders and the balance sheets are getting stronger.

<Q - Joshua C. Pokrzywinski>: Yes. Just a follow-up on the process margin comment from earlier. I understand you
said that, for the year, you'd still expect to be up a little bit. How does that frame out in the second half? Obviously, the
margin comps there are a little bit tougher and then the top line a little distorted by the makeup from Thailand as well.
<A - David N. Farr>: Even on a normal basis, as we look at our normal process trend lines, they historically have
higher sales in the second half and so we still – we expect that to happen – even though if you try to look at comps last
year, Dellaquila's dying on me in here – he's coughing on me. If you look at the first half, the second half, typically we
would see incrementally higher volume and therefore we leverage it. So if you look at our first half EBIT, we ran a
17.6%, is this correct, Frank? 17.6% and then a 20 point quarter to quarter. We're going to be running in the low 20%s
and a little bit higher 20%s, towards the mid 20%s by the fourth quarter. That's just based on the normal volumes that
we see in that business. So I don't see any change there.
<Q - Joshua C. Pokrzywinski>: Okay. So maybe flattish margins year-over-year in the second half?
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, you're looking at that? Okay. No, the third quarter margin in last year was phenomenally
strong. We do not see that at all. I think you're going to see more of the normal type of margin. Typically we see a
slight margin improvement from second to third. And so if we did 20%, let's say you're going to be around 21% for the
third quarter and then typically the volume picks – we usually have a fourth quarter volume pickup as things happen in
that industry in the fourth quarter and then you see a couple of more points pick up. That's what's going to happen. Last
year we had a huge pickup in the third quarter. That's not going to happen this year. I'm sorry, I mis-explained it to you,
my fault.
<Q - Joshua C. Pokrzywinski>: No, completely understood. And then just to follow up on the resi A/C, up 23%, is
there any share gain in there? I think one of your quasi competitors in this space had some business loss. I wanted to
see if that was coming to you guys or if that plus 23% was just pure organic.
<A - David N. Farr>: It was real growth, let's put it that way. I don't comment on shares. But we did well in the
quarter, let's put it that way. I know people think we've been – we're going out of business in our HVAC business in
North America, but it's not so we did okay, let's put it that way.
<Q - Joshua C. Pokrzywinski>: Fair enough. All right, thanks.

<Q - John S. Quealy>: I'm not too sure about that. Process Management, if I could, in the back half when you are
looking at growth remaining stable, can you break that down for us by end market specifically? Oil and gas obviously,
we know the dynamics, but utilities especially domestic, internationally. Have you seen any softness? We've heard a lot
of chatter out of Europe on utilities just shutting down, CapEx in some process. So can you break down a little bit for
us?
<A - David N. Farr>: Our actually utility business is doing pretty well. We're not the major player in Europe. So we
have two companies that are a little bit stronger than we are. And you could probably name who those two companies
are in the utility industry. We're doing pretty well in Europe but we're not the major player. Our Asia business is
extremely strong right now in China. We're very strong right now in China and Korea and we have a very good
presence in North America and we're seeing a pretty good pace of business in North America right now. So we have
not seen any slowdown in our utility business in the key markets we serve. So I expect us to have a very good year in
the utility markets and then when we sell that system, we get obviously, the instrumentation and the control valves go
along with that. And oil and gas we see that to continue to grow. Right now I think, I look at Latin America still do well
this year, I still think that we're going to see a very good business environment for Middle East and Africa. That's been
very good for us. I think that China's going to continue to be very good for us in the second half; our book orders in
China were very strong in the first half. Good sales growth but I expect our China to be driven by our process business.
And Southeast Asia has done as well. I think actually the two weakest for us for process, are going to be Canada and
the United States because we had such strong growth last year. I think see obviously some recovery in both Canada and
the United States in the second half, but I think you're going to see our international business driving our process
management in the second half this year.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: All right, thanks. And then a follow-up, did you talk about ex-embedded what Network Power
margins were or what we can sort of calibrate them to be?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, we've not said that, we've not said that yet.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Are they consistent with sort of the February update of what it would be if you stripped out
embedded?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. Yes. That's true.
<Q - John S. Quealy>: Okay, thanks, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hope to see you soon, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, guys, sorry I messed up earlier.
<A - David N. Farr>: You didn't mess up, I had to quicken the button, I probably cut you off. I have a button here, you
know.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: No, I really don't know how to use a phone yet. My fault.
<A - David N. Farr>: I do have a button here so be careful.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I do want to just ask a couple of things. At the Investor Day, you talked a bit about receivables
and having some concerns about days outstanding extending out, some of your customers taking their time to pay their
bills. Has that stabilized at all, Dave?
<A - David N. Farr>: Improved. The business leaders, Frank, Ed Monser and Charlie Peters, all the guys, we've got a
task force put on and part of it is our own fault to be honest, with the mix in some of the projects and the paperwork
you have to deal with projects, we've created some of that problem and some of it is just our customers using us as a

bank. But our receivables actual, what we call pass-through receivables, have come down from their peak and we
expect that to continue to come. So it was part of our cash flow improvement from Q1 to Q2 and I think that will
continue to be the focus for us in Q3. We reviewed in detail with the board today and I have to say the guys I called out
here are doing a great job and we had a call to action and they did it, and I feel very pleased with them.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I mean you had talked also at the Investor
Day about competition in China in Climate and I think one of the comments made, offline comments was just that it
wasn't clear how share shifts would move around in China. But your numbers were pretty good. So should we kind of –
does that imply that you have really fended off competition there and that you guys have won the battle, if you will and
it's all stable or is there still some volatility there ahead?
<A - David N. Farr>: We did very well in the first six months this year. We have several new products out within the
Asia marketplace both in variable speed and some of our new compressors, variable speed, fixed speed stuff, so that's
helping us. So we did gain in China in the first six months. Relative to China, I never count my chickens or eggs until
we've got them into the oven. And so we're going to keep working, from a technology standpoint, we've got to stay
ahead of this and make sure we do well. But we did well as you saw in the first six months, Purvis and his team did a
great job there and now in North America we also had a very strong start. Inventories were low, we did keep a couple
of new accounts, and we see some new technologies come into play on the HVAC side. My concern right now is the
weakness in transportation and non-res. And we're hoping to see that come back late this calendar year, which will help
us to get in 2015, but right now on execution wise on the residential, on a global basis it was a very good six months,
and now we've got to keep it going.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. And then last, Dave, do you think we will expect – or do you expect at least to have some
finality to embedded in the next 60 days, 90 days or is it more a couple quarters out?
<A - David N. Farr>: We want to drive this to be – to consummation before this fiscal year goes out. So, yes, we're
moving – that's where we're moving, we updated the board today we're moving that way. We want to bring this to
finalization so we can take our manager time and address it somewhere else.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: All right. Thanks, guys, I appreciate you letting me...
<A - David N. Farr>: Hope to see you soon.

And our final question comes from the line of Alan Strauss from Schroders. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan H. Straus>: Thanks for taking my call – my question. You guys have been known to give aggressive
guidance. Would you consider the guidance you just gave out for the rest of the year, give the ability of your dogs
Zorro to even jump over?
<A - David N. Farr>: I've gotten into the mode now. This is the first guy that asked me about Zorro. We try to give
guidance so that Zorro can jump over. And since a couple of years ago when my dog got a little older, so we try to
make sure we can give guidance we can jump over, yes.
<Q - Alan H. Straus>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean the key thing for us is that we've got to get some underlying growth going again here in
this global marketplace, which I think it's out there. It's just a matter of getting it done.
<Q - Alan H. Straus>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome Alan. Take care.

I'll hand it back over to the management.
David N. Farr
I appreciate you calling today, appreciate the questions. And again, I'm sorry that we had to revitalize or reset the
guidance for the year for both sales, but we have to be realistic with what we're seeing now in the near term and deal
with that, but the company is running very well from an operational standpoint and cash standpoint and margin
standpoint and we intend to keep that going and give more money back to the shareholders in the second half of the
year. Thanks.
