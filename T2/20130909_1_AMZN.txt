During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you'll find additional disclosures
regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.

2011.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 7% to $4.18 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 81% to $395 million. Trailing 12-month
capital expenditures were 3.79 billion. This amount includes 1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased corporate
office space, as well as property for development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle, Washington,
which we purchased in the fourth quarter.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting
of investing in technology, infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our
fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 4%, down from 22%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets
minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 470 million shares, compared with 468
million shares one year ago. Worldwide revenue grew 22% to 21.27 billion or 23% excluding the $178 million
unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. We're grateful to our customers who continue to
take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to 6.51 billion, up 8% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to 13.93
billion, up 28% or 29% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up from
63%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 32%. Active customer accounts exceeded 200 million. Worldwide active seller
accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 39% of paid units.
Now, I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was 16.14 billion or 75.9% of
revenue compared with 79.3%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was 4.45 billion or
20.9% of sales, up approximately 293 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was 2.2 billion or 10.3% of revenue
compared with 9.3%. Tech and content was $1.22 billion or 5.7% of revenue compared with 4.5%. Marketing was
$833 million or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.3%.
Now, I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate the segments or
stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item.
In the North America segment, revenue grew 23% to 12.17 billion. Media revenue grew 13% to 2.9 billion. EGM
revenue grew 24% to 8.5 billion, representing 70% of North America revenues, up from 69%. North America segment
operating income increased 114% to $608 million, a 5% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 21% to 9.09 billion. Adjusting for the $183 million year-over-year
unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, revenue growth was 23%. Media revenue grew 5% to 3.61 billion, or 7%
excluding foreign exchange, and EGM revenue grew 35% to 5.43 billion or 37% excluding foreign exchange. EGM
now represents 60% of international revenues, up from 54%. International segment operating income decreased 61% to
$70 million, a 0.8% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, International segment
operating income decreased 56%.

CSOI increased 47% to $678 million or 3.2% of revenue, up approximately 54 basis points year-over-year. Unlike
CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP
operating income increased 56% to $405 million or 1.9% of net sales.
Our income tax expense was $194 million in Q4, resulting in a 58% rate for the quarter and a 79% rate for the full year
2012. GAAP net income was $97 million or $0.21 per diluted share compared with $177 million and $0.38 per diluted
share.
Now, I'll discuss the full year results. Revenue grew 27% to 61.09 billion. North America revenue grew 30% to 34.81
billion, and International revenue grew 23% to 26.28 billion or a 27% growth excluding year-over-year changes in
foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income or CSOI increased 6% to $1.67 billion or 7% excluding the unfavorable
year-over-year impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin decreased 54 basis points to 0.7%. GAAP
operating income decreased 22% to $676 million or 1.1% of net sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased 1.87 billion year-over-year to 11.45 billion.
Inventory increased 21% to 6.03 billion and inventory turns were 9.3, down from 10.3 turns a year ago, as we expanded
selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories.
Accounts payable increased 20% to 13.32 billion, and accounts payable days increased to 76 from 74 in the prior year.
In Q4 2012, we issued $3 billion of senior non-convertible unsecured debt in three, five, and seven year tranches with
proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.
I will conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into the guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to date and what we believe today to be the appropriately conservative assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of
uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not
possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies
amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have a
material impact on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments or settlements,
record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain
approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2013, we expect net sales of between $15.0 billion and $16.6 billion, a growth between 14% and 26%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 122 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP
operating income or loss to be between $285 million loss and $65 million positive income compared to $192 million in
income in the prior period year. This includes approximately 285 million for stock-based compensation and
amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other expense to
be between zero and $350 million, compared to $398 million income in the prior period. We remain heads down
focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting
customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. With that Sean, let's move to questions.

Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question?
Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. We will take
our first question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt, Analyst
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Tom, it looks to us that you've successfully begun a transition of your logistics costs
in the direction of being more of a fixed fulfillment cost with lower unit base shipping cost, given that the growth rate
of outbound shipping is now meaningfully below the fulfillment growth rate. And so the question is, is that something
that we should expect to continue now on the back of this meaningful fulfillment center expansion ramp, and then
separately, but on the same topic, we're also wondering are there other parts of the business in which you can make this
transition to more of a fixed cost in the future? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
In terms of the fulfillment question, you're right in terms of over the past few years, we have expanded our fulfillment
network pretty extensively to the point where we are closer to customers, and you're seeing that reflected in our
transportation costs. You can obviously see the fulfillment expense really not fixed, in terms of, in absolute terms, but
you can see that we had 20 fulfillment centers last year and that's reflected in the operating expense that you're seeing.
But that is a benefit of adding to our fulfillment center network. We're closer and closer to our customers with a lot of
great [ph] selection and so you're seeing that reflected in the individual business gross margins, which shows up as
benefits of transportation costs.
In terms of other opportunities, certainly, there are a number of opportunities as we invest in individual customer
experience areas across the business. Many of those will be on our website. We have a relatively fixed expense as we
launch those, and we amortize those costs over our full customer base. So, as they grow, they become more effective on
a per unit or per customer basis. So, there is a number of opportunities that we have had, and will have going forward to
do that.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth, Analyst
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the shift to the third party, and I guess, in particular, I
think, in last 4Q, you talked about shifting more of the business in the video game space in particular to the third-party.
Are there certain categories that you would specifically point to in this last 4Q where you made sort of a similar shift?
Thanks.

We did see a good expansion as you mentioned in 3P, third-party units as a percentage of total units increased from
36% last year Q4 to 39%, an expansion of approximately 300 basis points.
Our overall unit growth rate for the quarter in total was 32%, and our third party growth rate was in excess of 40%. So
again, nice growth. It is, you are certainly seeing it in a number of areas, you see it certainly in our EGM business, if
you look at our North America growth rates, you can see that our revenue was up 23%, but our third-party -- our total
unit growth rate was substantially faster than that, and our third-party units were growing very faster there as well. So,
there is a number of different areas that you are seeing that, but certainly you are seeing it there.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz, Analyst
Great. Thanks. Looks like you are moving more in the direction of same day shipping. Would you provide any thoughts
or insights here? Should we anticipate a significant ramp-up of fulfillment center build-outs particularly in Q2, Q3 and
maybe, if you can just comment more generally on your FC build-out plans, U.S., versus international? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
There's not a lot I can comment on in terms of our plans. Similar to last year, as we progress through the year, we can
give you further updates on what we plan to do there. Last year, we opened up about 20 new fulfillment centers, and so
we saw very rapid growth in fulfillment capacity last year. And, we'll stay tuned and we'll let you know more as the
year progresses there.
Operator
We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney, Analyst
Thanks. Two questions please. That paid unit growth deceleration to 32%, it seems a bit of a disconnect versus an
active customer growth that didn't accelerate as much on a per customer basis, are you seeing some sort of change in
overall activity, is that the impact of newer international markets?
And then just, on the investment cycle, the last couple of calls, you've consistently called out future investments
whether the 1.4 billion for Seattle or distribution center expansion, you didn't do it this quarter, I don't want to over read
into it, but does that mean that we're at the end of a major investment cycle? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
In terms of unit growth, there is not a lot more I can add to it. We did see very strong -- we saw substantially high unit
growth and revenue growth in terms of paid unit growth in Q4, which -- we're seeing very strong third-party growth as
well, it's up over 40%.
In terms of investment cycle, yeah I wouldn't read into anything related to that, we will still be adding capacity during
2013, in terms of the levels of how much we'll add, as I mentioned earlier in the call, just stay tuned and we'll let you
know as the year progresses.

Thank you, Tom.
Operator
We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry, Analyst
Great. Thanks. I was wondering, if you could give us just a bit of a sense of what you're seeing as you roll out
fulfillment center in to new state. Obviously, the sales tax issue has been one that's come up a good bit, but you've
touched on the impact of being closer with faster delivery in those same states. Net-net, what do you see as being the
impact on, I'm not asking you to give us kind of a state-by-state breakdown, but the impact of rolling out the fulfillment
center footprint taking both of those things into account?
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
I'm not really sure how best to answer your question. I mean we certainly have expanded pretty dramatically over the
past really coming out of 2009, between 2010, '11 and '12, we've rapidly increased our footprint globally. Your
comment was more directed towards the U.S., but we've also rapidly increased our footprint in the U.S. As a result of
that, we're able to carry selection, a much broader selection closer to customers, just with the -- as you'd expect with
this rapid increase. We've also expanded selection during that time period. So, we continue to be in the locations we'd
like to be in, and continue to expand our footprint over time, and become even closer and closer to customers. Beyond
that, there's not a lot I can add.
Operator
We'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster, Analyst
Good afternoon. From a high level, can you remind us the margin difference between 1P and 3P. I know, in the past,
you've talked about you being agnostic between the two, but the growth in 3P, in what your CSOI margin is would
imply that 3P has a little bit higher margin. Is that the correct read through? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
There is some variation by business, but certainly that's what we attempt to do is from a pricing standpoint is to try to
be agnostic, that's certainly how we run the business. Again, this is on a third-party versus retail.
And then, we've also added certainly a lot of other services over the past year in terms of fulfillment. So, it really
depends upon where we are in the investment cycle. What our utilization is? Certainly, as you know at the last few
years, we've been very heavily expanding in terms of fulfillment capacity because of the growth that we've been
experiencing. That certainly will put pressure on our overall cost structure, certainly is on a per unit basis, because we
are not getting the productivity -- we don't get the full productivity for a number of years after expanding. So,

depending on what type of customer is, whether it's a retail unit, a straight third-party unit or an FBA unit, but again,
we're certainly attempting at least on a product basis to be roughly agnostic.
Operator
We'll go next to Brian Nowak with Nomura.
Brian Nowak, Analyst
Thanks. I have two. First thing is on the device strategy with Kindles and Kindle HD. Can you help us at all with what
you're seeing with attach rate trends in digital goods after people buy at the Kindles?
And then generally, do you see a higher overall GMV per customer on Kindle devices than users on Amazon apps
through other devices?
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
In terms of attach rates, it's not -- we haven't given a lot of detail, but, I think, one thing certainly to look at, and it
doesn't give you an attach rate, but, it gives you at least a sense of the health of the business is the number that was in
the release today. We surely have a multi-billion dollar eBook business growing approximately 70% year-over-year to
total year, last year. And that's growing at that rate after a -- to really just launching the business approximately five
years ago.
So it's a pretty good healthy growth rate five years in. And, we're seeing good -- I can't give you specific numbers, but
we're seeing very good progress on a number of our other digital media categories, video I talked about a little bit
earlier, we're seeing prime customers, certainly, the percentage of prime customers who were watching free content
through Prime Instant Video has gone up dramatically year-over-year. We've also increased Prime membership
dramatically year-over-year. They are also purchasing paid content.
Those customers that are using this service, they watch free, but they are also paying for a new content, which is great.
We've launched a number of new services on the music side, most recently, certainly our CD with free MP3, which we
have on many titles, it's still very early, but, we certainly like that service and pleased to offer to customers.
So, I can't give you specific for attach rates, but the business is making good progress on the video content side. And
again, it's still very early.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler, Analyst
Thanks, guys. Just two quick questions. As you guys build out the Prime membership and the SKUs available through
FBA, you're running to the challenge of increasing your unit volume of tale items. And at the same time, you need to
get products to customers in much shorter shipping cycle.
So, can you talk about how the new fulfillment footprint helps on that front? Is your reliance on air going down as a
percent of total items shipped? And then, if I remember correctly, you guys reclassified some FBA revenue in early
2012. Can you just remind us how that flows through the shipping revenue line, and what could happen as you comp
out in the beginning of '13? Thanks.

Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Just in terms of overall selection, as we added to Prime, what I was talking about earlier in terms of having a --
just a more expanded footprint is, there is no question that's helping us add additional selection more at economically to
Prime.
And so, that's both in terms of third-party selection, as well as retail selection. And so, that's something that we
continue to have the benefit of as we get more and more members of Prime and have a bigger and bigger concentration
of two-day shipping in the U.S. for that.
So, we did add the shipping portion of the FBA fees in Q1 of 2012 and we see some benefit year-over-year. And -- but,
we're still seeing leverage in terms of our ex the FBA fees, quite a bit of leverage there. So, we don't have a specific
number for you there, but, we're still seeing quite a bit of leverage their ex that reclass [ph] that you're referring to.
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post, Analyst
Great. Thank you. Last year, you reported 4Q in the lower half of revenue range, and you were able to call out Taiwan
and video games category. Any reasons why revenues were kind of in the lower half this quarter? And then, if you look
at gross profit growth, it clearly has accelerated to 40% growth, but unit growth decelerated to 32%. Can you describe
what's driving that kind of accelerating gross profit in the face of lower unit growth. And is it possible maybe you're
letting the third-parties handle, some of the maybe less profitable categories for Amazon, could you talk about that at
all? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
If you take a look at our growth rate, we are -- we think the growth rate for Q4 was solid. It was up 23% on a revenue
basis, quite a bit higher than on a unit growth basis, up 32% year-over-year. In terms of some of the things that we saw,
we again, there is -- we saw solid growth across many different categories and geographies year-over-year. Certainly,
some things to call out in terms of things that may have been a little bit softer, a few examples would be we did see
some of the higher average selling price items, particularly the items that are greater than $1000, were a little bit softer,
few of the consumer electronics sub-categories like, TVs, MP3 players, digital cameras to some extent were softer. But,
again with the base that we have in Q4, still very solid growth.
Another one, we certainly were thrilled to have Paperwhite in our lineup, it's certainly the best eReader that's out there,
and we're pleased with it. But we're going to keep up with demand, we would have had more sales in Q4, if we were
able to keep up with demand. And so the team is working very hard to make sure we have good start going forward on
that product, but we certainly could have sold more in Q4.

Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask you on Amazon Instant Video. How do you thought
about your current offering and your ability to add exclusive content in a cost effective manner through Amazon
studios. And what the relationship is between adding more titles and uses on your hardware such as your Amazon
Kindle devices? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
We'll continue to look at -- continue to expand our selection both in terms of Amazon Instant Video as well as Prime
Instant Video, and we'll do that in a number of different ways. And we think we have a very interesting selection right
now and you should expect that we'll be spending more on content. As it relates to prime overtime, we'll continue to
add selection on the Amazon Instant Video. Beyond that, you have to stay tuned.

Ken Sena, Analyst
Hi, I just had a question on your other segment line, can you talk a little bit about the non-AWS drivers within that line
such as advertising. And as you look out, are there advantages to you in terms of having AWS as far as offering things
like buying, serving analytics through the AWS platform to advertisers and kind of where are you sort of in that, sort of
roll out phase now? Thank you.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. There is a -- in terms of the AWS business, we've -- the business is growing very fast. We've increased a number
of services pretty dramatically over the past several years, the team is doing a fantastic job there. And we'll continue to
innovate on behalf of customers in that space.
There is a number of other things that go into that line item, other, some credit card as well as other marketing revenue
goes in there. So -- but, again AWS is in that line item.

We'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.
Anthony DiClemente, Analyst
Hi, thanks. I wonder if you comment on the pace of business throughout the fourth quarter. Did you see a particular
deceleration in the month of December? And then second question on International, I'm wondering are there any call
outs in terms of specific countries that may have been weighing on profitability, countries where there's going to be
outsized dollars of investment going on or accelerated investment at the current time? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
In terms of -- there is not a lot of specifics, we have got longstanding practice of not talking about trends within the
quarter and -- but, in terms of year-over-year growth or anything like that, obviously the Q4 is very seasonal, December

is by far the largest month followed by November.
But in terms of individual growth rates, I don't have lot of comments there. In terms of International, there certainly are
geographies that we're investing in heavily. Certainly, China would be one. Some of the newer -- some of the European
countries, including some of the newer launches we're investing in. And so, those are certainly -- you're seeing those
represented in those segment results.

We'll take our next question from Rohit Kulkarni with Citi.
Rohit Kulkarni, Analyst
Okay. Thank you for taking my question. In terms of your recent margin profile, especially comparing U.S., and
International, I guess, over the past four quarters, the vast majority improvement or rather the less worse margin trends
we have seen have been due to U.S., margin is improving, while the national were declining in the range of 300, 350
basis points. In Q4, international declines is 160 [ph] basis points. So, my question is should we read this as a
beginning of a trend that we saw how domestic margins increased over the last four quarters, whether international
should follow similar route over the next foreseeable future?
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. There is not a particular callout that I could make on that. The only thing that I would in terms of the change I'm
referring to, but in terms of the difference between the two keep in mind that a couple of factors, one, mix of business is
little bit different, our AWS business in the North America segment, you also have some newer geographies or
geographies I shouldn't say that are necessarily newer, but geographies that we're investing in heavily that have a
longer-term horizon for returns, sort of ones I mentioned earlier. So, those are factors as you look at the two different
segments.
Rohit Kulkarni, Analyst
Thanks, Tom.

We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter, Analyst
It looks like the first party gross margin is actually up fairly meaningful year-over-year. I was wondering, if you could
talk about that within the context of how Amazon Kindle hardware is impacting the gross margin? And then separately,
just any view on how video game sales impacted the year-over-year growth rates for the quarter? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I apologize, we are not -- we haven't broken out the first party versus third-party, it's not something we've done
for -- not something we're doing today or we've done in previous calls. So, there is not a lot I can help you with there.

We'll take our next question from Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus.
Jordan Rohan, Analyst
First, just an accounting clarification, should be pretty interesting, but the content cost for Prime Instant Video flow
into the cost of goods line, even there is no direct revenue associated with it, not into the tech and content line right? Is
that right?
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
That's correct.
Jordan Rohan, Analyst
Okay. So, gross margins would have been even higher if there was cost included elsewhere or broken out separately. It
also seems like it's becoming, separate question, becoming kind of common or -- to reduce the carrying value of your
investment in LivingSocial, do you have a feel on a broad strategic level, as to whether the local deals business through
Amazon local or through LivingSocial is something that you care to keep investing in? Thanks.
Thomas J. Szkutak, Chief Financial Officer
There is not a -- there is not a lot I can specifically talk about as it relates to LivingSocial beyond what's in our result
today and what we'll have in our 10-K, which will be filed soon. And so, I'd encourage you to take a look at our full
disclosures related to that. But in terms of local, there certainly is still a very interesting opportunity there. We do have
couple, we have an investment in LivingSocial, we also have a local business ourselves. And so, those are -- it's an
interesting opportunity, it's a long-term opportunity. And we'll continue to work on that customers to make that
experience even better. And you should think about it not unlike a lot of the other businesses that we invest in. We're
thinking about it over the long-term horizon and it's very early there.
Sean Boyle, Vice President, Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor
Relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward
to talking with you again next quarter.
