Before I turn the call over to John, I would like to provide some additional context for the quarter on slide four. We
talked with you the last few quarters about how we've been transforming our business for growth. This quarter, we saw
significant progress, particularly with our repositioning of the wireless business model.
First, on the network front, our Project VIP investment plan continues to deliver. We're transforming our network to a
premier IP video centric network, and the results have been impressive. Our 4G LTE build now covers more than 290
million people, and we expect to complete our deployment by the end of the summer. And our fiber build-out to cover
more businesses is going well. We've now passed more than 500,000 business customer locations since we first
announced Project VIP.
At the same time, we are investing in our network. We are investing in our customers by repositioning the wireless
value proposition. Several years ago, we successfully led the transition to usage-based data pricing. And now more than
80% of our postpaid smartphone subscribers are on those plans.
Now we are making another successful pivot away from the traditional device subsidy model with AT&T and our
Mobile Share Value plans. Customers can now pay directly for their devices in exchange for lower service pricing.
That's an equation that really works for our customers, as you can see with this quarter's record subscriber metrics. And
it's an equation that works for us, where there's an important strategic shift away from device subsidies, which have
historically netted out to be a multibillion cost each year.
This move away from the subsidy model is happening quickly and bringing about many of the expected changes in our
financial results; the shift in revenues from service to equipment and the moderation of quarterly margin trends as we
achieve increased savings in device subsidies in the back half of the year, which as you know historically is our
strongest device sales season. But the key point is that we have made a deliberate decision to go down this path. And
with the results we are seeing, we believe that strategy is clearly working. We see it in our results and we hear it from
our customers.
With that, let me turn it over to John to discuss our second quarter results. John?
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Susan, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. And as always, thank you for your interest in
AT&T.
Let me begin with our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide five. Consolidated revenue grew to $32.6
billion, up $500 million or 1.6%. This was driven by: continued wireless growth as we change our business model;
solid consumer wireline growth, once again led by U-verse; and growth in Strategic Business Services. Revenue this
quarter was impacted by the shift to no device subsidy plans in wireless.
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.68. As you know, during the quarter we sold our equity position in América
Móvil. After tax, we had a gain of about $0.08 on the sale. The gain was taxed at a higher effective tax rate due to
accounting for deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits. While the accounting rules require this high tax rate, we
are confident we will be able to utilize existing capital loss carry-forwards to maximize the after-tax cash proceeds
from the sale. When you normalize for this item, our consolidated effective tax rate is about 34%, or about 100 basis
points higher than last year.
Also, we had $0.02 of pressure from our Leap integration costs, including our non-cash items such as the amortization
of customer lists. You may call that we closed that transaction in March, so this is the first full quarter with these
integration costs. When you exclude these items, earnings per share were $0.62 compared to an adjusted $0.67 a year
earlier. Consolidated margins continue to be pressured by our investments, both in Project VIP and Agile and our shift
away from the subsidy model in wireless. These well thought out investments are expected to drive stronger growth in
the second half of the year.

Cash from operations continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities in the quarter totaled $8.1 billion. And
capital spending was $6 billion, with strong investments in Project VIP. Year to date, our free cash flow was more than
$5 billion, and that's after our more than $1.5 billion investment in our customers through AT&T Next.
Now let me turn to our operational highlights on slide six. As you can see, we continue to execute at a high level, even
as we transform our business. In wireless, the growing popularity of AT&T Next and the Mobile Share Value plan is
having an impact on our results. The customer transition to these plans is driving a major shift in the subsidy model and
at the same time helping to reduce churn, increase postpaid subscribers, drive strong growth of large buckets of data,
and improve our Net Promoter Scores or our customer satisfaction results. I'll let Ralph give you the details in just a
moment, but we are very pleased with what we are seeing from our wireless repositioning and confident in our strategy.
In wireline, U-verse continues its steady performance of subscriber gains and increasing revenue. It's now approaching
$15 billion in annualized revenues, growing at about 25% year over year. Strategic Business Services also continues to
grow at more than 13% and is an annualized $9 billion revenue stream.
We also reached a milestone in the second quarter when our U-verse high-speed broadband reached 70% of our total
broadband base. Clearly, the transition is underway. While we've made great progress, we still have a lot of room for
growth as we expand our base through Project VIP and continue to bundle broadband with other valuable services.
And of course in the second quarter we announced our intention to acquire DIRECTV. This will take our video and
bundling strategies and our cost structure to a whole new level. We're really excited about what this transaction can do.
Service bundles are a proven winner for us, and we believe the ability to bundle services nationally will be a big plus.
Overall we are on track with full-year guidance and look forward for trends to improve in the second half of the year.
I would now like to turn it over to Ralph de la Vega, who will provide more insight on the strong wireless performance
and the repositioning of the wireless business model. Ralph?
Ralph de la Vega
Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. It's great to be with you today. I'll start on slide seven.
As John said, this was truly a remarkable quarter for our wireless business with results coming in better than expected.
We've been very successful in repositioning the business model, and it's happening at breakneck speed. The shift to the
no device subsidy model is unmistakable. More and more customers are choosing the simplicity of Mobile Share Value
plans and AT&T Next.
This model shift is driving impressive results. Postpaid churn was a record low 0.86%, the best ever for AT&T and
likely an industry best this quarter. This customer loyalty helped drive our largest postpaid subscriber gain in nearly
five years, more than 1 million postpaid net adds in the quarter, including very strong smartphone net adds.
The shift to Mobile Share Value and Next has been dramatic in transitioning our smartphone customer base. Half of our
smartphone sales in the second quarter were on AT&T Next. And nearly half of our smartphone subscriber base has
moved to Mobile Share Value plans since we first introduced value plans in February.
Even better when customers do switch to Mobile Share, they're moving to larger and larger data buckets. We now have
more than 41 million connections across 15 million accounts on Mobile Share, with half on plans of 10 gigabytes or
higher. And the number on larger data plan continues to grow. As more and more customers move to usage-based data
plans, data use is increasing. We're still seeing a nearly 50% year-over-year data usage increase on smartphones. And
we continue to add more smartphones, connected devices, and tablets.
We're also starting to see the next wave of wireless growth. Digital Life is gaining momentum and had its best net gain
quarter. Connected car growth is accelerating with new models entering the market, such as the Audi A3 as well as 10
GM models that will grow to 30 by the end of the year. These are in addition to those that are already in the market
such as Tesla, BMW, and others. We feel these are incredibly good results in a time of transition.

Let me give you more detail, starting with our strong postpaid net adds and churn on slide eight. The move to Mobile
Share Value plan has really solidified our customer base, and this is critically important. Retaining our smartphone base
is the basis for future growth.
Postpaid churn was at an all-time low, and churn for Mobile Share and smartphone customers were even lower. That
was even more remarkable in a noisy competitive environment. This helped to drive more than 1 million postpaid net
adds, with more than half of those being phone customers, a significant improvement from the past several quarters.
Overall we had more than 600,000 total net adds, and that includes prepaid declines due to the second quarter seasonal
pressure and continued migration of session-based tablets to postpaid.
We also saw expected second quarter pressure from our Cricket integration. We expect this prepaid pressure will
moderate in the third quarter. And in fact we have already seen our prepaid trends improving.
Branded tablet net adds for the quarter were 250,000, and that includes 366,000 postpaid tablet net adds in the quarter.
We also saw pressure in reseller and connected devices as we transition off the old 2G network. All this drove total
churn higher, even with our record low postpaid churn.
We continued to grow our smartphone base. Including migrations we added nearly 1.6 million in the quarter. We had
more than 700,000 smartphone net adds in the quarter. And more than 90% of our postpaid phone sales in the second
quarter were smartphones.
Sales of LTE devices also continued at a strong clip, which is great for both us and our subscribers. LTE devices
provide the best customer experience while also being the most network efficient. Almost two-thirds of our postpaid
smartphone base now have LTE phones.
You see the dramatic impact Mobile Share Value plans have on churn and postpaid net adds. Now let me show you the
impact on the subsidy model and revenues. Those details begin on slide nine.
Total wireless revenues for the quarter were up nearly 4%, as revenues continue to shift to equipment from service.
Equipment revenue growth was strong in the quarter, up 45%. But as we expected service revenues were impacted. We
also saw revenue pressure from promotional activity early in the quarter and from a change in the recognition of
revenue with the sales of phones through our agents due to the AT&T Next offering. Together these two items had
about a 200 basis point impact on total wireless growth.
We're also seeing significant increases in the number of customers who bring their own devices. This is a good thing
for us, as it takes all the subsidy expense out of our model and brings on a profitable customer.
We're continuing to see customers choosing Mobile Share Value plans in unprecedented numbers. In just five months
about 24 million smartphones or about 44% of our postpaid smartphone base have moved off the subsidy model. That
includes about 2 million subscribers on unlimited data plans who chose to move to Mobile Share plans. We now have
less than 10 million subscribers on unlimited plans, our lowest level in years.
At the same time customers who are ready to upgrade are increasingly turning to AT&T Next. More than half of our
smartphone sales in the quarter, or 3.1 million, were on Next. As you can see on the pie chart on the left of the slide, we
have about 7 million AT&T customers who are Next customers at the end of the quarter, but the total number of
subscribers on non-subsidy plans is about 24 million. This gives us a large number of subscribers who will move to
AT&T Next when they buy a new device.
By the end of the year we expect the percentage of Next sales to increase considerably as customers begin to upgrade
their phones. And in fact we're already seeing customers do this. Virtually all of our pre-Next customers are choosing
AT&T Next when they upgrade in our company-owned stores.
And we expect sales to increase with our agents and in national retail, where we're just beginning to ramp up Next. The
change in the device subsidy model is driving a shift in our wireless revenue mix, but it is also driving higher value
with improved churn and more sustainable margins.

I'll turn it back to John so he can give you those financial details on slide 10. John?
John J. Stephens
Thanks, Ralph. Ralph talked about the great results we saw in wireless in the second quarter. Let me take just a minute
to dive deeper into the financial and customer value impacts.
If you look at the overall customer value, the shift away from the subsidy model is very positive. Churn plays a big role
in this. Take a look at the customer value illustration on the upper left of the slide 10. With a year-over-year 16 basis
point improvement in postpaid churn, the average life of each of our customers is extended by 18 months. With Mobile
Share Value pricing, service ARPUs do drop on a comparable basis. But when you factor in the average life of a
customer, lifetime service revenues actually increase. In the example presented, they increased $400 per customer.
When you're AT&T with over 50 million phone customers, that's a real opportunity to generate great value.
So in short, the customer value increases with Next, and this doesn't even take into account the reduction in equipment
subsidy. Going to AT&T Next also takes away most, if not all, of the net subsidy costs. That's why you can't just look
at service ARPUs anymore to get a comprehensive view of our business. Phone-only service ARPU was down for the
quarter. But when you add in Next billings, you get a more accurate idea of what an average customer pays us each
month.
The average monthly Next billings for the equipment are about $27 per month, driving our phone-only ARPU higher
with Next. Now this $27 per month is spread out over the entire base. It adds about $2.00 in ARPU per customer in the
quarter. As the Next base grows, so will this impact on ARPU. We've actually already seen this. Service ARPU with
Next improved throughout the second quarter. And for June, it was more than $65, or almost $1 higher than the
quarterly average as equipment purchases increased throughout the quarter.
Another benefit of moving off the subsidy model is that the previous highs and lows of our margins become more
stable. We've been in this business a long time, and we've seen two big drivers of sales and upgrades. That's the holiday
season and the introduction of new devices. In the past, we used to have mixed feelings about those events. It was great
for sales, but that subsidy cost pressured margins and financial results. Now with about half of our smartphone
subscribers already on non-subsidy plans and that number going up every day, we're feeling really pretty good about
the position we are in. If you look at expectations for the rest of the year, we anticipate service margins to be more than
40% while postpaid phone-only ARPU with Next billings will continue to increase as more customers upgrade their
phones.
Our wireless repositioning story is definitely a work in progress, but it's definitely working. The benefits are clear:
lower overall churn; higher postpaid net adds; customers buying larger buckets of data; and a shift away from the
unlimited plans. Best of all, customers like it. They like the clear and simple pricing. And we feel really good about
where we are, and we're excited and look forward to the second half of the year. Those are our wireless highlights.
I would now like to discuss our wireline business, starting with consumer on slide 11. U-verse has been a solid and
consistent story for us. We continue to see solid subscriber and revenue growth. This helped drive 3% revenue growth
in consumer. Total U-verse revenues are now approaching a $15 billion annualized revenue stream, and they're
growing at about 25% year over year. U-verse now represents 62% of consumer revenues.
We have 11.5 million broadband customers after adding almost 500,000 in the quarter. That's more than 70% of our
total broadband base. That compares to just 40% two years ago.
We also added 190,000 TV subscribers in the quarter, which gives us 5.9 million total U-verse TV customers. A big
factor in the success of U-verse is our ability to bundle. More than 97%, or virtually all of our video customers, have
some kind of bundle with us. And two-thirds of our U-verse TV subscribers take three or four services with us. ARPU
for U-verse triple-play customers continues to be more than $170 a month. That helps drive revenue growth while
reducing churn. In fact, triple-play bundle customers have significantly lower churn than standalone customers.

We see continued opportunity here. Our market penetration stands around 20% for U-verse broadband and TV, but that
penetration increases the longer we're in a market. Plus as Project VIP expands our customer reach, we believe we can
achieve much more.
We also continue to deploy GigaPower as part of our Project VIP build. Sales of our ultrafast broadband service have
exceeded expectations in Austin, and we have announced our intention to deploy in Dallas and North Carolina.
Now let me take you to our business wireline results on slide 12. The wireline business continues to be a story of the
economy and the shift to IP data and away from legacy services. Strategic Business Services, services such as VPN,
Ethernet, hosting, and other advanced IP services, grew by more than 13% in the quarter and more than 14% year to
date and now represent a more than $9 billion annualized revenue stream. And they now make up more than 27% of
business wireline revenue. And for the first time, Strategic Business Services revenues are now more than half of our
total wireline business data revenues.
Overall wireline business revenues were down 2.9%. Service revenues were down a little more than 2% in the second
quarter, but that's on track with recent trends and the slow economy.
When you look at each of the business components that make up our wireline business, you'll see some different stories
and some different trends. Enterprise service revenues were actually up about 1% year over year, and this was its fifth
consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth rate improvement. And our enterprise channel continues to provide
significant sales opportunities for our wireless services.
Wholesale again was challenged by network grooming of some of our wireless customers. And we also saw the impact
of our acquisition on Leap this quarter, as those previous external wholesale revenues now are internal to AT&T. Now
while small business is benefiting from wireless bundles and continued U-verse broadband growth, the lack of new
business formations is still impacting the business opportunity.
Now let's look at our margin story on slide 13. You can see the margin impacts from changes in the wireless subsidy
model and Project VIP on our margins. In the second quarter, when adjusting for Leap integration expense, wireless
EBITDA service margin was up slightly to 42.6%. That's a strong performance, especially when you consider our very
strong postpaid and smartphone net adds in the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion, stable year over year, but total EBITDA margin was down due to the impact of the
24 million smartphones moving to Mobile Share Value pricing, some promotional activity we had in the first half of the
year, and new business investments in things like Cricket and Digital Life.
For the quarter, our adjusted consolidated margin was 17.7% compared to 19.1% in the year-ago quarter. As Ralph
said, the shift to Mobile Share plans ahead of equipment purchases pressured our results. Wireline margins were down
from a year ago but essentially flat with first quarter levels. The decline in revenue from legacy services was part of the
impact. But at the same time, success-based video content costs, retransmission price increases, and expenses from
Project Agile and VIP also caused pressure. For example, overall content cost increases were more than double the total
increase of wireline operating expenses for the entire quarter. But this wireline pressure was partially offset by both the
consumer revenues, gains in Strategic Business Services, and solid execution of cost initiatives.
We expect Project Agile and our move to software-defined networks to provide margin help. Project Agile will drive
efficiency and speed to market as we transform how the company organizes and operates, all around our customers. As
we've said before, we are reinvesting savings at this point, but we see real opportunity to reduce costs through this
effort. We expect run rate savings in the $3 billion range by 2017.
Now let's move to cash flow. Our summary is on slide 14. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled
nearly $17 billion and about $8.1 billion in the second quarter. Capital expenditures were up, $11.8 billion for the six
months and $6 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow before dividends was $5.1 billion year to date, on track with
full-year guidance, even with investments in Project VIP and our wireless customer base.
We did monetize $800 million of our Next receivables in the quarter, and there continues to be great interest in
additional sales. But even after that, our net investment in customers increased by more than $1.5 billion during the

year. So we expect to meet our free cash flow guidance even with the substantial working capital invested in AT&T
Next customers. And net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was at 1.71 times, as we maintain the best credit rating of any
major U.S. telecom company.
In terms of cash, I think you know the story. Dividend payments remain our first priority and year to date totaled $4.8
billion. And we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program. Our asset sales, including América
Móvil, also strengthened our cash position and balance sheet. We ended the quarter with more than $11 billion of cash.
About $4.6 billion of that has already been used for debt redemption, leaving more than $6 billion of cash on hand at
the current time.
We have the balance sheet flexibility to pay down more debt and position ourselves for the upcoming spectrum
auctions and the DIRECTV acquisition while investing in the growth of our business. In fact, I believe we are
continuing to maximize our balance sheet efficiency. We expect another $3 billion of asset monetization by the end of
the year with the sale of our Connecticut wireline property and the remaining proceeds from our América Móvil sale.
The DIRECTV transaction continues to move forward. Brazil's antitrust regulator has approved it without restrictions,
and we have completed the review process at the state level without conditions, which included Arizona, Louisiana,
and Hawaii.
We also received good news today when the Department of Labor's approval notice allowing us to fund our pension
plans with a preferred equity interest in América Móvil was posted in the Federal Register website.
Now let me close with a quick summary and a recap of our full-year 2014 expectations. There continues to be a lot of
moving parts in this quarter and throughout the remainder of the year, but we're confident we're heading in the right
direction. We staked out our course and our plan for the year, and we are confident that we are on the right track.
First, we expect consolidated revenue growth at the low end of the 5% range. To define that, we define that range as
4.5% to 5.5%, and expect the numbers of AT&T Next upgrades to ramp substantially in the second half of the year,
powering that growth.
Second, we see stable consolidated margins as we begin to realize greater benefits, as more customers shift away from
the subsidy model in the back half of the year.
We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the low end of the mid-single-digit range, even with the pressure from Leap
integration costs and loss of the América Móvil equity income. We are still targeting capital spending in the $21 billion
range, even as we accelerated investment in the first half of the year. And we expect free cash flow in the $11 billion
range, even with strong AT&T Next sales.
I now will turn it back to Susan to take your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Hey guys. Thanks. Maybe just a comment on the churn side. Obviously you're going
to get benefit, probably somewhat due to lower pricing points. How do we get more comfort that this is going to be a
longer-term benefit?

<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah. Let me comment a little bit on that. Mike, when John was going over the chart, he was
explaining just the extension that we see in the customer lifetime value when you take our overall churn going from
1.02% to 0.086% (sic) [0.86%] (34:08).
The thing that is really encouraging to me is that that is the total average for postpaid. When you look at smartphones
you see a similar change. And what is driving the overall churn down are smartphones. And then when you look at
smartphones on Mobile Share Value plans and Next, they're even lower. So what we're doing is working.
I'll give you one proof point that was really encouraging to me in the second quarter. In the second quarter typically
churn for our company goes up in May and June compared to April. What we saw in this quarter was a change in the
trend, so both May and June were actually lower in churn than April, despite all the competitive activity that's going on.
So we feel very certain that as more and more customers sign up to Mobile Share Value plans and Next, it solidifies our
scores in terms of churn.
And we're seeing the same thing in our Net Promoter Scores. Our Net Promoter Scores for customers who are on
Mobile Share Value plans compared to FamilyTalk for example are twice the number. So every indication we have
from our customers is that these are sustainable and sustainable even during some pretty intense competitive activities,
as we always see in the wireless business.
Now you were asking about Cricket. Let me give you a quick update on Cricket. As you know we actually launched
Cricket on a nationwide basis, the new Cricket, on the 19 of May. So that was relatively short.
But I'm very pleased with what happened. We successfully converted both the Aio brand and the old Cricket brand to
the new Cricket brand. We rebranded the stores. And we started converting customers at rates that we expected from
the old CDMA network that Leap had to our GSM network.
And, Mike, the results are really, really encouraging. As you know that network covers 97% of the customers. It doesn't
include roaming. But what we're seeing is Net Promoter Scores again of Cricket customers improving month after
month as they get to sample the GSM network compared to their old CDMA network.
And so the migrations are on schedule. And we're seeing improving trends in terms of the net additions since we
completed the conversion. In fact if you look at the second quarter Cricket numbers compared to a year ago, we have
reduced the defections by one-third just in the first quarter alone.
And what we're seeing in July is an improving trend that I'm sure will continue throughout the year. Again as customers
sample this great network that they have now that is a nationwide network, as we move those customers over, we're
seeing lower churn. So we feel really good about what we did with Cricket. And we're really excited about the results
we're seeing with Mobile Share Value plans and Next in driving lower churn.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Ralph, I'm sorry. Just for clarification, on the Leap migration, did you get any benefit
on the postpaid side from customers from Leap?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: No, not any significant improvement. No, Mike, there was no significant movement from
prepaid to postpaid in our case.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, Ralph.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Mike.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks, guys. Maybe first just a follow-up to Mike's question for Ralph and another
one for John. Ralph, is there any – I liked where you were going with the churn. But is there any risk that churn could
start to move up within the Next base once maybe the pre-Next people that you've moved over that are eligible for a
handset and are probably looking at the new iPhone later this year, start to see the bill sort of – they've already seen
their bill go down, start to see it go back up again? And maybe you could talk about your experience there?
And maybe for John, in your prepared remarks at the beginning of the call, you talked about some stronger growth and
stronger trends in the second half. Is it just equipment driven? Or can you give us a little bit more detail on what some
of those trends are? And are we to the point where we have an eye towards when we will start to see service revenue
trends start to turn? Thanks.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: John, on your comment about what happens as people upgrade to Next, as we mentioned in
my comments, we're already seeing about half of our smartphone sales go on Next, and that's the same experience that
you were referring to. And those customers when we sample them, their Net Promoter Scores are high. So we're not
seeing any concerns at this point. And I think that once they get on Next, they're going to be able to get the new
smartphone every year or every eighteen months depending on the plans that they select. So we feel really good so far
about everything we have seen from the plans, no major concerns.
<A - John J. Stephens>: And, John, specifically the customers that we allowed to go up on the Mobile Share Value
plans early and that have subsequently come in, we've seen great stay-on rates, over 90% of the company-owned stores
where they've stayed on the Next program. So they like it. They really seem to be very sticky with us. So we feel good
about where it's going, but we're going to watch it closely.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Got you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: With regard to the stronger trends, there are a couple things that are just really important.
One, when you add 1 million customers in a quarter, and we added – total change was 1.6 million smartphones, that
was a conversion of about 900,000 feature phones to smartphones. And then there were net adds, postpaid smartphone
net adds of 700,000. So it was a really significant number. Also, we had another good number of tablets, about
350,000, but we really had great performance on our smartphone net adds, so that gives us confidence in generating
more revenue. Additionally, we are seeing people take insurance almost at a 50% clip on our Next sales. So that's going
to help, and we continue to find satisfaction. Those insurance rates are anywhere from $7 to $10 a month. We see really
good results on that.
Third, we're seeing people by bigger buckets, as we mentioned. I think we mentioned – Ralph mentioned that there
were 14 million or so Mobile Share Value accounts. Over half or about half of those are taking 10-gig or better. And
with the new phones coming out, people are using more data. We continue to see usage growth, which is going to drive
revenue growth. All of those things are what give us confidence in what we see and why we believe there's going to be
real opportunity for improving revenue trends.
But lastly, very much so, we think the Next take rate, especially with the opportunity for maybe some new devices in
the holiday season, will also generate some improvement in our numbers. So we feel really, really good about the
whole package, not just the equipment story.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: John, one other thing that I think we both feel good about is if you look at those that larger
data buckets, we mentioned that about half of our base is on buckets that are 10 gigs or higher. But if you look at
actually as customers add lines to their Mobile Share Value plans, we're seeing that number that are selecting the
10-gig or higher plan be 70%. So we've got about half the base, but on the ones that are getting added, the take rates are
up even significantly higher. So it gives us great encouragement that as you look at Mobile Share and Next, number
one, it's producing lower churn and longer customer lifetimes. Number two, it's actually reducing our subsidies. And
number three, it's resulting in these large data bucket purchases that we know will increase ARPU as we define it now

to be phone-only ARPU plus Next billings. Those are expected to increase for the remainder of the year. So we feel
really good that the strategy is working and is having its intended results.
<A - John J. Stephens>: John, just let me add just one other thing to make sure I made clear that you got out of the
presentation. As I said, there was about a 200 basis point pressure on wireless revenue growth this quarter. And it has to
do with we're now selling our Next program through our agents. And so instead of recognizing the revenue when we
deliver to the agent, we recognize the revenue when they deliver to the customer. And so that delayed – it had an
impact on revenue this quarter. By the end of the year, we think we'll get that back, especially in the holiday season
when inventories are traditionally low.
In addition, we had some early – early on in the quarter we had some pressure from promotional activities. As you
know, we really haven't run any significant promotional activities since the April timeframe. So we think we've got
most of that pressure behind us. When you put those two things together, we have a better starting point than we may
appear based on the appropriately reported results.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Got it, okay. Thanks for all the detail, guys.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks.
<A - Susan Johnson>: Next question?
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Ralph, can you give us a sense for the exit rate
for churn at the end of the quarter? And then, John, you just mentioned the promotional activity. Do you have an idea
of how much of the sub growth was actually driven by the promotional activity we saw early on in the quarter?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: First on the churn in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, what is really encouraging is that we
saw both May and June be lower than our postpaid churn in April, and usually it's the reverse. So it says that the plans
that we have put in place are bending the curve in the right direction, trending to lower churn in the back half of the
quarter as opposed to being higher, which is traditionally what we have seen in Mobility. So it is very encouraging, and
we're seeing very good churn levels at this point. So I don't see anything that would drive it in a different direction.
<A - John J. Stephens>: John, we both and the whole operation have been very optimistic about churn continuing to
improve on a year-over-year basis compared to historical levels, so we feel really good about that.
With regard to the net adds we had, we really haven't had any significant promotional programs in effect in May or
June. We had some in March, and some of the costs of those were appropriately accounted for when the customers
earned those discounts, or actually in April. So we really didn't see much in the way of significant customer change
with regard to that. We may have seen some of that benefit in March. But I will tell you it seems like in the [ph] new
economic (45:38) environment, a lot of our competitors were very active in that, and quite frankly we were not. We
were not as active as others.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: By the way, Joe, one other point of reference. The 0.86% churn number, as far as I know if
you go back and look at the history of wireless, is the second lowest churn ever reported by a company in the history of
wireless, and the one that was lower than that was only two basis points lower two years ago. So not only is it the
lowest for AT&T, but it's some of the lowest churns ever reported by any company in wireless.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Obviously, Joe, we feel real good about where we're at and how we're performing. The team
is doing a great job.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Okay, guys. Thanks.

Our next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks so much, good evening. On capital spending, you reiterated the $21 billion. That
implies about a 20% drop second half versus first half. And I know there has been a lot of talk in the market around
CapEx freezes and so forth. So perhaps you could just provide little clarity about how you're going to get there and
what impact that has on wireless or wireline.
And then for Ralph, I think in the June release, you said about one-half of customers would be on no device plans by
midyear and about two-thirds by the end of the year, and I think you hit 44%. So as we go into Q3 and Q4, are you still
targeting that two-thirds number, or are we coming in a little bit lower than that? Thanks.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Let me answer the last one, first, Simon. And yes, that's exactly what we're targeting. What
we have seen, Simon, is first of all, we started with our company-owned retail stores, and it was a huge smash hit. Then
we brought in our dealers, and they have been a huge smash hit, almost exactly the same performance that we saw in
our company-owned retails, which are much higher than the averages that we're reporting. Now we're bringing national
retails. These are national retail agents that have not sold Next up to this point who will be coming online. And so we
expect those to come online in the third and fourth quarters, further increasing the rate. So we're fairly confident that
you're going to see an increase from the rates that we reported in the second quarter.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Simon, with regard to the CapEx story, yes, we did reiterate that we'd be in the $21 billion
range, and we're staying with that. With regard to the commentary on the overload on that $1 billion spend in the first
six months, I guess I'm well aware of the commentary and the talk that many people had had that we had changed our
spending patterns based on those numbers. It would seem that some people were misinformed. It may have been more
about the spread or the sharing amongst our spend.
If you're thinking about how we're going to get down to the $21 billion range, I'd suggest this. We're very near
complete with our $300 million LTE build. In fact, we expect to complete that later this summer. So most of the
spending for that and much of the spending for the network densification has been already placed; we just need to go
out and utilize and put those assets into service, which we're apt to do. Secondly, we've done a lot of other of our
systems and other corporate work with regard to laying out fiber and other things that we expect will moderate in the
second half of the year and focus more on the utilization of assets that we've placed in service. So certainly it will be a
challenge. It will be a lot of work, but we feel good about the fact that we can stay in that $21 billion range.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.

It comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much and good afternoon, folks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Earlier this quarter, you folks mentioned that you've been able to secure some financing
for your handset receivables, which I believe Randall [Stephenson] had alluded to as an opportunity during your most
recent analyst event. Now that we've seen a couple of quarters of the Next program, do you see further opportunities to
finance some of these receivables?

And then secondly, there has also been a lot of chatter around the possibility of extending bonus depreciation. John, this
is an area that you've spent a decent amount of time looking at. I would love to hear your thoughts around where you
think legislation is and where it ultimately shakes out and the potential opportunity here with respect to your cash flow
positioning.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sounds great, Amir. Let me try to handle this. First of all, Citi was our lead bank in the Next
monetization transaction that we completed in June. We received about $800 million in cash from the monetization of
some of our Next accounts receivables. With that being said, we still had a net investment in our customers of $1.5
billion, more than $1.5 billion actually, from January 1 through June 30. What we learned from that is it wasn't just
Citi, but it was a number of other banks that stepped up and were very interested in joining in the consortium to buy
those receivables. There was plenty of demand. The financing costs were extremely low, very, very attractive, and the
terms and conditions were very attractive, so we went ahead and did it.
We're also very pleased with the fact that the collection of major banks established the real validity and the real value
of those receivables, and we believe there continues to be great demand. In fact, all the participants in that have come
back to us and asked us. So we'll look at further opportunities, and we believe that's one of the reasons why I feel
comfortable about our cash flow guidance for the year in the sense that we have – one of those levers is the
monetization process, so it gives us great comfort.
The second piece is we're optimistic on bonus depreciation getting at least extended. There have been a number of bills
out there, some to make it permanent, others to extend it. There seems to be a general sense that the extenders will get
completed and approved, but maybe not until later this year. That would be a very good thing for a capital-intensive
industry like us and help us continue to make significant investments. The biggest cash impact for us will be 2015
because of some of the nuances of the tax rules. And we follow up carefully, and we're looking for every opportunity to
promote that legislation.
<A - Susan Johnson>: Next question?
Operator
That comes from Mike Rollins with Citi Investment Research.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi, thanks for taking the question, just a couple of follow-ups, if I could, please. I think last
quarter you mentioned what the installment net receivables were at the end of the quarter. I was wondering if you can
give us an update there?
And then secondly, if I can just go back to the churn improvement that you saw during the quarter, how should we
think about who specifically the improvement came from? In other words did it come from customers that were out of
contract and were able to churn but took advantage of the no subsidy Mobile Share Value? Was it customers earlier in
their life that may have churned prematurely were you able to capture a benefit from? Is there a way to think about the
segments of customers where you saw that churn savings? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: I think, Mike, a couple things. One, I think the biggest churn improvements we saw were
quite frankly in smartphones and the overall category of smartphones where the smartphone churn is lower than that
0.86% postpaid churn we saw.
Secondly, the customers who participate in our Mobile Share Value plan, their churn is also lower than the 0.86%. So
as those plans grow and as our 80% smartphone base continues to go to our flow share of 92%, you can understand
why we are optimistic about further churn improvement and the opportunity to continue this good run we're having.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah. Mike, let me add a little more color to that. Like John said, when you compare the
1.02% churn to the 0.86%, that extends the life of a customer by a year and a half. If you do the same analysis not on
the total base but on smartphones, that life extension goes to two and a half years. The churn difference is actually

greater if you compare smartphones on the same basis. So you extend the life of the customer by two and a half years.
And then if you take smartphones who have Mobile Share Value and Next, you extend it even further than that. These
results are early on but are really encouraging. And it basically says that customers who choose Mobile Share Value
and Next on smartphones are driving this thing down to really low levels. And by the way the numbers that we're
quoting on churn are of course total churn. There's some involuntary churn, so the voluntary churn numbers are
actually even lower than the ones that we have just published.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Mike, lastly you said on the installment sales. I will tell you it's a mixed bag of numbers, so I
want to make sure I don't direct you to one specific line on the financial statement. But if you look at our accounts
receivable and then you add in our long-term assets that relate to Next, because some of the receivables are over 12
months. And then you look at the deferred purchase price from the Citi organization, you get a sense that we're in the
area of $3.2 billion of total receivables. And that's after taking into account or reducing it for the monetization we did.
We will disclose this information in our 10-Q, so I'll give you that back to say we will make sure we, as we have in the
first quarter Q, disclose that.
<A - Susan Johnson>: Next question please?
Operator
Comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey guys. Thanks. I guess two quick ones. First the buyback pace was a little slower. Should
we think of that as the new run rate given the DTV [DIRECTV] transaction out there? And I know you said
opportunistic, but assuming sort of at this level, give or take.
And then second speaking of DTV, there are a lot of opportunities in Latin America. AMX [América Móvil] may sell
some assets. The Brazil auction is coming up. Would you anticipate being involved in anything in Latin America
between now and the close of the DTV deal or in the future? Or do you think of DTV sort of it is as it is for a while?
Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Phil, real quick on the buyback, you're absolutely right. The pace has moderated. And
certainly we take into consideration all factors, the DTV deal, our CapEx spending, quite frankly our investment in our
customers with Next. So I'm going to stick with the guidance we gave before that we're going to continue to be
opportunistic. But you're absolutely right that the pace has moderated today as compared to last year.
With regard to any transactions other than the comments I've already made on DTV, we really wouldn't want to
speculate on any or comment on any speculation that's out there. So we're just really focused on continuing to work
with the regulatory agencies and getting the DTV transaction approved and moving forward with that. We're more
excited about it and more confident that it's the right thing to do than ever. And so we want to push it forward. Thank
you.
<A - Susan Johnson>: And, Nick, I think we're going to call for the last question.
Operator
Thank you. That last question will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks, guys. I think last quarter you gave the normalized ARPU and maybe I missed it
this quarter if you normalize for the sale of the equipment. And maybe I know you have the channel sales and a few
other moving parts. Can you give us what your best guess on what the normalized revenue growth was for the quarter?

And then lastly I know you said customers are bringing more of their own devices. But are you seeing customers trade
down to lower-cost devices with the Next plan now that they have to pay for it on their own? Thanks a lot.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Tim, a couple of things. If you look on slide 10 that we showed there, you can see that the
ARPU plus the Next billings was about $64, a little bit over $64, $64.35. That compares to last year's $67, so it's down
around the 4%, 4.5% range.
Secondly, I will tell you that if you look at that as of the month of June as opposed to the average for the quarter, that's
about $1 higher. And so what we're saying is an expectation that through the rest of this year, you will see the ARPU
plus those Next billings definitely increase. And we're very optimistic about the opportunity to get back on track for
growth. I'll let Ralph take the other question.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: And, Tim, what we're seeing today in terms of bring your own devices are devices that are
typically hand-me-downs. But we're very excited, because we see a new wave of low-cost smartphones where
customers can outright purchase the device for a very low cost and in essence bring their own device by paying cash.
And the new lineup of smartphones that we'll have in the second half will have several options of good-looking
devices, very functional, large screens, at lower cost that will allow a customer to get our best price by a very simple
purchase of the device. So we think that BYOD will probably increase as the year goes on.
<A - John J. Stephens>: For the quarter, Tim, I think our BYOD units were about three times or more than three times
what they were last year. But the encouraging thing for us is about three-quarters or more of those went on accounts
under contract. And so while the BYOD doesn't require a contract, when they bring them and put them on an account
that has a contract, we feel real good about the sustainability of those. And quite frankly, as Ralph mentioned, the fact
that there's no subsidy cost does make this really a financially attractive situation.
John J. Stephens
As we close, I want to thank you all for being with us this afternoon. We've made significant progress in transforming
our business for growth in the second quarter and in particular with repositioning our wireless business model. Postpaid
net adds were very strong. Specifically, smartphone net adds were very strong, and we had our best ever postpaid
churn. And we've made great strides in moving smartphone subscribers off the subsidy model. We feel really good
about our current momentum heading into the back half of the year and believe even stronger that our decisions to go
with this model was appropriate. Thanks again for the call and, as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a
great evening, good night.
