MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
Joseph Romanelli
Thank you, Andrea, and good afternoon, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone
listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items. First of all, there are a number of items in
the GAAP results such as acquisition related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that
we've excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, and you can see them in our press release on table
two. This will give you a better sense of the underlying performance. There are three tables in the press release. The
first table provides the GAAP results, table number two reconciles our GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results for the
third quarter and table three provides the sales performance for the company's business units and our products both on a
reported basis and excluding exchange. During the call, we will be referring to table two when we discuss the P&L and

Finally, I'll like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual
results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The company's SEC filings,
including Item 1A in the 2012 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the
company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this
morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our SEC filings can be
found on the website at merck.com. You can also find our earnings release and all the tables there as well.
This morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, President of
Global Human Health, who'll update you on our product and geographic performance; Peter Kellogg, our Chief
Financial Officer, who'll review our P&L and provide an update on our outlook for 2013; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter,
President of Merck Research Laboratories, who will provide you with an update on some of our key programs.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Frazier. Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide an update on our performance and highlight
some key events from the quarter. I'll start with performance.
This quarter our teams delivered solid growth in the underlying portfolio while aggressively managing costs to deliver
non-GAAP EPS of $0.92. Our diverse core business continues to grow despite challenges in the marketplace.
Excluding the impact of patent expiries, company sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, with strong
contributions to the top line from our vaccines, immunology and HIV businesses.
At this point in 2013, I believe it's useful to step back and look at the solid year-to-date performance of these and other
growth drivers in our portfolio. During the first nine months of the year, excluding exchange, vaccines grew 15%. Our
immunology business grew 12%. We had consistent global growth of ISENTRESS at 7%. Our diabetes franchise grew
6% and our hospital portfolio grew 5%.
As Adam will detail shortly, our commercial teams are focused on maintaining share and driving growth for key brands
despite competitive pressures and patent expiries. Our complementary businesses, animal health and consumer care,
were flat year-over-year this quarter but their fundamentals remain strong despite some factors affecting short-term
performance.
Now I'd like to briefly comment on our announcement earlier this month to sharpen our R&D and commercial focus.
On this point, let me be clear, Merck is and will remain committed to investing productively in R&D both internally,
and importantly, externally, as we firmly believe it is the best pathway to sustainable competitive advantage and
growth. By investing for growth, we will strengthen our ability to drive innovation and translate cutting edge science
into medically important products, the fundamental driver of long-term shareholder value in this industry.
As part of our global initiative, we are proactively reengineering our cost base to realize operating efficiencies while at
the same time bringing greater focus and commensurate investment to those areas where we have the strongest
potential for growth. These plans enable us to reduce our cost base by $2.5 billion by the end of 2015. We are confident
that this is the right plan for future growth in the current and future healthcare environment, although the steps we are
taking are very difficult.
However, I cannot emphasize enough that significantly reducing our cost base does not mean that we will stop
investing for the future. On the contrary, we believe it is necessary to focus our resources even more precisely so that
we can invest in those opportunities which best position us for a return to growth. As part of the same process, we are

evaluating strategic options for those areas that have not been prioritized. We have a research portfolio with innovative
assets such as our anti-PD-1 and HPV programs, both of which have been granted breakthrough therapy designation by
the FDA. These require significant investment and we are committed to fully resourcing these and other CRITICAL
programs like BACE for Alzheimer's disease. Regarding our anti-PD-1 program, we're looking forward to presenting
our first data in non-small cell lung cancer tomorrow. I am pleased with the speed and the intensity with which our
colleagues around the company are working on this important program.
Since joining us this past spring, Roger Perlmutter has been working on creating the foundation to achieve a higher
return on R&D capital by reducing operational complexity and introducing significant efficiencies. This ensures that
our researchers are focusing their efforts on the programs most capable of delivering medicines and vaccines that
provide unambiguous promotable advantages to patients and payers. Roger will talk more about that shortly, including
how our combination HPV regimen and V503 underscore his point.
As we think about our business going forward, we are focused on balancing the short-term and the long-term by
resourcing the key internal programs to deliver our pipeline, including potential game changers like anti-PD-1, while
also augmenting our pipeline with even greater emphasis on external opportunities. In addition, we will maintain a high
level of cash return to shareholders through both the dividend and stock buyback. In addition to the dividend, thus far
we've demonstrated our shareholder friendliness with a $15 billion treasury stock authorization and the accelerated
stock repurchase this year.
So in closing, we demonstrated solid financial results again this quarter. We're taking steps to sharpen our R&D and
commercial focus, which will strengthen our position for the future, by increasing productivity and investing in our
most promising opportunities. And finally, we are committed to increasing shareholder value in the future through
value creating business development and returning a high level of our free cash flow.
So with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to my colleague, Adam Schechter.
Adam H. Schechter
Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everybody. This morning I'll focus my remarks on the performance of our core products
and our core markets. Let me begin with our overall performance.
Human health sales declined 4% in the third quarter. Our top-line results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity of a
number of brands and weakness in the yen. Our underlying business grew 4%, excluding sales from these products on a
constant currency basis, and key contributors to the growth in the quarter were vaccines, ISENTRESS, REMICADE
and SIMPONI.
So let me provide more details and I'll start with the JANUVIA and JANUMET franchise. The franchise had sales of
$1.4 billion and 2% growth ex-exchange. Growth of 15% in international markets was offset by an 8% decline in the
United States. The United States sales decline this quarter was driven by lower customer inventory levels of more than
$60 million.
With regard to demand, in the United States we saw a decrease of about 2% in TRx volume this quarter. However, we
continue to maintain our strong market leadership position with a greater than 70% share despite three other DPP-4s in
the market. The key issue in the United States is that the branded oral diabetes market is relatively flat. Regarding
price, while we saw a small benefit from price this quarter, we also continued to experience rebate and pricing pressure,
as this is a very competitive market.
In international markets, JANUVIA and JANUMET sales increased 15% on a constant currency basis. We drove good
volume growth in each region around the world and we maintained leadership with about a 70% global market share.
Now let me touch on our outlook for the franchise. First in the United States, we continue to focus our resources on
JANUVIA to drive demand and to take share from the sulfonylureas. With significant new competition, we must
defend market share while at the same time focus on market growth. Although this has proven to be difficult, we must

change the TRx trend in order to return to growth in the United States.
Second, internationally, we expect good growth. The diabetes market continues to grow, and we are well positioned as
the market leading DPP-4 inhibitor.
Moving to ISENTRESS, ISENTRESS sales were $430 million, which represents about 7% growth. In the United
States, we are maintaining our patient share despite new competition, although it's still early. Outside of the U.S.,
ISENTRESS continues to have solid volume growth.
Moving to immunology, the combined immunology business, consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI, grew 16% in
the quarter. Sales of SIMPONI grew 40% to $126 million this quarter. We're seeing good growth across our markets,
including the recent launch in France. We're also pleased with last month's European approval for an additional
indication in ulcerative colitis.
Lastly, moving to our vaccine business, demand for our vaccines portfolio remains very strong, and we also benefited
from about $90 million of higher U.S. public sector purchases, including about $60 million of GARDASIL and about
$30 million of RotaTeq sales in the quarter. GARDASIL maintained its strong performance with 15% growth
year-over-year. U.S. sales increased more than 30% due to continued uptake of the male indication and higher public
sector purchases.
Internationally as expected, sales declined this quarter. The Japanese government decision in June to suspend proactive
recommendation of HPV vaccines had a negative impact on the HPV market. We continue to work with the Japanese
government to provide the best amount of persuasive safety and efficacy data available for GARDASIL. In addition,
the timing of emerging market tenders had an unfavorable impact on sales this quarter.
Moving on to ZOSTAVAX, ZOSTAVAX sales were $185 million this quarter. As expected, sales in the United States
are up sequentially due to seasonality. However, the flu vaccination season is getting a late start this year, so we'd
expect our strongest quarter of the year to be the fourth quarter.
Internationally, we have now launched in a select set of Asian markets and the United Kingdom. We're seeing good
uptake in each of those markets. As an important reminder, our European vaccine sales are reported through equity
income. We recently received approval of our Durham manufacturing facility, and we're on track to launch in
additional markets beginning next year. We continue to see ZOSTAVAX as a key growth driver.
Now I'd like to touch on our regional performance. In the United States, Europe, and Canada, sales continued to be
affected by the loss of exclusivity of SINGULAIR, MAXALT, PROPECIA, CLARINEX and most recently
TEMODAR in the United States. Excluding these products, U.S. sales increased by 7% and Europe and Canada sales
increased by 3% as compared to the prior year. Japan sales declined 2% ex-exchange due to an increase in the
utilization of generic versus branded products but also lower sales of GARDASIL as I mentioned earlier.
Sales in emerging markets grew by 2% ex-exchange. Double-digit growth in key emerging markets like Brazil, Korea,
Russia, and Turkey was partially offset by declines in China and Mexico this quarter. The timing of tenders also
affected our performance in the emerging markets including China this quarter. In key emerging markets, our base
business is strong and diverse, and Merck's growth continues to outpace the overall market. We expect stronger growth
in the emerging markets in the fourth quarter.
Before I close, I'd just like to touch on the changes we're making [ph] in global human (14:42) health as part of the
global initiative we announced earlier this month. We are sharpening our focus on core therapeutic areas and top
markets. We are prioritizing investment in those areas where we have a future platform for growth and for leadership
like diabetes and vaccines. In other areas, we're reducing investment and looking for creative ways to be successful in
the marketplace and to maximize the values of these assets.
In closing, the human health business demonstrated growth of our underlying portfolio of key brands this quarter. I'm
confident that the changes we are making together with our strong portfolio position us well for future success.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.

Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Adam, and good morning. As you heard from Ken and Adam, today's results reflect the various pushes and
pulls the business is facing today. First, we continue to work through the negative impact of patent expiries. Second, we
saw strong growth in key areas of the base business, such as immunology and vaccines. Third, we maintained solid
levels of sales and market share with products that are under considerable competitive pressures. And finally we
continue to manage costs effectively while making focused investments for future growth.
In total, we delivered a solid performance this quarter. Reflective of this quarter's performance, we are narrowing our
2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.48 to $3.52. Coupled with the new global initiative to strengthen Merck by
sharpening our commercial and R&D focus, today's results demonstrate that Merck is committed to delivering in the
short-term while preparing the organization for future growth.
This morning I will talk briefly about our performance in the third quarter, and I will discuss our outlook for the
remainder of the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. Starting at the bottom line, we earned $0.93
(sic) [$0.92] (16:44) per share this quarter.
Merck is now emerging from the most significant period of SINGULAIR patent expiry, which began in August of last
year. Also, this year has brought significant foreign exchange headwinds. So it is important for us to highlight how the
underlying base business is performing outside of patent expiries in foreign exchange.
On that basis, sales increased 4% in our pharmaceutical business, as Adam outlined earlier. Also on an ex-exchange
basis, animal health sales were flat year-over-year. Growth in companion animal and swine segments was offset by
declines in the cattle segment.
In consumer care, sales were also flat on an ex-exchange basis. Strong sales of CLARITIN and the launch of our new
Oxytrol OTC product offering were offset by the foot care and GI segments.
Moving to other revenues, we saw a 14% decline in supply sales to AstraZeneca in the third quarter. As the joint
venture continues to utilize an alternative supplier and as we approach the May 2014 U.S. patent expiration for
Nexium, we expect increasingly aggressive year-over-year declines. At the PGM line, as discussed in prior periods,
generic erosion of high gross margin products created a headwind on the gross margin this quarter. As a result, our
non-GAAP gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis to 74%.
Turning to marketing and administrative expenses, our third quarter SG&A expenses were about $220 million lower
year-over-year as a function of continued proactive cost management and foreign exchange. We continue to expect
SG&A spending in 2013 to be lower than 2012.
Moving on to R&D. Research and development expenses, in the third quarter, were about $260 million lower than prior
year. The magnitude of this decline represents continued cost management and some impact of timing of clinical
program investments. For example, we are now initiating Phase III studies for the partnered SGLT2 program, which
will bring milestone payments and clinical development costs into the fourth quarter. And we will continue to invest
heavily on our anti-PD-1 program. Taken together, we still expect that our full-year 2013 R&D expenses will be lower
than 2012.
Moving on to other line items, equity income from affiliates decreased $56 million versus the prior year due to lower
income from the AstraZeneca joint venture. We expect to see continued sharp declines as we approach the end of the
partnership. We fully expect AstraZeneca to exercise its option to end the JV in June of next year, and you should plan
your models for supply sales and equity income accordingly.
Other income expense was about $30 million lower year-over-year. Lower foreign exchange losses, on the balance
sheet, offset higher interest expense from the $6.5 billion debt offering we completed earlier this year.

Now moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.3% in the third quarter. As previously discussed, this rate is
significantly higher than the first half of 2013, and it is also consistent with the range we expect to see for the business
going forward in 2014. With this quarter's results, we are maintaining our estimated full-year 2013 tax rate to be in the
range of 22% to 23%.
Now turning to the outlook for the rest of the year, on the bottom line, as I noted earlier, we are narrowing our 2013
non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.52. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.61 and $1.79. Regarding
capital allocation, while we remain ready to bolster the pipeline with external innovation at any time, we maintain a
strong balance sheet and an efficient capital structure, which has enabled us to return cash in a shareholder friendly
manner.
As I noted a few weeks ago, we have returned roughly 100% of free cash flow over the last five years through the
combination of a strong dividend and a focused share repurchase program. This year, you can see the impact of our
accelerated share repurchase in our average shares outstanding. We remain on track to repurchase $7.5 billion of stock
in the first 12 months of the new $15 billion repurchase authorization, announced in May, inclusive of the ASR.
Beyond May 2014, you should expect ongoing share reductions were consistent with historical patterns, and continued
commitment to a strong dividend.
So in conclusion, this was a strong quarter. And I'd like to clarify that I may have misspoken earlier. I said $0.93 earned
in the quarter on a non-GAAP basis. We earned $0.92 per share this quarter, and that's what's shown in the press
release. And it was a solid quarter where we continued to drive growth across the base of the business, in the midst of
generic erosion and competitive challenges. We aggressively managed costs and we will continue to do so, as outlined
in the new global initiative. We are committed to maintaining this focus, while investing in innovation and driving
future growth. Thank you.
Now I'll turn the call over to Roger who will provide an update on MRL. Roger?
Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks Peter. During the third quarter we made considerable progress in advancing the goals of Merck Research
Laboratories, while focusing on intently on aligning investment with the best opportunities in our portfolio.
In the vaccines area, we were certainly pleased to receive the Prix Galien for ZOSTAVAX, our innovative shingles
vaccine. We also announced last week that the V503 program, our 9 valent Human Papillomavirus vaccine, met its
primary end points with respect to prevention of pathology associated with five HPV serotypes not covered by
GARDASIL. Detailed results will be presented at the EUROGIN conference in November in Florence. The distribution
of cancer associated HPV serotypes vary substantially among human populations, even in the United States. The V503
vaccine should provide protection against nearly 90% of these strains. As previously mentioned, we expect to file for
FDA approval of V503 before the end of his year.
Also from a regulatory perspective, we continue to make progress in developing lower dose formulations of
suvorexant, our orexin antagonist for insomnia. We maintain on track to complete our response to questions from the
FDA during the first half of 2014.
In September, the company announced that it received a complete response letter from the U.S. FDA for the
resubmission of the new drug application for sugammadex sodium injection, Merck's investigational medicine for the
reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. To address the complete response letter,
the company intends to start a confirmatory hypersensitivity study as soon as it's practicable based on forthcoming
discussions with the FDA. This will of course impose a delay on our FDA submission. We expect to provide more
detail on the nature of this delay following additional discussion with the agency.
Separately, we're looking forward to the advisory committee meeting for our review of oral immunization therapy for
grass allergy, which has now been rescheduled for December 12. We previously submitted a separate BLA for ragweed
allergen tablet and are working closely with our partner in this area, ALK-Abelló, on a more comprehensive program

for house dust mite allergy.
From a development perspective, as Ken mentioned, we will present interim data on the effect of MK-3475, our
antibody directed against PD-1 in patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer at the world conference on lung
cancer in Sydney, Australia. The MK-3475 program is now quite broad, and it includes studies in patients with
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, triple negative breast cancer, uroepithelial tumors, colorectal cancer and
hematologic malignancies in addition to non-small cell lung cancer and, of course, malignant melanoma. The breadth
of this program highlights the opportunity that we see for this new agent, which we hope will prove effective in a large
number of malignancies.
Among novel therapeutic categories, earlier this month the FDA granted breakthrough designation to MK-5172 and
MK-8742, our HCV protease inhibitor coupled with an inhibitor of viral assembly, which are lead elements in the
broader MRL program for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus infection. Interim data describing viralogic
response in genotype 1 infected patients treated with these agents will be presented at the American Association for the
Study of Liver Diseases meeting in Washington, D.C., next week. These results should give helatologists a sense of our
enthusiasm for the new Hepatitis C treatment regimens that we're exploring, including those involving other potent
direct acting antiviral agents that are at earlier stages in development.
Finally in development, we have initiated Phase III studies of ertugliflozin, an investigational oral SGLT2 inhibitor in
partnership with Pfizer. As previously discussed, this compound has very favorable pharmaceutical properties, which
should enable exploration in combination with sitagliptin and other anti-diabetic agents.
I wish to note that we're making very good progress in focusing our expenditures on the most promising new programs
in our portfolio. We regret that we have found it necessary to eliminate a number of positions as part of this
organizational realignment. Nevertheless, as Ken has made plain, our actions do not signal a softening in our
commitment to research and development. It is my firm belief that breakthrough research provides the only sustainable
competitive advantage for our company and I intend to husband our resources with great care to ensure that the most
important programs receive phase appropriate support.
Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
All right. Thank you, Andrea – and thank you, Roger. So Andrea, before we move into Q&A, just a reminder so we can
get through as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to just one or two questions. If you have additional
questions, please feel free to rejoin the queue.
So with that, Andrea, we will start the Q&A session.

Operator
Yes, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: On PD-1, as the data set continues to evolve, Roger, do you have a view yet on what the
duration of therapy will be in the real world? And then perhaps for Adam on JANUVIA U.S., is 2014 shaping up to be
a better or a worse year from a rebating and discounting standpoint relative to 2013? I believe a fourth competitor was
coming into the mix as contracting was being done for 2013. Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So, Gregg, we don't know what the length of the therapeutic regimen will be. We've sort
of taken a swag at it in our studies, and we have two years of therapy in our current study protocols. But we really –
we're not sure what the durability will be like, and we're also not sure what it would be like to engage in re-treatment in

individuals who may have failed. So those are the big questions that we'll have to get at in the future. At the moment
we're still trying to establish what the fundamental response rates are and the durability response in a variety of
different tumor settings.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And then, Gregg, with regard to 2014, we're not giving specific guidance at this time [ph]
for 2015 (28:45). And we don't typically give discounts and rebates on individual products, but what I will say is if you
look at where we are today, we have about 80% access in managed care, so we have a very strong formulary position,
and we believe that we will have a similar very strong formulary position in 2014 with greater than 80% access. And as
to rebate and discounting, we'll continue to be aggressive in the marketplace, but with that said, we're going to maintain
a very strong access position for JANUVIA in 2014.

Your next call comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Hi. Thank you. Just a couple questions, first on the JANUVIA JANUMET franchise, Peter if you
can provide us a little bit more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of volume and price? Obviously you have the
largest share of over 70% but with other DPP-4s on the market and SGLT2s, can you give us a sense for where you
would expect that 70% to go? And can you reconfirm whether or not you expect this franchise to still grow in the
mid-single digits? I think that was your guidance in the previous call. And then secondly on the gross margin, 74%, can
you remind me what was the hit from FX, and how should we think about the gross margin going forward? Is there any
reason why that gets better in 2014? Thanks very much.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: So, Jami, hi. Why don't I let Adam take the first couple questions related to JANUVIA
JANUMET and the franchise outlook, and then I'll come back to the PGM. So, Adam?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, so let me give you some context, Jami, to JANUVIA and JANUMET. And I'm
going to start first at a high level and a global high level, which says and is clear that diabetes is a growing epidemic,
that it is a significant concern in almost every market around the world including the United States. And if you talk to
any government, they would tell you that they're very concerned about the growth of expenditures due to diabetic
patients. So the market underlying demographics remains very strong.
If you look at the United States, we had a decline of 8% year-over-year, but that was almost entirely due to customer
inventory levels where we saw a greater than $60 million decrease in the inventory levels. If you focus on TRx volume
in the U.S., you saw about a 2% decline in volume. We did see a benefit from price, but with the continued pressure on
rebates and discounts, we saw several percentage points that could be attributed to price.
When you think about guidance in the U.S., what you're seeing is it's very difficult to predict the channel movements.
You saw last quarter we had 9% growth, this quarter we had minus 8%, and that's primarily due to the changes in
wholesalers and channels. So what I am focusing on are putting the right resources behind JANUVIA in order to
change the current TRx trend. And I believe the most important thing to watch is the TRx trend. And what we need to
do as we go into 2014 is to ensure that we don't continue to see TRx volume losses.
The fact that we still have greater than 70% market share despite four DPP-4s in the marketplace tell you that we have
a very strong position. We are losing a little bit of market share each month, but you would expect that with four
competitors. The real key is that the DPP-4 market and the branded oral anti-diabetic market isn't growing. Typically
when you have four or five new branded products in the market, you see growth in the market and you see expansion of
the market. We're not seeing that right now in the United States. So we have to focus on moving patients that are
currently sulfonylureas – on sulfonylureas to JANUVIA or make sure that JANUVIA is seen as the likely next step
after metformin, before sulfonylureas.

Outside the U.S., it's a very different story. Outside the U.S., we still have about 70% market share. We saw 15%
growth year-over-year and, despite losing a little bit of market share in markets here and there, the overall market is
continuing to grow. So with the market growth that we're seeing outside the U.S., that's why we're still able to see very
strong volume growth despite losing a small amount of market share.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Thanks, Adam. So, Jami, I'll come back on your PGM question. In fact just to restate, in the
third quarter this year, our PGM was about 74% and that's compared to 75.2% last year. And really, most of that
year-over-year impact is what we've been indicating all along, which is the generic impact of having SINGULAIR go
off patent both in the U.S. and in Europe. And obviously, SINGULAIR was a very high PGM product. So that's
primarily the driver of that.
On a sequential basis, we actually had some additional product mix as we went into the second and third quarter, and in
the second quarter we actually benefited from some productivity gains. Now foreign exchange was really a minor
impact actually in the third quarter year-over-year. So that's not a big driver this time. Much more the impact of these
patent expirations. But I do want to mention, while we're talking about PGM, is we do have an ongoing multi-year
effort to run our manufacturing network in a more and more efficient manner. We've made great progress so far, and
you'll recall, back at the time of the merger, we had 95 plants around the world. And today we're down to about 68 sites
around the world.
So great progress already, and that – the productivity from that continues to come through. And so at this point, what
you're seeing on the PGM line is nice productivity gains from all that work and those actions. But we do see, on the
other hand, the impact of the expiries, as well as pricing pressure that we've all talked about, which tightens up the
PGM line as well.
So it's a bit of a balancing, and what we've indicated is that, for this year, for 2013, we expect PGM to be down at least
or more than one point versus prior year on a full-year basis. We haven't given guidance yet for next year, but I mean
obviously we're down now, at this point, where we're out of a lot of the SINGULAIR expiry impact. SINGULAIR went
off patent and actually the sales declined very rapidly, as you know. So as we go into 2014, we'll see other things
coming into effect, such as the AstraZeneca joint venture and others. But basically, most of that LOE impact is done as
far as SINGULAIR is concerned. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. A couple questions, please. The company reiterated that both R&D and SG&A
would be below 2012. But with only one more quarter to go, I'm wondering if you could say how much below they
would be. And secondly, to what do you attribute the weakness in China? Other than GlaxoSmithKline, most other
companies have continued to deliver good growth in China, despite the investigation. So what can you tell us about
China? Thank you.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hi, Steve. It's Peter. Why don't I take the first question on the operating expenses? So, at this
point, we haven't given guidance further than that. The one thing I would like to highlight, Steve and I mentioned on
the call – on my comments earlier, is that in R&D we did have some timing impacts that actually – our guidance on a
full-year basis hasn't changed much; it's just tightened the range. And so really, in that regard, the second half of the
year is pretty much as our guidance had stood previously. It's just that we actually got a little lighter spending the third
quarter, and we expect with the start-up of some of the activity on SGLT2, as well as our growing drive against PD-1
and the broadening clinical trial base that's going on in that program, we expect to see R&D pick up some of that. So on
a full-year basis we're still in the same neighborhood.
On China, I'll turn that over to Adam.

<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Great.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, hi, Steve. In China, our underlying demand remains strong, and we did see some
hospital inventory declines associated with the current situation there. There is nothing specific to Merck versus the
other multinational companies. There was some timing of tenders that occurred, but overall we're seeing better
performance this month than we did last month versus the prior month. So there's nothing that you should think of
different for us versus the other multinational companies and what they faced in China.
The other thing affecting our emerging markets performance this quarter was wholesaler inventory levels in Mexico.
We saw very strong growth in Brazil, Korea, Russia and Turkey, and we expect you'll see better emerging market
growth in the fourth quarter of this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, Ken, you mentioned you were focused on what's strategic, what is not strategic. I was
wondering if you could just remind us exactly what is strategic and what is non-strategic. And then is there any way
you can help quantify us the tender so we understand how much moved third to fourth quarter for some of these
emerging markets? Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. Thank you very much for the question, Marc. Let me take a step back and try to
frame the strategy issues from my perspective. So I'd start with what we announced on October 1, which was that we
intend to drive additional efficiencies while sharpening our focus on R&D and within the commercial business to
prioritize what we believe are the key programs and markets that will drive our future growth. And so we talked about
the importance of vaccines going forward. We talked about the importance of diabetes going forward. We talked about
the importance of our oncology portfolio which is driven largely by the anti-PD-1 opportunities that we believe we'll be
working on for the next decade, frankly. We also talked about our hospital products area.
So those would be four that we actually cited as being the most important to our future growth. But as we go through
this, I think what we are also focusing on is we are now getting past our major loss of exclusivity period as well as the
end of our JV with AstraZeneca. So as part of all of that prioritization, you should expect to see us focus more on those
areas that I identify, but at the same time, you might look to see us divest products and programs and potentially
businesses such as our recent announcement with Aspen which will impact 2014.
Our strategic plan has multiple levers for running the business over the long term while being mindful that there are
still short-term opportunities. Let me be clear, as I said, we are evaluating all of our options to fund the right programs
for the future of the company because we know that successful R&D will be our long-term competitive advantage.
As Peter Kellogg mentioned, another strategic asset we have is that we have a strong balance sheet that will afford us
the opportunity to accelerate business development which is a real and important opportunity for Merck. We'll also
look for ways to continue to return cash to our shareholders. You've seen us raise our dividend over the past two years.
We're constantly evaluating if we can do more, because this is the primary way that we can return cash to our
shareholders. And we announced the $15 billion buyback, an accelerated effort through the ASR.
So we're also, finally, as I mentioned, looking at our complementary businesses of animal health and consumer care
always to determine whether these businesses are more advantageous inside or outside the company. So as I would say,
we have multiple levers we can pull to fund our growth over the long term while being mindful of the short-term needs,
but the most important ones are the areas of major focus in R&D and the main programs that Roger has talked about
like our anti-PD-1 program and our HCV portfolio.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: And, Marc, I'll – with regard to tenders, we don't break out our specific tender sales. And in
fact, we're still working to win some for the fourth quarter. So you're always working through the quarter to win as

many of the tenders as you can. And then once you win them, it's how fast you can ship and whether you ship in the
fourth quarter or the first quarter for those winning tenders. But [ph] what I ask you though is (41:03) from a bigger
picture perspective, in the first quarter we grew 8% in emerging markets, in the second quarter we grew 10% in
emerging markets. I'm saying the third quarter is an anomaly at 2% and we believe that the fourth quarter will be
stronger growth than what you saw in the third quarter, which will be partially due to tenders but there will be other
reasons with the underlying dynamics of our business.

Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much. Can you hear me?
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Yeah, Seamus. Good morning.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Okay. Great. Just a couple of questions for Ken, maybe. First off, can you walk us
through a little bit of the sales and the weakness in the animal health business? And your thoughts there on the timing
issues and what the underlying trends are in that business that are specific to the Intervet business – or, sorry, the Merck
Animal Health business. And then separately, for Roger. Roger, can you give us again a little bit of your thoughts on
odanacatib? I think at a recent meeting that you held with sell-side analysts you mentioned that you were trying to push
to bring a resolution to that program, whether it be a positive or a negative resolution, associated with the ongoing trial
for odanacatib. So just wondering if you could provide us with an update there? Thanks very much.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks, Seamus. I'll start with Animal Health. The first thing as I said is the underlying
fundamentals of the business remains solid despite what we saw this quarter. As you know, we voluntarily
implemented the temporary sale suspension of Zilmax in the United States and Canada to work with our industry
partners to provide the data that will reaffirm confidence in Zilmax, which remained an FDA approved product. It's too
early to speculate on when we will resume Zilmax sales in the United States and Canada, but again from my
perspective, we continue to believe that there are favorable macro trends that will help us drive growth in our Animal
Health business going forward.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, and Seamus, with respect to odanacatib, yes, exactly, I mean just keep in mind
again as was announced some time ago, we have a data safety and monitoring committee that halted the base study
early for robust efficacy and the favorable benefit risk profile. Those were the words they used. So we have to take that
seriously. We know what's underlying all of this. The point is, though, that in order to complete the odanacatib study,
we need to have a full intention to treat data set that captures all individuals who were enrolled and exposed to
investigational product and provides the basis for adjudication of all effects in those patients. And to that end, we've
been pursuing that. We are making very good progress. We'll get all of that information tidied up.
At that point, I think we're prepared to say, all right, we've got it in hand. Now let's actually look in detail at the benefit
risk profile and know therefore how the drug can be used. Our expectation is still that we should be in a position to file
in 2014 as we'd indicated previously. We're continuing along that path, and I think we're making good progress now in
getting the last few bits of data from the many, many sites of course that were involved in this 16,000 patient study.

<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Hi, yes, this is Tim Anderson at Sanford Bernstein. A couple questions, both for Roger.
On your BACE inhibitor program, assuming that the safety trial, the Phase II trial, comes out clean, are you still fully
committed to taking that into Phase III development? The second question is on your PD-1. Still trying to understand
the rationale for Merck running a 1,000-patient Phase I trial with other companies that are doing similar dose-ranging
cohort expansion studies, their studies are at a fraction of this size. So I am wondering why yours would be so big and
whether you are hoping that those cohorts could be big enough that you could use this as an early to market strategy?
And the reason I ask that question is because a couple of times in the past few months, you sometimes alluded to the
JANUVIA experience where you surprised the market by being first to market in the U.S. when a lot of folks thought
another company was ahead of you.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. Tim, first of all, on base, yeah, we have a safety run-in study which is then
followed by the Phase III study in individuals with mild to moderate impairment. And that study is definitely going
forward. And I guess I should just highlight here the magnitude of the problem is something that we're all aware of.
The genetic data supporting the focus of beta secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein and the production of
the abeta peptide simply couldn't be stronger. And the challenge is to know whether in individual who've already
suffered some degree of neurologic damage whether inhibition of beta secretase enhance the reduction in abeta
production, which we have shown takes place in people in CSF whether that's meaningful. And I think we all need to
know that. We need to know the answer to that question. It's hugely important for all of us. And I think all of us should
have our fingers crossed that it actually works because there's a desperate need for new therapy in this area.
And secondly with respect to PD-1, yes, we do have over 1,000-patient Phase I trial which was designed to have
sub-studies that permit exploration of dose and schedule as well as looking at other tumor types, and we have set it up
in exactly that way in order to be able to acquire sufficient data to know exactly how to proceed in registration enabling
studies, and it's of course we have a very large number of patients, as you know, that we are now treating with our
3475. The data are coming in, and as we become persuaded that there's something there that would really provide
benefit to people, we'll certainly be having those discussions with the agency. Again, as you know, we have
breakthrough designation, and so we are in a position to have discussions fairly frequently and are certainly doing so.
But I can't tell you what that means, in terms of our ultimate filing strategy.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thank you, Tim, for the questions. And, Andrea, next caller?

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. I'd love to go back to some remarks that you
made, Ken, about – I don't have the quotes in front of me, earlier on the call, about possibly looking at possibly
divesting certain businesses like animal health and consumer. I felt like that was the strongest language you've used to
date, and I just want your comments on that. Am I over-reading that? And then if you were to make a decision on that,
would that be something that you could – do you think you could – is that a decision that you think could be made in
the 2014 timeframe? Or as shareholders and analysts should we be thinking about that possibly taking a little bit of a
longer time?
And then for Roger if I might, back to the BACE, follow-up to Tim's question. Notice that you started – or at least you
put up on ClinTrials.gov (sic) [ClinicalTrials.gov] (49:08), a large MCI trial. I was wondering if you could talk about
the rationale for starting or at least putting that trial up on ClinTrials.gov (sic) [ClinicalTrials.gov] (49:19). I noticed
also in that trial you cut the highest dose. Maybe you could just talk about what we should read into the fact that you
cut the highest dose, if anything. Thank you.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thank you, Mark. Let me just say that what I was trying to convey is, just as we're looking
across our R&D and commercial portfolio and sharpening our focus on each of the assets there, so too with respect to
animal health and the consumer care, I would say we're currently evaluating those businesses, the way we're evaluating
everything, to figure out whether those businesses produce the most value inside our portfolio or outside our portfolio. I

did not mean to imply anything whatsoever with respect to timing. But I would say, again, we are currently evaluating
those businesses, just as we're sharpening our focus on every aspect of our business.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, Mark, it's Roger. With respect to BACE, there has always been the concern. And
we've discussed it in many different contexts in these calls, that though beta secretase inhibition may be enormously
useful in delaying the onset of dementia, it may be necessary to go in quite early. And the question is, when do you go
in? The genetic data says, we believe there would be a very strong effect of beta secretase inhibition if you could start
very, very early. But on the other hand, we can't do a 20-year or 30-year outcome study.
So the goal is to try and go early enough to make sure that we will see an effect, and hence we had always planned to
do a prodromal study. We posted the prodromal study. It's on ClinicalTrials.gov, as it's in the planning stage, and we
are working to come up with exactly how that will be done. And I don't think you should read anything more into it
than that, but I think it – we still or I still regard this as a hugely important program for us, and for people around the
world.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: I'm from Citi. Two questions. Firstly, I think, Adam, you said that the DPP-4 TRx must
grow; JANUVIA/JANUMET franchise must grow. I mean it's doing minus 5 to [ph] minus cents (51:26) year-on-year,
right now. Given the SABRE data from one of your competitors, net-net didn't exactly enhance the outlook for the
class. And given the competitive pressures, what is there that's going to drive that growth? Presumably, it's not
marketing. You've obviously got the SGLT2 combination, but that's still somewhat far off. And then secondly, one of
your competitors just took their LAG-3 in combination with the PD-1. When should we expect the first combination
trials with MK-3475? Particularly, if you could reference your intention, to take vicriviroc back into the clinic in
combination with PD-1, again timing? Many thanks
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Thank you. I'll discuss, first, the TRx trend for JANUVIA. And currently, if you look at
the IMS data, on a weekly basis we're seeing about a 2% to 2.5% decline in TRxs. And I would encourage you to focus
on the TRx volume because that's what's most closely correlated to overall sales. And what I'm trying to say is that in
order for us to grow for next year, what we have to do is see a change in that volume. If that volume continues to
decline, obviously it's going to be a problem for us to grow. I do think there are some things that we're doing right now
in order to help us find ways to grow. And I'll give you a few examples.
Number one, we've spent a lot of our time defending our market share versus competition. And I think we've done a
very good job of defending our market share, and I think you can see that by the fact that in the United States, we have
well over 70% share, closer to 75% share of the DPP-4 class. What we have not been able to do is to get the class to
grow by moving patients from sulfonylureas or to use DPP-4s prior to sulfonylureas. I think that our sales forces have
been distracted by focusing on market share. We now have representatives that are solely dedicated to focusing on
market growth and trying to move share from sulfonylureas to JANUVIA. And I think that should help us. In addition
to that, we've seen the impact of the new competitors, and I think for the most part they've begin to level off. So I think
that now we can start to focus again away from market share and more market growth.
With regard to the outcomes trials, I think that any positive outcomes trials in the DPP-4 class should be helpful to the
entire class. And as you may recall, our TECOS study will read out at the end of 2014. The other thing that we have in
horizon is the MK-3102, which I believe will be a very important compound and potentially could have people start on
a DPP-4 even earlier than they do today. And then you also mentioned that have an SGLT2 as well as an SGLT2
combination with JANUVIA. So I believe the diabetes class is an important one for us today and it will be important
for us in the future. Today it's about maximizing JANUVIA and trying to move business from sulfonylureas over to
JANUVIA. In the future, we'll be able to have 3102 as well as SGLT2 and SGLT2 combination.

<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Let me just add that, as I said in my comments, we are very focused on strengthening
JANUVIA in the United States for all the reasons that Adam just stated. But it's also important to remember that we
have another set of opportunities in our portfolio, including vaccines, immunology, HIV, and others. And so even in a
quarter where we actually had less than positive growth in the U.S. for JANUVIA, we're still able to grow our 4% our
GHH portfolio. So I just want to make sure that we are also focused as a company and ask others to remember that we
have multiple things in our broad portfolio.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: I think that's an important note, Ken. And as we've continued to focus on JANUVIA, of
course we will find ways to ensure that we are maximizing the potential in our vaccine business, which showed very
significant growth this quarter to maximize REMICADE and SIMPONI and the other products in the portfolio. So I
want to assure you that although we have significant focus on JANUVIA, we are also focusing on our other growth
drivers, because I think that those enable us to show things like 7% underlying growth in the U.S. when you adjust for
the patent expiration, it allows us to grow 4% on a global basis.
Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So, Andrew, at a high level, first of all, the expectation is that having demonstrated that
there is activity for 3475, that we want to look at combinations with conventional chemotherapies, and some of that's
already underway, with targeted chemotherapies, more novel targeted chemotherapies. Combinations with other
immunomodulators, and then other novel agents that are active in relevant tumor types where we know that 3475 has
some evidence of an effect. Now, you should expect that you're going to see a number of those combinations getting
posted very soon, and in particular as I've indicated before on prior calls, we've had a group working in the background
before PD-1 actually on the sets of immunoregulatory molecules on the lymphocyte cell surface that could potentially
be important in responses. And a lot of that is coming to fruition and is right now in studies that are enabling for entry
into humans.
So I would expect all of those things to be coming forward at more or less the same time early on in 2014, and that's
when you should expect to start seeing a lot of those combinations come. There's an enormous amount of work to be
done. And more or less to the point that Ken made, we're going to be studying this molecule and how best to use it for a
very, very long time because it's responsive in a lot of tumor types. So there's a huge amount of work to be done here to
find out how best to use 3475 and to bring the benefits of this therapy to patients who so desperately need it.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Andrew. Andrea, next question?

Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. I have two questions. First on animal health, I understand that cattle was
weak due to the recall of Zilmax. But is there any way that you can break out Merck's growth in cattle excluding
Zilmax?
Then second, for Dr. Perlmutter, could you please provide an update on MK-1293, your insulin glargine [ph] meto
(58:11) that was moving into late-stage testing recently? Are you moving that forward, or divesting it? And also, maybe
you could just comment on the insulin facility that you recently completed building in Virginia and whether that will be
moved forward or divested. Thank you.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: On animal health, let me start with Animal Health. Zilmax was a major issue. I would also
say that across the board this quarter, it wasn't the strongest quarter, but I come back to the point that I made before,
which is that there are favorable macro trends for these businesses, and we continue to expect very good growth going
forward.

<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, David, with respect to our programs, we have been looking at a variety of
different ways to assist in the therapy of patients with diabetes. We haven't disclosed any information about how we
might move forward in that area, so I really don't have any comments about that. I wonder if you were thinking about
our recently approved vaccine production facility, but in any case, we'll have more information for you on advancing
our diabetes franchise and therapy for diabetic patients in the future.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: I should also point out on the animal health that this quarter we had plus 2% growth
overall, if you adjust for exchange, et cetera.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions, Dave. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on the autoimmune franchise; and it seems
like you had a nice quarter there. My question is really around the future and what impact do you think biosimilars
might have, especially once we get into 2015. And I guess specifically is on the impact to REMICADE, a biosimilar
might have on REMICADE, but also on a related product like SIMPONI.
And then the second one is on hepatitis C. Obviously, positive news you have gotten there from the FDA, and the data
does look good. Just wondering if there's other answers you're going to need. We have to wait, obviously, for the data,
but just in terms of other answers you might need from Phase II; or is this something that might be moving to Phase III
quickly? Is 2017 a reasonable timeframe to assume that this might be something that could get to the market? Any
color there would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So I'll go ahead and take the REMICADE and SIMPONI question. If you look at
REMICADE and SIMPONI we had combined growth of about 16% ex-foreign exchange this quarter where
REMICADE was 12%, SIMPONI was about 40%. If you look at the REMICADE growth, there was some benefit due
to timing and tenders. If you exclude that, our growth rate was in the mid-single digits. And I also believe that
SIMPONI will represent the strongest growth opportunity, particularly with the UC approval that we had last month
and we're continuing to prepare for launch.
If you look at the biosimilars, we anticipate biosimilars in smaller markets next year. And if you look at those markets,
they represent less than 20% of our current REMICADE business. So we believe that we'll continue to be successful
overall with REMICADE in the markets that are the largest markets where there won't be biosimilars, and we don't
believe that having a biosimilar REMICADE should necessarily impact the sales as we move forward with SIMPONI.
Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Vamil, with respect to the HCV program, you know I can't provide explicit timing
for you. I would just say as I mentioned we have a portfolio of molecules. We have breakthrough designation of course,
as we've indicated for the combination of 5172 and 8742, but there are other molecules as well. And I think the key is
getting to an all-oral pan-genotypic ribavirin-free regimen that is useful in patients irrespective of co-morbidities.
And that's an important thing to keep in mind, right, because these patients who have chronic HCV infection are in
general elderly patients who have other things going on. So it'd be important that whatever drug cocktails are used in
these patients in order to cure them of HCV, that these be things that are tolerable and can be used even with co-morbid
situation. So we're focusing on all of that. Very excited about where we are in the program, and we're going to move it
forward just as quickly as we can.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Can I make a correction in response to Dave Risinger's question? I think I said that the
Animal Health sales was 2% ex-exchange. And it's ex-exchange, and it's also excluding Zilmax.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Okay. Thank you. Andrea, next question?

Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question for Ken. As you look back and reflect on your
2013 plan and the pushes and pulls there, what are some of the things that you really like that materialized? And then
what are some of those things that you saw in the 2013 plan that could have been done better for the 2014 planning
process?
And then a question for Roger Perlmutter. If you look at Merck's regulatory track record historically, the company has
had an impeccable regulatory track record. But if you look at the last seven programs that you put into registration, you
received three Complete Response Letters including a request for additional data. Very uncharacteristic of the
company. What are you doing going forward to help improve that to basically your standard, which was an impeccable
track record, especially in light of the new products that you're putting into clinical development?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. Why don't I start with the 2013 plan issues? I would start to say the things I guess
that were the most negative things versus assumptions, obviously JANUVIA U.S. growth we had hoped would be
stronger. Also, the impact of our hepatitis C category in terms of Victrelis's growth and PegIntron's growth given the
warehousing of patients were things that we wish had gone better. On the other hand, I think in a year of patent
expiries, being able to continue to drive underlying growth in vaccines, immunology, HIV, are all important.
Geographically continuing to be in the emerging markets and doing well in the emerging markets year-to-date, I think
is also a very positive thing. The biggest things that make me excited, though, if I have to look past any particular
quarter, and when you see things like the breakthrough designations for our anti-PD-1 and for our HCV program, those
are the things that I think are the most important to the company going forward, and those are the areas where we want
to continue to be focused where we can drive the greatest amount of growth going forward.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: If I can add to that, Ken. The one thing I would add also is that in 2013 we just saw an
exceptionally strong impact from the Japanese yen forex and we just probably didn't see that coming quite as much,
and that's what caused us to – that combined with the devaluation in Venezuela caused us to change our guidance for
this year. But again, I think that against that and some of the points you had, we've had a very proactive cost
management response so that basically I think definitely we're now set up for it as we go forward in 2014 to [ph]
continue to manage well (1:05:44) in this environment. And the foreign exchange rates have stabilized, the euro has
come back a bit, so we'll have to kind of watch that. Obviously Venezuela continues to be a topic that we'll all have to
watch as we go forward, in all years going forward. But in general, I think that we shouldn't miss how big the impact
was with the yen and the Venezuela valuation this year. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, John, I have to say that I think that you – it is the case that I'm not happy with
where we stand in terms of how our organization has been able to deliver documents that meet regulatory guidelines. I
just am really not happy with that. And as a result, I have been leaning into this process very, very heavily. There is no
single explanation for what has gone on over the last few years. First of all, of course there are issues with respect to
study design, and complexity in study design always makes it challenging to deliver data sets that are interpretable on
first pass. There are also issues related to study execution. There are complexities associated with this. And then there
is the fact that there have been many studies, there has been large outcome studies and those have their own challenges
associated with them.
Suffice it to say there are a number of issues that I've identified and that we're working to correct. We are doing a lot to
improve the management of our safety data and our good clinical practice approach. I'm very pleased that we have a
new head of global safety who will be joining us next month. We also are bringing in some additional people to shore
this up. I'm confident that we can get to a point where we and the FDA can work together in a way to bring files
forward that pass muster right from the beginning and that's my goal.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thank you very much. Roger, just on 3475, tomorrow there will be some data presented in
Sydney, and I am just curious. What should we be mindful of looking at, given it is a Phase I trial? Second, the SMR
conference is in November. Again, would you mind making some statements about what we should be mindful of that
Merck will present at that point? And then finally, will there be other data readouts between now and ASCO where
Merck may present top-line data? Thank you very much.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, Tony, so with respect to the 3475 lung cancer data, again, it's a small data set, but
I think that what we're learning as its playing from the abstract, and what you'll see is that there clearly is evidence of
response. And looking at the nuances of those responses in particular whether or not there are characteristics of patients
that have predictive value with respect to response, I think that could prove to be very important. And certainly I would
look at that. We're going to have more data that will be coming out at all the major scientific meetings including SMR,
AACR is going on I believe in February and there will be more data presented there'd before ASCO too. So we have a
lot of studies going on, and we will have the opportunity to make sure that in the appropriate scientific forums we
present data that place 3475 therapy in the context of what can be done for patients with a widely disseminated
malignant disease.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Great.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Thank you, Tony. And, Andrea, I think we have time for just one more caller.
Operator
Yes, sir. And your last question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much. Just had a couple questions here. Maybe the first one for Ken, just
coming back to strategic alternatives on Animal Health and Consumer. When you talk about evaluating whether it's
more advantageous for these businesses to be part of Merck or not, can you help us understand? Is that decision based
on whether these businesses could operationally perform better inside or outside of Merck, or whether these businesses
would be worth more or be more valuable to shareholders inside or outside of Merck?
My second question was on PD-1. It just was two questions. Maybe the first one in lung, can you just elaborate a little
bit more about how you are thinking about PDL-1 status and the role that is going to play in the development of the
category? I think there's been some debate on this topic given some of the responses in PDL-1 negative patients we've
seen in some studies. And my second question was when we think about additional tumors beyond melanoma and lung
that you're looking at, what are you most excited about there? And what does the science suggest in terms of likelihood
of success relative to some of the initial tumors where we've seen activity so far? I'm just trying to understand, again,
when you look at those additional areas you're looking, which one should we really be focused on? Thanks very much.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: So, Chris, first with respect to your question about animal health and consumer, whether
it's the operational issues or the value to shareholders, it's both. And at the end of the day, our goal is to maximize
long-term cash flow for our shareholders, and we are looking at these businesses like we do everything else versus
other opportunities that would allow us to drive that long-term cash flow.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Chris, it's Roger. For PDL-1, the – first of all, I think we know already as is typical
in malignant disease that PDL-1 is not an exclusive biomarker. Right. It's not the case that only those individuals whose
tumors have expressed PDL-1 are going to be responsive and hence there's a reason, depending upon the magnitude of
the response and the degree of adverse effects, to think about treating with PD-1 even in those who are PDL-1 negative.

The question is what is the correlation and does it differ from one tumor type to the other; and can you use it as a way
to begin to focus your attention on different patient subsets. And I think more data are coming out on that. I think
there'll be more data that will be available coming up at the lung cancer meetings and then at meetings after that. So
that's a useful thing to look at.
The second thing is when you think about where else to go with PD-1, and one of the advantages of having 1,000
patient Phase I study that focuses on many groups but including all epithelial tumors is that we have a chance to look at
individuals in whom we see evidence of response and ask can we tell from that whether there might be subsets of
patients who would really benefit. And from that we roll out more focused studies. That's what we're doing. And you'll
have a chance to see those data as I indicated.
There's now quite a number of different tumors that we are exploring directly. We've announced previously that we're
doing work in triple negative breast, for example, and head and neck cancer and uroepithelial tumors and all of these
areas, we have found evidence for therapeutic effect. The question is, how good is it? How do you use this drug, in
combination with others? There's a lot of work to be done here. But I'd just say, from my perspective, the breadth of
responsiveness is quite impressive and suggests that we could have a very, very active agent here that would prove to
be useful in a number of different settings.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Okay. Let me just close by saying, this was another solid quarter driven by vaccines, immunology and HIV businesses.
Going forward, I have to say that none of us are pleased with the JANUVIA performance in the United States, and
we're going to continue to focus our efforts and our investments on making JANUVIA in the U.S. stronger going
forward.
We are obviously focusing on reducing costs, but reducing them in a way that doesn't compromise this company's
long-term ability to do that which it's here to do, which is to do the innovation that actually makes a huge difference to
patients and payers and to society, in general. In that regard, we're very pleased with the breakthrough designation that
we got for our HCV regimen. We're also very excited and hopeful about the interim lung data for anti-PD-1, as well as
the future for this therapy going forward.
So in the end, I would say that we continue to plug on here at Merck. We're hoping to drive greater growth as we go
forward, and we're very much focused on our pipeline as the main means for doing that. Both our internal pipeline, as
well as a reinvigorated approach to business development.
Thank you very much, and I look forward to speaking to you soon.
