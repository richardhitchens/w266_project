MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the NIKE's Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. For those who
need to reference today's press release, you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our reports filed with the SEC,
including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q.
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues
for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations,
discounts, and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including
equipment; NIKE Golf, Converse, and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market
footprints of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.
Participants may also reference to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial
measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP
measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.

Kelley Hall
Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fourth quarter and fiscal
year 2013 results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our
website, investors.nikeinc.com.
Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Charlie Denson, President
of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an
in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like
to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your
initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to
re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your help with this.
I'd now like to turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thanks, Kelley. As you know, last week we announced strategic management changes for our organization. Chief
among them the decision by Charlie Denson to move on from his role with NIKE. Yes, he leaves some huge shoes to
fill, but luckily that's the business we're in, filling shoes, but more on that in a minute.
First, a bit of context on my leadership team going forward. I won't go through all the names here, but many of them
are people you already know. Even more important, they know NIKE and they know each other. They bring
tremendous passion, energy and chemistry to our future. And some people will be providing leverage and continuity
from their existing positions, while others will be assuming new roles. These changes reflect our successes and our
biggest opportunities and they represent five very specific and ongoing commitments.
Number one, to accelerate our innovation agenda. Two, to elevate design. Three, optimize our category and
go-to-market strategies. Four, to integrate product creation and merchandising to create greater continuity from design
all the way through to retail. And five, to sharpen our focus on supply chain and manufacturing improvements.
We spend a lot of time developing our leadership talent and that's something that never stops. It allows us to adapt and
evolve our competitive offense and that's what you can expect as this team takes NIKE into the future.
Now to fiscal year 2013, which was an important year for NIKE and our industry; new innovations and technologies
continued to accelerate the pace of change in the industry and our business, and we're focused on leading those
changes. In fiscal year 2013 that created greater differentiation and separation for NIKE and that's key to expanding our
leadership position.
In fiscal 2013, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8% to over $25 billion. It's interesting, it took us 18 years to get to our first $2
billion in revenue and we added about that much in just the last 12 months. Gross margins were up slightly for the year
in a challenging macroeconomic environment and earnings per share grew 11% to $2.69.
So how did we do that? Well, we delivered a relentless flow of innovation to consumers across categories that
generated tremendous commercial success and we have a pipeline full and staged for the future. We leveraged and
drew inspiration from the never-ending energy of sports around the world; the Olympics, the Euro Champs, the BCS
and Super Bowl, March Madness and the NBA playoffs. These are among the moments that inspire NIKE to create and
display our best work and we connect with the best athletes and teams to do that.
We also collaborated with retail partners to expand capacity in the marketplace and our own DTC business is hitting on
all cylinders. That's in-line, factory stores and online. Those two things together are driving the marketplace
transformation we talk so much about. In short, our brands, our products and our distribution have never been stronger.

We also continue to get better and better at financial management and operational discipline, which helps us leverage
our portfolio to deliver strong results for NIKE, Inc. in total. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we're well
positioned to capture more growth in developed and developing markets and deliver more value to shareholders today
and over the long-term.
I talk a lot about the power of our portfolio and it starts with a focus group of powerful brands that have deep
connections with consumers. In fiscal 2013, revenue for our continuing other businesses, and that means Converse,
NIKE Golf, and Hurley, grew 9% to $2.5 billion, while EBIT grew at twice the rate of revenue. At Converse, fiscal
year 2013 was paced by a strong growth in key international markets, with revenues up double digits in the recently
converted markets of China and the UK. Franchised product like Chuck Taylor delivered record sales again and the
brand's strong position in style and music continues to connect with young consumers around the world. This helped
Converse deliver $1.4 billion in reported revenue for the year.
NIKE Golf also delivered a strong year with revenues up 9% to nearly $800 million, powered by the launch of
innovative products like the Covert Clubs, Lunar Control in footwear and the new TW '13 shoe. And revenues at
Hurley grew 5%, actually outpacing the Action Sports industry.
In fiscal 2013, we also divested Cole Haan and Umbro. It was the right decision, enabling us to focus our capital and
our leadership talent on our highest potential growth opportunities. Of course, the most powerful part of our portfolio is
the NIKE Brand, where revenues grew 9% to a record $23 billion for the year. The two big market stories continued to
be China and North America.
So China, first, where we continue to drive our strategy to reposition this market for sustainable and profitable growth.
As we've said, the reset requires discipline and patience. The race in China is a marathon, it's not a sprint, and we're set
up for the long run. We own the premium brand position and we partner with the most inspiring athletes. We're the
leader in performance innovation and we're making progress reducing inventory levels at retail and taking steps to
increase the productivity of retail space. Our path forward in China is clear, that's to create a pull market fueled by
innovative product, compelling and productive retail and strong brand connections with consumers. That's the core of
our success around the world and it's setting us up for the next wave of growth in China.
In North America, revenue in fiscal 2013 exceeded $10 billion as we added $1.5 billion of new revenue in this
geography alone. That growth was broad based across all product types and our wholesale and DTC business and
across nearly all key NIKE Brand categories. And it was extraordinarily profitable growth as EBIT for the geography
grew 25% to $2.5 billion. Our performance in North America shows the real power of our category offense and our
strategy of innovative products, strong brand connections and premium distribution is equally powerful and relevant
around the world.
We have many global competitive advantages, but the most important one is innovation. It inspires us and it
distinguishes us as a company. Innovation drives everything at NIKE. It gives us new technologies and materials, helps
us create iconic products and services that people want and the game changers they can't even imagine. Innovation gets
us closer to the athletes and consumers. It shatters the traditional methods of manufacturing and distribution and
bridges the physical and digital worlds of sport. Innovation makes NIKE more competitive, more sustainable and
profitable.
I believe there is more opportunity in the world and more capability inside NIKE than ever before and that's why we're
accelerating our innovation agenda. I call it innovation squared, where we can deliver more new ideas and solutions
faster than ever before. And we're leveraging those across our sport categories, geographies and brands, amazing things
in the market right now from NIKE and even more in the pipeline.
So as we look into fiscal 2014, you can certainly expect us to train more and compete harder than anybody else. We're
athletes and that's what we do.
We're set to grow to explore, refine and leverage our leadership position. We have scale, power and passion and we're
not shy about using them to support the athletes, and by the way that means every athlete, to push ourselves and our
partners to connect more deeply with consumers and to grow this company and deliver more value to shareholders.

And finally on a more personal note, it's important to me to take a minute to thank two very special people and that's
Charlie Denson and Gary DeStefano, who have decided to retire after more than 30 years with NIKE. Gary played a
key role in leading our sales organization around the world, led teams in Asia-Pacific and the U.S. and for six years as
leader of our geography teams, he helped grow our brand and business around the world. Gary's impact on NIKE over
the past 30 years has been significant and I thank him for all he has done.
I've worked closely with Charlie Denson during most of his 34 years with NIKE and as you know, almost daily over
the last 10 years and I can tell you, you get to know somebody pretty well doing that. And what I know about Charlie is
that he is a brilliant an affable man, easy to respect and easy to like, obsessed with sports and the athletes and he has
incredible passion for the brand, and that's all a great combination.
Even more important, Charlie showed the next generation what it takes and what it means to be a NIKE leader, and we
go into the future stronger and more focused, thanks in large part to the example Charlie set over the last three decades.
Charlie is more than a colleague; he is a friend, a mentor and will always be part of the NIKE family.
So thanks, everybody. And now for the last time, here is Charlie to take you through the NIKE Brand.
Charles D. Denson
Thanks, Mark. That was nice. That was greatly appreciated.
Okay. Well, Q4 marked a strong finish to a record year for the NIKE Brand. A lot of that has to do with the power of
our category offense, but there are multiple dimensions in addition to category. We're able to push and pull levers
across the business and around the world to capture growth. Today, I want to focus on two of the most powerful levers
in our portfolio; geographies and key categories.
In the end, it's all about choices, focusing on the biggest and most promising opportunities for the NIKE Brand and our
choices helped deliver a very good fiscal 2013.
On a constant dollar basis, the NIKE Brand revenue was up 8% for the quarter and 11% for the year. For fiscal year
2013, we grew in every geography, except Greater China and across all of our key categories. NIKE Brand DTC
revenue increased 24% for the year with online sales up over 30% and global futures grew 8%. The MVP for the
quarter and the year really has to be North America.
Fiscal year 2013 was our first $10 billion year for North America, $10.4 billion to be exact. That brings incremental
revenue over the last three years to $3.7 billion. North America EBIT grew 25%. Their revenue grew 18% and their
inventory grew only 13%. At NIKE, when profits grow faster than revenue and revenue grows than inventory, we call
that the financial Triple Crown. And for fiscal 2013, most key categories grew at a double-digit rate, as did footwear,
apparel and equipment. So clearly, we upped our game in products, distribution and how we connect with consumers.
North America DTC delivered a record year for factory stores, in-line stores and online. Revenue increased 20% to
over $2.5 billion with double-digit comps in both our in-line and our factory concepts. E-commerce was up over 30%
and our work with our wholesale partners expanded the potential of the market and increased profitability. So a banner
year for North America, our biggest and most penetrated market. It's the best example of what is possible and it
illustrates the potential we have around the world. That said, we take nothing for granted in North America, or any
market for that matter. That's why we're continually committed to innovative products, strong brand connections and
premium distribution to continue to create short and long-term growth for the NIKE Brand.
Okay, let's talk a little bit about China. Mark mentioned, and has mentioned many times, discipline and patience. Those
are crucial to our growth path going forward. Our job is to build strong consumer connections and to increase market
capacity to fuel long-term growth; delivering innovative products and creating differentiation in the marketplace and
improving profitability and productivity at retail are the keys to our long-term success in the China marketplace.
Specifically on retail productivity, we're working with our partners to improve supply chain efficiency, accelerate
product flow and elevate store merchandising. That improves the experience for consumers; increases store

productivity and leads to profitable growth for the retailer and for NIKE.
We see the success of this work in our NIKE DTC stores and those partner doors that have been refitted with more
focused assortments and product stories. We're also seeing very strong performance in our new category doors. We
opened our first Running store and Basketball store in fiscal year 2013 with strong initial results. Overall, comp growth
at our own in-line and factory stores is up double digits. We also have initial executions with our retail partners open as
well, and we're seeing some promising initial results. These are all signs our strategy is working, so we'll continue to go
deeper with the consumer, expand our performance leadership position and elevate and expand the retail experience for
the consumer and our partners.
At the middle of all this is the strength of the NIKE Brand, and as the brand leader in this market, we're able to bring in
energy and presence nobody else can match. You're going to see that again this summer when LeBron, Kobe and Kevin
Durant for NIKE, as well as Carmelo, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook representing Brand Jordan head
back to China. If anything can match the excitement of Game 7, it's the reaction these guys get from the young Chinese
athletes. We have the roadmap to growth. The progress we've made to date confirms that, and we're committed to the
long-term solutions and potential in this amazing market.
Okay. Real quick, Western Europe; delivering some good results, especially in the north. We're expanding our number
one footwear position in the region, led by Running, and we're gaining share in Football across the continent.
Inventories are in good shape with European units essentially flat to prior year. In our emerging markets geography,
revenue is up 16% on the year and knocking on the door $4 billion in revenue. We see this geography continuing to
supply a strong growth story. One of the biggest contributing factors will be the energy coming out of Brazil with
World Cup followed by the Rio Olympics.
So let's move over to the category side. Since I'm handing out MVP awards, I have to give one to Running. For the
second year in a row, both Running footwear and apparel grew in every single geography, and that momentum
continues as we head into fiscal year 2014 with futures growing at a double-digit rate. Running is a tremendous success
story for NIKE, has been for more than 40 years. We lead in Running with innovative products, like NIKE Air, Lunar,
Flyknit-3 and Dri-FIT fabrications, all game-changers and examples of our commitment to the athlete.
We build Running on strong brand connections, like the NIKE Women's Half Marathon in Washington, D.C., which
sold out in a matter of hours, or through Nike+, which now has over 18 million members; and we build Running on
premium distribution through our own stores and online and partnerships like the Track Club with Finish Line and key
Running specialty distribution. Our commitment to serving the runner generated 18% constant-dollar growth in fiscal
year 2013, exceeding $4 billion in annual revenue. We've delivered 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth,
broad-based growth for both men and women. And Running is a big part of the momentum we're creating in the
Women's business, which was very strong in Q4. We have a hybrid strategy in Women's that combines Running,
Training and Sportswear. It's a cross category version of our amplified sports strategy and we have tremendous upside
here, especially in Sportswear.
And then there's Basketball. I'd say a co-MVP. Another category of worldwide leadership, March Madness, the NBA,
the Olympics, LeBron, KB, Kobe in leagues or on the playground, wherever the game is played with passion, NIKE
and Brand Jordan are there. A quick example for Q4.
We released the LeBron X, MVP shoe for LeBron's fourth MVP in five years. It sold through immediately. He is the
youngest player ever to win it four times and by the way rounding out the top five MVP vote getters were Kevin
Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant, a NIKE-Jordan sweep, or maybe as Mars Blackmon once said,
"It's Gotta Be the Shoes!"
Brand Jordan is selling 3X more today than when MJ was playing. That's the power of the brand at work. And we're
seeing even more upside as we continue to leverage our amplified sport model to increase revenue across both footwear
and apparel around the world. This is truly becoming a global brand and as FY 2013 revenues increase at a double-digit
pace in all of our NIKE Brand geographies. NIKE Basketball plus Jordan finished the year up 22% on a
currency-neutral basis.

Okay. The last category, Global Football; we're the best football brand in the world, bar none. In boots, cleat
technology, upper design, lightweight uniforms or protection from the ground up, we're the innovation leader in the
world's biggest game. And we get our insights from the best players and teams in the world. 15 years ago, we launched
the Mercurial boot and it changed the game for ever; lighter, more versatile and more beautiful.
We changed the game again in FY 2013 with the new Mercurial and the amazing Hypervenom. We had NIKE teams in
five different countries working on this boot. Neymar from Brazil laced it up and scored three goals in three games.
That's what happens when the best wear the best.
But the real story isn't what we did in FY 2013; it's going to be what's coming for World Cup. It's absolutely incredible
and that's all I'm going to say about that for now.
Q4 and fiscal 2013 showed a lot of what NIKE is capable of, but not all of it, not by a long shot. Mark talks about
doubling down on our innovation agenda, what he calls innovation squared. That will prove even more valuable as we
head into FY 2014 and beyond. We're looking at the Winter Olympics, the Super Bowl, the World Cup in Brazil, it's
moments like those on the world stage and the countless moments of athletes in every town and city in between that
brings out our best. It is what fuels our passion and our potential.
And finally, a couple of thoughts on this retirement thing; people have asked me, why would I retire? Well, I guess the
easiest way to answer that is because I can. But honestly, it's a good time to focus on a different path forward for me
and my family and the time is great for this type of transition. The brand is stronger than it's ever been, financially and
strategically. The company is in good hands with Mark and the new leadership, incredibly talented and focused and
really aligned with where NIKE is headed. And we've done a good job building our bench for the long-term, so all is
good here.
It's also important for me to thank all of you that have been with us over the years for your interest and insights as
we've grown this great company. 52 calls, almost as good as Joe DiMaggio, but that's a long time to listen to me talk.
And finally, I want to hank Don, Kelley, and the entire organization for their leadership and commitment to delivering
our long-term goals of shareholder value. And to Mark, a great partner, a great leader, and most importantly, a great
friend, and certainly to Phil for making it all possible. It's been a great ride. It's been a ton of fun.
Here's Don.
Donald W. Blair
Thanks, Charlie. You know I've followed Charlie on these conference calls for well over a decade and worked with him
for nearly 14 years. As CFO of NIKE, I could not have had a better partner. Charlie understands how all the dimensions
and aspects of our business fit together and he knows how to work the levers and while he claims he is not an expert on
financial management, he has the most important skill of all. He knows how to create value for our shareholders and
has done so year-after-year. That's a great legacy, but probably not the most important one. I think Charlie's greatest
legacy will be the people he has developed and inspired over the years and I count myself among them. Charlie, thank
you for 14 years of partnership and the great team you'll be leaving behind.
Here at NIKE, we have a list of 11 guiding principles we call our Maxims. The Maxims define our approach to the
business as we strive to reach NIKE's full potential. I think there are three Maxims that characterize our FY 2013
performance and speak to our ability to create shareholder value into the future. The first is NIKE is a company. More
specifically NIKE is a growth company made up of a broad portfolio of businesses. The diversity and flexibility of the
NIKE, Inc. portfolio helps us manage risk and allows us to leverage our strengths at scale, driving the kind of growth in
revenues, earnings and cash flow we're announcing today.
The second Maxim states, we are on the offense, always. This Maxim describes how we drive to create the future rather
than simply respond to it. We know that succeeding today isn't enough. We need to continue to raise our game if we are
to succeed in the future. That means, we must invest in deeper consumer connections, product and manufacturing
innovation and premium retail experiences, as well as the operational capabilities to support them. Over the last three

years, we've significantly ramped up our investments in these areas. As Mark often says, we believe our opportunities
are unlimited, but we realize our resources are not. Therefore, we'll continue to make disciplined investments, human
and financial, in the highest potential growth opportunities, while continuously editing and redeploying resources from
the less attractive ones. That's how we're able to invest in the future, while delivering profitable growth in the near
term.
Today's final Maxim is a personal favorite of mine; master the fundamentals. NIKE is a global company doing business
in an increasingly complex and volatile environment, yet we're consistently able to deliver results at the highest level.
That's because our strategies are focused and effective, our leadership teams are deep and capable, and our financial
strength is unmatched in the industry.
Three Maxims taken together highlight the focus and discipline that enabled us to deliver the fourth quarter and
full-year results I'll share with you now. For our continuing operations, full-year revenue for NIKE, Inc. reached $25.3
billion, up 8% as reported and up 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7% on a reported
basis and 9% currency neutral. On both a reported and currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders advanced
8%, led by double-digit growth in North America, emerging markets and Central and Eastern Europe.
Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 27% to $0.76, bringing full-year EPS to $2.69, up 11% versus the prior year. The
Q4 increase was driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and lower demand creation compared to the higher
event-driven spending last year. We also benefited from a lower tax rate and share count in this year's Q4. Gross
margin for the fourth quarter increased 110 basis points and was up slightly for the full year.
Our Q4 results reflect the benefits of higher selling prices and easing material costs, partially offset by the ongoing
impact of labor cost inflation, higher discounts, particularly in China and FX headwinds, primarily due to weaker
developing market currencies. In addition, about 70 basis points of the Q4 improvement reflected unusual costs in last
year's Q4 for digital R&D and a one-time customs assessment.
Gross margin for the quarter was better than we guided, largely due to a shift in supply chain investments from Q4 to
Q1 FY 2014 as well as stronger performance from our other businesses. Q4 demand creation spend was 13% below last
year's fourth quarter, which included heavy investments in the Euro Champs, Olympics and NFL launch. Operating
overhead grew 19% for the quarter, due to expansion of our DTC business, as well as continued investments to support
innovation and growth initiatives, particularly digital. The Q4 effective tax rate was 22.8%, better than we expected due
largely to a reduction in tax reserves related to foreign operations. Our full-year tax rate was 24.7%, roughly in line
with the prior year.
Year-end inventory grew 7%, below the rate of futures growth. Inventory on our books is in good shape overall with a
percentage of close-out inventory at historically low levels. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with $6
billion of cash and short-term investments on the books at yearend. FY 2013 ROIC reached 23.8% and we delivered
$2.4 billion of free cash flow, both significant increases versus FY 2012 and driven by improvements in working
capital productivity. During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in long-term debt at very low interest rates, giving us the
flexibility to finance our investments in the business, while continuing to increase cash returns to shareholders.
Now let's take a look at our performance by segment, starting with North America. As Mark and Charlie both
indicated, North America delivered an extraordinary year, as revenues reached $10.4 billion, up 18% versus FY 2012.
Q4 revenues increased 12% driven by strong growth across every category, led by Basketball, Men's Training,
Sportswear and Running. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 8%, while apparel and equipment each grew over
20%. Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 16% in Q4 as comp store sales increased 11%, marking the 14th consecutive
quarter of double-digit comp growth for NIKE-owned stores in North America. Q4 EBIT for North America grew 29%
due to robust revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.
In Western Europe, Q4 revenues were essentially flat on a currency-neutral basis in comparison to very strong sales in
advance of the Euro Champs and Olympics last year. Lower revenues in Italy and Iberia, both down over 20% for the
quarter, were offset by double-digit growth in our AGS territory, that's Austria, Germany and Switzerland, and nearly
40% growth in direct-to-consumer revenues. On a category basis, Running grew double-digits and our Basketball

business more than doubled. Growth in those two categories offset lower sales in our other key categories.
On a reported basis, Q4 revenues for Western Europe declined 1%, while EBIT increased 2%, driven by higher gross
margin. Central and Eastern Europe continued to deliver strong results in Q4. Revenues increased 11% on a
currency-neutral basis led by strong growth in Turkey and Russia. The geography reported double-digit revenue growth
for every category except Sportswear and Action Sports, which declined.
On a reported basis, Q4 revenues for CEE grew 9% and EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by lower demand
creation spending in comparison to last year's event-driven investments. In greater China, currency-neutral revenue
declined 1% in Q4 as double-digit growth in Performance Running and Basketball was offset by declines in other
categories, primarily Sportswear. On a reported basis, Q4 revenue in greater China was flat, while EBIT decreased 2%.
As we've discussed on previous calls, we're repositioning our business in China for sustainable, profitable growth. The
most critical step in returning this market to healthy growth is creating a more compelling, productive and profitable
retail marketplace. As Charlie noted, we're seeing some encouraging signs. For our largest retail partners, overall comp
store sales are growing and inventories are declining. Nevertheless, we still have a lot of work to do.
As we do that work, our reported results for China won't always follow a smooth trajectory and it's difficult to predict
how quickly we'll return to sustained growth. While China futures orders for the next six months are in line with last
year, we expect revenues for the first half of the fiscal year will be below last year as we continue to manage the
amount of product we ship into the market. At this point, we believe our revenue in China will stabilize around prior
year levels in the second half of this fiscal year.
In Japan, Q4 revenues increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis as every key category except Sportswear and Action
Sports grew. On a reported basis, Q4 revenue for Japan decreased 11%, reflecting the impact of the weaker yen. EBIT
declined 2%, as the drop in revenue was partially offset by lower SG&A.
Our emerging markets geography delivered another remarkable year in FY 2013, as revenues reached $3.7 billion, up
16% on a currency-neutral basis. Q4 revenues also grew 16% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in
Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Among the key categories, Running, Football, Women's Training and Action Sports
powered the growth. On a reported basis, Q4 revenue for the emerging markets grew 10% and EBIT increased 30%
due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and lower year-on-year demand creation spending.
Fourth quarter revenues for our other businesses increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit
growth in NIKE Golf and Hurley and 9% growth in Converse. On a reported basis, revenue grew 10%, while EBIT
increased 21%, driven by higher revenues and gross margins in each business.
Let me now turn to our expectations for FY 2014. We expect revenue for the first quarter of FY 2014 to grow at a mid
to high single-digit rate. Full-year revenue growth should be near the upper end of our high single-digit target range
with somewhat stronger growth in the second half of the fiscal year, as we build towards the World Cup in Brazil.
Regarding the outlook for gross margin, we're encouraged by the progress we've made increasing our average selling
price per unit by strengthening the premium segment of our footwear and apparel businesses and by taking selective
price increases around the world. We've also ramped up our investment in manufacturing innovations that will increase
the efficiency of existing production methods and over time create more revolutionary improvements in our sourcing
base.
That said, we expect Q1 gross margin will be essentially flat with the prior year as continued labor cost inflation and
unfavorable FX comparisons offset the benefits of easing raw material costs and higher selling prices. For the fiscal
year, we expect gross margin expansion of about 25 basis points with sequential improvement through the year as
higher selling prices, lower discounts and easing FX headwinds should more than offset the impact of labor cost
inflation.
For Q1 FY 2014, we expect SG&A to grow at a low single-digit rate, as we anniversary prior-year investments in
support of the Euro Champs, Olympics and NFL launch. For the balance of the year, we expect SG&A to grow at a
low-teens rate in each quarter, as we continue to invest in our brands, DTC and innovation. The result would be low

double-digit growth for the full year, slightly above the rate of revenue growth.
For FY 2014, we expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%. Finally, we expect FY 2014 EPS to grow at a low
double-digit rate, essentially in line with the EPS growth we reported for FY 2013. However, we expect first quarter
EPS growth well above this rate as demand creation spending declines in comparison to the heavy investments in last
year's Q1.
Our FY 2013 results reflect the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings and
cash returns to shareholders, while at the same time, investing for long-term growth. We're confident we have the
assets, capabilities and leadership to continue to do so for FY 2014 and beyond.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Good evening.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hey, Bob.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Hi, Bob.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Charlie, first of all, congratulations and best of luck and thanks for – thanks for everything over
the last 15 years.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Thank you. Appreciate it.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hold on. I've a little visitor here. Sorry.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: I know the feeling.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Sorry. So, I guess the first question I have for you, Charlie, just – as this is your last call, is, can
you give us any, like Trevor taking over as President of the NIKE Brand, any advice that you've given Trevor that
you'd share with us and what he should be most concerned about as he takes over at this point in his career?
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Well, no. I think – I mean, hey, Trevor and the entire team, I think they're in great shape. I
mean, lot – everybody knows Trevor. He's been around here a long time and he's in great shape. He's well-positioned to
take the baton and keep going.
I think, there's no specific areas of advice that I can give him that I don't think he already knows. He's pretty
well-positioned and got a great experience and he's a well-recognized person certainly around here and I think
externally as well. So, I think, I look forward to helping him make the transition and we'll be in good shape.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. Great. And then, I guess, as a bigger picture, and I don't know if this would be for Mark or
for Don, I guess, can you just talk about the – sort of the outlook or the macro that has impacted the outlook over the
last 90 days or last 60 days in the business and as you look at sort of the expectations on the earnings side of it going
forward? You know, what have been the biggest factors to sort of alter the view a little bit here?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah, I'm glad you asked the question, Bob, because our perspective on the business really
hasn't changed. We are absolutely as confident in the business as we were 90 days ago. And in fact, when we look at
our constant currency operating profits, they've actually gone up a little bit in terms of our expectations. But, a couple
of things have happened. Number one is the FX environments changed a bit and that's been a little bit of a drag on the
numbers. Secondly, we finished FY 2013 with a few more shares than we had expected 90 days ago. And finally, if you
look at our tax lines, our FY 2014 perspective has not changed, but FY 2013 came in a little better than what we had

expected, as we talked about in the prepared remarks.
So, from an operating standpoint, we're just as confident as we've been and very confident going into FY 2014, there's
just been a few things that have pulled our growth rate down a touch.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I would jump in and add that our ability to sort of work the operational and financial levers to
make the adjustments that we need to, in light of some of the more macroeconomic challenges, I mean that's never been
better.
We still feel like we have room for improvement in areas, but we've never had the ability to kind of surgically manage
from an operational and financial standpoint as we do today. Very proud of that, and I think it's – it served us well,
particularly over the last couple of years.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: All right. Thank you very much. And, Charlie, good luck.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Hey, Bob. Thanks. I'll see you soon.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay.

And your next question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Oh, thanks. Hi, guys.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Robbie.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Hi, Robbie.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: And, Charlie, congratulations as well and good luck with what you do next.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: I appreciate it. For a while, it won't be anything.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: The – two questions. The first question is the double-digit North American futures orders
you guys put up today, another great number; can you just give us some color on what channels might be driving that
more than others as well as the average selling price component to that? And then, if there's any changes in the
categories driving that? And then the second question is just Brazil, some of the unrest that's gone there – gone on
there, if – I was just curious, if you guys had any color or thought on that? Thanks.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Yeah, no, I think from a – when we talk about – and when we look at North America and
both the results and the futures order going forward, they are – they're still pretty broad-based. Running continues to
still grow at double-digits. Basketball is accelerating, and you saw the Q4 Basketball results; they were extremely
strong and certainly the NBA Playoff run didn't slow that down at all, and so we're very excited about that going into
next year.
We talked about Women's; we're pretty excited about the Women's piece. And then, we're moving into our second year
with the NFL here in North America. So, it's really a broad-based portfolio of progress, I guess.
And when you look at the way that the business is being made up from a channel standpoint, we're doing it – we're
doing it across all the channels. It's not one specific channel that's really stands out good or better than the others. And I
think that that speaks to the North America management team and points of differentiation that we've been able to
create in the marketplace.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: We talk a lot about complete offense and that means across the product platforms,
technologies, categories, geos, and wholesale and direct retail, and the U.S. or North America is a tremendous example
of really operating a complete offense.

And the exciting thing is, as we see that kind of success in the U.S. and kind of churn on all cylinders there, we see the
opportunity to really take a lot of that and apply that to other parts of the world. So, leveraging that complete offense
and those successes across the other geographies is really our plan. Very excited.
And the other point is just – and it relates to the organizational shift Elliot Hill coming on board to lead the
geographies, is incredibly experienced, he's done a fantastic job in North America, tremendous experience in both
wholesale and retail, great energy, lots of passion. And again, part of what I think is going to be a leadership team that
has some tremendous chemistry. So, Elliot and his team to Charlie's point deserve a lot of credit.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: And just on the ASPs in Brazil?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah, so on the ASPs, Robbie, we usually don't get into that level of granularity by
geography, but across all the futures, as we talked about, we were up five points on units and three points on ASP, and
that trend line is pretty consistent. So, we don't usually get into that level of granularity on a geography basis, but all the
geos are seeing similar trends.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: And your question on Brazil, I mean, obviously there's a lot going on in Brazil with the
ramp-up to World Cup and the Olympics. We know that the unrest is – and we're watching that situation very closely.
To-date, there's been no material impact on our operations or our business in Brazil. And we remain incredibly excited
about the World Cup coming up and all the opportunities around that and then following that the Olympics. This is, as
we've said, our time to shine as a brand and we have some pretty amazing things coming. Charlie alluded to that in the
world of Football, so we're excited about the opportunity in Brazil, but we'll stay close to it.

And your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Hi. Thank you. Charlie, I would like to also add my congratulations and best wishes.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Thanks, Kate. I appreciate it.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: My question is around the supply chain. It was great to hear your comments about the
innovation in the supply chain and how it could possibly impact gross margins next year. And I know it's still early
days with Flyknit and other efficiencies that you're finding in the supply chain, but I wondered if you could update us
on how this is ramping up as a production discipline?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Are you talking Flyknit specifically?
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Yes.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah, well, first of all, we continue to be incredibly bullish on Flyknit for a number of reasons
that we've talked about before; performance-wise, sustainability, margin, opportunities going forward as we scale that
technology within Running, of course, and then across the other categories. So, we are in the midst of a fairly major
effort to scale Flyknit across other models.
Over this next 12 months, you will see some very exciting new versions of Flyknit. And I would say just from a
product standpoint, we're just scratching the surface in terms of the potential that it offers from a performance and an
aesthetic standpoint. Let alone the manufacturing capabilities that I think it brings us.
You know that – the manufacturing payoff, I think will come, when – as we get this to even greater scale. And we're
well on our way, in terms of our plan to leverage, like I said, Flyknit across categories and even across price points as
well. So, you'll see some very exciting executions, actually starting as early as August – this August, you'll see Flyknit

actually meet Nike Free and that's a great combination. I'm tempted to say more, but I can't.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay. Great. And if I could just follow-up on that question again with regards to supply
chain and some of the labor costs that you're seeing. Obviously, labor has been a big pressure over the last couple of
years and I know you've guided for it, but is there anything different that you're seeing or has anything gotten more
accelerated in certain geographies where you are manufacturing currently?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, as far as acceleration, yes, we've definitely seen some fairly significant increases in
wage rates in a couple of countries. I think the one in Indonesia certainly was pretty well-publicized and we haven't
seen the growth in quite that level in other places, but they've all been headed up.
I think as Mark talked about a little bit with respect to Flyknit, I think the longer-term solution to addressing a lot of
these labor cost issues is really engineering the labor out of the product. And that really is with technologies and
innovations like Flyknit and there are a number of others that we have in the pipeline that are aimed at the same thing.
It will take some time and that's why one of the reasons we spoke to this on the prepared remarks is that we are very
carefully looking at all the other levers of gross margin, including price as well as just how we manage our mix.
One of the benefits we've seen in the last year or so is a real strength in the premium end of our business, which is the
place where we have the most differentiation and the most opportunity for price. So, long-term, innovation, we think is
one of the ways to get at this labor cost pressure. On the near-term, we're also obviously looking at price and all the
other levers in gross margin.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Oh, thanks. And, Charlie, let me add my congratulation as well. Great career. And to Trevor as
well, if he's listening in.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Sure.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Thanks, Omar.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Can I ask you guys about e-commerce real quick? I know, there's a lot of great brands out there
that have become a pretty little high penetration in terms of the mix of the business, revenues, generate online. I know
you guys have been more focused on the digital side, creating ecosystems, communities as well as the commercial side
of the business. How do you think about or how should we think about how and when the online platform can be ready
to become a big contributor to the P&L as part of the DTC overall?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Well, DTC and specifically online as a part of DTC is a huge priority at NIKE, and we are
investing in that platform fairly aggressively, I would say. We see the opportunity there is continuing on. We're
investing in mobile, for example, and seeing some great results there. Obviously, customization continues to be actually
a very strong subset of our dotcom business and we see lots of innovation opportunities there that are quite compelling.
But overall, DTC, and again, specifically the e-commerce dimension at DTC is a huge and growing percentage of our
overall business.
I think we're just at the very front-end. I mean, if you look at DTC as a percentage of some of the big verticals out
there, it's quite significant. So, we see ourselves and along with our retail partners in terms of wholesale.com is that,
there is some very significant opportunity for us and we're very, very focused and bullish.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: And the thing I'd add to that, Omar, is that the work that you referenced earlier that we do
around the digital experience for consumers and all of the digital connections we have with consumers on the brand
side, we think is a multiplier of the e-commerce side.

Certainly, there's a lot of things we can do to sharpen our e-commerce platforms, but the connection points of all that
traffic that's going through our brand sites and all of the connections we have with consumers through things like
Nike+, we think have a multiplier effect in e-commerce that most pure play e-commerce players can't match.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: We have – as we talked about our digital strategy, we divided into digital sport, which is
really products and services like the FuelBand, for example, e-commerce and then communications. In
communications, there's a lot of the social aspects. And we – as Don said, we see those all intersecting and that's where
the real opportunity for NIKE lies, is the intersection of all those pieces of digital in the future.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Got you. And, then Donald, I have a real quick one question on gross margin as they kind of
continue to accelerate a little bit here. What's that algorithm going to look like, when your kind of highest margin
market, China return to more of a growth business and that mix shift, it kind of goes from a drag to a benefit?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: That sounded like a statement, Omar, not a question. That will certainly be helpful to put
China back on that sustainable growth path and we absolutely are confident that we're going to get China there.

And your next question comes from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my call. Charlie, all the best to you in the future
in terms of whatever you choose to do, but all the best to you and congrats all the team.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Appreciate it.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: Sure. My question is, just a follow-up on China for a second. Don, you gave some pretty good
color about how we think about revenues first-half, second-half. Any thoughts about how we think about the margin
profile in China? You didn't do so bad here in this current quarter against some easy comparisons, but I guess just how
do we think about that first-half, second-half and where maybe that inflection point could really start to happen?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, I don't want to get into that level of granularity again, but what I can do is talk to you a
little bit about some of the dynamics there. I mean, certainly, one of the things that was mentioned on the last question
was just the high margins we have in China and one of the things that we believe is really exciting about the work we're
doing right now with our retail partners is the opportunities still in the economics and productivity of the retail stores is
that we can turn inventory faster. We think we can elevate the presentation for our consumers and we think that
ultimately is better from a profitability standpoint for us and for the retailer.
So, yes, our margins have held up relatively well in the last quarter, and I think, there's a lot of things that we still think
we can do going forward to manage that business for a high level of profitability. But I don't – I don't want to get into
the weeds of trying to guess where margins are going to be for any one quarter.
Just one thing to keep underlining here is, our goal is to get that market onto a sustainable profitable path. We're
confident we can do it. We know how this works. It's just a question of working through the execution and being
patient and disciplined as everybody else mentioned today.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: Okay. Thank you. And then just lastly, just on the gross margin outlook for you. I'd like to think
that you guys are being somewhat conservative in terms of how you're thinking about it. You've done better than you've
expected in the past two quarters or so. So, I guess, what maybe could be the opportunity whereby you guys could

outperform your thought process in terms of gross margin? I mean, what's the biggest headwind? I mean, I think
everyone might have anticipated you could have done a little bit better on the gross margin profile for this year, just
given the pricing increases. So, just maybe a little more color about where maybe the opportunities could be?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, one thing to bear in mind and I've mentioned this in the prepared remarks. There's a lot
of currency headwind in these numbers for, particularly, the first quarter. So, we do hedge, which means that for the
major currencies we are largely protected for a period of time, but we don't hedge a 100% and there's a lot of currencies
that we don't hedge, particularly developing market currencies. So, a more favorable FX environment would certainly
help.
From a business standpoint, there is clearly a positive impact to managing inventories and keeping the market within
that pull mode and one of the things that obviously we've been doing, as you saw our inventory numbers today, is
keeping that inventory in check. And so, the upsides in this business model, as you know are, keep the inventories tight,
make sure the brand is hot, sell-through maximum at full price and that's where the upside comes from.
So, we have a lot of moving parts in here. I think, as Mark said, we're better and better at this as each quarter goes by
and I hope you're right. I hope there's opportunity in the gross margin number.

And your last question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hello.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Hi.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Hello.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: I just wanted to follow-up on North America sales. There was a bit of a divergence
in your footwear versus apparel sales, and I was curious, if you could add a little more color to that and talk about
whether your futures' numbers also reflected a similar trend?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Oh, Lindsay, I'm looking at the futures numbers here, hold on. Actually, they're fairly close.
The futures will actually accelerate a little bit in apparel more than footwear, but they're pretty even, obviously, with
the number in 2012. We've still got great momentum in the marketplace in footwear.
And as we talked about over the last couple of calls, we're really focused on improving our apparel position. We think
it's one of our biggest opportunities. And I think, we're starting to see some of that momentum and work payoff a little
bit, especially in North American geography.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah, I think this comment I made about complete offense is really a major factor in our
success over this last year or really few years. It's definitely holding true as we move into, or will, as we move into
fiscal 2014. So, if you look at footwear and apparel, and you look across the categories, they're frankly up and down the
price points. I think, we look actually quite strong in North America from a complete picture standpoint. So, we
continue to be bullish on the opportunities in North America as we move into fiscal 2014.

<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Great. And then, just when you talk about doubling down on innovation, are you
talking about doubling down on your investment that we should expect much greater frequency of products with
innovation associated with them or much deeper innovation associated with it? And maybe just help frame what the
practical implications of that statement are?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. Well, first of all, as I said, there's never been more opportunity to innovate than there is
today. And, with that comps, it's not just more. It's better. So, we need to edit against that incredible list of opportunities
and make sure that we're investing in things that we think we can leverage for the greatest success to fuel growth,
improve performance, sustainability, et cetera. And, really, we have a very disciplined process by which we edit against
all those opportunities.
So, yes, we have some funding that we've put aside to look at getting behind some of these more compelling and
innovation opportunities.
I won't speak to specifically what those are, but the intent is to really rally behind those opportunities that are going to
give us the greatest potential to grow the business, and frankly, the leverage across categories, price points and even the
brands within the portfolio. So, I am incredibly excited; but at the same time, I know the discipline that needs to go
with managing innovation to achieve the greatest impact.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: And I would point out, as you mentioned earlier. In my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit
about the significant investments we've been making over the last three years particularly. And our guidance for FY
2014 does contemplate that as well. So, as Mark said, we've been investing in places like digital and product innovation
and manufacturing innovation, and so on, and we would continue to do that, but that is embedded in our guidance that
we gave you for FY 2014.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Great. And then just one last one, you talked about the higher share count being a
headwind to some degree of your EPS growth for next year and I can think of a pretty easy solution to that considering
all the cash you guys are sitting on, so maybe just, could you talk about what you plan to do with your extra $1 billion
and your balance sheet?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, we do anticipate continuing to increase cash returns to shareholders and I think you're
well aware of our record on dividend. And, certainly, buying our own stock is going to be a component of that as well
and we do expect to be strong buyers of our own stock. We try to do that as efficiently as we can. And obviously, your
ability to see into the future is always a little murky, but we are very enthusiastic about returning cash to shareholders
as well as investing in the business and that debt offering we felt was well-timed to give us the flexibility going forward
to continue to do both.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Great. Thank you.
