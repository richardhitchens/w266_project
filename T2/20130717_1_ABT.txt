Miles D. White
Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.46 exceeding our previous
guidance range, and we're confirming our full-year 2013 EPS outlook for double-digit growth. Sales increased more
than 4% operationally, led by continued strong performance in emerging markets, as well as Diagnostics and Nutrition.
Abbott continues to deliver on its expectations despite the recent depreciation of several foreign currencies and a mixed
global economy.
Before I comment on our results, let me address at a high level some of these dynamics. Our earnings performance was
strong despite a more negative impact from foreign currency than we had forecasted in April. As you know, the yen
depreciated further over the last few months and was the primary driver of unfavorable exchange. Several emerging
market currencies also weakened late in the second quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable exchange impact on sales
of 1.7%, more than our forecast of 1%. The underlying fundamentals are good, however; especially around gross
margin improvement and expense management, which all are progressing ahead of schedule.
As we look at total company sales, our results were strong in our growth market and in line with our expectations in
developed markets. Sales in developed markets declined about 1% before exchange, which was less of a decline than
we saw in the first quarter. Our businesses in these markets are generally more subject to reimbursement and austerity
pressures. However, in Diagnostics, one of our most durable growth businesses, sales in developed markets increased
3% before exchange. While these markets continue to be challenging, we do expect better performance in the second
half.
Emerging market sales were $2.3 billion this quarter, increasing 13% before exchange, similar to our first quarter
growth rate. We have built a broad emerging market base that helps to offset volatility that can occur in any one
market. With more than 40% of our business in emerging markets, we're well positioned to benefit from the long-term
demographic and economic trends that are taking place.
While we can't perfectly predict the macro environment, we can manage our business to deliver durable and reliable
results for shareholders. And we have done that consistently for years and we're able to do that because we have
flexibility, we plan for contingencies, and we oftentimes drive out performance in other areas of our business.
This quarter, we exceeded our gross margin forecast of 54.5%, delivering gross margin of 55% as a result of continued
progress on our margin improvement initiatives. We now expect our full-year gross margin to exceed our original
guidance. This was the result of continued momentum from margin improvement in Nutrition and Diagnostics where
we're ahead of our initial targets.
With that as context, I'll provide a high-level review of our four business segments before Tom and Brian comment on
the details of the quarter. In medical devices, second quarter performance was in line with our expectations, driven by
mid-single-digit international growth across vascular, diabetes care, and vision care, and as expected, global vascular
results improved sequentially compared to first quarter. We've seen good momentum from many of our recent medical
product launches including our OptiBlue cataract IOL in Japan as well as Absorb, MitraClip, and XIENCE Xpedition
which received approval in Japan last week.
On Monday, we also announced two acquisitions: IDEV, which expands our endovascular product portfolio; and
OptiMedica which gives us an immediate entry point into the laser cataract surgery market. While organic growth
remains our top priority, these acquisitions bring Abbott's leading technologies to capitalize on growth opportunities.
IDEV's SUPERA stent is on the market in Europe and under FDA review to address the challenges of treating
superficial femoral artery or SFA. Treatment of the SFA is the largest and fastest growing segment of the peripheral
market, driven by the rising rates of diabetes and obesity. This acquisition rounds out our endovascular portfolio with a

best-in-class technology to further penetrate this market segment. Our endovascular business is approaching $500
million in annual sales and increased 4% operationally this quarter.
OptiMedica's state-of-the-art laser system provides Abbott access to the rapidly developing laser cataract surgery
market. Most cataract procedures are performed manually today, but a growing portion of the cataract market is
moving to a laser-assisted surgery, especially as the market shifts to premium IOLs. The acquisition of OptiMedica will
allow Abbott to have broader reach in the growing cataract segment. Cataract sales represent more than 60% of our
vision-care sales, and this quarter, increased in the high single-digits as we build momentum with several new products
that launched in the first half of this year. We expect to complete both of these acquisitions before year end.
In Nutrition, worldwide sales increased 8.5% with equally strong performance in both pediatric and adult nutrition.
International sales increased 18.5% driven by strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. We have broad reach
around the world and have prioritized a group of markets where we're expanding our footprint. This includes localizing
R&D and building out local manufacturing. Our three new facilities in China, India, and the U.S. remain on track to
come online later this year or early next year.
Abbott's scientific heritage and new product development is critical to our success and leadership in the nutrition
market. As I mentioned last quarter, we're on track for approximately 70 new product launches this year, and have
completed more than 40 through the first half. It's not only new products, but the role of clinical data that allow us to
grow, shape, and further penetrate these markets.
For example, in our adult nutrition business, results from a health economic study announced last month demonstrates
that supplementing with oral nutrition such as Ensure can decrease hospital length of stay, reduce hospitalization costs,
and readmission rates. With healthcare systems facing unprecedented budget pressures and challenges, these results are
encouraging and represent an opportunity in both developed and emerging markets.
Nutrition operating margin also increased significantly again this quarter, and we're on track to exceed 300 basis points
of expansion for the full year. Our initial target of 20% is well within our reach and we intend to continue to look at
ways to exceed that goal.
In our established pharmaceuticals division, sales were below our expectations. Global economic growth forecasts are
lower than when we began the year. Last week, the IMF reduced its growth outlook driven by lower growth
expectations in Europe and emerging markets, and while we've seen some impacts from these market developments,
we also need to improve our commercial execution.
To that point, we recently created two new commercial leadership positions that have separate responsibility for
emerging and developed markets. This will sharpen our focus on the very different market-specific needs in this
business, and enable us to achieve the growth targets that we've set. We have some work to do to improve how we
promote the Abbott brand to various channels, whether it's hospitals, pharmacies, or the consumer. We're continuing to
build our product portfolios to registrations targeted for specific markets, and geographically, we'll see a shift in sales
to more high-growth emerging markets from 60% today to 75% over the next several years which will also accelerate
growth.
While we continue to expect EPD sales growth to pick up in the second half, we now have more modest expectations
for the pace of that acceleration. We're positive about the growth prospects for EPD and its strategy as we move
forward; we obviously have some things to do here.
Diagnostics continues to deliver on its expectations with worldwide sales up 7.5%. Sales in emerging markets, which
represent 35% of total Diagnostics sales, were up more than 15% in the quarter. This was led by core laboratory
diagnostics where we continue to outpace market growth in our priority markets: China, Brazil, and Russia.
In molecular diagnostics, we returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter with sales up 13%. In June, we also
launched the first FDA-approved hepatitis C genotype test, which allows physicians to match patients to the best
treatment option based on their genotype. This is especially important as patients will benefit from many new
pharmaceutical treatments over the next few years.

The Diagnostics operating margin also came in ahead of our expectations as we continue to execute on our gross
margin improvement plan. Despite the R&D investment we've been making for six new system platforms across our
three Diagnostics businesses, we're well ahead of schedule to reach our initial operating margin target of 20%.
In summary, despite currency headwinds, our performance exceeded expectations. We're executing on our strategic
priorities and confirmed our double-digit EPS growth target for the full year.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom to review our second quarter results and the 2013 outlook in more detail. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.46, exceeding our
previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased more than 4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an
unfavorable impact of 1.7% from foreign exchange. The impact of foreign exchange on sales was 70 basis points more
unfavorable in the quarter than the estimate we provided in April, reflecting further depreciation of the Japanese yen
and the weakening of several emerging market currencies late in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses, including
growth of more than 13% in emerging markets. Reported sales, which include the impact of exchange, increased 2.5%
in the quarter. The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55%, ahead of our previous guidance due to the
impact of margin improvement initiatives in our Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses, as well as a lower headwind
from exchange relative to previous expectations. In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was 6.5% of sales, in line
with previous expectations, and ongoing SG&A was around 31% of sales, somewhat lower than previous expectations.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2013, today we're confirming our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98
to $2.04, which reflects double-digit growth over 2012 at the midpoint of the range. We're forecasting operational sales
growth, that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the mid-to-high single-digits for the second half of the
year. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full-year
reported sales, which was 1.5% more negative than previous expectations. At current rates, we'd expect a 3% negative
impact on sales in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few
minutes.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55.5%, which is favorable to our
previous guidance, primarily due to strong performance in Nutrition and Diagnostics, as these businesses continue to
execute well on margin improvement initiatives. We also continue to forecast ongoing R&D at 6% to 7% of sales, and
ongoing SG&A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year 2013. Overall, we project our full-year adjusted
operating margin to expand by more than 100 basis points in 2013, somewhat above our previous guidance. We
continue to forecast net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013, non-operating income of approximately $20
million, and around $50 million of expense on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L.
Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2013, which we're providing for the first time, we're forecasting ongoing
earnings per share of $0.51 to $0.53, which would represent strong double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range.
We forecast specified items of $0.20 in the third quarter, primarily associated with intangible amortization expense and
cost reduction initiatives, resulting in GAAP EPS guidance of $0.31 to $0.33. Our operational sales growth in the third
quarter is expected to be in the mid-to-high single-digits, and as previously indicated, at current exchange rates, we
expect roughly 3% negative impact from exchange on sales in the third quarter. This would result in recorded sales
growth in the low-to-mid single-digits.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales in the third quarter, which
includes a negative impact from exchange of somewhat more than 1%. We also forecast ongoing R&D for the third
quarter somewhat above 6.5% of sales, ongoing SG&A expense of around 30% of sales, and non-operating income of
around $15 million.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for the operating highlights by business.

Brian Yoor
Okay. Thanks, Tom. This morning, I'll provide an overview of second quarter performance and our outlook for the
third quarter. My comments will focus on operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. I'll
first discuss medical devices, which includes our vascular diabetes care and vision care businesses. In our vascular
business, worldwide sales were flat on an operational basis, a step up from first quarter performance and consistent
with previous guidance.
International sales, which comprised more than 60% of total vascular sales, increased 4% operationally. Growth was
driven by new products including our XIENCE PRIME small vessel stent in Japan, XIENCE Xpedition, Absorb, and
MitraClip. Last week, we announced the approval of XIENCE Xpedition in Japan, which we expect to drive further
share gains. This approval follows the initiation of our Absorb randomized clinical trial in Japan, reaffirming Abbott's
commitment to developing truly innovative treatment options for coronary artery disease.
U.S. vascular sales in the second quarter were down nearly 7%, impacted by market declines, partially offset by
year-over-year share gains as a result of the XIENCE Xpedition launch. For the third quarter of 2013, we expect our
global vascular business to increase in the low single-digits on an operational basis. We expect to improve our
performance in the second half of the year with the uptake of XIENCE Xpedition in the U.S. and Japan, and continue
penetration of our new products, MitraClip and Absorb.
In diabetes care, global sales in the second quarter were relatively flat, in line with our expectations. International sales
growth of 4% was driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets as well as the continued uptake of our FreeStyle
InsuLinx meter. Abbott was recently selected as the exclusive supplier for the National Diabetes Awareness Program in
Saudi Arabia, a country where 30% of the population has diabetes today. In the U.S., we saw continued share gains in
the hospital and retail segments where Abbott maintains its leadership position, offset by market pricing and
reimbursement pressures.
We continue to invest in the next-generation sensing technology, which we expect to initially bring to market in Europe
in the second half of 2014. We project third quarter diabetes care sales growth to be relatively flat on an operational
basis. As we have previously discussed, while we are forecasting strong growth in emerging markets, the 2013
implementation of CMS competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact our U.S. sales this year.
In vision care, global operational sales increased approximately 2% in the second quarter. Cataract sales, which
represent about 60% of our global vision care sales, continued to outpace the market in the quarter, led by strong
double-digit growth in emerging markets and our TECNIS brand of intraocular lenses. We expect to see continued
growth in our cataract business driven by several important new product launches this year. This includes the recent
launch of TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan, which provides Abbott access to the largest segment of the Japan market; and
TECNIS Toric in the U.S., which gives Abbott access to the faster-growing premium segment of the IOL market.
The anticipated launch of TECNIS Preloaded IOL in the U.S. will also contribute to accelerated growth in the second
half of the year. For the third quarter, in our global vision care business, we expect mid single-digit operational sales
growth, an improvement versus first half of the year as we continue to drive cataract growth with new launches and
execute in emerging markets.
In Nutrition, global sales increased 8.4% in the second quarter on an operational basis. International Nutrition sales
grew 18.4% in the quarter, including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets, which now comprise more than
45% of total Nutrition sales. Global pediatric nutrition sales grew 9% operationally in the quarter. International
pediatric sales grew 19%, as we continue to execute on a number of geographic expansion initiatives and launch new
product innovations, including the global rollout of our specialty tolerance formula products. U.S. pediatric sales were
down modestly, largely due to lower infant formula share in the WIC segments. Abbott remains the market leader in
the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market.

Global adult nutrition sales, which comprise nearly 45% of total Nutrition sales, increased 7% operationally in the
quarter. International adult sales grew 17%, driven by strong growth of Ensure and execution of market expansion
initiatives. U.S. adult Nutrition sales were negatively impacted this quarter by the exit from certain noncore business
lines as part of our margin improvement initiative. Excluding the impact of these exits, U.S. adult sales grew low
single-digits.
As Miles mentioned earlier, a recent health economic study published in the American Journal of Managed Care found
that nutritional supplementation in the hospital setting decreased hospital length of stay and total episode cost by more
than 20%, and reduced the likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days by nearly 7%. As the clear
global leader in adult nutrition, we are working to expand the market by raising awareness of the role that proper
nutrition can play in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
As we look ahead through the third quarter, we expect our global Nutrition business to grow double digits on an
operational basis, with strong international sales growth led by emerging markets and continued uptake of
recently-launched products.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, sales in the quarter were flat on an operational basis as growth in
emerging markets was offset by declines in the developed markets. We continue to expand our presence and build local
portfolios in 14 key emerging markets. Sales in these markets grew approximately 4.5% in the quarter, and were
somewhat negatively impacted by timing of product deliveries in certain markets, as well as implementation of the drug
price control order in India which caused some delays in customer purchases late in the quarter. We expect growth in
our 14 key emerging markets to improve in the second half of the year with strong growth in a number of emerging
countries including Brazil and India.
As expected, growth in other markets, which include Western Europe and Japan, was negatively impacted by overall
macroeconomic conditions in these countries, including European austerity measures.
In the third quarter, we expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our Established Pharmaceuticals business,
as we see improved growth in emerging markets due to portfolio expansion and execution of recent tender wins.
And lastly, in our Diagnostics businesses, core lab diagnostics continued its durable growth with operational sales
increasing 6% in the quarter. About 80% of our core laboratory diagnostic sales are generated outside the U.S. where
we saw more than 8% operational growth in the quarter. Sales in emerging markets increased double digits led by
China and Russia, both growing more than 30%. In molecular diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 13% on an
operational basis in the second quarter, in line with our expectations for accelerated growth versus the first quarter.
International sales increased nearly 18% on an operational basis, led by strong infectious disease growth, particularly in
emerging markets driven by the impact of new tenders, as well as the continued global expansion of our ALK gene test
for non-small cell lung cancer. In June, we received approval for the first FDA-approved hepatitis C virus genotyping
test in the U.S., which will enable physicians to create a personalized targeted diagnosis and treatment path to improve
clinical outcomes, further expanding Abbott's diagnostic testing options in the infectious disease area.
In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 15.5% on an operational basis, driven by continued growth in
the U.S. hospital segment, further penetration in the U.S. physician office labs, and strong double-digit growth in
emerging markets. For the third quarter, we are forecasting our global Diagnostics business segment to generate high
single-digit operational sales growth, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in molecular and point of care
diagnostics, and mid-to-high single-digit growth in core labs.
So, in summary, we're pleased with our financial performance through the first half of the year. We delivered earnings
per share in the second quarter that exceeded our previous guidance range, and despite a challenging global economy
and recent fluctuations in currencies, we're confirming our 2013 ongoing EPS guidance. We will now open the call for
questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with a couple questions for
Miles. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Miles D. White>: I hear you fine.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Great. So, Miles, how do you view the broader macroeconomic conditions and dynamics,
both in the developed world as well as the emerging markets, including the impact of currency, and maybe some color
on how this impacts Abbott and your performance in the quarter and beyond?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, let me take the macro environment first. I think whenever the economies of the world,
wherever they may be, go into some recession or phase into some kind of adversity at least as businesses and investors
look at it, I think the natural tendency is to always forecast they're going to recover faster than they do. They recover
gradually, and I think that's what we're going to see here. I think if you look back over the last few years and listen to
all the pundits and analysts and everybody else talk about the macro environment and the pace of recovery and so forth,
it really – I think optimism and hope and so forth have driven a lot of wishful thinking that it's going to happen faster
than it does, but frankly, the problems of Europe or even the U.S. have been more serious and deep; they don't recover
that fast. So, that rolls through to markets, and it obviously rolls through to emerging markets too, because they're so
integral now to the global economy.
So, I look at it and say I think it's all getting better, I think it's going to get better, but it's going to be at a measured
pace, and I don't think it's going to just suddenly be better. And sometimes the trading in the markets or the DOW every
day certainly doesn't reflect that; we have great days of exuberance and other days that aren't so exuberant. But, overall,
I think it's pretty steady. Now, as I've said in the past, there's a pretty big difference here and we can see it in our
business between – call it emerging markets and very developed economies. You take the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada,
et cetera as the developed markets and call the rest of the world evolving or emerging growth markets, there's a big
difference here. And we can see it in our various businesses as we look down the list of our businesses and we look at
developed market growth and emerging market growth, it's dramatic – it's consistent. It's consistent for us except for
one business, and that one business is a pretty good measure of market health and market performance, and that would
be our branded generic drug business where I think it's frankly more our performance than anything else – or our own
execution.
So, we look at those businesses, and in almost every case, the performance in emerging markets is either very high
single-digits or frankly really healthy robust double-digit growth. And if you look across the developed markets, it's at
best single-digits, and in a lot of cases flat and declining. And I think we're in a phase where those developed markets
are absorbing all the austerity measures and other things that they've had to absorb. So, there's a pretty dramatic barbell
here between the robustness of emerging markets and the sluggishness of developed markets, and we happen to be
indexed in both – I think that's a good thing – and we're broadly represented in the emerging markets.
And as I said a couple of times, a bad day in emerging markets is a lot better than a good day in developed markets
often. And while those developed markets are very important to us and we have a lot of share, a lot of customers, and
frankly make a lot of profit there, as far as growth goes, the emerging markets are more robust. They're volatile
sometimes, which is why it's good to be in a broad cross-section of them and not over-indexed in a couple, and we are.
We're very broadly represented across these markets and in a broad group of businesses.
So, I would tell you, every day there's something concerning in some market some country somewhere. But, overall, in
the market basket of all that, it's a pretty strong overall economic picture and performance that I think has great
long-term longevity.
Now, having said that, it translates this volatility in currency too. As a lot of these countries become a bigger part of our
sales or other multinational sales, we're adjusting to less obsession about the euro and a lot more obsession about a
whole basket of currencies that aren't nearly as predictable and often aren't as widely traded and so forth.

So, this year, the yen has been a significant driver of negative currency, as I think is understood by all of our investors
and shareholders and analysts and yourself and so on. And in addition, some of the more larger emerging markets like
the BRICs have also contributed lately to that; but I have to say this year it's pretty much dominated by the yen. So, in
any given year, it's a different currency that could impact our sales, and because the company is 70% or more
international, that's something that we have to expect to manage and navigate all the time. And I would tell you that our
shareholders and investors don't expect to ride that curve with us, they expect us to manage that for them and manage
the overall global performance of the company, and we do -as we are this year.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: That's helpful. Just one follow-up for you, Miles. So, your performance in Nutrition
continues to be strong, particularly in the emerging markets. How should we think about the dynamics taking place in
China around the infant formula market? And secondly, the sustainability of the extremely high growth this quarter for
adult nutrition outside the U.S. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: There is – I would tell you this: there's anomalies all the time in comparisons and so forth in
any given segment of our business. But I would tell you that the demographics and the underlying market factors
around our adult nutrition business are all good and they're all positive. And while I would never even let myself think
that some extremely robust growth rate is sustainable indefinitely, I would tell you that the growth rate of our Nutrition
business internationally I think is pretty sustainable for a long time because all the underlying demographics, whether
the adult or pediatric business, are all pretty good right now, and I think for the foreseeable future.
With regard to China, I'd say I think most investors and most observers understand what's going on here and what's
happening here. The government is stepping in to say this market perhaps has become a little too robust in a number of
ways, and one might even speculate to the disadvantage of Chinese companies and I think the government has been
clear that it wants to improve its dairy industry and improve the circumstances in that market. As you know, they had
some issues several years ago with the quality of dairy product and so forth. You've got to admire the fact that they
make it a point to say, hey, we're going to pay attention to this, and at the same time they're paying attention to how
these markets are developing. They're looking at not only nutrition, they're looking at pharmaceuticals, they're looking
at packaging companies, they're looking at a number of things.
I think China is an unbelievably impressive country and I think it's an impressive government that's managed its
economic development incredibly well. I think this is a small piece of that. And in fact, in almost any way, you kind of
look at it and say, geez, of all things you'd think that the government would pay attention to infant formula; wouldn't
make the top of most industries or businesses or lists, but in this case, along with pharmaceuticals, packaging and a
number of other industry segments, it did.
So, I think we can manage this, I guess is the way I'd put it. My sense of prospects for the Chinese market haven't
changed. Opportunity remains strong. Opportunity remains robust. I think all the companies that have been mentioned
as part of this investigation have all responded very cooperatively to the Chinese government. I don't know that from
talking to anybody, but I've read the press reports and so forth. I know that we've cooperated with their investigation.
And this too shall pass; and I think the market dynamics remain robust.
Fortunately for us, China doesn't represent a disproportionately large portion of our Nutrition business or even our
pediatric nutrition business. It's a big business for us there, and we are big there. But we're so broad across so many
countries that it doesn't disproportionately impact our performance. So, our prospects and forecasts haven't changed,
our EPS forecast hasn't changed. We've obviously modeled all that in great detail to the degree that we can and to the
extent that there's any impact on us financially. We believe it's manageable in other ways.

<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Miles, just a quick question on EPD. It probably was the only business this
morning that is performing – that is not performing at or above expectations. And I wonder if you'd just give us a sense
of whether that you think that is more a developed market pressure, is that more just Abbott's delays with emerging
market registrations? And I think over the last three to four months, you have a lot of your peers saying, this is not a
particularly interesting business. And maybe you can just comment in terms of the quarter and your views, have they
changed at all about the ability to drive growth in this segment?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd tell you my overall views haven't changed at all. I'm glad our peers don't think it's
interesting because we don't need more peers. There's plenty of competition in these markets today. I think these
markets are developing exactly as we forecasted, and I think the opportunity is what we forecasted. I think the biggest
distinction here, and I don't think it's very well understood by a lot of people, is that the branded generic pharmaceutical
businesses around the world are different than commodity pharmaceutical or generic pharmaceuticals and they're very
different than proprietary or research-based pharmaceuticals.
And I think one of the execution issues we've had is more of a cultural or philosophical business approach issue,
because we've been so dominated by our research-based pharmaceutical business in the past. You have a business
mindset around how you execute against that business. And I think it's one of the reasons why few companies have
succeeded at having proprietary pharmaceutical businesses and generic pharmaceutical businesses in the same
company. And I've said in the past I admire Dan Vasella for being one of the first pioneers of that at Novartis, but he
separated them into Novartis and Sandoz and I think rightly so, because the way you operate those businesses, the
whole marketing approach is just very different.
And if I had to say there is one particular thing that has been a shortcoming for us, I think we or our management team
have approached this too much like proprietary pharmaceutical, and not enough like the different kind of business that
it is. This is a business that's very consumer-facing in a lot of countries, very brand dependent, very product line
dependent, meaning breadth of product line and so forth. It's a very different game. And I don't think we've made that
transition yet as well as we should have. And I think that's where we would diagnose ourselves as not having executed
as well as we should have. Part of that's registration timing, part of it's the mix of product, therapeutic areas and so forth
available, part of it's just our own knowledge and expertise in those areas.
So, we've separated the markets into two big segments, but the fact of the matter is that the countries are all quite
different. In any case, developed markets have common characteristics, emerging markets have common
characteristics, and we've got to do a much better job of making the adjustment to a branded generic pharmaceutical
business. I would tell you that while a lot of our peers don't view it as attractive, there are some of our peers who do.
And I think we know who our longer term competitors are and who they will be. We think the opportunity's robust, we
think we're underperforming, and by any measure, whether we look at competitor performance, our performance,
market performance, share, et cetera, we're underperforming.
I mean, it pains me to say it, but we are. The good news in that is I think we can change that, and we're taking the steps
to change that. So, I think our development of this business is going slower than I might like, and it sticks out like a
sore thumb relative to everything else, but nevertheless, my expectations of the business and what I think it can do for
us remain the same. It's a very profitable business. Gross margins in the low 60% range, so it's a very attractive
business I think executed right. There hasn't been a long historic track record in these markets in this kind of a business
as these develop so there's a lot of pioneering going on here. And it's pioneering by us and Sanofi and some other great
companies that I think understand these markets and are all trying to position themselves properly for the growth of
these healthcare systems. So, I remain pretty enthusiastic about it.
You asked me about developed markets, and I'd tell you, that part of this business is declining and it's experiencing all
the same pressures that other businesses in Europe are. Europe in particular is tougher with generic products, whether
branded or commodity or otherwise, and so we're certainly experiencing that too. If there's any part of this I'm most
disappointed about it's our performance in the emerging side. I expect what's happening in the developed side to keep
being that way for a while, but the – and I think we can mitigate that to some degree too, but the bigger issue here for
us is how we are doing in the emerging markets.

<Q - David R. Lewis>: Hey, Miles – that's very, very helpful, and just maybe a quick follow-up. The other persistent
investor question or debate since the spin has been in order for Abbott to transform their growth, there seems to be a
view that you need transformational acquisitions, and I guess, I think you're guiding to mid-to-upper single-digit
growth in the back half of the year which is ahead of your peers, and you did two small incremental deals. So, can you
talk to us about the deals that you've done, these last two in the recent days, is that more indicative of the kind of deals
we should see, and does Abbott need, frankly, larger multibillion dollar transactions to transform the growth rate?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, I love the question. If you watched me or us over the last 10, 15 years, one thing I think
you can consistently say is I've never forecasted to anybody what we're doing or what we're looking at or where you
can expect us to be interested in M&A activity. So, I'm going to waffle here and not give you a clue. The – I wouldn't
want to indicate that there's a trend here of what we're interested in any way, shape or form. I would tell you that I
always remain vigilant and watchful about what opportunities may exist for us from a lot of perspectives, both
conventional and unconventional, and you've seen that over 10, 12 years. And there are times when smaller – whether
you call them bolt-on or whatever – supplemental acquisitions fit and they enhance a given business, and there's other
times you make a bigger move.
Whatever it is, the timing of those moves tends to be driven by opportunity, valuation, circumstances in the markets
and so forth. And one of the things that I think has been a hallmark of our success, at least on the M&A side, has been
that we've done a lot of study, we've followed businesses, we've followed markets, we've followed various things we're
interested in or targets for a long time, done a lot of due diligence and so forth, and by the time the opportunity drifts
into the radar screen in the right way with the right stars aligned and circumstances, we generally are pretty ready with
a fairly well developed point of view on valuation and so on, and we'll act on the opportunity. The problem is you can't
always predict when that's going to be, and we can't predict it any better than you can, so we certainly can't forecast it
to you. But if you ask me is there a set of opportunities that we're always watching or always looking for that might be
enhancing to the business, the answer is yes. And as I've said many times in the past, I am mindful that investors are
not looking for things that dilute the current performance or in some way stifle the current performance of the
company.
And it's also a hurdle for us that we have to know what we're going to do with the business and do better with it if we
own it and earn an incremental positive return for the investor over and above what it might do stand alone. I will tell
you there's a number of things we've looked at out there where I think valuations are just out of this world, stratospheric
and unrealistic. And we've walked away from a lot of things because we thought valuations were unrealistically high or
expectations were unrealistically high. And I don't think there's a particularly robust, shall we say opportunity set out
there in a number of fields today. There might be a lot of things for sale, but they might not be for sale at a reasonable
valuation. And I think investors who are interested in that part of us should know that we're careful buyers. We buy
when it makes sense and when it adds to our business and when we can meet our criteria and when we can do it right
for you. And if the valuations are too high or we can't make a strategic argument to you of why it's worth whatever it
may be, then we don't make the move.
And that doesn't mean we're only going to do little deals like you just saw; the fact that they both got announced the
same day was pure coincidence. And we respond opportunistically when the opportunity presents itself, but it's not
reactive. We've usually been pretty well prepared. So, I don't know if that gives you some context, but we always
remain vigilant and looking, and for those who think we need something transformative, my e-mail is public; you can
send me those ideas.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: All right, Miles; I'll do just that. Thank you.

<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning, Miles. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Miles, if I just kind of step
back and think about the first half of the year, your comps were a little bit difficult, but in aggregate, I think you'd agree
that 3.8% of comps currency is kind of not your target for overall Abbott. So, other than better execution in the EPD, is
there anything else that you'd think is kind of key to getting you to what you originally were and hoping here which
was more mid-to-high single-digit?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, there's two businesses that have been a drag on us: one is our performance in EPD, and
one has been the entire vascular market, which you know because you watch that one pretty carefully and know it
better than anybody. But I'd say those two things have been a bit of a sluggish drag, no question. Just as – and I think
we're improving both of those. I think the evidence of that remains to be seen in EPD and I understand the skepticism
of investors or analysts on that one, but I'm reasonably confident of EPD. I'm just frustrated with the pace here.
On vascular, the sequential improvement here is pretty good and our share positions in our core market is pretty good.
We've got leadership share positions in the core stent businesses and so forth. I think, as has been pointed out a number
of times, our ambitions here are frankly to expand product lines in areas and geographies and so forth, and drive a little
better growth profile in that business in what is clearly an austere market. However, that still isn't going to be some
high double-digit rate or something as you know. So, I'm pleased with the progress there, but it's not going to look like
it did five, six years ago. So, we look at expanding and growing in new segments there and you saw a little bit of that
earlier in the week with the acquisitions admittedly modest in size.
The comment you make about the comparisons in the first half of the year, I'd say the first half of the year comparisons,
they were tougher. Not even modestly tougher; we had difficult comparisons in the first part of the year. And just as
difficult as those were, I'd tell you the comps in the second half of the year are equally sort of robust in the opposite
direction; I mean, we've got really good comps in the second half.
So, the growth rates that we are going to see here, on the bottom line, I look at and they're pretty heady and pretty high,
and we'll hit them. But I certainly wouldn't want you to trend line them for the long-term in some respects. They're not
one-time, but they more accurately reflect I think the underlying performance of the business. The underlying
performance – growth performance of the business is better than we saw in the first half, and for the long-term,
probably not quite as robust as the mid-20% range you're going to see in the second half here, I'm talking on the bottom
line. Because if you look at the guidance and so forth, we know, we modeled, we understand what things we've lapped
in the comparisons that get better or disappear and so forth, and so EPS growth rate in the second half is mid-20s.
So, that's pretty heady, and I fear that you'll say, okay, well, we'll just take that and straight line it through 2014, and
you'll just keep delivering at that level. Somewhere in there is the reality, and I think the reality is quite healthy. We
always target double-digit earnings growth, and in fact, if you look over – I don't know, last 10 years, whatever it's
been, we set our guidance in that range practically every year. We set a high hurdle, we set a robust hurdle, we set a
hurdle of being reliable double-digit EPS growth, and then we do our best to beat it. And generally speaking, I'd say
we've done that about 90% of the time, that beat part.
So, I think those kinds of dynamics still exist. At the beginning of the year, I told you we did not rely on the markets
improving for this to get better, and we have not. We have the same questions a lot of other people do, it's how much to
rely on market improvement to factor into our business. I think if these markets improve a little bit, we improve a lot.
But I think right now what we're looking at is pretty good growth rates that are a lot more reflective of the identity of
the company, its growth, the mix of its businesses and so forth going forward as we communicated last year and early
this year, and we knew the first two quarters would be tough – at least tough from a comparison standpoint, and they
have been. Unfortunately, they don't reflect what we think the company is going to look like on an ongoing basis.
Now, that said, all of us look at the top line too to measure of sustainability over time for the businesses. And I think
Nutrition, Diagnostics, even EPD and the improvements that we'll have in some of these businesses are going to drive a
lot of that growth. And then to the extent that we have any supplemental opportunities in M&A, we'll look at that, but
we don't factor that in because unless you've got it in your hand, you can't count on it.

<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me just follow up on the vascular piece, if I could. So, really two questions
here: so one is, can you just talk about the evolution of the Absorb strategy relative to that product and where it fits in
the marketplace. If everybody went back a year plus ago, the thought was let's price this at a super premium and try and
make it become 10% of the market. But on a volume basis, the 10% volume might mean 30% for revenue. Now in the
last year, obviously that's changed a lot. It's still priced at a premium, but nowhere near kind of what we were talking a
year ago. Is the goal for that to be a workhorse product, and if so, kind of where are you on tracking towards that goal?
And then the second question is on this week's acquisition, which really would be just from an outsider's viewpoint,
why does Abbott and the developer of XIENCE and with all the stent technology need to go outside to buy a stent
platform? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Let me talk about Absorb first. Your characterization is exactly right. I think initial entry
or strategy with that product was priced as a very new technology, and which I think niched it into selective use. And
there was a very intentional decision on our part to drive it toward workhorse use, just as you characterized. And to do
that, if I take Europe as an example, most governments – frankly the U.S. is the same longer term, but if most health
institutions, hospitals, governments, payers, et cetera, are operating pretty much on fixed or pressured budgets, making
room for technology that costs more than what it replaces is not high on their list. So, I think that what we have to
acknowledge is if we want that product in broader workhorse use, then not only do we cannibalize ourselves, but we
take share from competition. But the only way we do that is not to be an incremental burden to the budgets that have to
pay for those products as a philosophy.
So, quite frankly, intentionally, the price of that product has come down, and its share and its penetration and its use is
broadening, and it is our intent to move it into workhorse status. And I'd say we're seeing that in increased volume,
increased usage, increased pickup, increased account pickup and so forth, and then we're seeing it in the sequential
sales performance of the product and its position in our portfolio. So, that's exactly what we intend, and we're moving
that as fast as all the circumstances will allow without artificially distorting the market. So, I think you've characterized
it quite right.
Remind me again, what was the second question? IDEV, yeah, the position of that in the business, why would you go
out and spend. Quite frankly, we like their product, and we like their product a lot. And we wanted to enhance our own
offering. Surely, couldn't you do it yourself? Yeah, you could but – and clearly probably had the activity going in that
area, but this is quicker, and we think better, and we like the product, so it made sense to us to enhance our product line
and accelerate the business and fill it out because the endovascular business is, I call it a standalone business, it needs a
strong position in this place, and we think that's what IDEV gives us. So, we think that not only helps us in that little
space, we think it helps the whole endovascular business strategically as a package.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Thanks, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Did I get all your questions there, Mike?

<A - Miles D. White>: I can't give you a specific market growth rate because it's different for every country and every
market. And one of the difficulties of this business, Rajeev, is we think of a given geography as three different
segments: there's a proprietary pharma segment in a market; there's a commodity generic segment in a market; and
there's a branded generic segment in a market, and those different segments exist in practically every country. The
question is dominance or prominence in given economic strata in those markets. India's just a great example to point at
just because you've got all three there. It's very much a branded generic market, even a branded market at lower price
points in rural settings. And for that reason, we've got two brands in India. We've got True Care and we've got Abbott.
And True Care is a rural brand and a different price point, different product, and different mix of product, and the
Abbott brands tend to be in the major urban areas and so forth.
So, it depends, and generally speaking, around the world, there aren't very many data sources for us to get breakouts
that way of those markets. So, what we know we know from being in the market, we know from the way we can
segment. So, we don't even quote percentages of share, because quite often, it's contaminated with patented product or
other. So, I can't really give you that. But by country or overall, I think this is easily – I think these segments are easily
mid-to-high single-digit market growth, and our growth over that considerably higher where we get the strategy right
and we have the breadth of the product line and the brand position right and so forth. And our history and experience
here has been we grow much faster than the underlying market when we've got those conditions in place. And then the
price volume tradeoff is such that it stratifies like a lot of markets. There's low price product, there's mid-price product,
there's – I can't say high-priced products; there's nothing high priced about it. We're pretty good value in every market,
but the consumer does make a distinction, or the pharmacist makes a distinction between the brands he believes in and
the quality – the breadth of offering or the configuration of the offering or whatever the case may be. So, we tend to get
a premium for the quality and breadth of the brand and the offering that we have.
So, it's very much, as I've said in the past, like our Nutrition business from the standpoint of the mix of
consumer-facing and medically recommended or prescribed, and a branded product that comes from a quality or
international source or multinational source tends to get a pretty good share of the market at a pretty good price point.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks. And just a follow-up, I think Abbott's been pretty good operators in most of the
markets that it participates in, and this one, as you mentioned, is probably not where you want it to be at this point in
time. But what's a reasonable expectation for folks to have for this business to get to more of a market rate of growth?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'm a little gun-shy about forecasting one because I've been wrong thus far. But I think
this is going to get to a mid-to-upper single-digit sort of performance rate, the question is how fast. I mean, I got my
own ambitions which I'm already late on. So, you always think as soon as you change management and you put new
strategies in place that somehow next quarter it's going to look better. And I think this is going to take a few quarters
before we start to see the green shoots come up and the new growth come. And I'm impatient about that, but I think
we're not going to see what I'd like to see in terms of the sequential momentum hopefully until sometime next year.

emerging market part of the business, and we're changing out the – call it the marketing team and branding team that
will support him in that business, so he's already in place. He's already pretty much up to speed. He was already
familiar with us. He knows the markets well, knows the channels well, knows the brands well and so forth, and I think
that's going well.
The other position we elevated from internally, and one of our experienced, and frankly, I'd say excellent performing
managers who has the developed side, and I would say given the background of his experience, has the right balance of
what I'd say are the characteristics of European developed markets in the pharma and generic spaces, but also the
background and experience to understand how to transition where we can to branded generic consumer-facing type
marketing. And we've taken some of our experienced people from that background, like we've seen in emerging
markets, and supplemented his team with that because I think we've got a transition going on in some of these emerging
markets to much broader branded generic marketing and more consumer related.
So, we're supplementing their teams that way. All of them are located in Europe together at the company division
headquarters which is Basel, and they're all working there together so that they're with each other every day and
whether it's emerging markets or developed markets, they share quite a bit from the standpoint of the marketing,
branding and commercial teams. But, the commercial teams and the support are all dedicated to each of their specific
segments so that they're able to customize what we're doing either strategically or from a marketing standpoint for each
of those segments.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: I mean, you clearly have to go down both paths whether it is acquisition path or build internally to
enter new emerging markets, but does this strengthen the ability to maybe use the latter if the pricing on the former is
just too high?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think first of all we've got to get our house in order, which we're doing, and get our
strategy straight and the right people in place and so forth, which we've done. I'd say, okay, so far so good. Let's get our
strategy working internally here the way we want to before we complicate life with an acquisition or something else. If
an acquisition or an opportunity presented itself that fit well and fit well with what we wanted to do in a given
geography, well, we'd certainly look at it. I would tell you, and I think all of us know this, but I would tell you that
today the valuation expectations for most of those are just out of sight.
And I think the acquisition we made at Piramal in India was a pricey acquisition, but it gave us the #1 position in the
market by far in a profitable, growing, key, large market. That was worth something. And when we look at that
long-term, that's worth a lot. But, a multiple valuation like that in markets where all you can be is fifth or sixth or
something isn't worth that kind of multiple, and I think today what you see out there is valuation expectations that are
frankly just unrealistic. And if that doesn't change, we'll be doing this organically. And I think you have to be balanced
about your – or disciplined about the returns you expect and the hurdles you expect. I mean there's – it's the old adage,
anything is for sale as long as it's an overwhelming compelling price.
And I think if it's an overwhelming compelling price, it better have a good return for our shareholders or they're not
going to think we did a good thing for them. So, it's not like you can just go out and create M&A activity. It's got to
have the right intersection of value for both sides, and today I'd tell you in this particular space, you don't see that. And
that's why you don't see very many deals getting done by anybody buying anything to expand their footprint. I mean,
our peers may say, gee, it's an unattractive market. I don't think the markets are unattractive at all. I think some of the
M&A is unattractive. But that just means you got to go at it more organically over time, and frankly if that's how it is,
we'll go at it organically.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Okay. And then one quick topic change, but going back to China. This is the second time in two,
three years that we've seen a pricing disruption whether it's market-based or government-based. How do you think
about that in terms of investment? Obviously, you...
<A - Miles D. White>: How do I think about that? I think about that that we're probably going to see it again in a
couple of years. I think you're going to see it over and over again in like a – I don't know, I have a lot of things I could

say about it, I suppose. But I think you see this stuff all the time. And I think if you over-obsess about China, you
would over-obsess about China. If you over-obsess about Brazil or India or Russia or somewhere else, you can
over-obsess about any one of them. And is there a headache every day? Yeah; somewhere. But overall, we're in a lot
more than China. So, I look at this and I think I suppose we should learn to deal with these sorts of things on a rolling
ongoing basis because I don't think they stop. But I think what it does say is you don't necessarily want to be
disproportionately indexed in a given geography if you can't take the volatility of the ride.
And so for us, we're in a lot of geographies, purposely, and we know that the balance of that mix of geographies is what
stabilizes that volatility because it offsets to some degree, and then overall, we can deliver much higher growth, more
reliably, on a sustainable basis. But in the backroom here, we're managing volatility every day. And so the way I think
about it is we're going to be managing volatility every day. And I stress to the management team, we've got to be
always kind of preparing Plan B, and what are you going to do if, and contingencies and so forth. And that's a
fundamental part of our whole planning and budgeting process all the time. And if you look at this year, six months,
seven months into the year, you say, has the year gone like you expected? The answer is no. Have we delivered the
earnings we committed? Yes. We've exceeded them. So, I think you've got to kind of plan that way every year.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Sure. And where I was going with the question, Miles, was really what's the risk that other
countries start to follow the model? We saw in Japan, historically every couple of years a big reimbursement cut. China
is now taking up the mantle. In other countries as their healthcare costs rise, they say, hey, it worked over there, why
not here? So, how do you think about that exposure maybe over a five-year window? And you've mainly answered it,
I'm just curious if there's an incremental given kind of that risk of a broadening. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, the possibility I guess exists, but the circumstances tend to be pretty unique to a given
country. There's a regimentation in Japan around price management from the government or price control from the
government that it's every year or every two years depending on whether you're devices, pharma or whatever segment,
and it tends to be a fairly predictable regimen. And what it tells you is, you want to be very close to your markets, you
want to have your medical affairs, government affairs, regulatory affairs people in country, in markets. You can't have
those relationships from Europe or the U.S. or something and expect to be in tune with your markets every day.
So, I think it's possible that similar philosophies could exist other places, but what it basically boils down to is kind of
that age-old, they want to buy it for less and we want to sell it for more, and life's a negotiation, and it just keeps going
that way. Whether it's Europe or China or Japan or India or anywhere else, the ability to earn a return is always subject
to a certain negotiation of what the payer can pay or will pay for the service or product you provide. I think that's just
part of the business.
<Q - Ben Andrew>: Thank you.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Elan, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi, Miles. Good morning, and thanks for taking all these questions, giving us some really
useful color. I do have a couple of questions, but I'll...
<A - Miles D. White>: I think you guys could ask Tom or Brian one or two, but okay.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: No chance this morning. I've got a couple of questions, but I'd like to just lead off on margins
because I think it's the most important thing that hasn't been talked about yet on the call. I mean, it's a very nice quarter
evidencing that the two lines about it, one is the great, broad top line growth, and the second point, you've got some
great underlying margin expansion to look forward to and that's what seemed to really help out this quarter. I was very
encouraged by the commentary around Nutrition and the margins there, and I wonder if you can just give us a better
view here in terms of is it just cadence of delivering this margin improvement, or can you give us a bit more color on, is

this going to run longer or shorter in terms of timeline, and how much further beyond the 20% of sales do you think
right now we can get to, given that you seem to be over-delivering there?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. I would say first of all that the performance in Nutrition is the result of a fairly detailed
comprehensive plan with literally over a hundred different initiatives and so forth. Some of those are quick and easy,
and some take more time. And some of it is mix of products, some of it is manufacturing process, some of it is whether
we make our own product or source it from a third party manufacturer; there's literally hundreds of things.
We've made great progress, and I think there's, frankly, a lot more to be made. We've commented in the past that we're
fortunate to have some fairly public comparisons to some of our competitors for some of our segments that give us
some benchmarks to sort of judge how we're doing in given places. But I think there's more here I guess is what I'd say.
I – as much as you'd like to get even greater forecasts out of me, I'm always trying to get it out of the business too
because there's that caution of well, let's not fully commit all of it to Miles and Tom and the corporation, so we leave
ourselves a little cushion, because as I just explained in previous questions, everybody is kind of thinking about
contingencies too. But the fact is, the organization's got a culture and a mindset around cost management, investment
management, expense management. We do make a distinction internally between that which will drive improved gross
margins before discretionary spending, and the management or efficiency of discretionary spending.
A lot of times you can go out and just cut SG&A to make a quarter, but frankly, I think that's kind of shortsighted. And
in our case, on the discretionary side, if we look there for efficiency or cost management, we're looking at primarily
G&A, or we're looking at where spending is valuable versus where it's not so valuable, bang for the buck, hit rate, et
cetera. So, Tom and I, over the course of this year, and partly as the exercise out of the split and the transition service
agreements and the back office stuff with AbbVie, we're looking at the manner in which we support all of our
businesses and the cost of that support and how we do it and so forth, to make ourselves more efficient. And I think
when you go through an exercise like the split, it's the time to do that, it certainly allows you the ability to do that, to
look at whether you can spend your general and administrative expenses better, more efficiently and so on, and we are.
Because I wouldn't want investors to misthink that somehow we're shortchanging the businesses or starving the
businesses from the standpoint of R&D investment or sales and marketing investment, because we're not, and we don't
have to. So, we do make a distinction about moderating spending and where, to how, so that we don't harm the longer
term prospects of the businesses.
But the longer term sustainable improvements in profits, frankly, tend to be above that gross margin line in your real
costs, your pricing, the mix of your products, how you manufacture, all those sorts of things, and that's where this is
coming from in Nutrition. This is not because they're raising price. This is all fundamental cost and structure
management about the way they conduct that business. This is very durable and long-sustainable profit improvement
and there's a lot more here, I think, and we think and we know the plan to get it. And I'm going to have Tom add to that,
if he will, for a minute.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. I'd just say that to your original question, I think things are ahead of schedule, and
you're seeing it in the gross margin delivering above expectations. And it really is a function of executing the programs
they have more quickly, more efficiently and getting more savings sooner than what we might have expected a while
back. So, that's primarily what's happening, and obviously the closer we get to the 20% initial targets we had for each
division, then the focus is going to be on what more and how much better we can get beyond that. And we're making
very good progress getting towards those initial targets and we're going to keep working on improving beyond that.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: And I would just like one extra last quick question if I can; I know time is short. But in terms
of M&A, you said you don't want to be very specific, you did mention in EPD product breadth as being one of the
issues now. A lot of the large pharma companies are looking to separate or break out many of their established pharma
businesses. Do you see opportunities in some of those reorganizations to potentially augment what you have in your
EPD business?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I can't comment on what it is the other companies may have or what they intend to do
with their assets. But I can tell you this: it would be of interest if it fit us geographically. It's not that we lack products

or lack breadth. We have breadth. We've got tremendous breadth in our EPD business, that the value primarily to any
kind of M&A addition to EPD is geographic footprint or share footprint in a given market, how large your share
position or brand position may be in that market. So, for us, it will more likely be a consideration of geographic
enhancement or geographic fit, than it will be breadth of product line, because we're not challenged from a breadth
standpoint. The opportunity is really in bigger geographic footprint. So, that would be kind of how we'd look at it. And
to the extent that there's assets out there that may fit that, we'll have a look. But today, I can honestly tell you I don't
really have a point of view because I haven't seen those assets yet.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Okay. Thank you.
