Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone.
Today I'll focus my top line thoughts on our progress this quarter and the progress we are making in transforming our
business. This quarter we reached $26.5 billion in revenue with an operating income of $7.8 billion. This quarter's
results show the product and business transformation underway at Microsoft. We saw success in a number of our
strategic areas, including cloud adoption, redefining and revitalizing the Windows ecosystem and improving economics
in our hardware portfolio.
We also saw some challenges this quarter. As expected, the onetime benefit of Windows XP end-of-life PC refresh
cycle has now tailed off. Additionally we ran into unexpected issues in select geographies. Where there are execution
issues, we will address them. Where there are macroeconomic challenges, we will weather them. With that in mind, I'll
walk you through the quarter.
Let's start with our cloud business, an area where we are extending our leadership position and accelerating our
innovation. In commercial cloud we saw continued customer and revenue growth across a growing footprint of cloud
services: Office 365, Azure, Enterprise Mobility Suite and Dynamics CRM Online. In fact this quarter is the sixth
consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth in commercial cloud and we are now at a run rate of $5.5 billion.
Azure services continue to grow in appeal to Enterprise IT and developers with rapid improvements across hybrid
services, premium cloud storage and virtual machine offerings, enhanced data and data analytics offerings. Microsoft
Enterprise Mobility Suite is one key area of product innovation that I would like to highlight given the growth and the
uniqueness of this offering. Microsoft offers a comprehensive solution for all devices that brings together mobile
device management, mobile application management, hybrid identity management and data protection into one unified
offering through EMS.
Office 365 now includes new application experiences on all phones and tablets for mobile productivity. Further, we
have released completely new scenarios. This includes Office Sway for visualizing and sharing ideas; Delve to help
search and discover content; Office 365 Groups to make it easier to collaborate, Office 365 Video for secure media
streaming for businesses.
Finally we continue to invest in enterprise value by integrating MDM and Enterprise Mobility Suite into Office 365:
new encryption technologies, compliant certification and new eDiscovery capabilities in Exchange.
In Dynamics CRM Online we added 53 markets this quarter bringing us to 130 markets around the world. We are
bringing together CRM with Cortana, Yammer, Power BI, and Skype to add unique value to customers.
We're expanding our capabilities in the cloud through five new acquisitions. Last week, we announced an agreement to
purchase Revolution Analytics, the leading provider of statistical computing and predictive analytics which will enable
our customers to unlock big data insights. We bought HockeyApp, a leading mobile app testing and development
service to enhance Azure services for mobile developers. Our acquisition of Aorato accelerates our ability to give
customers unique security capabilities by tapping into behavioral intelligence around identity and access spanning
on-premise and the cloud. We're bringing on new capabilities in machine learning as applied to eDiscovery and other
enterprise compliance processes with the acquisition of Equivio. And we also welcome Accompli, a provider of

innovative mobile email applications for iOS and Android. The common theme across all these acquisitions is
advanced data analytics and machine learning-driven capabilities that improve with more customer adoption and usage
of the cloud.
We're also making progress in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 Home and Personal revenue grew nearly 150%
year-over-year as we added 2.1 million net new subscribers since last quarter. Bing U.S. search share continues to
grow, as does search revenue with 23% growth this quarter. I will talk about our progress in Xbox Live later in my
comments.
Now let's turn to Windows. To start, the overall Windows ecosystem is driving more innovation. Over the holiday
season at CES, our partner showcased the diverse lineup of Windows devices including more premium device choices
than ever. Last spring, we made a strategic decision to introduce new Windows pricing programs to drive unit growth
in opening price point PCs as well as tablets, and this quarter, we saw year-over-year growth. Also, businesses continue
to value Windows. We are seeing healthy demand for Windows Pro even though we faced challenging prior-year
comparables in Q2 as well as in the second half of the year following the Windows XP end of support related PC
refresh.
Now let's talk about Windows 10. Last week was an important milestone on our path to release Windows 10 and usher
in an era of more personal computing. The heritage of Windows was about enabling one single device, the PC. With
Windows 10, we are building a device platform for the mobile-first cloud-first world. It's a world where the mobility of
a person's experience is paramount, requiring a platform that spans devices from small screens to large screens to no
screens at all. It's a world where interacting with technology is as natural as interacting with other people, and it's a
world that demands trust and security.
It is also a world with rich opportunity for developers. And Windows 10 will be the most attractive Windows
development platform ever. With our free upgrade offer and with universal application and unified store for developers,
we'll have a large unified up-to-date user base to target. We want people to love Windows and have made this our most
collaborative project yet with more than 2 million insiders giving us feedback every day. I'm very optimistic about
Windows 10.
We are making progress with our own devices, both those in the market today and also the ones that we have recently
announced. This quarter, we surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark with Surface for the first time. The value
proposition of being the most productive tablet is resonating.
Further, the sales for Lumia phones topped 10 million units, growing 30% year over year this quarter, with strength in
devices such as Lumia 500 and 600 series, our affordable smartphones. In this segment of the market, the combination
of our brand and value stand out, and we plan to continue to build a beachhead here.
We're also creating new device types that open up new markets and opportunities for Microsoft. In October, we
launched our first wearable, the Microsoft Band. And just last week we revealed two new hardware with Windows 10:
Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft Surface Hub will revolutionize group collaboration in
meetings. HoloLens and Windows holographic computing will make mixed reality applications part of everyday life
across work and home.
I want to talk briefly about Xbox. Xbox One console adoption accelerated this holiday and was the top selling console
in the U.S., and fans on Xbox Live were engaged with the service more than ever before. However, it's our strategies
coming together with Windows 10 that give me the greatest optimism. The vibrant social gaming community on Xbox
Live will span Xbox, Windows PC, tablets, and phones. With Windows 10, gamers on a PC, tablet, or Xbox console
can play together, and games on Xbox One can easily stream to a Windows 10 PC or tablet.
It's also getting clearer how games people love today will evolve to mind-blowing experiences in the future when
designed for mixed reality that Windows 10 and HoloLens create. Just imagine what's possible with Minecraft. Gaming
truly is a valuable part of millions of people's lives, and Microsoft will excel and increase our lead.

Before closing, I wanted to share a few thoughts on capital allocation. Over the past several quarters and certainly with
last week's Windows 10 announcements, you've seen us unleash new innovation in our cloud services with Windows
and our hardware. We did all of this without materially growing our cost base. This required clarity in purpose and
value proposition, realignment of talent, and disciplined execution. Our increasing innovation and competitiveness in
today's growth markets and the creation of new categories is how we will most positively impact the returns for our
investors.
Earlier today, we announced our intention to complete the existing $40 billion share repurchase authorization by
December 31, 2016. This is another step in our ongoing commitment to increase capital return for our shareholders
while investing in the growth of our business. It too shows our optimism for the future growth of Microsoft. As we
move forward, we will certainly continue to be thoughtful in our capital return decisions, balanced across dividends and
share repurchases.
In closing, I'm encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation to become the productivity and
platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world. I'm proud of how our teams are stepping up to both change
and execute to make this transformation happen. I'm confident of the decisions and choices we are making to drive our
business and products forward to serve our customers and partners in the future.
With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through the quarter's results in further detail and share our outlook for the next
quarter. I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer your questions. Thank you.
Amy Hood
Thanks and good afternoon, everyone.
As Satya shared, in Q2 we again made solid progress on our business transformation. We had strong growth in our
cloud and subscription businesses. Our annuity renewals were healthy, as customers remained committed to our
enterprise portfolio. And our hardware products performed well during the holiday season. As we expected, our
year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the prior-year benefits that we realized in our OEM and Office
transactional businesses following the Windows XP end-of-support refresh cycle.
Beyond that, our results in China and Japan fell short of our expectations. In Japan, the PC market lagged due to the
macroeconomic environment along with the combined impact of XP end-of-support and the VAT increase last year.
Our Office attach rate to PCs is very high there, so the weak PC market also impacted Office revenue.
With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter. Revenue was $26.5 billion, up
8%, and would have been one point better without the impact of foreign exchange. Gross margin grew slightly this
quarter, even when comparing against a year ago that benefited from the XP refresh cycle. Our commitment to ongoing
execution improvement and thoughtful portfolio management helped improve the gross margin percentage in each of
our operating segments.
Operating income declined 2%, which included $243 million of integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that,
operating income grew 1%.
Our reported GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, which included a $0.02 negative impact from integration and
restructuring expense and a $0.04 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Foreign exchange had a $0.01
negative impact on EPS.
As we discussed last quarter, FX movement first impacts our bookings growth and unearned revenue on our balance
sheet. Our contracted but not billed balance was adjusted down to reflect current FX rates. Therefore, our bookings
were flat this quarter. Unearned revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $21.2 billion but the sequential decline was
slightly higher than we expected due to the larger than anticipated impact from FX. Adjusting for that FX impact, our
commercial unearned balance was in line with historical trends and our expectations.

From a geographic perspective, relative to our expectations, the U.S. outperformed and Europe was generally in line.
As I mentioned earlier, China and Japan were below our expectations. With that backdrop, I will now move to a
detailed discussion of our results.
Last year we ended support for Windows XP. That stimulated a PC refresh cycle in particular in developed markets and
with business customers. During the period from Q2 through the end of our fiscal year, Windows Pro revenue growth
was over 10% and meaningfully outpaced business PC growth. As expected in Q2, PCs have reverted to a more
normalized mix between developed and emerging markets and Pro attached to business PCs has returned to levels we
saw prior to FY 2014. Also to drive revenue growth in academic institutions, we lowered the price of Windows Pro for
that customer segment. This pricing change, along with the impact of XP, caused Windows revenue growth to be lower
than the relatively stable business PC market we have seen since the end of FY 2013.
We again grew Windows non-Pro licenses and saw year-over-year growth in activations. This was driven by
particularly strong demand for opening price point PCs, related to the strategic decisions Satya spoke of earlier. The
hardware mix shift to opening price point PCs impacted license mix, and therefore, aggregate revenue per license in the
quarter. The mix shift was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline.
Inventory in the channel is a bit higher than normal which we expect to work through in Q3. Office consumer, products
and services revenue declined 12% and was impacted by the ongoing transition to Office 365 and by the dynamics in
Japan, where PC growth was lower than we expected and a geography where the paid attach of Office is high.
Adoption of Office 365 Home and Personal remained strong and we now have over 9.2 million subscribers.
In our Computing and Gaming segment, we are proud of the continued progress we are making in our Surface
portfolio. Strong interest in Surface Pro 3 helped to drive record revenue as well as improve gross margin. Surface Pro
3 volumes are pacing over three times the rate of what we saw with Surface Pro 2.
In Gaming, Xbox One was the console sales leader in the U.S. Xbox Live users grew and those users increased their
purchases of third party publisher content and consumables. Sales of the Xbox platform exclusive, Halo: The Master
Chief Collection and Forza Horizon 2 were strong. And this quarter we welcomed Minecraft.
We articulated our plan for the Phone business back in July and we are executing to plan. With our Lumia portfolio of
phones, we are driving volumes in the low price device category. We sold 10.5 million Lumia phones this quarter, an
all-time high. We also sold over 39 million non-Lumia phones, even while we make changes to the product portfolio
and manage this business for profitability. We are looking forward to bringing new product to market that will
showcase the features that we presented at our Windows 10 event last week.
Revenue in our Devices & Consumer Other segment grew 30%. As noted earlier, Xbox Live transactions and first party
games performed well and contributed to this growth. Additionally, search revenue growth was strong with
improvements in both rate and volume. Within display, revenue declined on our MSN portal though we saw revenue
growth across other Microsoft properties. We are also pleased by our gross margin expansion in this segment.
Transitioning now to our consumer results where revenue grew 5%. Our annuity revenue remained strong growing
double digits and renewal rates remained high. Customers are continuing to move from transactional purchasing to
long-term annuity contracts as they show an increased commitment to our product roadmap.
Our transactional revenue declined over 15%, slightly more than we expected primarily in Office and mostly due to our
performance in China and Japan which I detailed earlier. Additionally, FX had a greater negative impact on
commercial revenue than we had anticipated. Our commercial cloud services delivered triple-digit revenue growth for
the sixth consecutive quarter. Office 365 continues to be priority for CIOs as both existing and new customers move to
the cloud. This transition accelerated with 45% of our renewal seats in Office moving to the cloud this quarter.
We are seeing great growth in revenue from premium Azure services, driven by both the increasing customer base and
an expansion in a number of services that those customers deploy. Within Dynamics CRM Online, customer growth
accelerated and revenue nearly doubled. From a product perspective, commercial Office product and services revenue
declined 1%, slightly below our expectations. Annuity revenue remained strong with high renewal rates and continued

adoption of Office 365. Within our Office transactional business, year-on-year comparables are difficult given the
benefits from last year's XP refresh where customers chose to update their desktop productivity solutions along with
their PC.
Additionally, the shift to Office 365 continues to impact transactional revenue. While these dynamics were consistent
with our expectations, revenue in China and Japan both fell short given the factors that I noted earlier. Server products
and services revenue grew 9%, again outpacing the broader IT market. Growth in premium mix helped to drive
double-digit revenue growth in SQL Server and System Center. Windows Server annuity revenue grew double digits
again this quarter but transactional revenue was down, primarily due to a declining traditional server market.
Additionally, we are pleased with the performance in Dynamics business which grew revenue 13%, driven by growth
in both on-premises and cloud offerings.
Operating expense grew 1% to $8.3 billion and was favorable to our expectations. These results are inclusive of
investments that we made in our strategic growth areas, a few of which were showcased last week at our Windows 10
event. Excluding approximately $750 million from the addition of NDF operating expense would have declined 8%.
Relative to the guidance that we provided for the quarter, roughly half of the favorability resulted from FX changes
with the balance driven by our continued prioritization of spend.
Our integration and restructuring efforts have been focused on optimizing resources across the company which includes
reducing the expense base in our Phone business. To date, we have integrated the manufacturing and supply chain
teams across Microsoft while also rationalizing our phone manufacturing capacity. In operating expense, we committed
to reducing $1 billion from the phone cost base which we have done. We continue to look for opportunities to drive
further efficiencies. Our effective tax rate was 25% and higher than expected due to previously mentioned income tax
charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of phone results and our
changing geographic mix.
Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, driven primarily by investments to increase our capacity as we expanded
existing and added new data centers, as well as made server purchases and support of our fast growing cloud business.
This quarter, we increased our capital return by 5%, with $4.5 billion returned to shareholders through buybacks and
dividends. And as Satya reinforced in his comments, we will continue to take thoughtful steps to increase capital return
to shareholders with a focus on value.
With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook. Our guidance is based on our current view of
FX rates. Should the U.S. dollar strengthen beyond those assumptions, as it did this quarter, we would see additional
negative impact to earnings, revenue, our balance sheet and our contracted but not billed balance.
As a reminder, in our annuity businesses, the FX impact is first reflected in unearned revenue, which is recorded at the
rate when the contract is billed. Then revenue comes onto the P&L at that same rate as it is recognized, generally over
to next year. Therefore in Q3 we will start to recognize a higher percentage of revenue from periods with a stronger
U.S. dollar than the prior year comparison.
In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 4 points in Q3. The majority of
this impact is in our Commercial business. In FY 2014, it was our Q2 through Q4 results that most benefited from
Windows XP end of support. As such, our growth rates across Windows Pro and transactional Office will be impacted
as our business moves back to pre-XP levels.
On a geographic basis, we expect year-on-year revenue declines in China, Russia and Japan. In Japan, Q3 represents an
even tougher comparison with the anniversary of the VAT which again will create difficult comparables in Windows
and Office. We currently expect that these geographic dynamics, challenging comparables from XP and FX headwinds
will be in place throughout the remainder of our fiscal year.
With that overall background, let me move to our specific Q3 guidance starting with Devices & Consumer where
revenue guidance includes approximately 4 points of drag from FX. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion
to $3.6 billion. This range assumes a more challenging comparables I mentioned earlier. The range also includes a
reduction in channel inventory for Windows non-Pro opening price point PCs. Within consumer Office, we expect to

see similar trends to Q2. And within our IP licensing business, we expect lower per unit royalties with the changing
mix of devices sold by our licensees. In computing and gaming, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.
This range reflects normal seasonality coming out of the holidays for our Xbox and Surface businesses. In phone
hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This range anticipates accelerating year-over-year
growth in Lumia units driven by our affordable smartphone devices.
We also expect both volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to continue to decline in Q3. With this lower aggregate
revenue base, we expect gross margins, which include non-cash amortization, to be lower for the next couple of
quarters. In Devices & Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be about $2 billion, reflecting continued progress in key
areas like Office 365 Home and Personal, Xbox Live, and search.
In our Commercial business, we expect our significant momentum in annuity and commercial cloud services to
continue. Within our Commercial Licensing segment, we expect revenue to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion. In addition
to the factors that I discussed which impact our year-over-year comparability, we anticipate a four point drag from FX.
In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Even after considering the impact of FX,
growth will remain robust, with expected momentum across our commercial cloud portfolio, Office 365, Azure, and
CRM Online. And in corporate, we don't expect any revenue impact.
As we continue to work towards the launch of Windows 10, we will share additional detailed information regarding
any accounting impacts from the Windows 10 free upgrade offer and Windows-as-a-service. I would like to reiterate
that our OEM royalty model, which is paid up front, will remain in place.
We expect COGS to be $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion, with variability driven by both hardware segments. We expect third
quarter operating expense to be $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion. We are lowering our full-year guidance to $33.2 billion to
$33.6 billion, which reduces full-year growth, including NDS [Nokia Devices and Services], to 4% to 5%. Our Q3
plans include investments in advertising and customer-facing roles to continue to accelerate our momentum, with
commercial products such as SQL and the cloud. These investments are a direct result of reprioritization decisions
made during H1.
Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to incur an additional $200 million of restructuring expense. This
results in total charges of roughly $1.4 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance. Separately, we still expect
integration expense of $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, other income and
expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current
FX environment, we expect other income and expense to be negative $100 million in Q3.
We now expect our full-year tax rate to be between 22% and 24%. This includes the Q2 income tax charge for an IRS
audit adjustment as well as the changing geographic mix of our business. In Q3, we expect CapEx to sequentially
increase in support of our growing cloud business.
Unearned revenue will continue to benefit from customers moving to our subscription services and high contract
renewal rates. We expect to see low single-digit sequential decline in our unearned for Q3, which includes a one point
drag from FX, as new billings will reflect the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our commercial unearned
balance will follow recent historical seasonality when adjusted for FX.
In closing, this quarter was another example of the progress that we are making across this company. Our execution
continues to improve and we are making data-driven decisions to inform our investments, both shorter term, as you
have seen in our marketing and sales adjustments, as well as for the longer term, as we adjust our product portfolio.
There are certainly short-term comparability challenges as we anniversary last year's XP refresh cycle and see the
impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. But we are confident in the underlying health of our business, proud of the
significant innovation we are funding within our prioritized operating budgets, and excited to continue gaining share in
key strategic markets.

driving the increase in cloud margins within the Commercial Other segment, as well as any sense for how accretive the
cloud is becoming? And then I have a follow-up question.
<A - Amy Hood>: Sure. Why don't I talk a little bit about that from a math perspective? And I'll let Satya add from
some of our engineering improvements which I think are important. Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix
shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud
environment. That is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth. In addition, we've done a lot of hard
engineering work, I believe, over the past six quarters to be able to take advantage of more utilization and capacity over
time. And I'll let Satya maybe add a little bit technically.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Overall, the shift to the higher layer services is the real driver here, which is obviously Office
365 and its various levels is one factor. The other one is what I talked about in the Enterprise Mobility Suite. That's
really got fantastic momentum in the marketplace because the solution has really come together and it's fairly unique,
as well as Dynamics CRM. So these all got a different profile in terms of margin, and they're all now pretty high
growth businesses for us.
So when you think about our cloud, you've got to think about the low-level infrastructure. Even there, we now have
premium offerings, and then we have higher level services. So that aggregate portfolio is what helps us move up the
margin curve.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Excellent, and one quick follow-up. How should we think about monetization, Satya, for
the Windows devices sub nine-inch?
<A - Satya Nadella>: One of the comments I had made in my remarks was some momentum we are seeing in our
consumer cloud services. So for example, the store monetization, Bing monetization, Xbox Live monetization, as Xbox
Live now, in fact, is going to span devices, are all things that drive monetization for below nine inches. So I think of
device gross margin in some cases because we are building devices like the phones as well as this post-sale
monetization using our consumer cloud services, as the two additional levers that we have in order to be able to
monetize Windows devices.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Excellent, thank you. I appreciate it.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, Mark. We'll move to the next question, please.

<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Amy, just on the XP tail-off, are there other commercial products that you're seeing being
impacted? I just wanted to be clear, there were a lot of questions. Is there some type of halo impact from the XP taking
growth down on the other solutions?
<A - Amy Hood>: Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last
year when the impact was happening. So let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components
again. Obviously, there's the very direct impact which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro. And it's
mixed when attached to business PCs.
The other important component of that was when people bought a PC, as we talked through the year, they often took
the chance, whether generally in the Business segment, which impacts in our world commercial licensing as a reporting
unit, to buy Office and generally on a non-annuity basis. So if you think about that being the next major transactional
type purchase, that was driven a year ago as the first externality.
The second was in Windows VL. We also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows VL, which again is in our
Commercial Licensing segment. So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. If
you think about it from our reporting segments, it's the D&C Licensing segment, as well as our Commercial Licensing
segment and specifically our transactional revenue growth year over year.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up, just on the reduction in operating expenses for the full year. Is
this across the board, Amy? Is there a particular area that you're finding more opportunity to cut?
<A - Amy Hood>: Brent, thanks again. I actually think of it as a general concept. I think we are trying to invest behind
opportunities where we see them. Some of those are more public as we've talked about in terms of our sales and
marketing adjustments or ad campaigns that we run like the commercial cloud. Others I think you don't have the
opportunity to see until we launch products like we did last week when we were able to reassort our product portfolio
and really move our talent to invest in – I guess mind blowing is the word Satya used – in terms of product portfolio in
that way.
So I'm not sure that all of it, Brent, I would say is across a line in that way. They're sort of short-term optimizations and
longer-term portfolio optimization. But I think we've talked about this before. I think the entire senior leadership team
views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we
invest. And I think we've made great progress as a team. I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and
in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thank you.
<A - Satya Nadella>: And I'll just add that we are also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of
our engineering teams. And that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments. So there's a significant, I
would say, combination of culture change, as well as how we work change that drives more innovation for the same
dollar.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: We'll move to next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One on execution. It sounds like you highlight some issues in
Japan and we've heard about VAT from other companies. Can you just talk about what you're doing to address some of
those issues? And is there any concern that that might spread beyond what you've seen in Japan and China?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Walter. Is that both your questions? I just want to make sure I get them.

<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: I was just trying to understand generally that issue. I have one other, but it's just on...
<A - Satya Nadella>: So I would just start by just talking about China. We have in China, currently a set of
geopolitical issues that we are working through. We are very committed to China as a market. We have in fact pockets
of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well. But at the same time, we grounded that in the fact that we
need more work to do and we are working through them. And then as and when they'll work out, we'll let you know.
<A - Amy Hood>: I'll talk a little bit about Japan and, Walter, to answer your question, I don't have any concerns that,
that expands, especially in this unique issue beyond Japan. With the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, as
well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated. And Japan in
particular, because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us. So impacts in Japan more directly come to
the P&L as opposed to on our unearned or CNB [Contracted Not Billed] balances. And that's why this quarter you saw
some weakness in Commercial Licensing. But when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt
quite good from a commercial perspective.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: And then just one question on the Office 365 commercial, can you talk about deployment
rates there? I know you've done a good job of getting those into contracts. How many customers are actually running it
– running their e-mail and SharePoint and other products in the cloud versus just having the rights to it?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Walter. I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle. And I'm really
encouraged by the fact that we are doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through
adding on services and back to renewals. And I think the importance of that customer life cycle is really how we think
about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud.
The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously Exchange. It happens to also come with directory
implementation and so we generally think of a fast deployment cycle, and then adding on workloads and premium
workloads cycle.
And then as you might imagine that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually
that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite. So while I think there's
always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customer showed to the movement to the cloud and then
moving them quickly as we can but also at their own pace through deployment.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Walter. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking our question. I just want to dig into Windows OEM
ASPs a little bit and just try to sort of better understand the dynamics between what we see in the marketplace when we
look at the industry analysts that we're looking at basically sort of flat to slightly down unit growth and the down 13%
OEM that revenue growth that you guys are seeing some of this mix and in some of this ASP. I was wondering if you
can help us with a little bit more color in terms of exactly what that ASP dynamic is going on in terms of these lower
entry level additions. What's that doing to the overall ASP of what you're able to extract from the market?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Keith. I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I
wasn't sure which category you were talking about. Let me start at the highest level which is, if I look at industry
analysts as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms
of PC unit health across business which has been stable since FY 2013 and across consumer where we've seen
meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one. So then I'll take a second and talk
about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth, so let me start first in Pro.

There, there are really two key dynamics. The first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh.
They're consistent. The dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an
ASP problem in Pro. It is a return to the attach level we saw before. The component that actually is impact – the second
component in Pro that is an "ASP/mix comment" is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower
the price and saw an increased unit number. So that was a second component of the revenue piece. But the larger
component was the XP reversion, and again that's not an ASP comment.
When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments which is we saw device growth in low
price devices, opening price points. We actually made, I believe, a strategic decision to increase our ability to put
devices on the shelf, especially at retail, at prices under $200 to $249 is how to think about the price points that were
the most impacted. We do have the Windows with Bing SKU there. It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro
OEM license, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in
the channel.
And so overall while it did have an RPL impact which does explain along with mix shift the minus 13% in non-Pro
OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall
ecosystem health, which we feel quite good about.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: If I can squeeze in one follow-up. Have you guys done any assessment in terms of the
success you're seeing in Surface Pro 3? It definitely is a real productivity device. To what extent is that cannibalistic
from what would have been Windows PC sales and to what extent do you think you're expanding the market
opportunity with that device?
<A - Satya Nadella>: I think it's definitely expanding the market opportunity. One of the things that I feel very good
about is the risk we took to introduce the two-in-one category. And I feel now that we see that in fact inspire even a lot
of activity in our own OEM ecosystem. And we see many good designs coming because it's viewed as a category that
drives growth. And so from that perspective, I feel good about leading because that's one of our strategic goals which is
we want to create new categories, foster more demand for the entire ecosystem.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: We'll take the next question, please, operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.
<Q - Rick Sherlund>: Thanks. For Satya, could you talk about the implications of Windows 10 for a moment? I'm
thinking, in terms of a new platform for innovation, and maybe you could talk about post-sale monetization. What do
you think the impact is on demand in the industry and the opportunities for Microsoft around the new platform?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks, Rick, for the question. As I said in my remarks, I'm very optimistic about what
Windows 10 means for our customers, partners and Microsoft. The core idea of Windows 10 is to build a device
operating system that spans the gamut from no screens to small screens to PCs and even large screens. In fact, if you
look at our innovation, we are perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we are doing with the Surface Hub,
HoloLens as well as some of the two-in-one form factors.
So overall, I think the most strategic objective for us is to get developer momentum with Windows 10. And that's
where we are focused in on with a lot of different actions. One is the one unified developer platform, which I think of
as perhaps the most strategic piece of Windows 10, along with the unified store. And now couple that with the call we
have made to provide an upgrade offer. We are creating a great opportunity for every developer to write these universal
Windows applications that will run on the desktop as well as on our phone and tablets as well as on Surface Hub, and in
fact HoloLens runs universal applications. No one else provides that kind of a unified marketplace for developers.

And especially the changes we have made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are in fact
very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop. So that's the combination of things
that we think are going to play out effectively. And of course, we are in beta right now or previews right now and
getting daily feedback across all the length and breadth of Windows 10. But overall, I'm pretty optimistic of what it
means both as a platform as well as a set of end user features.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Rick. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Philip Alan Winslow>: Thanks, guys. I've just got a question on the Commercial Other line. Obviously, that
continues to show strong growth. You've been calling out the cloud business, whether it be Azure or Office 365. But I
just wanted to double click on the Azure side. I wonder if you could help us parse through the
infrastructure-as-a-service and the platform-as-a-service side and the trends there and any joint benefit I guess that
you're seeing of being able to offer both those two.
And also, Satya, as this business does scale – and then Amy, I'd love you to chime in here too -how do you think about
the gross margin and just operating margin characteristics once again as the revenue just continues to grow here?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks, Phil. So let me start. Overall, what we are seeing is clearly there's increased usage of
infrastructure-as-a-service because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud. But the interesting
thing that happens once you move your initial workload is you build around it, especially for example if you move a
VM with some data into the cloud, you may want to use that same data to build a mobile front end. And that's when
you are starting to use some of our platform-as-a-service components like our Azure Mobile Services, Azure Media
Services.
So we see the combination, and they're not all happening coincident but there is time lag in it. So therefore that's one of
the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads onto Azure, both storage and compute. And
even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM
sizes. And then on top of that, we have these managed services which have a different margin profile, so media
services, mobile services, web, which is another place where we actually have a lot of traction. And then that's all just
on Azure. Once you get beyond Azure, you have things like CRM Online. You have Enterprise Mobility Suite, and of
course, the Office 365 lineup.
And when we think about our capital and in fact the core infrastructure, we don't have different infrastructure for these
different services. It's one common infrastructure and one common datacenter footprint between O-365, Azure, CRM,
Xbox Live, everything. So that's why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about even total return on
invested capital for our cloud business.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Phil. We'll move to next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great, thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up, Amy. Your
Commercial Other business continues to have fantastic growth, and I'm just wondering. When you juxtapose that with
the growth in the Commercial Licensing business, I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you face. But when we
think about it more than one quarter out and think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market
share in the cloud, how do we think about the trends in the Commercial Licensing business in the next year or so?

<A - Amy Hood>: I think in general, let me start by saying all up. So in our Commercial business, I think we've done a
very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis and continuing to push customers to our annuity
business whether they're on-premise or in the cloud. That is our strategic goal as well as impacts then both segments.
Now let me talk about uniquely commercial licensing and how to think about it. While I won't give specific guidance, I
will talk about how to think about the impact in particular from XP. Our transactional revenue will have a headwind
from XP. That doesn't and shouldn't be interpreted as customers not continuing to be committed or not committing to
move to annuity over the longer term, which is exactly I think the question that you're asking.
And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing
and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing, which will be a headwind, the overall goal of
continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud, or whether or not they move, adding cloud
services even if they have on-prem because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guidepost we have
on a multiyear journey.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Heather. Operator, we'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thanks for taking my question, two quick questions. Satya, I wanted to follow up on Phil
Winslow's question earlier on Azure and the use cases there. In theory, you have a huge opportunity given your
installed base on the server side. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing the SMB customer base doing there?
Are we in that people trying on bursting? Or where is that huge customer base in terms of adoption on Azure?
<A - Satya Nadella>: On Azure itself, one of the other elements that I did not actually talk about in response to Phil's
question is the hybrid offering. One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the StorSimple product, which
is essentially a storage product that cloud tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud. We also have built
now into Windows Server Backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL Server. So that's the first thing that
we're seeing is increased usage of our servers with a cloud component.
Bursting is something for sure a lot of people do, but that's more on the high end because in the SMB segment, the real
movement there is more to Office 365. In fact, one of the things in Office 365 is we are getting people to effectively
use servers which now happens to be in cloud who never bought servers from us ever before because they didn't have
Exchange, they didn't have Lync, they didn't have any of the core capabilities of Office 365. So those are the two trends
we are seeing.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect, and a quick follow-up for Amy. If you look at the changes on the operating side that
you talked about, it obviously seems it's a cultural shift to what's more – if you budget, it's more dynamic budgeting. It's
very much a return based culture that you seem to be introducing here. But it's something that kind of means some feed
for the organization and it's more a cultural change. Where are you in terms of like innings in terms of having it fully
through the organization?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks for that question. I think we talked about this in prior quarters. While many people want to
see it as a finance concept, it's not. It's a senior leadership team concept and a leadership environment that I think we're
making collective decisions faster. I think we're applying our resources to opportunities when we see them. I think we
have a freedom to make those choices quickly. And I feel very good both about the decisiveness that comes with it but
also the empowerment that we give people within our organizations to make those calls to increase our performance
without waiting to an annual budget process. I think some people call it dynamic budgeting. I think for us it's more
about thinking about opportunities we have and stack ranking those every day to improve other execution and our
returns.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.

<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Brendan J. Barnicle>: Thanks so much. Amy, when we first started talking about Office 365, I think at that time
you were suggesting that the move from an Office CAL [Client Access License] to an Office 365 license would
increase gross profit by about 50%. Now that you've had a couple of quarters with Office 365, do you think those
changes to the model still make sense? And more importantly, are there other changes that you've seen that are more
accurate?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks for the question. In general, I think we're still on the early ends of seeing the opportunity
that we have in that segment. As you point out, there's a couple of components that make gross profit dollars per seat or
the lifetime value of a customer, depending on the terms you want to use, improve and increase over the life cycle.
The very first thing, and I think Satya mentioned it and it's most direct in SMB, is moving from buying copy of Office,
which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who
used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own.
So as you move Office, it's simply the first step. So even though obviously it comes a lower gross margin percentage,
our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really
where the lifetime value goes up. And frankly over time, and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of
innovation we've seen coming out of our engineering teams, particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM Team
Online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time.
We mentioned simply one that didn't exist I think, Brendan, when we first started having this conversation which was
our EMS suite. And I look and say those opportunities, as well as the creativity of our people, I think gives me more
confidence, not less, in the structural integrity of the lifetime value of a customer argument.
<Q - Brendan J. Barnicle>: Great, thanks so much.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks. Operator, we'll have time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - Edward Everett Maguire>: Yes. Thank you. Over the last several quarters, and particularly, Satya, you've
opened up a number of the products to different platforms, Office and Android and with Minecraft and Skype you've
got a number of really multi-platform product and services. Could you quantify so far to what extent you've seen
benefit and as this plays into the free upgrade for Windows 10, at least for a limited period, how you expect this to play
out benefiting the business case of your products across the portfolio?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Yeah. So overall, at the highest levels, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft
services, i.e., cloud services, be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility Suite, are covering all the
devices out there in the marketplace, so that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these
subscription and capacity-based services. So that's sort of the core rationale for why we are doing cross platform.
Now the next question is what's the uniqueness of Windows? And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don't
think of these services and their application end points as apps but fundamentally core to the Windows experience. So
we are building them natively into Windows. So for example, when you log into Windows, you're logging in with
Microsoft account or Azure really. When you have files they are syncing with OneDrive. Outlook is the e-mail client
for Windows.

So that's how Windows will differentiate and not to mention our gaming and Xbox Live experiences. So overall we
will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in
Windows. And at the same time we'll make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage,
more subscription growth. So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth
and EMS growth.
