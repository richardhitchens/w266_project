MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Merck's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Joseph Romanelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Joseph Romanelli
Okay. Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to
everyone listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's third quarter 2014 conference call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to remind you of a couple of items. First, there are number of items in the
GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. We've excluded these
items at our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and you can see them in our press release in Table 2. This will give you a
better sense of our underlying business performance.

There are three tables in the press release. The first table provides the GAAP results. Table number 2 reconciles our
GAAP P&L to the non-GAAP results. And Table 3 provides sales performance for the company's business units and
our products both on a reported basis and excluding foreign exchange. During the call, we'll be referring to Table 2
when we discuss the P&L and Table 3 when we talk about revenue performance.
Finally, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon Merck's current beliefs and are subject to significant risk and
uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
The company's SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2013 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements
that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement. Our
SEC filings can be found on the website at merck.com, and you can also find our earnings release and all the tables
there as well.
Now with that, I'd like to say good morning to Ken Frazier, our Chairman and CEO; Rob Davis, our CFO; Adam
Schechter, Head of Global Human Health; and Dr. Roger Perlmutter, Head of Merck Research Labs.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining the call today. We again reported solid earnings this
morning. But before I discuss our performance, please allow me to remind you of the strategy that consistently guides
us.
Merck remains focused on bringing forward medicines and vaccines that make a difference to patients, payers and
healthcare systems around the world. In a healthcare marketplace, where resources are increasingly scarce, our strategy
continues to be all about meaningful innovation.
To accomplish this, last October, we announced our global initiative to sharpen our commercial and R&D focus,
redesign our operating model, and reduce our cost base.
We launched this multi-year initiative to transform Merck into a more competitive, more innovative company and to
build a platform for sustained future growth. Now one year later, I am pleased to report that this quarter's results reflect
the steady progress we've made in each of these areas.
We identified four areas of focus where we will compete to win and our investments are paying off. In our diabetes
business, we reallocated resources and invested significantly in JANUVIA and have now reported our second
consecutive quarter of growth in the U.S. and in international markets.
This marks an important turnaround from where we were last year. Our acute care business grew by double-digits this
quarter, as we're now seeing the impact of our investments. These brands will continue to be key drivers of growth in
emerging markets.
Our vaccines business remains a fundamental contributor to Merck, despite a decline in this quarter due to the timing of
U.S. public sector purchases. We're also looking forward to regulatory action for V503, our next-generation 9 valent
vaccine for HPV.
And then in oncology, our integrated business unit has made strides to file and launch KEYTRUDA. This quarter, we
received approval from the FDA for KEYTRUDA, the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the U.S. for advanced
melanoma. And I'm happy to report that we also recently received Breakthrough designation from the FDA for
KEYTRUDA as a potential therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

We continue to study KEYTRUDA in more than 30 different tumor types and are encouraged by recent data presented
at the European Society for Medical Oncology in five different cancers. Roger will talk more in a few minutes about
the progress we continue to make with the KEYTRUDA program, and Adam will discuss the recent U.S. launch in
advanced melanoma.
Also, during the third quarter, we received U.S. approval from the FDA for BELSOMRA, our novel treatment for
insomnia, which we anticipate launching early next year. In addition to increasing our focus on the key therapeutic
areas that represent our best opportunities, we continued to rigorously prioritize our portfolio to ensure that all of our
businesses have the potential to be market leaders and create value for shareholders.
This approach led us to divest human health products and business areas that amounted to nearly $1 billion in annual
revenue. That focus also led to the recently completed sale of our $2 billion revenue Consumer Care business to Bayer.
We then employed the proceeds of that sale to complete the acquisition of Idenix and to increase our return of cash to
shareholders this year.
The same approach led us to a different conclusion with regard to our Animal Health business, which we believe will
continue to generate long-term value for Merck. Animal Health saw strong growth this quarter across all species. We
look forward to additional innovation coming out of our Animal Health pipeline and remain committed to growing this
business, which is already a market leader in key segments of the global animal health market.
Let me now turn to the progress we've made in sharpening the focus of our R&D organization. Along with the strong
progress we've made on our KEYTRUDA program, we continue to advance our work to develop a highly effective,
once-daily oral pan-genotypic regimen for the treatment of hepatitis C. As I mentioned earlier, we also completed the
acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals and it's promising portfolio of hepatitis C candidates, which complement our
internal development efforts.
We will continue to focus on our highest potential growth opportunities while rigorously prioritizing our pipeline,
bolstering it with external assets while divesting our out-licensing programs and candidates that are better suited to
create value elsewhere. For example, this quarter, we entered into an agreement to out-license MK-3222, our
investigational treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis, to Sun Pharma. All of these actions are in keeping with our
intention to be the premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company.
Lastly, we've made significant progress in redesigning our operating model and reducing our cost base. You'll recall
that last October we targeted a net reduction in annual operating expenses of approximately $2.5 billion off our
full-year 2012 expense levels by the end of 2015. As a result of disciplined cost management, I'm pleased that we
remain on track to achieve our target for 2014 and our overall savings goal by the end of 2015.
These savings have enabled us to better target resources to key priorities across the enterprise and to accomplish the
goals I've mentioned today. At the same time, this discipline allows us to return a high level of cash to shareholders
through both the dividend and our stock repurchase program. Over the past 12 months, we've returned nearly $11.5
billion to our shareholders.
We're rebuilding Merck for sustainable future growth. We've sharpened our commercial focus and are launching
products with the potential to make a significant difference to patients while providing value to payers, providers and
healthcare systems. We've focused and prioritized our R&D effort so that we may continue to translate cutting-edge
science in the medicines and vaccines that have meaningful, differentiated attributes.
And we've continued to aggressively manage our cost to ensure that our resources are focused on our most promising
opportunities for growth. Taken together, these actions have created near and longer term opportunities that will allow
Merck to continue to drive value for both shareholders and society.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Adam Schechter.

Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll provide you with an overview of Global Human
Health third quarter results and also provide some commentary on the early days of the KEYTRUDA launch. My
commentary will be on a constant-currency basis.
Overall, sales reached $9.1 billion, reflecting the following: growth in core areas such as diabetes immunology and
acute care, which were offset by more than $150 million in product divestitures, hepatitis C market dynamics and
patent expiries.
First, I'll review core product areas and then I'll provide an update on our regional performance; and I'll start with
primary care. The JANUVIA franchise reached more than $1.4 billion in sales and grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting
growth in the U.S. and in international markets. In the U.S., sales grew 6% on continued volume increases. We are
encouraged by the growth trends we saw in the third quarter and the month of October. We're seeing positive results
from our efforts to defend our 75% market share and to grow the DPP-4 class.
In our international market, sales grew 4%, driven by Europe and the emerging markets. Sales declined in Japan due to
the 10% repricing that occurred in April and the overall competitive environment for DPP-4s. We are confident that we
will deliver global sales growth for JANUVIA franchise in 2014.
Next, in hospital and specialty care. Sales of ISENTRESS were approximately $410 million in the third quarter, a
decline of 3%. Internationally, our growth in Europe was balanced by the timing of tenders in the emerging markets. In
the U.S., ISENTRESS sales were impacted by customer buying patterns and the competitive dynamics in the HIV
market.
Sales of our immunology products reached more than $770 million in the third quarter, growing 9%. We're seeing
continued strong uptake of SIMPONI across multiple indications; and SIMPONI remains the fastest-growing anti-TNF
in markets where we promote. REMICADE grew 3%, reflecting growth in core markets; and offset by biosimilar
competition in some of the smaller EU markets.
In acute care, sales exceeded $600 million and grew by 17% this quarter. Growth was driven by continued uptake of
BRIDION in Japan, Europe and emerging markets; and solid performances across our portfolio of antibiotics and
antifungals. While growth rates may vary from quarter to quarter due to timing of tenders, we continue to expect this
core area to be an important contributor to future growth.
Now turning to our vaccine business. In the third quarter, vaccine sales were approximately $1.7 billion, a decline of
6%, primarily due to roughly $100 million of U.S. public sector purchases of GARDASIL and RotaTeq in the third
quarter of last year that did not occur in the third quarter of this year.
Sales of ZOSTAVAX were approximately $180 million in the quarter, declining 2% compared to last year. As we enter
the flu season, in the United States, we've initiated promotional efforts including a new direct-to-consumer campaign to
educate consumers of the importance of talking to their physicians and their pharmacists about shingles. We have broad
access for ZOSTAVAX, and we're working with customers to help them understand the reimbursement process.
Now turning to some geographic highlights in the third quarter. In the United States, sales declined 8% as growth in the
JANUVIA franchise and DULERA was offset by lower vaccine sales, the loss of exclusivity of TEMODAR and
declines in our HCV portfolio. In Europe, sales fell 1%. We drove continued growth in diabetes, immunology and
ISENTRESS, but sales were impacted by divestiture of our ophthalmology products, continued declines in the HCV
portfolio, and the generic erosion for NASONEX. Sales in Japan declined 14%, primarily due to biannual price
decreases and ophthalmology product divestitures.
Sales in the emerging markets grew 8%. China grew 33%, in part due to timing of purchases. Demand in China
remains strong for a broad portfolio of innovative and also established products. Other important emerging markets
such as Turkey and Mexico also delivered solid growth in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect that the
emerging markets will be good growth drivers.

Now I'll spend a few moments speaking about the early days of the KEYTRUDA launch. First, let me say we are very
excited to launch the first and only anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the United States. We are still in the early days of
launch, but we have been moving rapidly to ensure the medicine is available to patients; and feedback from our
customers is very encouraging.
Upon approval, we said KEYTRUDA would be available within a week and we were taking orders and shipping in just
a couple of days. Our colleagues in manufacturing work tirelessly to ensure that patients would have access to this
important medication as soon as possible.
On the commercial side, we reached the top ipilimumab prescribers in a matter of days from approval. We've now
expanded our reach into community practitioners. We have reached more than 75% of the key physicians and we have
made multiple calls into many of the high-volume prescribers.
Regarding access, most payers are covering the cost of KEYTRUDA for its current indication without restrictions.
Additionally, we offer patient assistance for patients requiring reimbursement assistance. As we said, at approval, we
believe there are about 1,200 patients in the U.S. who are eligible for KEYTRUDA based upon our current label.
Additionally, we expect a few hundred new patients to become eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA each month.
Since approval in early September, we believe that approximately 900 patients are being treated with KEYTRUDA.
Many of these patients were previously part of the Expanded Access Program and are now in a process of moving from
the EAP to commercial product.
Our global oncology business unit is passionately engaged on maximizing the potential for KEYTRUDA for
appropriate patients. We are looking forward to sharing more launch details with you on the fourth quarter earnings
call.
In summary, Global Human Health is transitioning through a period of patent expiries and divestitures. Since late last
year, we've consciously redirected our focus to core product areas to core markets and to new product launches. We
drove growth in many of these core areas and we're successfully introducing KEYTRUDA to the U.S. market for
patients suffering from advanced melanoma. We continue to prioritize our investments, and we are intent on driving
future growth and broadening our impact in global health.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Rob Davis.
Robert M. Davis
Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. We've had solid results in the first nine months of the year. Our third quarter
results demonstrate that we continue to sharpen our focus as a company; and, as Ken mentioned, our cost reduction
program is on track. This morning, I'll provide additional color on our P&L and comment on our outlook for the rest of
the year. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials.
Total company revenues were $10.6 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 4% year-over-year with a 1% benefit from
foreign exchange. This decrease reflects in part the loss of more than $400 million of sales in the prior year from
divestitures and the now ended joint venture with AstraZeneca.
As Adam stated, our sales in the Pharmaceutical business were driven by solid performance in our key brands, which
have benefited from continued resource allocation to our priority therapeutic areas like diabetes and acute care.
Animal Health revenues increased $83 million or 10% year-over-year, excluding exchange. These results were driven
by strong performance across the portfolio, including significant growth in our companion animal and poultry
businesses.
Consumer Care revenues decreased 9%, excluding exchange. As a reminder, this is the last quarter in which we will
record set of results from the Consumer Care business since the transaction with Bayer closed on October 1.

Moving now to expenses, gross margin was 74.3% in the quarter, which represents a 30 basis point increase
year-over-year. We continue to expect the 2014 full year gross margin to be slightly lower than 2013's full year ratio of
74.3%.
Marketing and administrative expenses were $148 million lower than the prior year, driven by reductions in direct
selling and promotion costs. We continue to focus our resources on key markets and core products, while ensuring we
appropriately invest in our product portfolio launches. And in support of these efforts, we expect M&A expenses to be
sequentially higher in the fourth quarter.
Research and development expenses were $1.5 billion in the quarter; $109 million lower than prior year. We expect
R&D expense in the fourth quarter to be higher year-over-year as we invest in our portfolio.
Finally, regarding the tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.5% in the quarter, which was in line with our
expectations. We continue to anticipate the tax rate for the full year to be between 24% and 26%.
In terms of our bottom line performance, we earned $0.90 per share in the third quarter as compared to $0.92 per share
in the prior year.
Now our outlook for the rest of the year. On the top line, we are narrowing our revenue guidance to $42.4 billion to
$42.8 billion at current exchange rates. This takes into account recent currency movements, as well as a public sector
vaccine purchase in the third quarter of last year that did not occur this year, which Adam described earlier.
We're also narrowing our non-GAAP EPS range, raising the bottom end of the range to $3.46 and lowering the upper
end to $3.50, while maintaining the same midpoint. Our EPS range reflects our strong performance in the first nine
months of the year and includes the absorption of roughly $0.06 to $0.09 of dilution from the Consumer Care
divestiture and the Idenix acquisition.
On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $4.06 and $4.29 in 2014. Both M&A and R&D expense in 2014 are
expected to be lower than 2013. And as I said earlier, we remain on track to achieve our target of a $2.5 billion
reduction in expenses off of the 2012 base by the end of 2015.
Now touching briefly on capital allocation. By the end of the year, we will have deployed the balance of the after-tax
proceeds from the Bayer transaction net of cash used for the Idenix acquisition for share repurchase. We continue to
project our average diluted shares outstanding will be slightly lower than 2.95 billion shares for 2014. We remain
focused on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. And, as Ken said, we've returned over $11 billion to
shareholders over the past 12 months in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
As we look at capital markets more broadly, we recently took advantage of favorable market conditions and
restructured some of our debt through a tender offer and a €2.5 billion debt offering. We're pleased with the results of
the transactions, which created economic value for the company and will benefit annual interest expense in 2015 and
beyond.
In summary, the third quarter was another solid quarter for Merck. Since our announcement at this time last year, we've
refocused our business and divested non-core assets with 2013 full year sales of approximately $3 billion.
In addition, we continue to trim our expense base, putting us solidly on track to achieve our expense reductions by the
end of 2015 while also investing in our promising new product launches and pipeline.
Now I'll turn the call to Roger.
Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Rob. The third quarter was an especially busy one for our Regulatory Affairs group with multiple product
approvals in several important areas. In August, our novel first-in-class orexin receptor antagonist, BELSOMRA, was
approved by the U.S. FDA. BELSOMRA acts to improve sleep initiation and sleep maintenance in patients suffering

from insomnia. As Ken mentioned, the BELSOMRA launch will begin early next year.
In September, we gained approval of BELSOMRA in Japan where we also gained approval of vaniprevir, a potent,
highly selective protease inhibitor for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection.
Also in September, we received approval for KEYTRUDA, our monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1 for the
treatment of patients with advanced malignant melanoma refractory to currently available therapies. As I've previously
mentioned, our development program for KEYTRUDA has expanded to include more than two dozen studies around
the world, involving more than 6,000 patients and addressing more than 30 different tumor types.
At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings earlier this month, we presented data documenting the activity
of KEYTRUDA in patients with gastric, bladder, and head and neck cancers; and also presented more comprehensive
data describing the activity of KEYTRUDA in patients suffering from malignant melanoma or non-small cell lung
cancer.
Today, we announced that the U.S. FDA has granted Breakthrough designation to KEYTRUDA for the treatment of
non-small cell lung cancer in patients who have failed the platinum-based therapies and whose tumors do not bear EGF
receptor or ALK gene mutations. We're working closely with the FDA to define an optimal dataset that would permit
registration of KEYTRUDA for this important indication.
Later in the year, we expect to have a chance to describe our studies of KEYTRUDA in patients with the so-called the
triple-negative breast cancer at the San Antonio Breast Cancer conference; and in some hematologic malignancies at
the American Society of Hematology meeting.
Combination studies employing KEYTRUDA for the treatment of a variety of devastating malignancies are also
underway. These studies employing conventional therapeutic modalities, as well as novel targeted agents will benefit
enormously from the broad understanding of KEYTRUDA monotherapy that we are developing.
Turning now to infectious diseases. We are looking forward to the upcoming American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases meeting next month. During the meeting, we plan to present complete data from Phase II studies of our
MK-5172/8742 doublet. I will remind you that the FDA has granted Breakthrough designation to these agents for the
treatment of hepatitis C virus infection and deemed the Phase III registration program for MK-5172/8742 is now
completely enrolled; and we expect to see data from these studies in the first half of 2015.
At AASLD, we will also present early data from the C-SWIFT study, which pairs the MK-5172/8742 doublet with the
nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir. The goal of these studies, which we announced five months ago at our
business review, is to advance the case for an all-oral ribavirin-free genotype independent regimen that can be used in
patients irrespective of comorbidities; for example, in patients with established cirrhosis, simultaneous infection with
human immunodeficiency virus and/or renal insufficiency. And that will achieve sustained virologic responses over a
shorter course of therapy. Because of the difficulties in ensuring patient adherence in the real world, shorter course
therapy is clearly desirable.
Our triple therapy regimens have been enabled by our recently completed acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals
through which we gained access to a potent nucleoside polymerase inhibitor that we now call MK-3682. Data
describing the effectiveness of MK-3682 monotherapy will also be presented at the AASLD meeting.
Beyond HCV, we continue to make very good progress, enrolling other Phase III infectious disease therapeutics
programs including once-daily ISENTRESS and letermovir, a treatment for patients at risk from disseminated
cytomegalovirus infection.
During November, we also expect to present the results of IMPROVE-IT, our study testing whether a
cholesterol-lowering regimen of ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin alone improves outcomes in patients at
high risk for major cardiovascular events. The first patient was enrolled in this trial exactly nine years ago. With design
and protocol review, it has been a decade since the question that the trial addresses was first posed.

In all, IMPROVE-IT enrolled 18,145 patients presenting with stabilized acute coronary syndromes. There have been
more than 5,000 composite events that will soon be reviewed. The MRL clinical team and I, along with the rest of the
Merck management remain blinded to the data; and our statisticians have only a very short period to conduct analyses
before the presentation in mid-November.
My number one consideration regarding this study has been to ensure that we work closely with our academic
colleagues to obtain a complete and robust dataset generated during that decade that it has taken to conduct
IMPROVE-IT. Given the size and complexity of this study, I expect that the IMPROVE-IT data will provide important
insights into the appropriate care of patients at high risk for major coronary adverse events.
Returning briefly to regulatory affairs. We've now submitted our complete response to FDA questions regarding
sugammadex, our parenteral agent for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia. Included in this
response, a new study is designed to examine hypersensitivity reactions that can occur with sugammadex
administration, as well as an updated review of our Pharmacovigilance experience with sugammadex, which is
marketed in more than 50 countries as BRIDION.
Separately, we've had a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss our odanacatib results. We have agreed together
upon a plan to characterize more completely the adjudicated adverse event reporting in this study, which will mean that
our filing will be delayed until 2015. The data that we presented at the ASBMR meeting in September demonstrate that
odanacatib could provide a meaningful therapeutic option to reduce the frequency of osteoporotic fractures in women at
high risk for these events.
Finally, as Ken mentioned, we continue to work closely with the FDA on the review of V503, our 9 valent human
papillomavirus vaccine for the reduction of cervical malignancy. We expect that the FDA will complete its review
before the end of the year. Joe?

Great. Thank you, Roger. And, Jackie, I think we're getting ready to start the Q&A segment of the call. Just as a
reminder, if you can limit yourself to one or two questions, that way we can get to as many callers as possible. So,
Jackie, I think we'll turn it over to the first caller.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much. Just two questions here. First, with the Breakthrough status in lung
for KEYTRUDA, can you just update us on anything about your filing strategy or at least key data points we should be
watching for that could support a filing in lung?
And then second, we're just interested in your thoughts on TECOS and risk of heart failure with JANUVIA. There's
obviously been a lot of discussion around this point as of late, and would like to just get Merck's perspective on the
risks associated with that study? Thanks very much.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. Chris, just with respect to the filing strategy, I think we certainly are pleased to
have gained Breakthrough designation for a non-small cell lung cancer. As you know, we have a number of studies
underway, large studies, and we have the opportunity to look at those studies; and we're working closely with the
agency to develop an ideal registration strategy, as I indicated.

So we won't have any more to say about that than what I've said to this point. With respect to TECOS, you know, I
think that we do expect that the final patient data will be available, last patient, last visit, by the end of the year. This is
of course a study that's being conducted, led by academic institutions. So we'll be made aware of those data.
I think it's important to recognize that a data safety and monitoring board has been following this study extremely
carefully. Thus the observations that have been made in other studies employing regimens to treat diabetes are well
known to the data safety monitoring board. The last data safety monitoring board review was in December of last year.
Given that, the fact that the DSMB came back and said the study should be continued without change, I think, provides
some reassurance with respect to the overall conduct of the study. It's a large study and provides important answers to
questions about the meaningfulness of intervention with sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Great. Thank you, Roger. And, Jackie, next caller?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks for the question. So a couple of quick questions for Roger. Roger, can you talk
to us a little bit about – I don't see PD-L1 status highlighted for the Breakthrough designation for KEYTRUDA, but my
understanding is that much of the data that was generated in small-cell lung cancer was in the PD-L1 positive patient
population. Can you just clarify for us if this indication is specific to the PD-L1 patient population or if it isn't, and it is
actually for the broader patient population?
And then as we think about the next sort of data points in the KEYNOTE-010 study, can you just update us on whether
or not you've officially taken the look at the response rates which is sort specified on clinicaltrials.gov relative to the 2
milligram and 10 milligram dose? And if that look included a comparison to TAXOTERE? The reason I ask is if that
could be utilized as supported evidence for a potential filing? Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Thanks, Seamus. First of all, the Breakthrough designation is not specific to PD-L1
positive patients. And as you know, we have done quite a lot of work on trying to understand the meaningfulness of
PD-L1 positivity. What we've shown in a whole variety of settings is that patients whose tumors are judged PD-L1
negative or more precisely that fall into the PD-L1 staining less than 1% category, nevertheless, do demonstrate some
responses. And we and other groups that are studying this are still in the midst of trying to understand exactly how to
correlate a PD-L1 expression status with outcomes. We know there's a relationship, but exactly what the
meaningfulness of that is I think remains to be elucidated.
With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, as I've indicated, we have a variety of different ways that we can look at
these data in order to come up with an optimal registration strategy; and that's something that through the close
interaction that we have with the FDA and will have more particularly because of the Breakthrough designation that
we're going to be doing in order to come up with the best possible strategy.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Thank you, Seamus. And, Jackie, next caller?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot – excuse me – thank you for taken the question. Maybe just a
follow-up on Seamus. The KEYNOTE-010 trial, Roger, what is the timeline for a data readout on that? Can you update
us? I believe last time you spoke about it, you had talked about late 2015. Could you just remind me if that's correct or
incorrect data?
And on hepatitis C, if I may, Roger, last call you expressed a great what I interpreted to be a great period of optimism
for the four-week regimen. Obviously the bar is very, very high given the Gilead data that's out there. I'm wondering if

you could update us on your expectations for the four-week data. And I know this is the third, but this is just a yes or
no. Just to be clear the Breakthrough designation was for, if I'm reading the press release right, is actually for second
line and later lung, is that correct?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Mark, so first of all, the Breakthrough designation doesn't specify line of therapy, the
Breakthrough designation is for patients who have failed platinum-based therapies. And that's understandable of course
because you get Breakthrough designation for those circumstances under which there's the anticipation of a meaningful
intervention beyond what exists as standard of care. So that's understandable I think.
With respect to the KEYNOTE-010 study, again I think the timing remains as before. We continue to march forward
with that study. We, as I said, have opportunities to examine that data at different times. And one of the things that
we'll be doing is discussing that with the agency, but we do expect to have data available by the end of next year for
sure.
And then with respect to hep C, I think the important thing to remember here is that what we proposed when we
described the study back in May was that a triplet regimen would provide the opportunity to test whether it was
possible to get sustained virologic responses; that is, eradication with very short regimens. We don't know what the
nature of those regimens would be, and so we've tried to book-end those for genotype 1 and genotype 3 in the
C-SWIFT study.
We have access now of course to MK-3682, our own nucleoside polymerase inhibitor. And the things that we learn
from our studies with sofosbuvir can then be applied to our triplet studies with MK-3682, recognizing of course that no
two polymerase inhibitors will behave in exactly the same way, but it basically provides the kind of guidance that we
need in order to design effective Phase III studies. So we're looking forward to having the opportunity to review those
data in detail.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Mark. And, Jackie, next caller?

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Roger, just a follow-up on those comments.
Could you please remind us what the similarities and differences are from what you can tell from your [ph] nuc (37:24)
versus Sovaldi? And, Adam, could you please give us a little bit more on the GARDASIL performance and your
outlook. It seemed to have been a little bit lower than expectations? Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So, Alex, you'll have the opportunity to see Phase Ib data for MK-3682 at AASLD,
which will be interesting. But of course it's very difficult to compare two different agents when they're not studied in a
head-to-head context, because of differences in patient population. I can't really speculate about that. We'll have the
opportunity to look at those kinds of data sometime later, but right now I think the important thing will be to look at the
Phase Ib data, which I think you'll find intriguing.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And, Alex, regarding GARDASIL, let me provide some additional context. So sales in
total were $590 million for the quarter. The U.S. declined 7%. The U.S. declines were mostly due to higher public
sector purchases in 2013 that did not occur in 2014. If you look at the cumulative 15-year to 18-year-old penetration
rates in the U.S., it's about 65% for females and about 50% for males. So there's still room to grow there.
If you look at males, we continue to have good uptake. And if you look at the private sector data, it suggests that about
50% to 55% of first doses are now being administered to males. If you look outside the U.S., the declines were due to
Korea and also there is the end of the catch-up cohorts in several of the smaller markets. But, overall, we continue to be
pleased with our market share, greater than 90% in a global basis and 99% in the U.S.; and we believe that there's still
room for additional growth in the future.

Our next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question, just for Ken. I think you traditionally go through
your planning process this time of year. I know you can't give or you're not ready to – prepared to give guidance for
2015, but if you can just help us understand what some of the pushes and pulls are, especially since 2015 you've
indicated as a return to growth year going into that year? So that would be very helpful.
And then for Roger, if you can just characterize why it's so difficult to potentially to get to four weeks of therapy in the
HCV population, either four weeks or eight weeks going forward that would be real helpful? Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks, John, for the questions. So let me start by saying of course we're not giving 2015
guidance today. We'll do that on our fourth quarter call. But you're correct. We still expect to go off our 2014 base, and
there are number of factors that are going on outside right now. For example, there has been a change in currency rates
which will have an impact on 2015.
But also, on an operational standpoint, we are looking forward to several launches. We're looking forward to the
continued development of several key programs in our pipeline. So from an operational standpoint, we're pleased with
the progress that's being made in our pipeline and with the upcoming launches. And obviously they'll have to be looked
at in the context of the overall headwinds that I think everyone is experiencing from things like currency.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. John, the duration of treatment in infectious disease is always a difficult process to
assess. I think first of all there are aspects of molecular cell biology to consider that you have hepatocytes that are
infected with HCV. They differ almost certainly one cell from another in terms of replication rate. And those that are
replicating more slowly, it can be difficult to inhibit that process and there will be variability in terms of the
degradation of the viral nucleic acid. So there's a lot of heterogeneity in the liver itself. And then there is also variation
in terms of the exposure to drug in individual liver cells. And beyond those sort of molecular cellular considerations,
there's also the clinical context.
So we all recognize that despite the fact that we've more or less understood the nature of, for example just to pick one,
the nature of osteomyelitis, bacterial infection in bone, the length of treatment in the clinical setting is different in
different parts of the world and different regions. We really don't have an established length of treatment that we can
justify with good clinical data. And one can expect that it will be easier in HCV because we can measure viral burden
much more readily, but still the clinical context will change depending upon, for example, the degree of liver disease.
So you can imagine where there's a lot of fibrosis and it's difficult to get drug penetration that, that would make things
more challenging, all of which means that it may be hard to get to a single short course recommendation for all
patients. But, instead, patients will have to be stratified and maybe the stratification can be determined before treatment
begins, but most likely it will be in response to therapy. These are things that we have to learn now that we have these
potent direct acting antivirals and our C-SWIFT studies I think will provide important data on this.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Okay. Thanks, John, and next caller?

<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you very much. Just a few questions. Roger, do you expect to receive priority review for
your doublet hep C therapy? I know you mentioned you've completed enrollment. Those trials should be completed by
the end of sort of I guess middle or next year. Should we anticipate priority review and timing of approval?
Second question on KEYTRUDA for lung, when is the earliest we can expect to see randomized data showing overall
survival for KEYTRUDA? And then thirdly a question for you, Ken, we had read I guess rumors in the press about
Merck considering selling its diversified product line or its legacy business. Can you give us an update in terms of how
you're thinking about that? There have been a couple of trades, as you know, of those businesses. I'm just wondering
how should we think about that for Merck? Thanks very much.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Can you take it, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Jami, thanks. The first question, of course we do have Breakthrough designation for the
doublet and that doesn't, by any means, stipulate that the priority review would occur. I think it will be driven in large
part by the strength of the data and the assessment of meaningfulness. So we'll get to that point when we have a chance
to evaluate all the Phase III data and get it submitted.
With respect to the randomized overall survival, again we do have data coming from the KEYNOTE-010 study. There
are other possible approaches to this, but certainly one would expect towards the end of next year, if we'd have an early
look at that. Again, a lot depends of course on the survival statistics for the population, but we'll have data around that
time, Jami.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. Thanks, Jami, for the question, and let me start with a broader focus on it and that is
that we continue to prioritize and focus within our business and as we communicated last October, that's required us to
look across the entire business to determine which assets might have more value outside Merck versus inside the
company. As part of that you've seen us take action and divest assets with approximately $3 billion of 2013 sales
including MCC and certain GHH products. We will continue to evaluate opportunities as appropriate.
But specifically with respect to the diversified brands we will also be considerate of the fact that a lot of these more
mature assets also provide strong cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest behind the meaningful innovation
that's at the heart of our strategy. So we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward, but we've got to
balance the cash flow concerns, as well as what we can do to monetize assets where appropriate.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Jackie, next caller?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. I'd love to get your thoughts on the KEYNOTE-006 trial, pretty important
in that it compares your PD-1 head-to-head versus it being first-line melanoma. And I'm wondering if you can update
us on the timing of readout and just more generally your views of CTLA-4 antagonist and specifically your views of
those products from a risk-benefit standpoint as part of combination therapy with PD-1s in two settings, melanoma and
lung. And then just a quick question on TECOS? Is it possible you will top line those results by late 2014 and more
generally how you handle data disclosure when you do have those results?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Okay. Tim, for KEYNOTE-006, yes, we do expect the data moving along and we will
have comparative data versus sifalimumab, and there's nothing particularly to update with respect to KEYNOTE-006.
So what you see on clinicaltrials.gov is a fair reflection of what we have, and we are expecting to have data next year.
You asked a more general question of how we view PD-1 antagonism versus CTLA-4, ipilimumab in particular, and
there's been a lot of discussion of this. As you know very well, there has not been an opportunity for us to compare
KEYTRUDA vis-à-vis ipilimumab directly to this point although ultimately we will have those kinds of data. I think
what we've seen from the registration materials for these drugs is that at the current exposure levels, there is a
substantial amount of systemic toxicity that is seen with CTLA-4 antagonists. But time will really tell how that plays

out, particularly as there are dose adjustments and different approaches to combination therapy.
So I don't think we can say that that's going to turn out to be an impossibility. I think that the important thing in order to
design combinations correctly, speaking not just for ipilimumab or CTLA-4, but speaking for the totality of
combinations, is we have to have a firm understanding of how these molecules behave as monotherapy. And we have a
very large monotherapy program for KEYTRUDA, which involves more than 6,000 patients as I've noted.
In addition, we have 17 combination studies currently underway which explore KEYTRUDA in a variety of other
settings used with other drugs. So we'll have the opportunity with this firm foundation of monotherapy results to
understand the meaningfulness of combination therapies, including combinations with the CTLA-4 antagonist like
ipilimumab.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: And then on TECOS, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yes. TECOS. So the TECOS data, as I've indicated, we should have last patient, last visit
– I remind you this is a study that is coordinated by an academic group. They are managing the study, but we should
have last patient, last visit by the end of this year we hope; and the data will be presented in 2015. That's all we know
about it. I've mentioned before the data safety and monitoring committee that is overseeing the study as well, but we
don't know anything more than that.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Great. Okay. Thank you, Tim. And, Jackie, next caller?

Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Ken, obviously the restructuring program takes your expenses down pretty significantly by the
end of next year. I'm just curious from there, are we now reset and as we start to see this top line from the new launches
kick in, will we get the operating leverage that we would expect to see given that hepatitis C, oncology, these
businesses that are not primary care will kind of drive the top line?
And curious how much investment you need to make in those areas that would offset and that we wouldn't see that
operating leverage. And then, Adam, if you just could talk about the emerging markets just a little bit more. Obviously,
China was really strong. What type of one-timer was there or was this kind of a catch-up for the year? And maybe you
could talk about just some of the key drivers of what's going on in the emerging markets? Thanks.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Adam, why don't you start with the emerging markets?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yes. So if you look at the emerging markets, I've always said that growth can vary from
quarter to quarter and timing of tenders becomes very significant in the emerging markets. China, as you mentioned,
had strong growth of 33%. A lot of that was in the acute care products of which timing played a part in; and also, the
diversified brands continued to show good growth, which was not related to timing. I also mentioned that in Turkey
and Mexico we had very good quarter as well, and that was driven by specialty products, but also cardiovascular
products.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: And on the overall issues with respect to our cost structure and how we're approaching it,
we've been pretty aggressive in the first nine months to reduce cost and change our operating model; and we're on track
for the overall $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2015. And so we think that actually positions us well as we move into the
future. Beyond that, I can't say much because we're not providing guidance in today's call.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Thank you, Mark. And, Jackie, next caller?

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Yeah. Good morning. Regarding anacetrapib, a question for Roger, would a positive protocol
analysis for IMPROVE-IT at AHA make you any more confident about the anacetrapib trial given the debate about its
proposed LDL mediated mechanism of action and I know you're aware there are two presentations scheduled?
Second, just following up on the KEYNOTE-010 trial. Should I be thinking about an earlier interim analysis for your
trial compared to Bristol's equivalent, given you are selecting PD-L1 patients. And it's obviously much larger and
therefore where would they put the interim just on your modeling? And then just an adjunct to that, do you still remain
convinced that looking at PD-L1 expression on tumors rather than on the different cohorts of white blood cells is the
right way to go to optimally select patients?
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. Andrew, three questions. First of all, for anacetrapib, of course we don't – as I've
indicated, we have no idea what the results of IMPROVE-IT are going to be. IMPROVE-IT tests the question as you
know of whether or not one can by aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol levels in patients who already are optimally
managed with simvastatin, one can achieve a beneficial effects on cardiovascular events and the magnitude of that
effect.
Our studies with anacetrabib are different and because we have an anacetrabib, both the significant LDL
cholesterol-lowering effect, but also the HDL elevating effect, I'm not sure that I could read out much of anything from
IMPROVE-IT to anacetrabib. I think anacetrabib is testing really quite a different question, and we'll just have to wait
for the results of the REVEAL study.
With respect to the KEYNOTE timing, I can't speculate about how Bristol-Myers is pursuing their analyses versus our
own. I've indicated when we expect our data to become available and we're going to examine those and make decisions
based on that.
And with respect to PD-L1, we've presented really quite a lot of data using our proprietary PD-L1 antibody to look at
expression in tumors. And what we've shown is that there is substantial association between PD-L1 expression in
tumors, which is judged at different cut points, and responses to KEYTRUDA. And we've shown that in a number of
different tumors, and most recently we showed it in our presentations at ESMO.
The important thing to recognize, as I say, is that doesn't mean that there are no responses in those who are PD-L1
negative. It's simply an association. It is an association that is biologically plausible, but we don't by any means feel
that we are able to inventory all of the PD-L1 that's expressed in and around those cells that might be responsible for
tumor killing. And so no matter what, we only get a partial picture of it. My feeling is that PD-L1 assessment in the
tumor is much more likely to be revealing than PD-L1 assessment on circulating white blood cells, as an example. And
certainly that's our experience.

Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Good morning, and thanks for taken the questions. Sorry if I missed this, but on hep C, how
important do you view hitting four weeks from a commercial standpoint? It feels like physician feedback has not
indicated high level of importance as perhaps we'd expect. And then just a second one on the IMPROVE-IT study, if
the trial does not meet the primary end point, how do you think about the level of investment in the franchise going
forward? Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So this is Adam, Colin. With regard to hep C, this is a very large market. In the U.S. alone
there's about 3.2 million people with chronic HCV, of which only about 50% are diagnosed and only about 150,000,

200,000 are cured. So the market is very large. I believe that four weeks would be helpful. But as long as in the
competitive dynamics there is equality in terms of the regimens, I think that you can be successful commercially under
either circumstance.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: And then IMPROVE-IT?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yes. So at this point, we're not commenting specifically on IMPROVE-IT. We continue to
believe in the LDL cholesterol hypothesis. And of course we prepare for all scenarios, but there's nothing specific to
add at this moment.

Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. I have two. Adam, you mentioned that roughly 900 patients are being treated with
KEYTRUDA. Was curious if you're seeing orders and shipments that are pretty consistent with that? Is that a pretty
tight relationship between individual patient to managed shipments, or is the system kind of gearing up for broader
usage even though you can't talk about broader usage from Merck's standpoint?
And, Roger, how confident are you in the scientific community, if you can speak for the community, in the
reproducibility of a particular patient's PD-L1 status? It sounds like investors kind of want things in neat boxes. I'm not
so sure it's actually going to play out that way, but curious on your thoughts there on the testing and the status and
whether that could flux within patients? Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Hi, Gregg. It's Adam. First of all, as I said before, we're pleased with the uptake in
customer feedback that we have early in the launch, but we are still very early in the launch. We're taking orders for
KEYTRUDA since the first day of availability. Nearly all of the top 50 accounts have purchased since we launched the
product, and a majority have made repeat purchases. And at this point in time, we believe we have about 900 patients
that are being treated with the product.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. And, Gregg, you're absolutely right with respect to PD-L1 status, in that the
PD-L1 gene itself is responsive to a variety of different stimuli, including cytokine. So the inflammatory milieu could
easily influence how much PD-L1 is expressed, and that could be different from one, for example, site of metastasis to
another. So there could be quite a bit of variability.
That variability may underlie the challenges that people have experienced in trying to dissect the relationship between
PD-L1 expression and responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. Nevertheless, the fact is there is such an association. So
summing over everything, there still is a general relationship between PD-L1 expression in tumors and responsiveness.
It's been seen many times.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Gregg. And, Jackie, next caller?

Our next question comes from the line at Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Yeah. Thanks very much. Two brief questions, Roger, we've talked about KEYNOTE-010 and
platinum failures. The question is what's the difference between KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042 in the Phase III
setting, at least in first-line advanced non-small cell lung?

And the second question, Adam, the top 50 accounts having ordered KEYTRUDA, can you provide any additional
color on the percentage of patients who were already on therapy in the Access Program and have moved on to, if you
will, as a paying customer and those that are actually new to therapy? Thank you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Adam, do you want to take the first question?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah. So right now, as we said, we believe there is about 900 patients that are being
treated with the product. Many of those, many of those we believe are coming from the EAP program. And if you look
at the top 50 accounts, it's not easy to tell where the purchases go, to which patients exactly, so you can't comment on
that. But I think the bottom line is we're on track for all in 60 days to move from the EAP program into the commercial
area. So we're working hard on that and we're on track for that.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay, Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. I mean if you look at KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042 I mean you will see –
we're talking about similar kinds of studies, but they differ in size and they differ in primary outcomes. And that's kind
of understandable and not atypical for registration strategies in these sorts of settings.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Great. Jackie, and next caller?

Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple of questions. First, with respect to your hep C
program, could you talk about your development vision for the Idenix nuc, including the timing for Phase III?
And then second, I have a little bit of a lengthy question on KEYTRUDA, and this relates to the KEYNOTE-006 trial.
So the approved dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 milligrams per kilogram every three weeks and it costs $150,000 a year. But
in KEYNOTE-006 the KEYTRUDA dosing is 10 milligrams per kilogram every two or three weeks, which would cost
$1.15 million or $750,000 a year respectively.
So since KEYNOTE-006 is supposed to read out early next year, and assuming that it shows that KEYTRUDA is
superior to Yervoy in first-line melanoma, it should get compendia listed at 10 milligrams per kilogram, but how
should we think about actual use in the real world? And how should we think about pricings for that compound? Thank
you.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah. So I guess the question is first of all with respect to MK-3682 and the timing, I
should note that for MK-3682, and again Phase 1b data will be at AASLD, we do have an IND now in the United
States for that molecule and Phase II studies will begin shortly. And thereafter based on the results of that, we'll begin
to decide how best to conduct registration strategies. So that's more or less how we're thinking about it. It's fairly
conventional.
And then with respect to KEYNOTE-006, well, as you know, we began our studies of pembrolizumab in a variety of
different doses, at 2 milligrams Q3, at 10 milligrams Q2, at 10 milligrams Q3, and what we've learned in the course of
those studies is that the dose response curve is relatively flat and 2 milligrams Q3 was selected as the dose to go
forward in melanoma. And we're also working on a fixed dose at 200 milligrams Q3, which will give the equivalent
exposure, of 2 milligrams Q3, for most patients and doesn't require the weight calculation.
My expectation is that because we'll have a large amount of data from all of these different settings, we'll be able to
make the appropriate analysis. I can't speak of course to how compendia will look at this and any other aspect of the
commercialization process.

<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And, Dave, what I would say is, we've been very active to ensure that patients that are in
need of KEYTRUDA have access to it. And claims are being paid for KEYTRUDA consistent with the indication
without restrictions, and we've got our clinical presentations with all of our top 30 targeted health plans, either occurred
or are going to occur. So as we look at the future, of course we continue to work to maintain access as appropriate.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: All right. Thank you, Dave. And, Jackie, I think we have time for just two more callers.

Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, a couple here. One on JANUVIA and JANUMET. From
what we understand, I think that product, starting in 2015, is not going to be available to people with United Healthcare
commercial plans. Can you just confirm if that is indeed the case or there's been a change there? And while I assume
losing one plan is not likely that material to you guys. Are there any other changes to the access of that franchise that
we should be aware of as we start thinking about 2015?
And then the second question, just on the PD-1 side of things, any update you can provide on the status of the lawsuit
that you guys filed against Bristol in Europe, and also the one that Bristol's filed in the U.S. against you guys, once you
get the approval for KEYTRUDA? Thanks.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: So, Adam, do you want to go first?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yes. So let me start. JANUVIA continues to have good access in 2014, and based upon
preliminary reviews in 2015 we expect to continue to have good access. JANUVIA is still on formulary for United Part
D plan in 2015 and continues to have preferred access. The contract with United was signed recently, but since it had
not been signed when United filed their 2015 formulary with CMS, the United Part D website and CMS required notice
to insurees that did not list JANUVIA as on formulary, but I just want to repeat that it still is on formulary for Part D in
2015.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: And, Vamil, thanks for the other question. We're confident with respect to PD-1 and
litigation associated with the patent. We're confident we'll be able to market KEYTRUDA in any country in which it is
approved. Litigation appeals, they're a multi-year process so you won't hear anything from us for a while. If there are
any updates, we'll provide those in the Q.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. And, Jackie, I think we have time for the last caller.

Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered if you can just give us a bit more color on what
the biosimilar situation in Europe looks like, what you're really learning from the early stages of this and what you're
going to take forward as access to biosimilars becomes more prevalent in Europe? Thank you.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah. So if you look at REMICADE and SIMPONI, as I said, we had about $775 million
of sales, about 9% growth. We continue to have growth with REMICADE of about 3%. That was driven by the core
EU markets, driven by gastro indications, but there was some offset due to biosimilar competition in the smaller
markets.
If you look at the biosimilars specifically, there's been relatively limited uptake of either biosimilar product or
acceptance on tenders and formularies. And what we've seen so far is where there has been movement of the
biosimilars, it's been limited to new patients only. However, we have seen increased pricing pressures that are required
in order for us to compete with the biosimilars. So we expect the pressure to continue in the small markets this year,

and then we expect there to be some pricing pressure and new patients in the core EU markets after February 2015 loss
of exclusivity.
<A - Joseph Romanelli>: Okay. Thank you, Adam. And, Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
So just in closing, we reported another solid quarter of company performance. As I've mentioned earlier, we're making
great progress on the strategic initiatives we announced last year. We're now seeing the benefit of investing in our core
therapeutic areas like we've seen in diabetes. We've made significant advancements in some of our most important
research programs, including the launch of KEYTRUDA, and receiving Breakthrough therapeutic designation in
non-small cell lung cancer. And as Roger mentioned this morning, we're making steady progress in hepatitis C as our
registration study for the doublet is now fully enrolled.
We also continue to focus on improving our operating model, and over the past year we've seen our operating expenses
decline significantly. We will remain on track to achieve our $2.5 billion of cost savings. Our prioritization has also led
us to divesting $3 billion in sales through the MCC transaction with Bayer and other divestitures in Human Health.
We've used those proceeds to fund the Idenix acquisition and repurchase shares this year. Over the past 12 months,
we've returned more than $11 billion via the dividend and share repurchase program. So we remain strongly committed
to returning cash to our shareholders.
So, again, thank you for joining us, hanging in with us for a little bit of a lengthy call. And we look forward to updating
you again on our fourth quarter earnings call.
