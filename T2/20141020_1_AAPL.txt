Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.
Since we spoke in July, it's been an exciting and very busy time, so we have lots of great things to talk about today. Just
last month we launched the biggest advancements in iPhone history with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones
are the best we have ever created and customers absolutely love them. Our operational team has done an extraordinary
job executing the manufacturing ramp throughout the entire supply chain. To date, we've launched in 32 countries
including China and our new iPhones will be shipping in 69 countries and territories by the end of this month, making
this our fastest and most successful iPhone launch ever.
Demand for the new iPhone has been staggering, and geographically broad-based, markedly higher in every single
country where we've launched compared to the iPhone 5S a year ago. We're working hard to fill orders as fast as
possible, and we're on track to be in more than 115 countries by the end of December.
Last month, we introduced two new categories. The first is Apple Pay, an entirely new way to pay for things in stores
and in apps. It makes mobile payments easier, more secure, and more private. Apple Pay went live today, and now
making purchases in participating stores happens with just the touch of a finger.
Paying within apps is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing your finger on Touch ID. Today, Apple Pay supports
credit and debit cards from the three major three payment networks and the top U.S. banks and over 500 additional
banks have signed on and will be supporting Apple Pay beginning this year and early next year. Apple Pay is being
supported by many of the nation's top retailers and we continue to sign more retailers.
The second new category is Apple Watch, our most personal device ever and one that has already captured the world's
imagination. We can't wait to get Apple Watch to customers beginning in early calendar 2015. We'll be providing more
details on Apple Watch as we get closer to the shipment day.
Last week, we launched the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 with innovations that make them dramatically better than
previous generations and the stunning new iMac with a Retina 5K display. We released iOS 8 last month and our
customers are enjoying new ways to use their iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch with intuitive new features and
ground-breaking security. Last week, we also released OS X Yosemite with an all new design and continuity features
that deliver an even more fluid experience across all of our iOS devices and Macs. These introductions reflect years of
innovation and hard work by teams all across Apple, and they demonstrate the seamless integration of hardware,
software, and services that provide unparalleled user experiences to our customers. These are things that only Apple
can do.
We've also communicated and demonstrated our commitment to respecting and protecting users' privacy with strong
encryption and strict policies that govern how our data is handled. Today, we're also reporting very strong results for
Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. We generated our strongest revenue growth rate in seven quarters, far surpassing our
expectations we communicated in July and establishing a new record for Apple's September quarter revenue. We're
also reporting gross margin of 38% compared to 37% last year, leading to a very strong EPS growth of 20%. Fueled by
the launch of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and strong demand for our previous iPhone models, we set a new September
quarter record for iPhone with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year.
Demand for iPhone was strong across all geographies with global unit sell-through growth of 26%, and we exited the
quarter with significant backlog for both iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. We established an all-time quarterly record for
Mac sales with revenue growing 18% year-over-year, thanks in particular to the very strong performance of our
portables. We're especially proud of our Mac results considering the overall contraction of the global PC market this
year, and we achieved our highest quarterly market share since 1995. We also set an all-time record for the App Store
revenue thanks to the tremendous momentum and ongoing success of our developer community. App Store revenue
grew 36% over last year and cumulative app downloads have now topped 85 billion.
These results bring to a close a record-breaking fiscal 2014. Over the last four quarters, our products and services have
generated $183 billion in revenues, an increase of $12 billion over last year. We sold 243 million iOS devices and 19
million Macs, both all-time highs. Our revenue from iTunes Software and Services reached $18 billion, which is more
than the annual sales of two-thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we generated $6.45 in earnings per share,

which is 14% higher than last year and also set a new record.
We've made big investments in our business and have continued to expand our global footprint. Today, we have 437
Apple retail stores in 15 countries, and our partners are selling Apple products in hundreds of thousands of locations
around the world. We're continuing to invest in developing markets where revenues approached $50 billion in fiscal
year 2014, up 16% over last year and twice the rate of growth of the company overall.
We forged a landmark partnership with IBM to provide a new generation of mobile enterprise applications designed
with our product legendary ease-of-use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data analytics. Our partnership aims to
redefine the way work gets done, address key industry mobility challenges, and spark true mobile-led business change.
Developer teams have been working closely to develop the first wave of MobileFirst solutions, and these solutions will
be ready for customers beginning next month across six sectors: banking, government, insurance, retail, travel and
transportation, and telecommunications.
We've brought tremendous new talent and technology into Apple through 20 acquisitions in fiscal 2014, including
seven alone in the September quarter. We closed the Beats transition in July, and we're off to a great start with some
wonderful plans that we'll share with you in the future.
Our strong results continue to generate significant cash and we're extremely happy that this has enabled us to make
substantial investments in Apple's future while returning cash to our shareholders. We've executed aggressively against
our share repurchase programs, spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone, and $45 billion in the last year.
In addition to Apple's strong business performance over the past four quarters, I'm incredibly proud of all of our work
to protect the environment, to advance human rights, to improve working conditions in the supply chain, and to change
the way teachers teach and students learn. I'd like to thank all of our customers, employees, developers, and business
partners for making fiscal 2014 Apple's best year yet. And I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued
support. I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our September quarter results in more detail.
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.
During the September quarter, we generated record revenue of $42.1 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion or 12% year
over year. This result exceeded our guidance range due to better-than-expected sales of iPhones and Macs for which
customer demand grew strongly year-over-year in all our segments. Gross margin was 38%, at the high end of the
guidance range. Operating margin was $11.2 billion, representing 26.5% of revenue. Net income was $8.5 billion, a
new September quarter record, translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.42, a 20% year-over-year increase. Cash
flow from operations was very strong at $13.3 billion, also a new Q4 record.
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 39.3 million iPhones, an increase of 5.5 million over last year,
or 16% growth. Underlying demand was even stronger, with sell-through growth of 26%. IPhone sales grew across
both developed and emerging markets. Unit sales in the U.S. grew 17% year over year, and in Western Europe they
were up 20%. We saw even stronger growth in Latin America and the Middle East, with sales up more than 50%; and
in Central and Eastern Europe, where sales more than doubled. We increased iPhone channel inventory by just under 1
million units during the September quarter this year, significantly less than the 3.3 million unit increase in the
September quarter a year ago. Based on the very strong demand for our new iPhones, this left us below our target range
of four to six weeks for channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
IPhone momentum in enterprise markets remains very strong. The latest data published by IDC indicates that iPhone
has 69% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market. Also, an August ChangeWave survey of U.S. corporate IT
buyers found that among those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 75% plan to purchase
iPhones.

And iPhone continues to fuel innovation at companies around the world. Schindler, a leading global escalator and
elevator manufacturer, has deployed over 20,000 iPhones and 20 custom apps to improve customer engagement for
sales teams and to allow service technicians to access vital documentation, repair, and safety functions when they're in
the field. Baidu, China's top search provider, currently has over 20,000 employees using iPhones. And the company has
developed over 30 in-house iOS apps to help its employees work more efficiently, track sales leads, and manage
internal IT infrastructure and processes.
Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 1 million over last year. That
represents 21% growth year over year and an all-time quarterly record. We saw great demand in the back-to-school
season for both desktops and portables, with especially strong growth from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. We
achieved double-digit Mac growth across most markets around the world, with particularly impressive performance in
emerging markets, where Mac sales were up 46%. These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global
PC market, and we now gained market share for 33 of the last 34 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel
inventory slightly below our four to five-week target range.
Turning to iPad, we sold 12.3 million units compared to 14.1 million in the September quarter last year. In anticipation
of our October new product announcement, we reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the June
quarter, which left us within our target range of channel inventory on a look-back basis. IPad sales were consistent with
our expectations, and we experienced very strong results in Japan, where iPad sales were up 46% year over year.
Customers continue to love their iPads. In an August survey by ChangeWave, iPad mini with Retina display earned an
incredible 100% satisfaction rate. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, the survey
indicated that 55% plan to buy an iPad.
We continue to see strong momentum in enterprise for iPad. Progressive IT organizations around the world continue to
deploy, manage, and develop amazing in-house apps for iPad. Healthcare leader Sanofi has over 25,000 iPads and over
450 in-house apps for sales teams and corporate employees to get their products and information into the hands of
doctors and other healthcare providers. Premium eyewear designer Luxottica has deployed over 10,000 iPads to
improve how customers experience the size, fit, and overall look of eyewear in a retail environment. Importantly, since
the announcement of the partnership with IBM, hundreds of corporations around the world have expressed interest in
MobileFirst solutions. And we are actively working with over 50 of them to become foundation clients for MobileFirst
solutions in their industries.
IPad continues to lead the U.S. education tablet market with 90% share based on the latest data from IDC. In the
September quarter, the St. Paul Public Schools in Minnesota purchased over 22,000 iPad Airs and over 5,000 iPad
minis. In the first phase of the district's personalized learning through technology plan, they will ultimately equip every
student with an iPad.
The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Our iTunes Store generated all-time record billings of $5.4 billion in the
September quarter, up 22% year over year, thanks to the tremendous momentum of the App Store. Developers around
the world have embraced the iOS platform and keep broadening the appeal of our thoughtfully designed App Store to
our large, loyal, and engaged customer base across all of our programs. The number of registered app developers has
grown by 22% in the last year, and we are rapidly approaching 10 million. We are seeing especially strong interest in
the enterprise, where the number of registered developers is up 39% over a year ago.
Our retail stores also generated strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, and a
new September quarter record. We opened 10 new stores and completed the remodels of three stores during the quarter,
ending with a total of 437 stores, 41% of which are outside the United States. We are projecting a total of
approximately 25 new store openings in fiscal 2015, about three-quarters of which will be outside the U.S. We also
plan to remodel about five stores over the course of the year.
With an average of 432 stores open in the September quarter, average revenue per store was $11.9 million compared to
$10.9 million in the year ago quarter. We hosted 102 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates
to over 18,000 visitors per store per week.

Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $155.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a
sequential decline of $9.3 billion. We have continued to execute our capital return program aggressively with a total
spend of over $20 billion in just the September quarter. We launched our fourth accelerated share repurchase program
at the end of August, spending $9 billion. We also spent $8 billion to repurchase 81 million Apple shares through open
market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized over $300 million to net-share-settle
vesting employee RSUs.
So we've already taken action on over $94 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $68 billion in
share repurchases with five quarters remaining to its completion. We remain firmly committed to our objective of
delivering attractive returns to shareholders to both business performance and return of capital. As we said before, we
review our capital allocation regularly. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in
the past, and we will continue to do so. We plan to report on our conclusions in a timeframe similar to last year.
Now as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63.5
billion and $66.5 billion, compared to $57.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. This represents a double-digit revenue
increase despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most
currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and
$5.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $325 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.
Also, today, our board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share, payable on November 15, 2014, to
shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014.
With that, I will hand it over to Nancy for some final remarks.
Nancy Paxton
Thanks, Luca. We'd like to let you know about some reporting changes that we'll be making beginning with the release
of our Q1 2015 results.
First, to better serve our customers and optimize our results around the world, we're collaborating like never before
across our direct and indirect channels. Accordingly, beginning in Q1 2015 we'll be including the results of our retail
stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located, providing a consolidated view of regional performance
that is consistent with the way our executive team measures the business. This means that going forward, our reportable
segments will be the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Rest of Asia Pacific with retail no longer
classified as a segment.
Second, to better reflect our evolving products and services, we'll be making some changes to our product summary
reporting. We'll continue to report iPhone, iPad, and Mac as separate line items, and we'll also have a category that we
refer to as Services, and this will encompass everything that we report under the heading of iTunes, Software and
Services today, including content, apps, licensing, and other services, and beginning this month, it will also include
Apple Pay. We'll be creating a new reporting category called Other Products. This will encompass everything we report
in the accessory category today, including Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV, and peripherals and accessories
for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod.
In addition, we'll begin to include iPod sales in the Other Products category, and we will also reflect sales of Apple
Watch in this line item once it begins shipping in early calendar 2015. So to recap, beginning in Q1 2015, our product
reporting categories will be iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services, and Other Products. We wanted to give analysts and investors
a heads-up on these plans so you can reflect them in your models accordingly. We'll also re-classify historical results to
be consistent with these new groupings and we'll provide that information on our Investor Relations website when we
release Q1 results.
And finally, our distribution channels have evolved and expanded significantly in the last couple of years, including
traditional resellers, consumer electronic stores, mass retailers, distributors, and carriers; and each of these channels has

a different distribution model. Today, iPhone is sold in over 200,000 locations around the world, and iPad is sold in
more than 100,000 locations.
In addition, revenue from emerging markets has increased considerably over the last few years and now accounts for
over a quarter of our sales, and channel inventory requirements in those markets tend to be much longer. So due to the
size, complexity, and differing needs of our channels around the world, we've determined that a five to seven-week
average range for both iPhone and iPad channel inventory is more appropriate, and that will be our target range going
forward. However, given the backlog for our new products, we expect to exit the December quarter with our old four
weeks to six weeks target range.
So with that, let's open the call to questions. And we ask that you please limit yourself to one one-part question and one
follow up.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is with regard to Apple Pay, which
we actually used this afternoon and where it was rolled out, it actually worked pretty well, which was nice. But could
you provide some more color, Tim and Luca, on how you see the business model for Apple? And maybe from a
high-level perspective if you see it as more sort of over time becoming a standalone business, sort of, like you look at
iTunes, or is this more just a way to sell incremental product?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Shannon, hi. It's Tim. What we wanted to achieve with Apple Pay was, first and foremost, to
have an incredible consumer experience. And so we focus very much on making it elegant and simple and hopefully
your trials have proven that. I know I used it over the weekend, and it worked fantastically. We also wanted to focus on
security and privacy. And so we see huge issues with the security of the traditional credit card system, and many people
that have entered mobile payments are doing so in a way that they want to monetize the data that they collect from the
customers. And we think customers in general do not want this; that they'd like to keep their data private. And so we
wanted to have ease-of-use, security, and privacy, and maximize all three. By doing so, we think we will sell more
devices, because we think it's a killer feature. It's far better than reaching in your pocketbook and trying to find the card
that you're looking for and half the time it's not working. We do not charge the customer for the benefit. We do not
charge the merchant for the benefit.
However, there are commercial terms between Apple and the issuing banks. But we're not disclosing what they are;
like any other contractual arrangement, those are a private sort of thing. And so as Nancy was saying in her closing
comments, we'll be reporting Apple Pay in the Services line item on the datasheet, and so we see it as an incredible
service that is the most customer-centric mobile payment system that there is. And we're very proud of it and can't wait
to sign-up more retailers and also extend it around the world.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. And then, Luca, if you could, talk a little bit about the impact of currency. In
IBM's results this morning, they talked substantially about potential pressure going forward from currency. So could
you walk us through how your hedges work, how we should think about currency, and how you sort of reflected it in at
least the current quarter guidance?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, definitely, Shannon. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened quite significantly
against most currencies in the recent weeks. When we looked at our Q4 results, actually the impact was fairly limited in
the combination of the hedging program and the fact that the dollar really strengthened towards the very end of the
quarter. Not much impact in Q4. It is becoming a significant headwind in Q1 both on a year-over-year basis and on a
sequential basis. As I said before, we have reflected the new FX situation at current levels into our guidance that we
provided for both revenue and gross margins, and it's a fact of life if the U.S. dollar strengthens, that creates a headwind

for us both in revenue and margins for our business outside of the United States. As you know, we have a
comprehensive hedging program in place that mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. Over time, of course, these
hedges roll off and get replaced by new hedges at new spot levels, and so the protection that you get from a hedging
program is temporary. But, again, the guidance that we provided fully reflects the current situation in the FX markets.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
And from Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.
<Q - William C. Shope, Jr.>: Okay, thank you. Could you comment on how we should think about the key swing
factors for gross margins in the December quarter, obviously outside of the FX impact you just mentioned, Luca? And,
more broadly, I know it's still early. But how should we think about the gross margin path as the iPhone 6 family ramps
versus what we saw with the 5S and 5C cycle? I guess if you can't answer that specifically, I'm trying to figure out if
you'd characterize this as a fairly normal cycle in terms of the expected cost improvements over the life of the product.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Bill, let me start with puts and takes of margins for Q1. I would say that on the positive, we
are so pleased with the launch of the new phones. Demand has been phenomenal. So we think we're going to be getting
favorable impact from iPhone mix. Of course, we also are going to be getting some leverage – positive leverage from
the higher revenues that we guided to – and we continue to see a fairly favorable commodity environment. So these are
the things that are on the positive side.
On the negative side, I've talked about FX; obviously, we have launched a lot of new products during the last six
weeks, and we've got transition costs as we move from current products to new products, and that tends to be a
headwind. And every time we launch new products, we make them better. And what that means is that our cost
structures tend to go up when we introduce new products. We have a very good track record of taking those cost
structures down over time. So when you take the positives and negatives that I have just mentioned, that is what gives
us the guidance that we just provided.
<Q - William C. Shope, Jr.>: Okay, great. And my second question is, looking at the current supply constraints of the
iPhone, could you confirm that your guidance is assuming you'll reach supply/demand balance before the end of the
quarter? I think that what was implied by your commentary on channel inventory. And related to that, could you give
us some more color on what you see as the key bottlenecks at this point for supply on the iPhone side?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, it's Tim. The ramp itself is going great. It's the fastest-ever in our history. So I couldn't
be happier with it. That said, today, demand is far outstripping supply. It's unclear looking at the data when supply will
catch up with demand. And so I don't want to leave you with a view that we know that we're going to get to a
supply/demand balance on both on the new products this quarter, because I don't know that at that point. It's very
difficult to gauge demand without first achieving – without first finding the balance. And it's clear that, as of today,
certainly as of the end of the quarter where you're looking at the data, we're not nearly balanced. We're not close. We're
not on the same planet.
But that said, I'm really confident that supply is going to be great, and that's the reason you see incredibly strong
guidance that we're giving from $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion. But at this point, it's just very difficult to gauge what the
true demand is. It's very unusual to see every country having a marked improvement over the previous year, and that's
what we're seeing on iPhone, and so I couldn't be happier with the way the demand looks. Nancy's comment at the end
was meant to tell you that we do not envision, as of today, being able to achieve the extra inventory in the channel that
we believe is needed when you think about the long food chains in some of the emerging markets where the
distribution channels are not as efficient. That's the purpose of that comment.

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
We'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks. Luca, I wonder if you can quantify the currency headwind on gross margin in the
December quarter just because there's a big focus on currency across tech right now. And should we expect price
harmonization if the dollar remains strong? And then I have a follow up.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Katy, I said that the headwinds from foreign exchange are going to be significant. And I would
tell you that they're more significant when you look at it from a year-over-year basis than it is from a sequential basis
because clearly the dollar has been strengthening for quite a while, particularly against certain currencies like the yen or
the Canadian dollar, a lot of the emerging market currencies. It's a significant impact, and that's the reason why we
wanted to call it out.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Will you do any price harmonization if the dollar remains strong?
<A - Luca Maestri>: We price our products in a way that is in general reflective of pricing here in the United States.
And it's a pricing that we want to keep in place for reasonable periods of time. We do not like to make sudden changes
to our pricing.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I wonder if you can comment on how NAND capacity and
SKU mix is tracking versus your expectations of iPhone 6.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Katy, it's Tim. At this point, we're selling everything we make. And so it's difficult to say
that we've estimated well on the SKU mix and the split between the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. From everything
we can tell, we've done a pretty good job on that. But I stop short of saying there's no issue at all because it's hard to tell
when you're at a point where you're selling everything you're making. It's a good problem to have.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Got it, congrats on the quarter.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Thank you very much.

From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi. Toni, you may want to check your mute button.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, sorry about that. I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. Luca, the question for
you is a bit of a follow-up from the last one, which is that we saw a pretty robust sequential increase in ASPs this
quarter on the iPhone. And I was wondering if you could qualitatively help us understand whether that was a higher
mix of new phones than you typically see in the September quarter. Or was it really a function of the new phones
having a richer ASP? And if we look forward to calendar fiscal Q1, last year you had a very substantial ASP increase.
Should we be thinking about a similar kind of ASP increase this quarter given I think a widespread belief that
availability on the iPhone 6 Plus has been even more constrained and that we could see a much higher percentage of
iPhone 6 Plus as a percentage of total iPhones shipped in the quarter next quarter?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Toni. So on a sequential basis, our ASPs for iPhone were up $42. And as you said correctly,
the reason for the increase was a higher mix of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. There was a partial offset in the

quarter from the transition costs that we incur typically when we move to a new product. Going forward, obviously the
percentage of new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will increase sequentially, so we're going to have the full quarter
available to us. And it is correct that iPhone 6 Plus is supply constrained right now.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. And then, Tim, for you, I was wondering again qualitatively if you could help us
understand what you think the mix of repeat buyers is for iPhone 6, let's say, over the next year versus first-time iPhone
customers. And the question in that is do you believe that because the iPhone 6 is so compelling that that traditional
replacement cycle might be accelerated over the next several quarters? And if that's ultimately the case, do you in the
future run reversion back towards an elongating of that replacement cycle in future generations?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's difficult to answer exactly, but let me back up and give you some data maybe that will
help frame the topic some. If you look at some of our top countries and how they did in midyear of selling a customer
the first iPhone they had ever bought, what you would see is that in countries like China, over 80% of people that we
were selling the iPhone 4S to were buying their first iPhone ever. In the U.S., it was over 60%. And so those give you
some goalposts of large countries in terms of first-time ownership at our entry level. As you step across and look at the
iPhone 5S, which was at that time the top-end phone, in China still almost half the people were buying their first
iPhone ever buying a iPhone 5S, and about a quarter of the U.S. population buying a iPhone 5S were buying their first
one. And so that gives you some goalposts.
And so the way I look at those numbers are that on a forward basis, what I would expect but obviously we don't give
guidance on this kind of stuff is that I still see a fairly large opportunity in people buying their first iPhone ever. And I
think with these products that we just announced with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, that opportunity increases, not
decreases. I also believe that the upgrade market for people that were waiting for an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, as we
can see from our order backlog, that number is huge. And so I would expect that to go on for some period of time
because you have people that time out of contracts at different time. Not everybody does that at launch time.
And so I see both the first-time buyer being a great opportunity and the upgrader – some of the first-time buyers are
people that have never owned a smartphone before, and some of them are switchers from Android. And so, right now,
everything – all of those look very good to us, but we're in the early going and we're selling everything we're making.
And so it's going to take some period of time before we have a better handle on what those numbers will look like in
steady state. But I've never felt so great after a launch before. Maybe that's the best way to summarize it of all.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question?
Operator
From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks. Is there more color you can give us on the mix of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus,
particularly to the degree you see it in the order book? Our work suggests it's maybe 2.5 to 1, iPhone 6 to iPhone 6 Plus
in the U.S., but maybe that geographically it's quite different; Asia maybe going for the bigger screen, or is there any
color you can give us?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Steve, there's not a lot of color that I can give that I feel is terribly accurate, because, as I
said before, we're selling everything we're making. And so essentially what our current sell-through looks like is our
current supply. And so in the long arc of time, once there's enough supply to meet demand, that mix might look
differently. It is clear or at least I think that we will see a difference by geography in terms of preference, and we
thought that going into the launch. And there's no data that we've received to-date that would suggest that that's not the
case. And so that's about all I can say at this point.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. And then regarding the strength in Mac and the weakness in iPad, I guess, what's
the message from the market that you take away from that? And does that perhaps at all affect your view of doing a

convertible type product which in the past has not kind of been Apple's approach, you tend to like to do your very
focused products, but it might be that there's something in between that could be quite successful.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Let me comment on both the Mac and the iPad. On the Mac, it was just an absolutely
blow-away quarter, our best ever. It will result in our highest market share since 1995. It's just absolutely stunning. The
back-to-school season voted, and the Mac won and carried the day and we're really proud of that. I'm proud of the Mac
team. It's clear that all the work that we put into our notebooks on the hardware and the software side is resonating with
our customers, and I think if you went out to college campuses about now, you would see a lot of new Mac notebooks
there based on the sales. And so that feels fantastic. Being up 21% in those markets that's shrinking, it doesn't get better
than that.
For iPad, if I take a step back on iPad and I know that there's a lot of negative commentary in the markets on this, but I
have a little different perspective on it. Here is sort of my simple perspective. If you look at – instead of looking at this
thing each 90 days, if you back up and look at it, we've sold 237 million in just over four years. That's about twice the
number of iPhones that we sold over the first four years of iPhone. If you look at the last 12 months of iPad, we sold 68
million. In fiscal year 2013, we sold 71 million. So we were down but we were down 4% on sell-in and the sell-through
was a bit better than the negative 4% because we took down channel inventory some.
And so, to me, I view it as a speed bump, not a huge issue. That said, we want to grow. We don't like negative numbers
on these things. And so looking further in the data, I know that there's a popular view that the market is saturated. But
we don't see that. I can't speak to the – to other people, but I do look at our data deeply, and in the last market research
data we have is in the June quarter, and let me give you some of the real data that we've got. If you look at our top six
revenue countries, in the country that has sold the lowest percentage of iPads to people who had never bought an iPad
before, that number is 50%. And the range goes from 50% to over 70%. And so when I look at first-time buyer rates in
that area, saturated – that's not a saturated market. You never have first-time buyer rates at 50% and 70%.
What you do see is that people hold onto their iPad longer than they do a phone. And because we've only been in this
business four years, we don't really know what the upgrade cycle will be for people. And so that's a difficult thing to
call. What we do know is that people always respond for us doing great products, and we feel really great about what
we introduced last week. We also know that the deeper the apps go in the enterprise, the more it opens up avenues in
enterprise. And that's a key part of the IBM partnership and what I think customers will get out of that, which is more
important than us selling. It's changing the way people work. And so I see catalysts going forward. There are obvious
cannibalization things that are occurring. I'm sure that some people look at a Mac and an iPad and decided on a Mac. I
don't have research to demonstrate that, but I'm sure of that just looking at the numbers. And I'm fine with that, by the
way. I'm sure that some people will look at an iPad and an iPhone and decide just to get an iPhone, and I'm fine with
that as well.
But over the long arc of time, my own judgment is that iPad has a great future. How the individual 90-day clicks work
out, I don't know. But I'm very bullish on where we can take iPad over time, and so we're continuing to invest in the
product pipeline. We're continuing to invest in distribution. If you look at how we did in emerging markets, like BRIC
countries as an example, we were up 20% for the full year of 2014. And so these numbers are impressive, and
obviously the BRIC countries are growing as a percentage of our total as is developing markets is. And so it looks a bit
different geography-to-geography. And so that's a long answer to your question, but I thought it was important for you
to at least hear my perspective, and you can judge it as you will.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?

<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Hey, thanks a lot. Tim, I was wondering what we were to make out of your new segments
with the Apple Watch being in the Other category, we were just a little surprised to hear that because it seems like such
a substantial new category and you could sell maybe even tens of millions of units. So by putting it lumped in the Other
with iPods and a lot of other things, does that say something about your expectations for that product, or do you think
that you'll just break it out after a little while?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It says nothing about our expectation for the product. We didn't form those categories based
on expectations. We looked at current revenue, today revenue, and decided that we would lump everything that wasn't a
Mac, an iPad, or an iPhone, or a service in one kind of category. In the future, we might decide something different.
But for now, in Q1, we're not shipping any iPhones – or excuse me, Apple Watches. And so, it seems appropriate to
start it that way. It also – to be, also straight is I'm not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch
because of then – and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it. And so aggregating it is
helpful from that point of view as well.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Okay, got it. And then with regard to my next question is, you put out a lot of products, and
we obviously, everybody gives you a lot of credit for the great new product lineup that we have, but everybody talks
about what's next. You said in an interview recently on TV that you were working on products that people didn't even
speculate on yet, and that's pretty hard with Apple considering how many people watch your company and write about
it. So I was just wondering if you can elaborate on that maybe in terms of your excitement around new products and
what did you mean by that comment? And just how do you feel about the future in light of that comment you made?
Thanks a lot.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I'm incredibly optimistic about the future. We've already announced two new categories in
the last 60 days or so or less than 60 days with Apple Pay and Apple Watch. We start shipping the watch early next
year. And, obviously, we're working on other things as well. And to the degree that I can keep that in the cone of
silence, I'm going to do it. And so I'm not sure what to say. I don't – I'm not going to give any hints or anything. We
look at a lot of different things, and we're fortunate to have a lot of creative people here that want to change the world
and have a lot of great ideas.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: All right. Thanks, Tim.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Hey, good afternoon. A follow up to Ben's question in terms of the last year, you had
high expectations in terms of new product categories and the iPhone 6 launch, but there are some investors who think
about Apple as a product cycle story. So, Tim, I'd be interested in how you think about the story broadly in 2015 and
kind of exciting things to be focused on as an investor? And then I have a follow up to Luca.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: For Apple, as an investor, I would hope that people would look at what we've done and what
we delivered and the power and strength of the product line that we've announced. And maybe more importantly than
all the stuff that you see is to look at the skills within this company and the fact that I think it's the only company on the
planet that has the ability to integrate hardware and software and services at a world-class level. And that in itself
allows Apple to play in so many different areas.
And so the challenge becomes one of deciding which ones to say no to and which ones to say yes to and ones to focus,
not ones of do we have any great ideas. We always have more ideas than we have resources to deal with. And so I
would look at that. I would look at what we talked about last week, things like continuity. And if you use your
imagination and think about where that goes, there's no other company that can do this. Apple is the only one. And I

think this becomes so incredibly important moving forward for customers living in an environment where they're using
multiple devices.
And so I would look at the skills, the capabilities, the passion of the company, and the creative engine has never been
stronger. And I think you can see that from the Apple Watch. You can see that with Apple Pay. Apple Pay is classic
Apple, taking something that is incredibly old, outdated, cloogy. Everybody is focused on everything except for the
customer and putting the customer at the center of the experience and making something very elegant. And so I would
look at those things. And when I look at those things, as an investor, I feel great. As a personal investor, I feel great.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: That's helpful, and then a follow-up for Luca. You mentioned that you have typical
transition costs that would involve new products that you're rolling out. Do those costs start to ease in the March
quarter, and would that presumably have a positive impact on gross margins in March versus December? Thanks.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Gene. You know pretty much what our product cadence is and what it has been in the past,
and you know that the holiday season is a period where we have significant product events. We're not providing any
guidance for the March quarter. And also keep in mind, Gene, if you are trying to extrapolate gross margins into the
future, there are so many factors that affect gross margin over time. It's not only transition costs, but it's product mix,
it's foreign exchange, it's commodity markets.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Okay, great. Thanks, congratulations.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
And from Bank of Montreal, we'll go to Keith Bachman.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Tim, I was wondering if you could characterize China a little bit. The numbers I
understand weren't as good as the rest of the company this quarter, but presumably that was all the delay of the iPhone.
So I'm really asking if you talk about the last few weeks, or more importantly as you look at December quarter in
particular related to some of the political backdrop, including the carriers have been mandated not to spend the level of
subsidies. Do you see any of that impacting your opportunities for Apple, broadly speaking, but more specifically for
iPhones as it relates to subsidy levels?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: That's a good question. Keith, as you said, if you look at Greater China Q4 of 2014
compared to Q4 of 2013, the obvious difference is that we launched the iPhone 5S in Q4 of 2013. And in this year we
didn't have a new product launch. We're launching in this quarter in Q1 of 2015.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yes.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The second thing that's not as apparent probably but is somewhat related to that is that last
year we increased our channel inventory by 1.3 million units. This year we actually decreased it slightly. And so you
have a compounded effect of no launch and a huge change in channel inventory on a year-over-year basis.
So the way that I assess the strength of the market is I look at unit sell-through. And to share with you what it was in
Greater China, iPhone's unit sell-through despite no launch in Q4 was up 32% year over year. The market was
projected by IDC to only grow 13%, so we feel incredibly great about that. Macs were up 54% year over year, and
that's against the IDC's estimate of a market contraction in China of 7%. And so those are our two stalwarts that were
really driving results. And so the underlying results look totally different than the reported results because of the
channel inventory differences.
The App Store in China is also doing great. The growth there is phenomenal. IPad contracted some during the quarter,
but for the full year we did grow. We were up 9% year over year for the full year. And so I see lots of positives. As you

know, China is in the early stages of their huge 4G rollout.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yes.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: And this past weekend we launched it with China Mobile, China Unicom, and China
Telecom. This is the first time we've launched a new iPhone with all three carriers, and we've done it at the early stages
of the 4G rollout. And so I'm incredibly bullish over it.
In terms of subsidies, there are regulatory pressures on subsidies. We've seen that. However, only 20% of the iPhones
that we've been selling in China have had a traditional subsidy applied to it, and so the vast majority don't. And so will
it make a difference with that 20%? I don't know yet. Intuitively, you would think it would. But it's at least a percentage
of 20% instead of a percentage of 100%.
And so when I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class
than any nation on earth in history, and just an incredible market where people want the latest technology and products
that we're providing. And so we're investing like crazy in the market. We're more than doubling our stores. We've got
15 stores in Greater China today. We're going to be close to 40 stores in the next couple of years. We've expanded our
online store to cover now 315 cities in China. The revenue results for Q4 were more than double the previous year. The
App Store is growing. Chinese developers have now created 150,000 apps on the App Store. And so I see lots of very,
very positive vectors there, and I couldn't be more excited.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. And then as my follow-up, if I could, Tim, you mentioned before on a previous
comment on iPad where you saw, I think, 50% to 70% in the top six countries were new buyers. And related to a
previous question, I wondered if you could give that same range? I understand it's probably a pretty wide range for
iPhones, and that was to the June quarter, I think. And broadly speaking, how does that number change, at least your
guess, as you look out over the next couple quarters given the launch of the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: For iPhone, I really have it by model from the June quarter. And as I had mentioned before,
the highest percentage is the iPhone 4S buyer in China. Over 80% of the people were buying their first iPhone, and for
iPhone 5S in China, 50% were. And so I think what that says those numbers are so high...
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yes.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: ...80%, that I think a great – my gut tells me a great percentage of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
Plus buyers will eventually – a great percentage of those will be new to iPhone. That's what I would predict.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, that's it for me, guys. Thank you.
