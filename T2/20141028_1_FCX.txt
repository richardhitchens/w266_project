On the call today are: Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, our President and Chief
Executive Officer; Jim Flores, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, and we've
got several others from our senior management team here in the room. We'll start by briefly summarizing the financial
results and then I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual,
we'll open the call after our remarks for questions.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $552 million, $0.53 per share for third quarter of
2014 compared with $821 million or $0.79 per share for the third quarter of 2013. There are several special items, as
you'll note in the press release, included in this quarter's results which reduced net income by $115 million or $0.11 per
share.
These items included a ceiling test write-down on our oil and gas properties, which impacted net income by $192
million, a charge of $47 million for an increase in deferred tax accruals associated with recent tax law changes in Chile.
These were offset partially by mark-to-market gains on oil and gas derivatives totaling $76 million and $48 million in
gains on asset sales and debt redemption transactions.
The operating results, as you'll see, reflect strong operating performance throughout the organization. Copper sales
totaled 1.08 billion pounds and gold sales totaled 525,000 ounces. Those exceeded the year-ago quarter. Our oil and gas
sales of 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent exceeded the recent forecast, but were below the year-ago quarter,
reflecting the sale of the Eagle Ford shale properties in June of 2014. Our results also benefited from the resumption of
Grasberg concentrate exports in August, following regulatory approvals from the Indonesian government in late July.
Our third quarter average realized copper price was $3.12 per pound. That was below the year-ago quarter of $3.28 per
pound. Gold prices were also below the year-ago at $12.20 per ounce versus $13.29 per ounce in the third quarter of
2013. And Brent prices, Brent crude prices averaged $103.50 per barrel compared with $110 per barrel in the year-ago
quarter.
Our operating cash flows generated during the quarter totaled $1.9 billion and our capital expenditures approximated
$1.9 billion as well. As we previously announced and we've got additional information in the press release, we entered
into an agreement in October to sell our 80% interest in the Candelaria and Ojos copper mining operations and
supporting infrastructure to Lundin Mining Corporation for $1.8 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to
$200 million. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we redeemed $1.7 billion of senior notes with an average interest rate of 6.6%. And additionally, on
October 15, we redeemed $400 million of aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% senior notes. We ended the
quarter with $19.7 billion of total debt and the consolidated cash was $658 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to materials, the slide presentation materials on our website.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone. We've got a lot to talk about today and I know in this complicated geopolitical world we live
in with the market conditions we face, we got some issues to talk about in Indonesia. We're going to talk about the
things that affect our business in those areas and answer your questions.
But I also want to put the situation in context for our company. Kathleen just talked about a quarter, despite all these
things, where we had solid performance from our global operations, both in mining and oil and gas. In Indonesia, we
resumed concentrate exports in August following the export ban that came into play in January. And we're working to –
we work with the government on our long-term contract situation.
Then, when we look at our strategy of growing the volumes of our business, and to do that, we obviously have to focus
on making long-term decisions and making long-term investments and be consistent about it. You're seeing progress
made of efforts that began back at the time of the Phelps Dodge/Freeport merger in 2007. The Morenci expansion is
expected to reach full rates by the end of this year. The project is essentially complete and it's a major step for us. The

Sierra Verde expansion, which is a tripling of our output there, a project that's cost is estimated to be in excess of $4.5
billion, is on progress. Construction is underway heading for a startup in 2016. In our oil and gas business, Jim will be
talking about the commissioning of Lucius this year and the Highlander project where we're completing the well for
testing and production as part of our Inboard Lower Tertiary program, important project in that area.
Beyond that, our exploration activities and our planning activities for future expansions in our mining business, our oil
and gas business, continue to look at our large resource base and position ourselves for future growth over long periods
of time. Kathleen talked about the sale of Candelaria. That was a good asset. We found a buyer willing to pay a
reasonable price and we executed it. Should be a good deal for both companies. For us, it's a step towards meeting our
objective of generating cash to reduce our debt, and all of that has gone smoothly and we're working with Lundin on all
the efforts to close the transactions and have an effective transition.
Speaking about copper markets, global macroeconomic situations have been overhanging the market, raising questions
about demand. Europe has become a recent matter of global concern about its financial and geopolitical situation.
People are concerned about growth rates slowing in China. But when we look at our business and the outlook and in
talking with our customers, in our copper business, we sell directly to users of copper. We're not traders. We have a
limited amount of activity with the trading companies. And so, we have direct ties to copper consumers globally. Here
in the U.S., we're almost just a little less than 50% of the total marketplace for copper and we sell around the world, and
copper consumption continues to remain strong. Copper is affected by the economic situations in any particular
country. But as we talk with our customers and we were with many of them during the LME Week, the outlook of the
current uncertainty is bolstered by a more positive outlook going forward. The U.S. continues to grow at a moderate
rate.
Then, when you step back from the demand side, which is going to be affected by what goes on in China and the global
economy, the supply side challenges, which is the underpinning for the current copper price and for our optimistic view
about copper going forward, is really driven by the supply-side issues. A number of projects were started. Some have
been delayed. The surpluses that were projected are not yet being realized and appear, perhaps, to be overstated.
Inventories of – at customers and the exchanges remain low, we see examples of new projects being delayed or
deferred, and so the supply-side picture remains the same, and the positive long-term fundamentals for the copper
markets which drives our business are intact.
On slide seven, you can see that we managed our business in an efficient way during the quarter and achieved good unit
cost results. And you can see that for the quarter, our consolidated unit costs were $1.34 and the improvement in
Indonesia with the resumption of exports during the quarter. We have a set of assets that allows us to be responsive to
market changes. We showed that clearly in 2008-2009, and with assets that can generate profits at today's copper price
levels, with the outlook being positive for the longer term, improve profits as we go forward. Production volumes in
North America reflect the Morenci ramp-up and improvements at our mines. South America, we were in lower grade
sections of our mines, and you can see that Africa performed well, as did Indonesia, during the quarter.
The strength of our company in the Minerals business is our resource base. At $2 copper plans, we have over 100
billion pounds of proved and profitable reserves reported under SEC standards. Beyond that, we have identified mineral
resources associated with our existing properties of an incremental contained over 100 billion pounds. And we are
working to take this mineral resource base to develop long-term investments. Finding projects to invest in requires
time. And after we complete the current round of investments, there's going to be an active period of doing all the work
that's necessary before we begin making significant capital commitments to new projects. But we have to be focused on
doing that with a sense of urgency in order to be able to take advantage of these opportunities.
Then beyond this big resource base, there is significant additional potential that's not included in our mineral resources.
And much of this has to do with sulfide deposits lying in North America associated with the oxide production that we
have, but Morenci and Safford, with the Lone Star deposit and other properties in North America.
At Tenke, we still are doing drilling activities and metallurgical analysis to identify the mixed ore sulfide base beyond
our existing production that we have there. El Abra has continued opportunities for resource additions and we're
working with partners in the area to determine the best way to deal with that. And we have an attractive greenfield

project in Serbia. So that is a real strength of our company.
Now, where do we stand in this process? Well, this first round of projects that we're now completing – the Morenci
project, the Cerro Verde project, we previously completed the Tenke project, were designed to add about 20% to our
production volumes. We started on these projects in 2010. By 2016, we'll be moving from an annual sales level of
roughly 4 billion pounds to 5 billion pounds. You may recall before that, we had completed the initial development of
Tenke. We'd completed the startup of the Climax mine. We had enhanced production from our existing operations; now
we're seeing where we go from there.
Grasberg, through all the issues related to the export ban, the other issues we've faced in recent times, we have
progressed the development of the underground resource. This is a big project. Very attractive long-term economics
because of the high grades of both copper and gold that are available to us. And we're working to establish Grasberg as
a long-term asset with high production volumes, low cost. You can see that the schedule we're on will provide for the
commencement of mining from the extension of our existing DOZ mine, the Deep MLZ mine with its high grades that
will begin by the end of 2015. And then once we complete mining in the Grasberg pit, which will be 2016-2017
timeframe, we will commence mining from the Grasberg Blockade underlying the pit. And that's what we've been
working on for several years and continue to invest in. All of that is part of our long-term plan.
Now, here's where we stand in Indonesia. We entered into this memorandum of understanding in July to allow us to
resume exports. Export sales had been prohibited since mid-January as a result of a government policy, government
laws and regulations designed to encourage in-country investment in downstream processing. We executed the MOU.
We agreed to pay higher royalties, pay an export duty. We posted a bond to support a commitment for our smelter
development, and then we are continuing to operate under our existing COW.
Our agreement with the government is, is that we will work to amend the Contract of Work, provided we're provided
assurances for our ability to operate beyond 2021 through the extension provisions of the COW to 2041 with
assurances about our fiscal terms, operating rights and legal rights. We've done work with the government on that.
Work remains to be done. Last week, there was an inauguration of the new government or the new president came into
office. He has now announced his cabinet and we will begin working in a transition mode from the prior government
officials with these new government officials.
Our goal is to maintain a positive long-term partnership with the government of Indonesia. We're confident we can
achieve that because it's one of these things where it's in everyone's best interest to do it. It's been a complicated
political environment with the elections. And we've had to work in that environment, but we are confident we're going
to be able to achieve this because we've done such good things for the country, our employees and the region, and it's
important to the country. It's the right thing to do and we're going to work to do it.
Labor. We have had issues with labor that started two years ago when we had a strike. We worked through a CLA
agreement following the strike – three years ago with the strike. Last year, we signed a new CLA agreement. We've had
safety issues that have been reported. We had a collapse of the underground classroom area last year, and then recently,
we've had two accidents.
The Union has been – we're approaching these with a great deal of focus to ensure that our procedures are right and
we're handling safety right. Our safety programs are strong by international standards. Operations in Indonesia have
had very low accident – incident rates. Our standards are very high, but because of the terrain, the weather and the
workforce, when someone makes a mistake, unfortunately, the consequences can be tough. So we're dealing with all of
that.
It's been, let me just say, an emotional time in Indonesia with the elections not only nationally, but in the region. And as
a result of that, that's led to a current issue with parts of our workforce. 75% or 80% of our workforce is in place, but
some workers are engaging in protests and demands relating to these recent safety issues. We're attempting to work
with them. Some workers are currently not reporting to work and that's having some constraints on our mining
activities in the pit.

We've been continuing to operate our mill, our underground operations and our concentrate delivery systems, but it's
having a current impact and those discussions are going on right now. We're getting support from the local government,
the local community and the central government and we're in the process of working to resolve this. We're reaching out
with the union leadership to have discussions with them as well. Again, this is – sorts of things that we've worked
through in the past and we'll work through these issues, but that is the situation we're dealing with currently.
Now stepping back, after we complete these projects, where do we go next? We've been engaged in brownfield
development studies. We have significant long-term opportunities for growth projects in Chile at our El Abra mine,
where we have a partnership with Codelco. We're talking with our partners about how to proceed with a major
development project there. That requires development of water sources, the desalination pipeline project, the power and
so forth, but the great thing is we've got a huge resource. And so those are issues we're working on.
At our Bagdad mine near Prescott here in Arizona, we have a very significant large sulfide resource that has the
capacity to more than double our mill rates. We're working on developing the necessary steps with water, land to
develop for tailings areas and so forth to move forward with that. In Tenke, we have the resource that allows for
growth. To take the next step will require development of power resources for the area and we're working with the
government and other companies in Katanga to deal with that. That's a necessary step to allow us for the long-term
development at Tenke.
And at the Safford mine in Eastern Arizona with the adjacent Lone Star resource, we have about five years left on our
current oxide production. We're looking at a step opportunity there to supplement that oxide ore with ore from the Lone
Star deposit and then at Lone Star and at Safford, we have a significant sulfide resource that would allow for us to deal
with that.
So, that is kind of the lineup of where we're going and we'll continue to report for it. We have, on slide 13 and slide 14,
we have these 3D models, we call them Vulcan models, that allow us to take drill hole results and project the geometry
of resources. And we felt we'd share a couple of those with you at Morenci where we've just completed an expansion of
our mill, but the opportunity there, because of this huge potential resource that's shown on this slide for a very large
scale milling expansion in the future is something that is becoming increasingly more attractive.
At Lone Star, adjacent to Safford, a deposit that's been known about for decades now is, because of the ability to take
advantage of resources and the drilling and exploration analysis we've done, is showing a huge resource potential.
These are in the U.S. Today in the U.S., because of the improved energy situation coming from the shale oil and gas
development with attractive energy costs because of the flexibility of U.S. labor, the support we have here in Arizona
from the local government for brownfield development expansions, makes these things very attractive.
Jim Bob, would you want to say a couple of words about the potential projects?
James R. Moffett
The only thing I would say is that there's two good examples, Morenci and Lone Star, that shows that these brownfields
underneath the property that we acquired from Phelps Dodge, the easy way to explain it is to tell you that these things
are all icebergs sitting here and the oxide ore is the tip of the iceberg with the big body of the iceberg down below the
surface. Remember, the only difference between oxide ore and sulfide ore is that the oxide ore has been exposed to
weather. So if you look at this and see all the core holes that we drilled in here, you see that underneath this Lone Star
oxide, you have a mine potential that would be bigger than most of the big mines in the U.S. and the rest of the world.
So if you realize that most people are trying to get out and find greenfield projects, we're sitting here with the
infrastructure on U.S. soil, with the big potential of these mines. For instance, in Africa, where you have [indiscernible]
(0:26:32) we mentioned earlier, we have a 60-kilometer ore body that's exposed at the surface [indiscernible] (0:26:38)
another one of these icebergs. So my only comment, Richard, is we use this example to remind everybody that we have
this huge resource base and we've done enough drilling that we've taken the risk out of what would normally be their
entire greenfield projects.

Richard C. Adkerson
Okay. Thanks, Jim-Bob. And now, just in closing, we're really excited about the mining business. It's a tough business.
There are challenges that we have to face that we've faced over the years. We're confident about our ability to do that
and we've got a track record of doing it, great set of assets, great people, great technology.
And then on page 15, you can see where we have right now, within sight, five mines to be world-class mines and those
are very, very difficult to find with 400,000 tons to 500,000 tons of annual production that scan the world. And then all
these resources that while we won't be spending capital on in the near term, we'll be very disciplined about that. We're
going to be focused on shareholder returns. It gives us a great deal of excitement about this part of our business.
I know Jim shares that excitement about our oil and gas business, and I'll let him take over.
James C. Flores
Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. As Kathleen articulated in her opening comments, the oil and gas
business is doing well. Our sales of 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter was slightly above the July
estimate. But it was impacted by our earlier $3.1 billion rationalization of the Eagle Ford Shale assets in the second
quarter. We continue to have good steady production performance in California in our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
where our high margin barrels all come from. The cash operating margin was $600 million for the quarter with a $48 a
barrel margin. That was impacted by the recent price activity in the Brent pricing, 68% of Gulf of Mexico with a $65
margin. Then we did a good job over the summer and positioned the company for future growth out of our key area,
which is the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Also, our oil hedges that were carried over from the Plains days come in handy with this current oil price where we
have puts that are stuck at $90. They cost us $3 or $4 a barrel and so forth. And when you start talking about $80, $85
oil in this type of market volatility and violence that they're the fire protection you need to make sure you continue to
protect your capital budget and your shareholder returns that we're all pledged to protect.
On page 17, the reserves and resource potential is, we're trying to articulate here what the rotation of our business has
been from purely production assets that are flat to declining to something that's going to be impactful for the company
at large with large growth. As you can see, California and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico is a great comparison. Two
excellent oil assets. The cash margin, obviously, in the Gulf of Mexico much higher because of the efficiency of
production versus California with $79 versus $53. And the reserve bases are basically about the same, 200 million
barrels each.
But the growth potential and the reserve potential in both areas is dramatically different from 400 million barrels in
California to 4.4 billion in the Gulf of Mexico, still with the same operating leverage, still with the same brownfield
complexion of reserve adds and also the facility and technical leverage that preserves your individual project
economics, was like in the mining business. That's where our strong suit is. So we're putting a tremendous amount of
effort as everyone does in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, positioning our business. We'll talk about the portfolio
rotation here in a second.
In the meantime, we do have, on the right-hand side of the page, a very large opportunity in Morocco to drill some
Jurassic fan plays and some deep structures there offshore that we're excited about. We'll start drilling those, the first
one next year and the second one in 2016. I've passed over, but not left out our gas business. Our gas business,
highlighted by the Haynesville and the Inboard Lower Tertiary, we have 23 Tcf of gas potential there versus our 8
billion barrels of oil upside.
With gas prices where they are, we continue to put the harness on this. We're drilling a few exploratory wells in the
Inboard Lower Tertiary on the backs of the Highlander apparent success, even though we haven't put it on production
yet. And as far as trying to delineate where the play goes to and try to make sure that we protect our resources there
without going into full development just because of the gas price margin, obviously at $2.85 an Mcf or $18 a barrel

doesn't compete as well for capital as the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico or California or International does.
So that gives a look at the 8 billion barrels of potential resource, potential we have in the company versus our 430
million barrel reserve base and an additional 23 Tcf. We have a very deep portfolio of opportunities that we plan to take
advantage of for many years and decades to come.
Specifically to the third quarter business on page 18, the portfolio optimization comes on the back of the Eagle Ford
Shale interest sale for $3.1 billion in June of 2014. We reinvested $1.4 billion of Deepwater Gulf of Mexico interests
on a tax-free exchange for interest and picked up another 5% plus of our Lucius oil development and then our – the
Heidelberg oil development we're watching is just to the west of our Holstein facility in Green Canyon. We picked up
12.5%. Both of those are operated by Anadarko.
And then a new one, our Vito oil discovery that Shell and Anadarko and Statoil had drilled a few years ago. It's a
delineated structure that has a lot of development leases and exploitations in leases around the mini basin that we have
a significant interest in, and this will give us an infrastructure hub coming in the basin that will make our offset drilling
or exploratory and exploitation leases have the field economics that we enjoy in the rest of our portfolio. Super high
quality projects and high quality operators that we'll be doing business with either as a non-honorary partner or
operating for them as well.
So, this rotation into the Gulf of Mexico projects replaces the Eagle Ford production with an extended growth profile
starting in 2017. It was very value creative and it was an important ongoing step in our debt reduction plan with $1.2
billion of debt reduction and net after-tax proceeds. The graphs of the Deepwater production reflects on slide 18 and
incorporate these assets as well as the net resource potential comparison. You can see how more important these assets
were than compared to our upside in the Eagle Ford, so about 10 times, 10 times more potential than 1.3 billion barrels
of oil.
And just to remind everybody what our strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico, the size of our assets – the assets are
coming, this is our Holstein facility here with – reflecting we have with Marlin and Horn Mountain as far as these big
production facilities. They're running at about 25% of capacity and we plan on getting them to 100% capacity by the
end of this decade.
The major development projects that are coming on is Lucius, Heidelberg and Vito. Lucius is scheduled to come on
here in the fourth quarter of 2014, probably first production that will impact us at the lime field. It would be early 2015
and our new guidance reflects those small delays at Lucius. Heidelberg's scheduled to come on third quarter of 2016,
and Vito is scheduled to come on some time in 2019 right now, even though it's unsanctioned.
And then of course our exploration and exploitation opportunities. We're focused primarily with 85% of our dollars on
exploitation in the next several years and staying with our disciplined operating strategy of filling those existing
facilities with high-revenue barrels out of Gulf of Mexico.
Kind of a global picture of our Gulf of Mexico here, and starting from right to left – because I'm left-handed I like
going backwards – we have our Marlin area, Horn Mountain area in, this would be Canyon area. And you see how Vito
fits in very well between the Mississippi Canyon and our Holstein/Green Canyon area, the Vito and the Lower
Mississippi Canyon, Atwater Valley area, and then we get over to Keathley Canyon and Lucius.
And it also reflects, by asset, areas where the 4.4 billion barrels of resource potential lie, and it's a well-balanced area,
about half a billion to a billion barrels per area and we continue to explore it. As we get all of our seismic data in and
our geoscientists and we think we have a long, long way to go of developing brownfield and tie-back opportunities in
these areas.
One we really want to highlight this morning is a Holstein Deep play that we're drilling on right now which is on page
21. This is a discovery that we drilled a few years ago, and after the Holstein purchase, were able to pick the leases
back up and develop it. And this is the log from our initial well in Green Canyon 643, a discovery well, and we're
currently drilling a well about a mile south of it, or a mile, a mile and a half south of it, southeast of it. And we're in the
M13 sand right now coring. We found in M13A and M13B sands as well as D sands and we're looking at the M13E

sand and coring it, and then we're going to drill on down in M18.
We think this is a significant discovery at this point in time with the confirmation well. And we're learning a lot about
our seismic as we drill more wells here and how much conflict we have going all the way around the salt feature. It's a
very large resource potential, multi-pay in the Miocene. And we haven't got into the Lower Tertiary or the Cretaceous
at this point in time.
So this is going to be a dominant production event for us in 2016, at Holstein where we have about 100,000 barrels of
capacity there that we'll be able to bring on a significant portion of that 50,000 or 60,000 barrels a day in 2016 out of
this Holstein deep drilling as we continue to drill around it. That will complement with our Heidelberg and also Lucius
ramp-ups this year and in 2016 with Heidelberg.
So we've got a lot of production events coming forward that are already in the pipeline. It's a matter of getting the work
done. And we're going to continue drilling the well. We'll report on M18 sands and further the coring activity at our
next call.
Lucius and Heidelberg development projects. I gave you the update on those. Just to refresh everybody's memory. We
have a 25% work interest there. So it's very significant, when you're talking about 80,000 barrels a day and half a
million cubic feet, or 450 million cubic feet of gas, most of that's third party. And then we have a 12.5% interest right
now in Heidelberg going forward. And that, as you can see, the spar has already had the sail-away and it's progressing
on structure.
In page 23, our Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous activities. We've been very active here. The highlight, a project
which is our top project at this point in time, we've had ongoing completion operations there. We've had some
mechanical or equipment failures that we've had to replace equipment that's put us about 30 to 45 days behind. So we
expect the flow test here in the fourth quarter, more oilfield stuff that we've managed through. And so we're on track,
we're just delayed.
The Davy Jones #2, we're conducting flow tests at the Wilcox sands. At this point in time, most of the testing at this
point has not yielded commercial results of hydrocarbons, but it's given us confidence in our flow rates from the deeper
sands that we're flowing a lot of water and not much gas. So at least the permeability and porosity is there, if not the
productivity.
The same thing on Blackbeard West #2, and then on Blackbeard East, we're going to be moving a rig later this year to
do a Miocene completion and there's some nice sands there, and we're drilling our farthest gate west exploratory well. It
spudded here in October and it's drilling towards 29,000 feet in southwest Louisiana, and we also have our Lineham
Creek project that we're reviewing completion operations with the operator, Chevron.
So that ties it together on the oil and gas side. We've been active. We're rotating toward a very busy Gulf of Mexico
season for the next several years with our drill ship fleet and driving production volumes and moving the cash flow of
production higher. Richard?
Richard C. Adkerson
Okay. Thanks, Jim. Let's look at the outlook slide, our update to our outlook for the year 2014. Current copper is
projected to be 3.9 billion pounds. That reflects the sale of Candelaria and some timing issues at Grasberg.
Gold, molybdenum and oil, this also reflects the most recent information we have from the operator of Lucius about the
start-up from it. It's going fine, but it's starting up just a bit later in the fourth quarter and some maintenance that we're
having at our Marlin platform, some unscheduled maintenance. But that gives our current outlook for our oil
production. You can see our unit cost outlook is consistent in the $1.50 range. Operating cash flows at $3 copper would
be $5.8 billion for the year, and our capital expenditures are consistent with our previous estimates.
On a quarter-by-quarter basis, we have the projected sales volumes on page – for the annual – this is the annual. I'm
sorry. I'm a slide ahead of myself. This is the annual sales volumes going from 2013 to 2016. Again, in copper reflects

the adjustment for Candelaria and our most recent outlook for plans at Grasberg, you can see 2016 as we approach the
completion of mining from the pit continues to be a big year. Some of that may go over into 2017 based on the work
that's been done there and you can see the ramp-up in our growth in oil and gas business as well.
Now we get to the quarterly slide that I was talking about earlier, but it shows, again, the adjustments for the year and
gives our quarter-by-quarter projection of our volumes. The site operating costs, unit operating costs that we have by
region is shown on page 27 and shows good performance at each one of our operating sites as well as our sales by
region. That's information for your reference in doing your models.
And on page 28, we have this depiction that we traditionally show, showing the cash-earning capability of our business.
At varying copper prices. We now go from $3 to $4 and show operating cash flows ranging from $9 billion a year to
$12.5 billion a year. Based on previous estimates, we've lowered the by-product prices to $1200 for gold, $10 for moly
and $100 for oil and also reflects the sale of Candelaria and the adjustments of Grasberg's volumes.
Capital expenditures and how they break out between oil and gas, major mining projects and sustaining capital for
mining shows the completion of the Cerro Verde project in 2015 and the drop-off of capital spending as a result of that.
We remain committed to balance sheet management. We recognize that our long-term plans for developing our
resource base can best be accomplished if we have a strong balance sheet. We're currently financially strong, with an
investment-grade rating and our recent meetings with the credit rating agencies have been positive. We have acted in
response to lower commodity prices to sell assets. We had a positive transaction with our Eagle Ford sale, and now,
we've sold Candelaria.
We're continuing to look at other types of transactions to generate cash for balance sheet management, lower
commodity prices, and with the situation in the non-investment-grade credit markets, those kinds of transactions are
currently more challenging, but we're going to be creative. We're going to find ways of looking at the timing of our
spending. We're looking at partnership arrangements that may give us a chance to share costs with others on attractive
basis. And we're looking at the potential for selling assets in a creative way.
We've had a long history of adjusting our business to varying markets, and we're prepared to do this now. We're
looking at our balance sheet and how best to structure it for the long term. So this is still a work in progress. What we
want to communicate today to our shareholders is that as a management team, as a board, we remain committed to this
process of reaching a strong balance sheet to support the long-term development of our resource base in the type of
businesses that we're in.
So that is our update of where we stand right now. We know you have a lot of questions. And Jim Bob, Jim and I,
Kathleen and our team are here prepared to respond to them.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hey, Curt.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: I just wanted to drill down more into the capital allocation for the company going forward.
Obviously this year, there's been pretty significant shifts both in terms of monetizing some of the copper and oil assets

and then reinvesting in the Deepwater. So could you just comment on, do you continue to expect to pursue more
bolt-on acquisitions in the Deepwater? And does the recent decline in the oil price change any thinking regarding
exploration spending and/or potentially what you'd want to do with California?
<A - James C. Flores>: Okay. Curt, this is Jim. I'll let Richard clean it up from there. The aspect of our spending –
we're spending a minimal amount of exploration spending in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of it's development and
exploitation spending around our facility. So as far as exploration, there won't be really any change because not much
of it's been done. We are obligated to drill one well in Morocco on the exploration front. That's on the international
side, if you want to call that the Deepwater aspect.
The bolt-on acquisitions and so forth, the market – I think it's going to continue to be there from a seller's perspective.
Our needs, when you look at our portfolio on page 20, we have a tremendous portfolio. I'm sure we'll buy a few leases
in the March lease sale coming up. I don't forecast as active of year as we had this year even though there'll be
opportunity. We just, we don't have the need.
As far as California and thinking about that as a monetization asset, because of the flat production curve and growth, I
think it falls in the area where Richard talked about, where the creativity and so forth, we still have partnership
concepts and ways to do that. It's a tremendous asset to finance and we're working on something – a project like that
with partners to see. Obviously, the market volatility, we're not rushing out to price something in this type of market.
We want to see where things stabilize and we have probably a little more constructive outlook on commodity prices
than the banks at this point in time.
They've been calling for $80 oil for three years, and so they've finally got it and now they're calling for $70 oil. So we
see demand around the world and we have a pretty good look at it as continuing to be healthy. There's a lot of financial
noise in the markets right now, and all this will calm down and we'll get back to business as usual, maybe as early as
the first half of next year or maybe take a little longer, but we don't think so.
So, we continue to have that, I guess, arrow in the quiver and we're talking about we want to do something that works –
that's very smart and value creative for the FCX stakeholders and so that's more of our dry powder. But as far as
rotating into more of Deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, we'll probably be developing those with a drill bit on our own
properties versus third parties at this point in time.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay, that's great. And then, just a follow-up on the sulfide projects, Richard. Can you give
us a sense for how the capital costs, per se, a pound of capacity would look compared to some of the recent brownfield
expansions that you've been doing?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: You know, Curt, that's – I'm always reluctant to use averages because we are assessing
these projects based on the individual economics of each property. The nature of the properties are similar though in
that the available sulfide projects that we have to work with are these large, low-grade deposits. And we are looking at
the individual aspects of what it takes to develop them. In other words, if we compare an El Abra with our Bagdad
mine.
And when we look longer range at Morenci and Lone Star, all of those things have attributes for development,
permitting water access, power, that vary significantly. So we match those up. We eliminate projects that don't fit in the
portfolio, don't have good rates of return, or ones that we that are not impactful, or ones that we couldn't fit in a way we
manage variations in prices over time. So it's a real detailed dynamic study of what to do. And then we look at
execution risk. Which ones can be approached and achieved with the least amount of risk in terms of engineering
design, tailings management? It's a very dynamic kind of project. So we can give you averages, but that's not really the
way we look at.
You look at the Morenci project that we just completed, that we're ramping up now. Here we added a modern
high-pressure grinding roll mill, goes along a 1940s area mill. We're taking material that we were wasting and now
we're finding a way to economically process it. That's a lot different situation than Cerro Verde where we're basically
tripling where we had an existing site, we developed an innovative approach with the wastewater system for the city of
Arequipa to give us water. We had about as straightforward a building site as you can have in this industry. And we had

technology that we'd just put in place when we started the project. And so, we're tripling that. And that gave us the
opportunity to go for that.
So, as I said, what I'm looking forward to is having a day where we can bring a group of investors here in and go into
some detail as to the process we go through in analyzing these things. The issue is, and this is the reason that the
outlook for copper price is so good, in situations that we have, where we have the resource, we have the ability to do it
and want to do it as fast as we can, we're talking 10 years, plus or minus. And that's what's so supportive of prices. Now
if you're talking about a greenfield project, you can just see. Just watch those that are going on around the world. And
that's why I say when we're looking at markets, that's really supportive of the copper price. And grades are falling,
mines are having to go underground, Codelco's having to deal with its social issues. That's why we think it's a great
business.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: No question. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Hi, guys. I'd like to get started with the $12
billion in net debt target that you had set for 2016. With the presumption that the California sale at current oil prices
doesn't make sense, would you be willing to be flexible with that because 2016 appears to be a pretty good year for
production from your projects? And in addition to that, noticed that you have been continuing to buy back high-cost
debt, which makes absolute sense to me. So could you just provide more color around that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, when we set the $12 billion target, it was just following the announcement of the
acquisition of the oil and gas business. And we have faced some headwinds since that initial analysis, with lower
commodity prices, with the interruption of production in Indonesia, and that's led us to find ways of selling assets and
establishing our business. We're going to continue to do that. We are looking at capital spending. One of the attractive
things in the oil and gas business is it is a business that has a great, more financial flexibility than the mining business.
Once we start spending on a mine like Cerro Verde, it's very difficult to pull the plug. So it gives the opportunity for
partner arrangements that could help us for timing of spending, for selling partial interests.
And so, we're going through all of our business, looking at all of our capital spending, seeing what we can defer, how
we can deal with it, how we can generate cash. And we are going to be committed to reaching this strong balance sheet
target. All of you run your models and many of you said, Richard, my model shows it's going to be tough for you to get
to $12 billion by 2016. You're right, by the way. Does that mean we're going to change our focus on getting to a strong
balance sheet? None of us know what commodity prices are going to be in 2015-2016. We have a great set of flexible
assets.
We're all very confident we're going to reach the goal of having the kind of balance sheet that most of you as investors
are encouraging us to get to, and we're going to work diligently to try to get there, while we work to keep our
production volumes up, execute, deal with our issues in Indonesia, deal with our long-term growth plans, be disciplined
about how we spend capital over the long range – and so we're going to deal with it.
<A - James C. Flores>: And Richard, just to add one thing. Oscar, this is Jim. You mentioned the California sale.
Remember, we have a very strong hedge book on the oil from the standpoint of looking from where commodity prices
are now and what the current financial community's outlook for it is through 2015. So that gives us a bridge to still be
strongly considering a transaction involving California that is, like I said, accretive to the stakeholders of Freeport. So
we're in a unique position there to carry over some of those hedges and floors.
So I would not take that off the table at this point in time as part of our flexibility and bullets toward getting to the goals
that Richard outlined because we're all committed across the board to making sure of that because we're talking about a
business that lasts, as Richard said, for decades and 100-years-type reserves. So it's – the quicker we get to a balance
sheet that we're proud of and that we feel like is going to give us the flexibility to accelerate the growth, the faster we'll

all be happier around here, so, if that helps you.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Yeah. No. That's great. That is, from my perspective, you already have a strong balance sheet.
Then if I may, a second question with regard to Grasberg. We can't help but notice the agreement that Vale reached in
their Indonesian nickel operations ahead of the President taking office. And I understand it's a difficult situation, but I
was just wondering if you could just compare and contrast your situation with that of Vale because it seemed that they
got an extension to the Contract of Work that they didn't have before. And in addition to that, it changes based on what
they press release that they can go directly to the Indonesian Stock Exchange to dispose of 20% of the stake they need
to do.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Well Oscar, let me say first of all, it's going to be a limited amount that I want
to say about another company. You need to, Vale will explain their situation. But a key thing to remember for all of
you who are looking at our situation in Indonesia is that all of these contracts are different. They were signed at
different times. Vale's operations, like Freeport's, go back, ours go back to the 1970s. Theirs go back, at least to the 80s.
And so where they ended up – where we ended up with was contracts that had historical legacies and that have
significantly different terms going into this process. For whatever reason, for some reason, the Indonesian government
has elected to treat nickel and copper differently. Vale produces an intermediate product called nickel matte, which
represents 80% of the value of refined nickel. That product is allowed to be exported under Indonesian regulations
without any restrictions, without any duty.
We produce a product called copper concentrate that is worth 90% plus, 90% to 95% of the value of refined copper and
yet it's treated essentially as an ore and we're subject to these restrictions. I don't have an answer for that. But Vale's
contract, according to their press reports, did not have legally the same degree of assurance in the contract about the
rights to extend. Legally, our Contract of Work has very strong provisions that gives us the right for extensions from
2021 to 2041.
Vale's contract extended to 2025 and did not have those same kinds of legal provisions. They reached some agreement
with the Indonesian government. We're not sure of the details, but it allows them to continue to operate under a
business license approach. And typically under a business license, you have the right to operate, but you're subject to
prevailing laws and regulations that can be changed.
We're working with the government, and it was acknowledged in our MOU, with a need for us to have assurance about
the terms of our operations beyond 2021 about our rights to operate, fiscal terms, legal enforceability because we're
spending so much capital now, between now and 2021 that won't be produced until after 2021. 75% of our reserves are
produced after 2021. So, we have to be in a position of saying we'll spend this money. We've agreed to work with them
on their smelter, but provided we have assurance of terms beyond 2021. Vale's situation is different and I don't know
enough about it really to give you a detailed comparison, and in any event, I don't want to talk about another company.
But our situation is just what I've described.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: That was great, Richard. That was exactly what I was looking for. Thank you very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Ash Lazenby with HSBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ashleigh J. Lazenby>: Yes. Good morning, all. Just a couple of questions. Just if you could possibly expand a bit
more and you commented about the hedge book for next year, if you do give us an idea of how significant the volumes
are and the sort of prices and to the extent that you can disclose that?
And then secondly, just a point of clarification in terms of the CapEx and on oil, the $3.5 billion to $4 billion. How can
we think about that in terms of flexibility? For example, if the oil price wasn't to recover from these sorts of levels, how
much sort of flexibility do you have within those CapEx figures where you could potentially rein in some of them, free

up some more and then boost the free cash flow generation? And what would that be in terms of a – to the detriment of
any of sort of production that you've currently got in the profile? Thank you.
<A - James C. Flores>: Ash, two part. On page 35 in our presentation, Kathleen can take us through it later, but page
35 has got a detail on all of our volumes. And we have 83 million barrels a day with a hedge profile I talked about in
2014, 107 million in 2015, so a significant portion I think – all of our California volumes just to do a transaction. So
page 35 will help you there.
As far as flexibility in CapEx, there's a couple of different ways to do it, right? There's – you can just reduce activity,
but in spite of the flexibility that the oil and gas business has, we do have significant relationships and contracts with
drill ships in the Gulf of Mexico. You got to plan your business much further ahead due to the regulations today and go
through all that regulatory process of permitting that causes a little lengthier situation. I think the easiest or the best way
to do it is start looking at the longer-dated projects and develop joint venture relationships and basically bring in
partners to share the spending.
And that's something we've been active in doing for the past several months and are going to continue to have those
discussions, mainly out of solicitations from investors to us versus us really reaching out to other investors. So we're
ramping up those activities to make sure that we continue to maintain a front-end loaded development activity versus
doing too much drilling for the future, while even though it's development during any kind of period of constrained
commodity prices.
So we're looking at building that flexibility and I think you'll see the realization of it in the second half of 2015 if we're
able to be successful there. I think in the first half of 2015, you would look at rationalization of assets like California. In
the second half, you look at the realization of joint ventures reducing CapEx. And we're going to proceed to have that
flexibility in our program irrespective to where prices are if it makes sense.
<Q - Ashleigh J. Lazenby>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please
go ahead.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I was taking a look at the commodity prices
on December 5, 2012, when you announced the oil and gas acquisitions versus yesterday, and it implies about $2.8
billion a year less, after-tax cash flow. It would seem as though some of the CapEx is more, things like the smelter in
Indonesia came up but that's small and some of the CapEx that's a large project in midstream, it's hard to change like
the Cerro Verde mill once you started. Given the decline in cash flow, what are the levers of spending they can turn
off? And would it be less damaging to just omit the dividend as opposed to cutting off these oil and gas projects when
they're permitted or the Peruvian CapEx in midstream and you've got probably some regulatory CapEx for pollution
control. And I know it's very complicated. It's a terrible question to ask, but the reality is that the markets are the
markets.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Right. Well, John, you're exactly right. And that's what we've been dealing with. As this
situation has unfolded with the lowering of commodity prices, with the interruption we had in Indonesia, we've been
taking steps all along. In our Mining business, we scrutinized spending to defer, delay spending all along. So – and
we've done that in oil and gas and we're going to continue to do it. We're not in a 2008 crisis mode. Oscar made the
point, thank you, Oscar, for saying that at the end of his – after we answered his questions, we've got a strong balance
sheet.
We're an investment-grade rated company right now. We've had very positive discussions with the agencies. And so,
the issue of having to take the draconian steps that we took in the fall of 2008, where I came back from LME, we called
our team together and said we're stopping spending right then. We stopped Climax, we stopped the spending on Cerro
Verde, which was an earlier stage on Morenci. We just stopped all the projects. We cut the dividend. We even raised a

little capital if you recall.
We're not like that now. We don't have to go through that kind of analysis. But what we want our shareholders to
understand is we've got this commitment to work to strengthen our balance sheet in a rational way. We're not going to
fire-sell assets. We don't have to. We're going to find ways, we're going to look at all of our capital spending, see if
things can be deferred with that – of where we're honoring our contracts to spend, where we're doing what we need to
do. This is not something we're wringing our hands about here. We can manage our way through this and preserve our
long-term growth. We're not having any discussions about cutting the dividend. We're just talking about managing our
business, and we've got the assets, the balance sheet and the way to do it and we're going to do it in a way that, John,
you're going to be happy with and we're going to be happy with.
<A - James C. Flores>: Yes, John, this is Jim. There's no well that's important enough to drill before paying the
dividend, on the oil and gas side, that can't be drilled later or that type of thing, just because the structure of our
business, as Richard talked about from the mining aspect. They're very correlative on both sides and I think what's
trying to impress everybody about this company is that we're not only trying to put our business in great shape for the
future, put it in great shape for the present, at the same point in time, increase our flexibility by paying our debt all at
the same time.
Is that hard to do? Yes, we all acknowledge that. But that's the kind of goals and realizations that our board expects and
we're proud of the flexibility of our business to be able to even discuss and propose it. We've made some progress this
year with Candelaria and the Eagle Ford sale and we've got more progress to do. So, we're all on the same board and I
think it would be beneficial to the shareholders, irrespective of where commodity prices go and that's what our job is.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you. I'm a shareholder.
<A - James C. Flores>: Thanks, John.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: So are we, John.

Your next question will come from the line of Leigh Goehring with Chilton. Please go ahead.
<Q - Leigh R. Goehring>: Yes, Rich, just two questions. First is that a lot of the chatter regarding the copper tied up in
financing deals in China has died down and I was wondering if you had any comment on that? And second, this is the
first time I've heard you talk of Serbia, and I'm very curious about where that project lies as far as in your priority of
your capital investments and new projects going forward between now and 2020? And I've been to that property, so it's
very interesting.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. I knew you'd been there, Leigh. Great hearing from you. It's been a long time since
we've seen each other. This financing deal in China has always been murky as to what it meant. They had this
fraudulent situation develop at the port that for a brief period of time really raised everybody's concern.
You know, Leigh, we've talked about over the years at any point in time in China, there's always some story about
things that could be happening. And I've got to tell you, I don't know all the details of the financing scheme, but when I
look at this, the size of the Chinese economy and the amount of money that's being spent on development even in this
lower growth situation and thinking about all they have to do to meet their development goals for the interior and what
State Grid is facing, not this year or next year, but over a 20-year period in terms of development and how much copper
that involves. I've got to tell you I think a lot of these stories about inventories at any point in time, financing deals are
side shows that are probably really meaningful for companies that are traders, companies that have to make short-term
decisions about what to do with copper stocks and buying and selling. For companies like ours, we're again, focused on
the longer-term situation.
Just like you, as investors, often have to be more concerned about short-term movements as to how you realign your
portfolios. We understand that. But if we ever were to let short-term deals affect the way we run this business, then

we're going to miss out on some huge opportunities because of the time it takes to get projects ready to go.
Now Serbia, there's nothing in the natural resource business like greenfield exploration, I mean, nothing. The idea of
making some investments in exploration and finding a new asset and creating a huge value, that's the happiest day you
can have in a company like ours. And, you know, in the oil and gas business it happens a lot more frequently than it
does in the mining business, and that's again what's so supportive about prices. You go back and you think what are the
big success stories during my long career in the mining business for greenfield exploration. There are few and far
between, few and far between. We have an active program, [ph] Rich Lovell (01:15:57) and Jim Bob work with and we
fund junior mining companies around the world on exploration concepts that have the potential to be big. We don't look
at anything unless it has the potential to be big. So that's why you haven't heard much from us about this program.
This does. This has that potential. You've been there. There's been some real exciting core holes that have been drilled.
A lot of work needs to be done. It's in an area that's a traditional mining area. The government of Serbia is very anxious
to see us come in and invest. The current status is we're not actively drilling now. We're working on partnership
arrangements with our partner there. I saw them briefly in London when I was there last week. And we're excited about
it, but it's longer term, a lot of work to be done, but it is a greenfield project that if it is successful, could add a lot of
value to our company.

Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Good morning. I have a question about the water rates flowing through on this recent test. I
would presume that what you haven't said straight out is you have solved the problem of how to perforate these wells
now, and whether we're getting out hydrocarbons in commercial quantities is less significant in a way than all the
problems that we had at Davy Jones No. 1. So, my question is am I correct in surmising that, that the guns are now
working and the ability to perforate at these depths is now perfected? And would that mean that would you ever go
back to Davy Jones No. 1? What does this imply for Davy Jones No. 2? And can you elaborate a little on whatever the
problems were you had at Highlander?
<A - James C. Flores>: Joan, this is Jim. That's a possibility. The other possibility is the reservoirs are different and
the porosities and permeabilities were better at Davy Jones No. 2 versus Davy Jones No. 1. When we're in the business
of producing saltwater versus oil and gas, it's scientific, but as far as economic and financial, all eyes are on
Highlander. That's where we have even better porosity and permeability, and core evidence and log evidence of
hydrocarbon accumulation, so that's where we're focused.
The delays at Highlander were strictly oilfield related, equipment that failed that we had to retrieve out of the hole, and
it just put us behind schedule, but we think we're getting closer and closer to the development tests there. We've got a
little more work to do out there, and feel like here in the fourth quarter we'll be able to get a test at Highlander and put
it into sales very quickly once it happens. So that's what we're focused on. We're really just updating everybody over
the operational results of those existing well bores for McMoRan.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Well, I know you're not in the business of producing water, but I'm asking – it's a more
specific question, which is...
<A - James C. Flores>: And, Joan, I said that is a possibility. But there's also another possibility.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: What possibility?
<A - James C. Flores>: The possibility is that it was purely mechanical with the perforating guns. But the other
possibility, more likely possibility, is just different reservoir characteristics. So, I know I'm answering your question

with two answers and either one of them are a possibility. It could be that reservoir characteristics have changed or the
mechanical aspects of the guns. I happen to think and our guys happen to think it's the reservoir characteristics but the
guns are an issue. But at the end of the day, we're focused on Highlander and perfecting the flow rates of gas and oil
there and that's where we're concentrating.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Okay. So you will not say that the guns are now working?
<A - James C. Flores>: They've always worked.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Well, there's some question about that, but okay, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Yes, thanks. I just had a question on your hedging portfolio on oil and gas. I know you commented
on that being an asset possibly in the divestiture of California. Is there any plans to add to that portfolio because I know
it was acquired with the Plains Exploration and since I don't think you guys have added to it at all?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Steve, this is Kathleen. No, we have not added to the positions. PXP had positions going
into the deal which will benefit us during this period of time. We continue to monitor markets and look at how a
hedging program might fit in with our overall plans and capital spending, but at this point in time, with these markets,
we're not looking to add to positions, but it's something that we'll continue to evaluate over time in the future.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Okay. Thanks. And then...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Steve, I just might note too, you know, company situation is different than Plains and
FCX. We have a broader set of assets, a stronger balance sheet. We're also short oil in a lot of our businesses. It's kind
of difficult to match it all up piece by piece, but we're a big energy user. Energy is 20% to 25% of our cost. It's from a
variety of sources in our mining business: natural gas, hydro, but oil's a component of it. So when we step back and
look at the overall business in terms of what our financial strategy should be, it's a different circumstance than having
independent oil and gas company like Plains was.
<A - James C. Flores>: Steve, this is Jim. I would just highlight, it gives us a lot of flexibility during this period of
time that other people do not have when it comes to valuations and financial flexibility of financing deals with
California. So that's unique to us and unique to our situation.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes.
<Q - Steve Bristo>: Okay, thanks. And then just on the debt target, it came up earlier about the $12 billion net debt
target by 2016, but it sounded like you're sort of shying away from that and the new target is just a strong balance sheet
without a certain number around that. Is that correct in assuming that's what you're sort of leading into?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Look, all I'm acknowledging – let me just say I'm acknowledging is we have a target and
we're working to get that, but never anything magic about that target. We wanted just to be as clear as we could to the
marketplace at the time about trying to make it. It would be unrealistic of me to sit here and look at these circumstances
and what we're dealing with and say, if I've got $12 billion it's $12 billion. We're going to continue to work towards it.
We're going to work to have a strong balance sheet, we're going to look at the time of when we can get there, and I'm
just being realistic more than not being realistic.
<A - James C. Flores>: And, Steve, the key about it is really the discipline it brings into all the spending, all our
business, it sure keeps everybody focused on creating value. So it's been a beacon that's been endorsed by the board and
so we'll continue to focus on it.

Our last question comes from the line of Wilfredo Ortiz with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wilfredo Ortiz>: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on your volume guidance for copper for
the fourth quarter. Does this include any type of impact if a strike at Grasberg were to take place? And if it does take
place, would it impact the whole operation or just partially a portion of the operation? Just wanted to get a sense as to
what we're seeing as far as the guidance versus what could potentially happen if a strike does ensue post November 6?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The answer is it does not include any impacts of any kind of potential work disruptions,
strikes or otherwise. And there's no real clear answer to your question. As I said, as we speak now, there's a group of
workers primarily in the Grasberg open pit who are not reporting to work. That's in violation of our Collective Labor
Agreement. The work continues at our DOZ mine, in our underground development, in mill operations and so forth.
So we're just going to have to work through this. It's unclear even if the union were to declare a strike, to what extent
would the workforce respond to that? It's a dynamic situation with a lot of interest represented even within the union,
and so we're going to deal with it. Could have an impact. That impact's not reflected in any of our numbers. And one
thing you can be sure of in Indonesia, you've got a real-time news flow coming your way because whatever the union
does is in the paper every day and we're going to be active in our communications efforts to make sure the market's
aware of what the circumstance is.
<Q - Wilfredo Ortiz>: Understood. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Thank you, Wilfredo.

Now we will return the call over to management for any closing remarks.
