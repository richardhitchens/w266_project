Annual Report on Form 10-K for our year ended December 2012.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it
relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, and global core excess. And
you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor
Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group,

Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks, everyone, for dialing in today. I'll walk you through our first quarter results and then take
your questions. Net revenues were $10.1 billion, net earnings $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.29, and
our annualized return on common equity was 12.4%; overall, a solid result.
As we've talked about in the past, client activity levels are generally correlated to the broader macroeconomic
environment. This certainly proved to be true in the first quarter as activity levels were mixed as the quarter progressed.
Early in the quarter, continued positive developments in the U.S. economy, specifically in housing and unemployment,
drove increased client activity and greater risk appetite. In January, U.S. new home sales grew by almost 15%
month-over-month, one of the largest month-over-month increases in the last two decades. The U.S. nonfarm payroll
report for February came in significantly higher than expectations with 236,000 jobs created, versus expectations of
160,000. In addition to driving increased client activity and risk appetite, these economic developments help support
rising asset values. Most notably, the S&P 500 was up by 10% in key credit indices, such as the LCDX and High Yield
CDX reached higher by more than 50 basis points.
This created a backdrop for generally improved liquidity and a more favorable environment for managing client flows.
However, later in the quarter, market sentiment was mixed as political uncertainty in Europe and the U.S. began to
resurface. The Italian election and the situation in Cyprus added further complexity to the European outlook.
Specifically, it's events like these that create uncertainty for market participants who struggle to understand the
mechanism and approach for resolving sovereign issues within the eurozone. Likewise in the U.S., our clients focused
on the potential negative impact of sequestration and the continued impasse related to budget negotiations.
In aggregate, as the quarter progressed, these concerns impacted both client activity and risk appetite. Client activity
levels were mixed across our Investment Banking businesses during the quarter. Debt underwriting activity continued
at the robust pace we experienced in the fourth quarter as corporate issuers took advantage of a low interest rate
environment and strong investor demand. Equity underwriting activity improved sequentially with higher issuance
activity but is still relatively muted by historic standards. And, announced M&A volumes were down 37% sequentially.
Macroeconomic uncertainty has been an understandable and consistent theme following the onset of the financial crisis
and has quite naturally led many of our clients to approach strategic decisions with greater caution. As CEO confidence
is such an important input to M&A and IPO activity, continued improvement in the macro environment will be a key
driver of opportunity in these businesses. Regardless of the macro uncertainty, our people remain focused on serving
our clients by providing them with superior advice and execution and, of course, the capital necessary to meet their
goals.
I'll now run through each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up
12% from the fourth quarter. First quarter Advisory revenues were $484 million, down 5% sequentially. Year-to-date,
Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide completed M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that
closed in the first quarter including the SEK21-billion sale of Ahold's stake in ICA to Hakon Invest, the $3.3-billion
sale of select Supervalu assets to an investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management, and the $2.4-billion sale of
McGraw-Hill Education to Apollo.

We were also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. These include the $23.3-billion sale of
Virgin Media to Liberty Global, the $6.7-billion sale of Repsol's liquefied natural gas assets to Royal Dutch Shell, and
the $2.6-billion acquisition by Orix Corporation of a 90% equity stake in Robeco Group.
First quarter underwriting net revenues were $1.1 billion, up 21% sequentially, a record debt underwriting quarter, with
revenues up 17% to $694 million. In particular, this reflects significantly higher net revenues from leveraged finance
and commercial mortgage related activity. Equity underwriting revenues of $390 million were up 28% from the fourth
quarter, reflecting an increase in IPO activity and secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in
global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.
During the first quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions: Sinopec's $3.1-billion private placement,
ArcelorMittal's $4-billion dual-tranche equity and mandatory convertible offering, and Intelsat's $3.5-billion high-yield
offering. Our Investment Banking backlog declined modestly from yearend levels.
Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services. Total net revenues were $5.1 billion in the first quarter. These
businesses produced stronger results in the seasonally weak fourth quarter, driven by an overall improvement in
activity levels and market sentiment. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $3.2 billion in the first quarter,
significantly better than the fourth quarter. This quarter's results reflected a broad contribution across businesses.
Rates reflected generally higher activity levels as clients reacted to the improved economic outlook at the beginning of
the quarter. Our credit business experienced solid client activity and a favorable market environment, with strong
issuance trends and generally tighter credit spreads. Mortgages continued to benefit from strong client demand,
relatively limited new supply, and improving prices. Our Currency business reflected higher levels of client activity.
And, finally, Commodity results improved from what was a relatively weak fourth quarter.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.9 billion. Excluding the $500-million gain from the sale
of our hedge fund administration business in the fourth quarter, results were up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client
execution revenues were $809 million, up 6% sequentially. Commissions and fees were $793 million, up 10% from the
fourth quarter on improved market volumes and generally higher market values in Europe and Asia. Excluding the
one-time gain in the fourth quarter, securities services net revenues of $320 million were roughly flat sequentially.
With respect to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $76 million, consistent with fourth quarter levels.
Let me now review Investing & Lending. We produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter. Investing &
Lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds as well as lending activities. These activities occur
across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt. Other equity investments generated net
revenues of $1.1 billion, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments. This strong performance reflects
higher global equity prices during the quarter as well as increases in fair value, driven by company-specific events.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $566 million, driven by continued tightening of credit spreads as well
as interest income. Our investment in ICBC produced a $24-million gain in the quarter. Other revenues of $375 million
were driven by the firm's consolidated investment entities.
Switching over to Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, down 13% from the
fourth quarter due to lower incentive fees. Management and other fees were consistent with the fourth quarter at $1.1
billion. During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $3 billion to $968 billion, primarily reflecting net
market appreciation and net inflows in both fixed income and equity assets, partially offset by outflows in money
market assets.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a
compensation-to-net-revenue ratio of 43% which is 100 basis points lower than the firm's accrual in the first quarter of
2011 and 2012.
Over the past two years, we have focused extensively on cost reduction and efficiency efforts. And, from a head count
perspective, total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 32,000, down 1% from the end of 2012 and

10% from yearend 2010.
First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter, due largely to
lower other expenses. In the fourth quarter, other expenses included higher litigation and regulatory expenses and
higher charitable contributions. Non-comp expenses were essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2012, and our
effective tax rate was 33% for the first quarter.
In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover with you. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.1 million
shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2012 capital
plan. We also recently amended the terms of our warrant agreement with Berkshire Hathaway to require net share
settlement on October 1st of this year.
At the end of the first quarter, our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 12.7%. This includes the revised
market risk framework that became effective on January 1st. Our estimated Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio was
approximately 9%, of course with all the caveats that the rule has not been finalized.
During the first quarter, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our proposed capital actions, but as
required by the Federal Reserve, we will resubmit our capital plan by the end of the third quarter, incorporating certain
enhancements to our stress test processes. We intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve to implement these
enhancements.
Before I take questions, let me close with a few summary thoughts. As I mentioned earlier, macro uncertainty continues
to be a meaningful consideration for the global marketplace. While the environment is slowly improving, there will
clearly be bumps along the way, so despite an improvement in the outlook, some uncertainty remains.
Another uncertainty that has occupied investors' minds is the potential impact of regulatory reform on our industry.
While everyone would like clarity, it's natural for these rules to be developed over multiyear time frames, especially
given the complexity and the potentially significant ramifications for the global economy. As a firm, we remain a
constructive participant in these discussions. We understand the importance of creating a safe financial system while
meeting our client needs and supporting global economic growth at the same time.
In light of the continued macro uncertainty, we've continued to stay focused on managing the firm's risk exposures,
capital usage, and our expense base. It has allowed our people to be principally focused on serving our clients. We
believe the combination of our operating discipline and our steady investment in our client franchise has us well
positioned competitively. In addition, it has provided the firm with the opportunity to generate significant operating
leverage as the environment improves. Regardless of the operating environment, we will continue to rely on the
strength of our client relationships, the diversity of our businesses, the caliber of our people, and the adaptability
embedded in our culture to deliver superior results for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I am now happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hello?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hello, yes.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi, Harvey. I was hoping to get your takeaways on the 2013 CCAR now that it's all said and
done. There were some disparity on the PPNR and stress ratios between you and the Fed and I was just wondering how
that impacts your view on capital planning or running that process internally if it does at all?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So when we think about capital planning, obviously first and foremost, Howard, we think
about making sure that we strike that careful balance between making sure that we have capital from a defensive
perspective, but also, we want to be positioned for the opportunities for our clients and so that's how – and we manage
that process, obviously, dynamically as we go through. Specifically with respect to the CCAR, what I would say is we
don't have visibility into their numbers so I really can't comment to any extent on the differences between our
submission. And, when go through our submission, we think about the events and we approach it from a very
conservative framework. Did I answer your question, Howard?
Operator
Okay. And we'll move on to the next question. It's from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Glenn. How are you?
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right. Curious, with the market up so much and sluggish revenue backdrop across industries
and everything that we know about balance sheets and sheet debt, normally this would be a pretty good world for
M&A, but of course, there is some bigger overhangs out there. Just – I'm just curious to see what you're seeing. You
made a comment about pipelines but as a general comment, as you look out the next year plus, why don't we have a
better M&A backdrop – I mean, the backdrop is good. Why isn't there better M&A activity?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think and I highlighted in my prepared remarks, I really think it's a question of we're
very close still to the epicenter of the crisis, at least in the context of history, right? And so people's memories are very
fresh. And, when you have periods of uncertainty and, as I said bumps along the way like events in Europe or big shifts
in employment data and economic growth, it doesn't translate well when you think about CEOs who are making what
obviously is the most significant decision they're making for their organizations strategically. And so I think it's going
to be a bit of a lagging indicator because it'll be one of those things that, when we really have stability and confidence,
you'll start to see it come out of the pipeline. Having said that, obviously, we feel really good about our position
competitively in our M&A franchise and it really is just a question of when activity picks up.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: But I wish I could tell you when.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No, I hear you. Investing & Lending, is there anything you could tell us in terms of much
realized this quarter? Markets were up huge so I would imagine that there were some gains along the way but a lot of
that is marks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It really was in line with broad equity markets. So in the past we pointed you to the
MSCI and so there are going to be periods where we, obviously, outperform that because of the idiosyncratic nature of
the portfolio and periods where we under-perform but more or less in line.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: And you still – there is a decent private component to it so I am assuming that there are still
some big liquidity discounts used on the private positions?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I don't know that I'd say – I don't want to be careful about the word liquidity discounts.
What I'd say is that we're, as you would expect us to be, very thorough in terms of how we mark the portfolio and – as
well as our auditors. So, yeah, these things will be in line with the market as appropriate.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Understood. And then in Commodities, I get the component of the business that would be weak
due to just trending lower prices and less structured transactions. Is there anything on the regulatory front that's
changing how you do business, how you think about the business going forward? Or is it strictly a cyclical
phenomenon right now causing the weakness?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there's nothing on the regulatory environment that's impacting the way we think
about the business. Specifically now of course, there are a lot of rules to come and so we'll get more visibility in
Commodities and other of our businesses could be impacted as we see – as we get more transparency. But there's
nothing in the regulatory aspects of it.

Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi. The Volcker Rule presumably getting pushed out further, latest reports are not
until sometime during the second half. How do you view that, good or bad? Bad being the uncertainty lasts longer.
Good is a potentially better outcome.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think in the end it's all about quality of the rulemaking process. These are – and it's not
just Volcker. These are exceptionally complex rules that are obviously incredibly critical not just to the financial
institutions that will live with the rules, but really quite frankly, more broadly in terms of their impact on the capital
markets. And, given the complexity, I think it's quite natural that these are going to take time to implement. And the
regulators themselves, it's a massive amount of work that they have to go through to get to a place to introduce these
rules. So I think this process in terms of the time it's taking – I think we'd love to – I think everyone would like to have
the final rule set in front of us. Clients would certainly want that, we would want that, our constituents would want that.
But I think this is very natural and on balance I think it improves the quality of the rulemaking, which to date is what
we've seen, for example, in clearing. I think it's a good thing on balance.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And the BDC you're setting up, is that in any way tied to the view of the
regulatory outcome? It seems like that might be investing in things that SSG does.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, not at all.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Not at all?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's very much just part of our asset management strategy....
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: ...where we're managing assets on behalf of our clients as a fiduciary. We obviously
have, as a core competence, in there credit risk management skills. So no, that has nothing to do with Volcker.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And one other on the reg front, the first phase of the mandatory clearing has
been in effect over a month or so now. Any comment on how that's gone? And specifically, anything you can identify
on activity levels like rates and CDS that's separate from broader market impact?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. As you know, and we talked about this a lot in the past, we're huge proponents of
clearing. And obviously that comes with a caveat – the obvious caveat that as long as it's done safely. But, in terms of a
– as a mitigant to systemic risk, we think it ranks quite highly and so we've been a huge proponent of it. I think just –
getting back to your earlier question, I think in terms of things that were delayed I actually think the delay here was
quite thoughtful and I think the CFTC in their rollout plan, by having the first rollout in March, the second wave in
June, I think that's a very constructive way to approach the market because it gives clients an opportunity, particularly
the second wave of clients, not the most frequent users, an opportunity to adjust. And they have a lot of work to do.
There are workflow issues, processes, et cetera, that go into this. And so I think it's been thoughtful. With respect to
impact on business activity, et cetera, I do think this is one of these things that, as we get more clarity, it definitely

provides people the rules so they can operate in; they are more willing to engage. But it's way too early to measure the
impact.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Just lastly inventory levels across FICC, I think they were higher in the first
quarter. Did they end around the average of the quarter, any trends coming into this 2Q?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I didn't hear the very first part of what you said. Did you say inventory or activity?
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: The inventory – no, inventory levels.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, no big trends, nothing meaningful in terms of inventory.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay, all right. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Roger.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks. Just on the OTC side, just given that we're starting down that process, if you think
about the different users in the market so like corporates, pensions, asset managers, hedge funds and if you look at the
increased margin requirement, when they're thinking about alternatives, meaning using a future versus an OTC
contract, is there something that Goldman or the dealers – particularly on that margin disadvantage, is there something
that you can provide to make that less of an issue so maybe like on the collateral management side? Just trying to figure
out because it seems like there's going be some users that – there'll be more incentive to try to use an alternative if they
don't have their hurdles like hedge accounting. But I don't know if on the dealer side if there's something that you can
provide to ease that burden.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I think that when – first of all, I would say the following. We, in the industry, have
lived with uneven requirements in terms of whether it's margin or capital standards and so some of these things are
going to exist. I think as we get the full view of everything that's out there I think that the regulatory community and all
of us as participants will then have to view the extent to which there's differences and understand whether or not those
incentives are actually the right incentives in terms of reducing systemic risk because, remember, the overarching
objective here is to reduce systemic risk. And that – again, I'd go back to my earlier comment about clearing. So you
don't necessarily want to have significantly different collateral requirements for essentially the same type of risk
because then you can get some unwanted incentives. Now having said that, putting that aside for a moment, our clients
are driven by their long-term incentive goals. So they're going to make the best choice they can for executing and at
times collateral may be a more significant component of their thought process; other times, other issues will guide how
they execute.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And then just on the market share opportunity, there is a lot
of stuff that's shifting around, whether it's the increased cost of regulation on the Fixed Income side, you guys –
different rules on comp coming out of Europe, maybe foreign entities in the U.S. having different capital requirements
going forward. But when you guys size up, just given the competitive landscape in the different product areas, how
much market share opportunity do you think is shifting around and potentially up for grabs over the next, call it, one to
two years?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a great question. It's a difficult thing to quantify and so strategically the way we
approach it is making sure that – and let's just take, for example, the securities division. If you think about the diverse
nature of that business and what you really need to be successful in terms of having scale but also an ability to deliver
the full range of services to your clients so whether it's commodities or interest rates or prime brokerage, executing
blocks and equities. So, first of all, you need to be at scale in this market environment because trying to build I think
the headwinds are hard given the activity levels. We feel we are at scale and we feel quite good about our position both
within those individual businesses but of course geographically also. So we'll have to see over the next several years

but it feels like there's reasonable market share opportunity given the environment because, as I said, unless you're a
leader in some of these businesses I think it's a difficult time to build.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple of questions, one on the reinsurance business; you broke that out which is
helpful. Just wanted to understand what kind of impact that has on capital relief when that deal closes?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: The – so in the insurance business we're in the midst of the sale process so if it's okay,
Betsy, I'll come back to you with that when the sale process closes. However, as we go through the new capital rules,
the driver here was, as I mentioned earlier, the amount of capital that business attracts under the new rule set. And so
we like that business but under the new capital rules it's really better held in other people's hands. And so it just felt like
it was appropriate to move forward the sales process but, as it completes, we will certainly update you with more info.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And then you've in the past outlined opportunities for active and passive RWA
mitigation. Is there any changes at all to the outlook over the next year or two?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there are no changes to the outlook. Obviously, we continue to focus on it very
closely and I've talked about the tools that we've been rolling out. That all continues on schedule. So we just continue to
work through the process.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. Because it just looks like maybe there wasn't as much this past quarter as an
average would've suggested. Is that fair or you would...?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I wouldn't necessarily say that but I think it's hard to look at it in a
quarter-over-quarter period. I think we have to look at it over longer periods but we're comfortable with our progress.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Sure, okay. And do you give details just on the numerator, denominator on the Basel 3,
the RWAs, for example?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, we've not.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. If I could follow up with a couple of questions on the Commodities
business. There was a blurb last week that you might be selling the metals warehousing unit and I was just wondering if
there was any comment you could provide on that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, we have no comment, although the only thing I would say that I know when those
things come out and they're picked up in the press they often have knock-on questions that relate to our commitment to
Commodities or anything like that and we got into that business in 1981 and invested a huge amount in being a market
leader so we're very committed to that business.

<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And then just related to just commodities pricing that we've seen in the last couple of days,
obviously a lot of volatility and maybe it's too early to know. But is this potentially good for the business because
maybe volumes increase or bad because there's just too much volatility or, again, maybe too early to know?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, it's definitely too early to know but it's really a question of degree of volatility and
causes. I think some of the volatility we've seen, particularly in Commodities, it looks more like liquidation of crowded
positions so I wouldn't read too much into it. And over time investors will digest the information and then that will
translate into – either into expanded client activity or not. But I think the near-term reaction is what I said, mostly
liquidation.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, some other firms have talked about structured products
being a little bit better in 1Q and I would assume that's somewhat broad-based. But any thoughts on what's driving that?
Is it just as clients look for yield or optimism over the economy or a combination of both?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I can't comment on anything else – any – what the competitors say. What I would
say is that and you certainly see it in terms of yield activity and it was reflected in the quarter with respect to both
issuers – the opportunity issuers have to issue and obviously investor appetite as people search for yield.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Any thoughts on – rates have been so low for so long and obviously it's broadly an area
that's been fairly quiet and it seemed to pick up quite a bit in 1Q. So it just seems like rates have been low for a while. I
don't know if it was a combination of that and the economy or....
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, there's certainly a cycle of reinvestment that's occurring. I think back to last year, at
capital committee we were reviewing financing opportunities for our clients, committing capital, bringing things to
market and many often – many times those same clients were back six, nine months later in a position to refinance
because of the compression of credit spreads and the market appetite. But, if you are asking me when that'll change,
that's a question I definitely don't have a view on and I can guarantee I'd be wrong.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. So your prior ROE target was 20%. You haven't given a new target, I don't think. You were
12% this quarter. Can you just give us some sense of what sort of ROE you guys would hope to have over several
years?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So with respect to the ROE, it's an important question, Mike, and we still just don't have
enough information in terms of capital rules, all the regulatory activity to give you a view. What I will tell you is that
we remain very focused on our returns, both on a relative and an absolute basis and certainly in the way that we're
deploying and managing the balance sheet.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And you said your Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio was about 9%....
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: With your passive strategies, if they were all done today, what would that 9% ratio be?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We haven't updated that, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And I guess I won't get an answer to the active strategy either. I'm just trying to figure out
how much potential there is with both the passives and the active strategies for managing the risk-weighted assets to
create a whole lot more capital because it seems like you're willing to buy-back a lot of stock here. You bought at an

average price of $150, the stock's below there. So why not be even more aggressive I guess?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, with respect to capital – first of all, in terms of the ratio, you're going to see the
work as we do it, so we want to present it to you. I'm not sure there's a whole lot of value in forecasting it. In terms of
how we think about share repurchase and how we're managing the capital dynamically from quarter-to-quarter, we're
going to make adjustments as we work through until – if we think the best use of our capital is to return it and we'll do
that, and if we think it's best deployed in the business, we'll do that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then just lastly a separate question. In terms of right-sizing the business, how do you know
if you've downsized too much, you or your competition? Some are cutting a lot more than others. And how do you
know what's the right amount when you've cut too much?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So that's a great question because if you look back over the past two years, in
some respects, if you knew you were going to end up down 10% in head count, you would've rather done that on day
one, rather than take two years to do it. Okay? [indiscernible] (35:40) we don't have a crystal ball, and this is a really
important strategic point about how we have to think about the business.
First and foremost, we need to be there for our clients in all aspects of our business – investment banking, asset
management, securities division. And so we can't shape the opportunity set. We can only shape how we respond and
compete with other market participants. And so we're constantly reviewing it, and that's why you've seen us take the
steps that you've seen us take. Right now, for the current environment, we feel very comfortable. If the opportunity set
expanded and the environment continue to improve, you could see us deploy more resources and likewise if the
environment was to trend downward, I think you'd see us respond there too of course.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. So I'm looking at your FICC revenues. If I adjust them for DVA
year-over-year and I look at the percentage change, you're down about 9%. And the couple of big peers that have
reported so far are also down but more like mid-single-digits. You've identified the drag on the year-over-year
comparison as being rate product and I would expect that some of those other guys who are more sort of big banks
would have been hit may be more by that just based on mix. Are we still seeing a process of adjustment to your
business mix towards the new regulatory realities? And can you comment maybe on the revenue mix between cash and
derivative instruments on a year-over-year basis?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We don't – those quarter-over-quarter numbers, we don't view those as a big deal. There's
– I don't think there's a lot of information in it. If we were – if the numbers were completely reversed, I wouldn't be
pointing that – I wouldn't be pointing you to that as a material item. There's going to be noise in the numbers back and
forth, and we feel quite comfortable with the position of our FICC business.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: But again, just to probe on that a little bit, you talked before about the opportunity relative to
some of the issues that a lot of the European banks are facing, and I believe that a Goldman Sachs should be able to
actually benefit pretty meaningfully from some of that. Is that something that we're going to see longer term? And
again I'm going to come back to this idea that given that you're seeing some change in the regulatory environment
because of the change in OTC protocols and everything else, are you making changes to your business in the short-term
that are – that are driving short-term revenue contraction and preparing yourself for some of these market share
opportunities longer-term? Or is there something else that I'm kind of missing as I try to figure out what's going on?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So, okay, that's a very important question so I want to make sure I'm clear on this.
So in terms of – again, the quarter-over-quarter, I don't think there's a lot of read through for you there. I think in terms

of the opportunity set as it relates to the regulatory issues, really difficult to speculate on, for example, the impact of
clearing, swap execution facilities, we don't have yet and many of the rules are still outstanding. If you ask me I think
as you get more clarity on rule sets, clients respond well to that.
Now, with respect to how we adjust – and this is a strategic issue, you can – and I covered this, I don't know if you saw,
I covered this a bit at the Credit Suisse Conference back in February, but one of the things that we have now is that
trying to anticipate rules can be quite costly and you can make major mistakes. Mortgage business being a really
concrete example of when you first saw the Notice for Proposed Rulemaking for mortgages a couple years ago versus
responding to final rules. So you're not seeing us dial down or up our businesses in anticipation of rules. With respect to
market share opportunities, those are always, in my experience, multi-year events and they'll play out over time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's actually very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Just a couple if, I guess, relatively quick questions. We've heard from a couple
of your competitors that the client activity levels over the course of the first quarter were sort of strongest in the first,
earlier part of the quarter, weakest perhaps in March. I guess I'm curious given that your assets were up about 11%
quarter-over-quarter but VaR was stable. Can you give us a sense as to sort of what your activity levels were over the
course of the quarter and what the level of, I guess, conversations were in the advisory businesses over the course of the
quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So client activity, as I said in my prepared remarks was – it was more active really in the
first month of the quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March based on just the data that came through. And what
we have seen that clients whether it's in the advisory business or those on the investing side are obviously very
sensitive to data and information. And so, for example, as issues started to come back more onto front screens as it
relates to issues in Europe, clients obviously pulled back towards the end of the quarter. But I would say that overall the
trend, in terms of outlook, feels like it's continuing to improve steady but it's not going to be a straight line from here to
there. And so, our strategy during this time period obviously is to stay extremely focused on our clients. It is an
environment where there's – you can really compete on content with your clients because there is uncertainty that
they're dealing with.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Right. And then just back on – a quick question on I&L. Can you – given the strong
performance of the markets in the quarter, did that incent you to potentially accelerate a bit of your realizations in the
first quarter given the strong performance of the markets? Or was that pretty much at steady-state?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, it's always going to be a function of the market and idiosyncratic events and
obviously I said there's a correlation. But there are things – we don't look opportunistically. And the market will give us
opportunities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And I guess just back to VaR, given the volatility in the markets of Cyprus in March, did that
have a meaningful impact on VaR over the course of the quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. With respect to VaR over the quarter, it was virtually unchanged from the fourth
quarter, where you see...
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: ...the bigger drop is from first quarter last year to this year but that's virtually all driven
by market volatilities.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So quick question on the competition for talent here and maybe potential impact on expense
flexibility. Could you give some color on what you're seeing so far? And maybe were you guys trying to signal
something in that regard with the moderate drop in comp ratio? I know where you guys peg it in the first nine months it
almost turns out to be arbitrary given how big the fourth quarter delta is. But was that something you were trying to get
across?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, in terms of talent, quite frankly, it feels like one of the better market environments
we've seen in quite a long time. Our ability to acquire and add people to our team seems pretty good. And in terms of
attrition, attrition is very manageable and has no – it's not reflected at all in how we think about the compensation ratio.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then a follow up on Howard's question, is there any color you can give on the
resubmission process, how those discussions are going with the Fed? Maybe any granular specifics about what drove
that request and such?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we don't have any color yet and to the extent to which we can share it over time, we
will. Of course it's supervisory level data, but whatever we can share over time we will. What I will say is that as a firm
that has invested a lot of time and energy both in terms of analytics but culturally around risk, we always look for
opportunities to learn. And so we'll work closely with the Fed – well, with the Federal Reserve over the next six months
and we look forward to enhancing any process changes we make.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And I guess following up on that, the idea of learning as we're going through this,
given that we've – now we're starting to see the impact of the stress tests as we move closer to Basel 3 and some of
these rules start getting implemented and included in stress test, do you continue to think that firms with large – well,
complex global investment banks running with about a 10% Tier 1 common ratio is realistic? Or do you think that it
might end up working out higher than that given how the stress test process has been going so far?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think it's too early to tell. And I do think – look, what I will say is the stress test is a
really good concept and quite frankly if there was a version of a stress test prior to the crisis maybe it would've had
some mitigating effects in terms of the crisis. But it's evolutionary and it's complex, and so we'll have to see how it
evolves.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then last one for me is just sort of a nit question, incentive comp in Investment
Management stood out as pretty high, particularly given it's the first quarter. Was there anything specific behind that or
just the strong markets?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I think you were referring – sorry – just to incentive fees?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yup.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there was...
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sorry, yeah, incentive fees, not comps.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: [ph] Yeah, I'm sorry (46:54), it's okay.

Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes. Good morning. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the VaR, just
interested in the increase in the currency and rates, obviously it's an area where you don't normally see too much
movement but you seem to have seen the increase there. Perhaps give us some background on that.
Second question is on revenue mix. I think 59% of the revenues last year were in the United States. I wonder if you
could give us a flavor for whether that has changed much in the first quarter given obviously how rather more robust
the U.S. markets were?
And then finally just a follow up really on that question on the realizations in I&L on equities because I think you had
about $120 billion of [ph] Basel 3 (47:49) RWA in there at the end of the year and I wondered had that moved a great
deal on the back of this – of the gains you've made? And really what sort of progress you want to make on that over the
next 12 months? Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So let me make sure I rattle through those. So, on VaR, so as you know, VaR is
measured with a lag. Now our VaR I think relative to competitors is more heavily weighted to the more recent
observable time period, so about 50% of the contribution. But there's nothing meaningful in those shifts and they
reflect, generally speaking, client activity and obviously the resultant position. So there's nothing meaningful about
VaR. The more – I think more significant observation that everyone should take away was the one I made with respect
to last year versus this year and that as market volatilities increase I think you could easily see increasing VaR over
time but perhaps with the same position profile. So people shouldn't be – we're certainly not lulled into any
complacency as a result of the fact that the VaR signal is low because that's mostly driven by market volatilities.
With respect to your second question on business mix, there's nothing significant really to highlight for you there.
Obviously, as you would expect, activity in Europe towards the end of the quarter, a little more impacted, but it's really
just natural outcome of client activity. And so where you see uncertainty, client activity obviously is going to be
impacted, but I wouldn't say that the mix issue is material.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: [ph] And your (49:24) last question on I&L, your last question. You had I think also a
question on I&L.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: I did. Yeah.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We're going to continue to manage that business as we have in the past. And so that is
obviously about investment selection but that includes obviously the lending activities, the debt and the equity. And so
it's a diversified portfolio. It's diversified geographically. And so we'll continue to manage that business as we have in
the past, so nothing really to comment there.

<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Two questions. First, can you just sort of update us on the framework
of thinking around capital usage at this sort of very point? Obviously, you've talked about capacity coming out of some
businesses, the stock's at about $143. You have a pretty significant authorization. So, any change in the philosophy
there? Or is it sort of should we be thinking about the 2012 dynamic? And then on the asset management side, I know
not mentioned yet but it did look like you guys had one of your better quarters in a while with respect to some
long-term flows and I'm just wondering if there was anything you guys could attribute that to? Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. So in terms of capital, no, there's nothing there. And with respect to the Investment
Management, we obviously continue to stay very focused on performance, and improved performance always attracts
client flows and we're certainly seeing that.
<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: So if I could just follow up with the first question, I guess. When we think about repurchase
activity, I mean the framework for 2012 is a reasonable framework for 2013? Is that a fair statement?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I wouldn't extrapolate 2012 into 2013 because it'll be based on the environment. And so
if we see continually improving opportunities, which again will be driven by our clients, then we may deploy capital
into the business. And it's a balance.

Your next question is from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Thanks. I just had a follow up on the BDC issue and Liberty Harbor. I was wondering if
you might be able to kind of size the opportunity there in terms of growth – you mentioned it as part of kind of an asset
under management – and also if that's part of a broader strategy to kind of attack midsized firms?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's not a strategy specifically targeted against – against any firm. It really is just again
what I said earlier about deploying our competencies into opportunities that we feel our clients are interested in and
would benefit from. And so, we'll have to see how the business grows over time, but of course this will be a multi-year
effort and I think it really gets to the point that we're always looking for opportunities and new products to introduce
that our clients want to utilize.
<Q – [05VMRJ-E]Fred Cannon – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.> And then just one other follow up. You've
addressed a lot of the issues about the U.S. regulatory environment. I was wondering if you could comment on some of
the issues going on in Europe, particularly the push for a financial transaction tax.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So of course we're monitoring all that and we're engaged with regulators in terms of
discussion. Of course, it's unclear at this point exactly how this will ultimately be adopted, so it's really not possible at
this stage to estimate the overall impact. I guess I would say that when evaluating any of these rules, all the market
participants, obviously we all have a huge obligation, regulators and clients and ourselves to make sure that we strike
the right balance because we want to make sure that we're ensuring that the best capital markets are built with proper
liquidity, and so these are important decisions.
<Q – [05VMRJ-E]Fred Cannon – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.> And then along those lines, I guess I would just
kind of follow up. Is there any sense of kind of where regulation seems to be headed to be the most onerous whether it's
Europe or the U.S. or does it feel like it's the same kind of across the globe?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No – I don't know if I'd say onerous. I think I'd say that if there was a consistent pattern I
think generally speaking for the rules that it had been proposed versus how they've been finalized, they generally start
in one place. There's been engagement with market participants and they generally have migrated to a place that's better
for the capital markets.

because you talked about 350 basis points of improvement and I thought I'd see that in the RWAs under Basel 3, and I
wondered if you could talk about why that's not the case. And the second issue is just if you had any comment on

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, on the second question, nothing in particular to note. The only other thing I would
say with respect to the ratios, you're right. Reference what we – I think you're referring to what we put in the 10-K.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Yeah.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And so what's in the 10-K, so obviously the performance for the quarter and also we
received some feedback from the Fed with respect to the numbers which improved them.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: But then what I can't quite understand is why we didn't see that in the Basel 3 number?
Because obviously it's part of the component.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. Well, I did say approximately, so I'm not going to be specific as to the number but
there's improvement there as well.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay, thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Hey. Good morning. Kind of a macro thought question, thinking about the FICC revenue outlook
and I guess I'm specifically thinking we've been waiting for higher-margin businesses like mortgages to pick up for a
while. Now that we're seeing it we're actually kind of seeing FICC decline. I'm having a little trouble balancing
between the importance of larger – what I usually think of as being lower margin businesses like rates versus the
smaller but typically much higher-margin businesses like mortgages.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as activity picks up obviously you're going to see it but I think the key for us is the
diversity of the franchise. And so as I said earlier, we just want to make sure strategically that – and look, we're far
from perfect and there's always work we can do on improving our businesses and we stay very focused on that, but we
want to make sure that we're positioned within each one of the businesses, where we really get the benefit in a market
environment like this is the diversity both within products but also geographically.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: I mean should we kind of sitting here today be happy because we see mortgages picking up? Or
should we be more concerned that rates are probably not going to hit the revenue levels that it hit historically?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We don't – I don't know if I'd describe it as happy or sad. I think again we have to – we
don't create the environment, we just have to make sure we're best positioned for our clients to respond to it. So, for
example, right now as you pointed out, and I mentioned in the earlier comments, a big improvement in housing, there's
also been investors desirous of yield, and so you see things starting to turn on in terms of the mortgage business but it

may not correlate for example with the rates business which is why I highlighted the diversity aspect. It'll be the case –
I don't think we – we don't expect necessarily very frequently all the cylinders to fire at the same time.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And as we're thinking about comp expense, I mean what should we – and this may have
been touched on, but what if anything should we read into a year-over-year decline in the accrual ratio despite I&L
actually being a smaller portion of revenues year-over-year? I mean should we be looking for continued comp expense
efficiency driven improvements going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So there was no change to the way we thought about the compensation ratio this year
versus prior years. And just to be thorough, as you know and we talk about this a lot, it's driven by performance, other
issues, the competitive dynamic and what's happening in the broader environment and in the end it's our best estimate.
Now what I would say is that certainly the expense efforts that – and the control efforts we put in over the past two
years give us some degree of flexibility and that's represented in the number.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. So your best estimate now is lower than your best estimate a year ago and can I
paraphrase to say that's at least partially structurally driven as opposed to business mix driven?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I'm thinking about that exactly, I think that's fine.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric E. Wasserstrom>: Thanks. I – Harvey, I just wanted to return to the VaR issue, most of my questions have
already been answered, but you made a comment, I just want to make sure I understood it, which was that we should
directionally expect the VaR dollars to increase but in a similar mix of categories. Is that correct?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So what I was trying to say was the following. So there's obviously multiple inputs that
go into the VaR calculation. One dominant factor obviously is market volatilities that we experience during the process.
So for us, there's a bit more of a weighting towards the more recent time period; roughly 50% of the VaR calculation is
impacted by the last three month's volatilities. And so when we saw – what I was trying to do is to draw a line under
the 95% from last year I think it was down to 76% this quarter, and that is driven mostly by drops – a decline in implied
volatilities in the marketplace...
<Q - Eric E. Wasserstrom>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: ...not from position change. And what I was really saying was it wouldn't surprise me at
some point volatility will increase. Who knows? It could be soon, it could be a long time from now, but I also wouldn't
read too much into my comments.
<Q - Eric E. Wasserstrom>: Okay. So I guess the real crux of my question, though, is that it sounds like based on
what you're seeing from client activities that this current VaR profile would remain pretty consistent without any
changes in broader volatility?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: That's too hard for me to predict. I mean if you're basically saying if the second quarter's
exactly the same as the first quarter, it might look like that, but I think clients are going to drive activity as they always
do and it's a dynamic world.
<Q - Eric E. Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: Yeah, hi. I just want to see if I could pin you down on the compensation question with
a little bit more specificity. And should we read into that decline that the Goldman Sachs Company is dedicated to
achieving positive operating leverage in the sense that if revenues are flat to up by when we see the fourth quarter
number, the compensation ratio should be slightly down?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I don't want to attach too much to the compensation ratio itself. What I would say, Chris,
is you should 100% assume that in all aspects of our business, we're always looking for operating leverage. And at the
same time, we're making sure we find that balance between how we compete for talent, compete against our
competitors generically and most importantly how we serve our clients.
<Q - Christoph M. Kotowski>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Yeah, hey. Good morning. Just one follow up on the derivatives reform. With the May 1
deadline looming for signing up clients with – for them to register for swaps trading, do see that as an issue in terms of
activity levels? Do you think it gets extended? How do you think of – how should we think about that impact this
quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So this is, again, one of these things that's really, really difficult to predict and so we'll
monitor it and – one of the things that we've learned in terms of regulatory changes and market structure changes is that
the key is less about predicting output and outcomes and more about responding to them. And so we have a long
history of adapting and so as these rules become live we're going to have to adapt as are our clients. And we'll have to
adapt better than our competitors. Historically, we've been good at that, but we'll have to deliver in the future.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Fair enough. Maybe taking a little bit of a longer term view as you get more prepared for –
and moving things to clearing and the increasing electronification of FICC, do you see offsets here? What's your view
on how expenses react to greater electronification? And should that offset I guess most people's view of declining
revenues in that type of environment?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, difficult to predict, so I think it's better to look at history as a guide. The
electronification of FICC has been obviously happening for a number of years. You go back to the early part of 2000s
with the advent of Tradeweb in government bonds and then simultaneously the foreign exchange market, so
electronification is not new to us in FICC and obviously equities broadly. And so, for us, electronification I think is a
bit of a muscle-memory issue.
And of course, as you know, I do think we have some competitive advantage given that we have one platform in [ph]
SecDb (64:01), which when rules become final and as markets become more electronic, a lot of this is about speed and
ability to adopt new procedures and respond because that's what our clients need. And so with respect to the forward,
obviously, there's some operating efficiencies that can be gained, you may get new revenue development and new
products, but I think those things are much harder to forecast.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: No, fair enough. I guess...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You only have to look at our experience in terms of how we've done it.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: So I guess – but if we look at Equities, it did seem like you had, following more electronic
move to commission you had less volatility and better returns. Do you think that that's a logical outcome for fixed

income as well?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And again, like I said, I think if you look at the case study and we can – and Dane and
team can walk you through more specific examples offline. But if you look just at us case study of equities, foreign
exchange, government bond training, et cetera, I think our history is good but we have to execute.
