MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Sean and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Biogen Idec Q1 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Claudine Prowse, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Claudine Prowse
Thank you, and welcome to Biogen Idec's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.
Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find a press release and
related financial tables including our reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today. Our
GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results
which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage the business
internally. We've also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.
I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current
expectations. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially

On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global
Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our EVP of Finance and CFO,
Paul Clancy.
I'll now turn the call over to George.
George A. Scangos
Okay. Thanks, Claudine, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
Before I start, I do want to make a few comments on the case reports that appeared in The New England Journal of
Medicine today. Frankly, it's hard for me to understand why these old reports were deemed worthy of publication at all.
And certainly the timing, coming shortly after approval, is interesting.
These are old news, right? The cases described in the New England Journal are two of the four cases of PML that have
occurred in over 19 years and over 180,000 patient years of exposure to FUMADERM. All four cases were discussed
at the JPMorgan conference in January, and all four cases were seen by the FDA, European regulatory authorities and
all regulatory authorities months in advance of approval, and I think the TECFIDERA label speaks for itself.
So just to reiterate, there have been no cases of PML or other opportunistic infections with TECFIDERA. The clinical
program has involved over 2,600 patients, treated for up to four years, and with a median time of approximately two
years. So there's been substantial patient exposure with TECFIDERA.
The New England Journal of Medicine cases occurred with different drugs. But even if one does assume that
[indiscernible] (3:05) rates were the same – which I do not believe to be true – then the rate is extraordinarily low. Four
cases out of 180,000 patient years.
Now we've gone through these cases before. We have described the characteristics of these patients before. I'm not
going to reiterate all of that stuff now. And fortunately, I believe that the noise and misinformation being spread is
transient and will fade. And [ph] in a first way, (3:30) it's somewhat complementary.
Importantly, I can assure you that we're well prepared to make sure that physicians and patients have a balanced picture
of TECFIDERA. So with that we'll move onto the prepared remarks.
It's been a remarkable quarter for Biogen Idec, our shareholders, for patients as a result of several major
accomplishments over the quarter. First, our core business performed very well. Tony and Paul will go into more detail
but the bottom line is that revenues were up 10% to $1.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings were up 41% to $1.97 per
share compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Both AVONEX and TYSABRI had strong growth, driven by AVONEX's life-cycle improvement and TYSABRI's
powerful efficacy. AVONEX continued to gain market share within the ABCRE class, and global units grew by 4%, so
the core business is off to a great start.
Of course, a key event during the quarter was the approval and launch of TECFIDERA in the U.S. as a first-line
treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. This is a watershed event for our company and for MS patients.
We're moving full-speed-ahead with the great label that allows our commercial team to discuss TECFIDERA in a
balanced and broad way – to describe the benefits of TECFIDERA, not only on relapse rate, but also on disability
progression and MRI endpoints, both of which are becoming increasingly important for patients living with this
debilitating, chronic disease.
Also during the quarter, we were able to substantially improve the intellectual property protection for TECFIDERA.
The U.S. patent for the 480-milligram-per-day dose that the FDA approved has been issued. The patent provides
protection for the 480-milligram dose, which is the only approved dose until 2028.

The European Patent Office also determined that claims to the 480-milligram-per-day dose are allowable, and we
expect the European patent to issue sometime in the next few months. That patent also will not expire until 2028. We
believe our patent protection for the approved dosing regimen, coupled with existing patents, will provide a solid
intellectual-property portfolio to support our commercialization of TECFIDERA for many years to come.
Our recent transaction with Elan, in which we gained full control of TYSABRI, cleared regulatory hurdles and closed
shortly after the quarter on April 2. This transaction provides us with full ownership rights and control of TYSABRI,
and eliminates the change-of-control provisions that were in the original contract. The operational simplicity should
allow us to be more nimble and focused, which we believe will not only help TYSABRI but the overall business in the
longer term.
As Paul will outline, it is a deal that will give us an increased share of TYSABRI economics going forward. The
transaction is immediately and, we believe, sustainably accretive as we move into the future. It's another landmark
accomplishment for Biogen Idec and our shareholders.
We also continued to advance our late-stage programs through the registration process and preparations have begun for
three more anticipated approvals and launches over the next 18 months.
Two product candidates for hemophilia, long-lasting Factors VIII Fc and Factors IX Fc, are hopefully our next products
to reach the market. These products represent the first major treatment advances in hemophilia since
recombinant-clotting factors were introduced two decades ago. If approved, we believe these products will provide
meaningful benefit by addressing a compelling need that these patients have, which is to require fewer injections.
Hemophilia is roughly a $6 billion market worldwide. There are entrenched competitors in this market, and patients
tend to stick with their current therapies. But we believe that for the first time in a long time, we'll be able to offer
patients products that actually give them compelling reasons to change. We have a team with deep experience and
relationships in the hemophilia community, and we believe that we have the potential to create a significant hemophilia
franchise over time.
Our PEGylated interferon for MS, PLEGRIDY, finished the first year of the advance Phase III trial successfully. We
plan to file for regulatory approval by mid-year for an approval decision next year. We hope to be able to offer patients
a therapy that's administered once every 2 weeks subcutaneously with efficacy that appears to be at least comparable to
other products in the injectable class. We believe that with this profile, patients and physicians will view PLEGRIDY
as a preferred front line option.
And behind those is a pipeline of compounds on track to reach development milestones in the next few years, including
the SMNrx compound for SMA, anti-LINGO for remyelination in MS – anti-TWEAK for treatment of lupus nephritis
and STX-100 for the treatment of IPF. We believe that each of them has the potential to be a major improvement in
therapy for their target patient population. So in summary, this has been a very productive quarter and year-to-date for
Biogen Idec.
So now, I'll hand the call over to Tony to discuss in more detail the commercial results.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thank you, George.
We were pleased with the continued execution of our commercial strategy in Q1. We remain focused on growing our
leadership in the MS market with a goal of maximizing our total patient share across our therapies. The launch in U.S.
of TECFIDERA represents obviously a very exciting addition to our MS franchise.
During the quarter, we experienced continued strength across our products with AVONEX and TYSABRI both
showing solid revenue growth. AVONEX unit revenue growth were strong as this important product remains a leading
first-line therapy for MS patients. First quarter global AVONEX revenues increased 13% versus prior year and we
continue to see competitive share gains for AVONEX within the ABCRE segment across the segment across multiple

markets. AVONEX performance continues to be driven by strong commercial execution maintaining strong share of
voice in this highly competitive and promotionally sensitive segment of the market. Excuse me. As well as the benefits
of the AVONEX PEN, which offers improved patient convenience, which we believe is an increasingly important
differentiator within the injectable segment.
TYSABRI first quarter global revenues increased 9% versus the prior year. In an increasingly crowded MS market with
more options available to patients, we believe TYSABRI's powerful efficacy profile continues to resonate with
neurologists. We are continuing to educate the market about TYSABRI risk stratification and believe this is supporting
earlier use of TYSABRI in appropriate patients who need high efficacy. The majority of patients starting TYSABRI or
JCV antibody negative, we expect favorable longer-term retention rates for these patients.
Moving on to TECFIDERA – We're still in the initial days of the U.S. launch and it's premature for us at this point to
comment on specific launch metrics. However, we have been encouraged by the early signs of physician and patient
interest in this product. For TECFIDERA, we are focused on two immediate objectives: First, to create broad
promotion and education to physicians; and second to facilitate access to patients starting on TECFIDERA. Our
pre-launch planning was comprehensive and I'm very pleased with the speed and quality of execution by the U.S.
commercial organization over the last several weeks.
Regarding our promotional efforts, well data indicates U.S. physician awareness of TECFIDERA is high and
perceptions of the product are strong. We believe a successful launch will require broad and repeated promotional and
educational efforts and we believe we are well prepared to accomplish this in the coming weeks and months. Our sales
force is fully trained with approved promotional materials and call plans with broad reach to target neurologists. We've
also completed training of physician speakers and have a robust schedule of educational programs.
Concerting our efforts to facilitate access for patients starting on TECFIDERA, we are executing the plan. Within days
of approval, the product was shipped to our specialty pharmacy partners and was ready for patient starts. Our managed
care teams are beginning to engage with payers to secure formulary access and reimbursement, a process that we
expect will take 6 months to 12 months as is typical for products of this type. Prior to inclusion on payer formularies,
we believe that many payers will, again as is typical for products of this type, require prior approvals and step edits that
place some additional burden on physician offices and patients. These hurdles can cause the start of therapy to be
delayed in some patients by one to two months. At steady state, we think it will take weeks for patients to get on drug.
We believe our internal patient services group working in conjunction with pharmacy partners is well resourced to
provide assistance to physician offices to get patients started on therapy.
For patients, we have comprehensive financial assistance programs in place including co-pay assistance and a free drug
program for those who are uninsured.
We continue to prepare for broad commercialization of TECFIDERA outside the U.S. Our plan assumes that the initial
European launch will occur in Germany after the anticipated European Commission approval. Additional European
country launches are expected to occur throughout 2014, as other E.U. countries generally require approximately 6
months to 12 months to go through the reimbursement process. In these ex-U.S. launch countries, we already have key
marketing and market access resources in place and we plan to add field resources in anticipation of each country's
launch.
We continue to be very excited about the long-term potential for TECFIDERA. We believe this product will be
appealing to a broad segment of patients and physicians and that in the future, TECFIDERA will become the leading
oral in the MS market.
We also recognize that we are competing against an increasing number of therapy options and that MS is a
conservative market where many patients will persist on their therapies for extended periods. Patients typically see a
neurologist every 6 months to 12 months with treatment decisions, primarily driven by patients who relapse at a rate of
10% to 15% year.
Given these factors, success for TECFIDERA will require sustained execution. We believe that we are well resourced
and well prepared to do just that. I'm very pleased with the execution by our commercial team bringing this important

innovation to patients who need it.
With that, I will hand the call over to Doug.
Douglas E. Williams
Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone.
The first quarter has been busy with progress on the clinical and regulatory front and further progress building out our
research capabilities. Starting with important advances on the regulatory front, we receive notification of a positive
opinion from CHMP for approval of TECFIDERA and both FDA and Health Canada approved TECFIDERA with
first-line indications for broad spectrum of patients with relapsing forms of MS. As expected, the U.S. TECFIDERA
label reflected a strong efficacy, favorable safety profile and limited monitoring requirements for a broad population of
patients with relapsing forms of MS.
Beyond the initial CBC, which should be taken within six months prior to starting therapy, and blood tests annually or
as clinically indicated, there's no additional required monitoring for patients. Our warnings and precautions section
have two items of note. Lymphopenia, which can be monitored through a simple blood test, this testing should fit into
the typical cycle of MS patient management, and flushing which is usually mild to moderate and we believe usually
improves or resolves over time. Taking it with food may help mitigate flushing as well.
Switching gears to our hemophilia franchise, the BLA submission for our long-lasting Factor IX has been accepted by
the FDA with a standard review timeline. We also submitted our regulatory package for our long-lasting Factor VIII to
the FDA and for Factor IX to Health Canada. We're working on our Factor IX submission to the Therapeutic Goods
Administration of Australia and Factor VIII to Health Canada.
During the quarter, important data on our diverse neurological portfolio were presented at the American Academy of
Neurology annual meeting with 50 company-sponsored platform and poster presentations. We also presented for the
first time the detailed results of our pivotal trials for long-lasting Factors VIII and IX at the European Association for
Hemophilia and Allied Disorders conference, also referred to as EAHAD.
One important presentation I want to highlight from AAN was data from the pivotal Phase III study of PLEGRIDY or
Peginterferon beta-1a. PLEGRIDY met all primary and secondary endpoints after the one-year cut off of the two-year
study. PLEGRIDY significantly reduced MS disease activity including relapses, disability progression, and brain
lesions compared to placebo at one year. We believe that the safety and tolerability will be viewed favorably. The
overall incidence of adverse events were similar among the PLEGRIDY and placebo groups with the most commonly
reported AEs being redness at the injection site and influenza-like symptoms. We plan to file for regulatory approval
with the FDA and European Commission by midyear for an approval decision next year.
At the EAHAD meeting, we reviewed the pivotal study data from our Factor VIII and IX programs showing that these
clotting factors had extended half-lives. Neither molecule showed any evidence of [ph] inhibitor fork (17:47)
development. The data from both of our studies suggest the potential to transform the treatment of both hemophilia A
and B by enabling patients to maintain protection from bleeding episodes with the benefits from less frequent
injections.
Turning now to our early stage pipeline, data with our anti-beta-amyloid antibody, BIIB037, from our Phase I single
ascending dose study was presented at the eleventh Annual Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and
suggest that we could safely administer intravenous doses as high as 30 mgs per kg without evidence of Vasogenic
edema, a dose limiting toxicity observed with other anti-beta-amyloid antibodies in development.
The pre-clinical data comparing the binding in biological properties of BIIB037 with other beta-amyloid antibodies
showed that our antibody may have a unique phenotype recognizing primarily the insoluble fibular form of
beta-amyloid with little binding to vascular-associated forms of beta-amyloid.

In transgenic animal models, BIIB037 showed potent and dose-dependent removal of plaques. We're currently
conducting a multiple ascending-dose study in patients with prodromal and mild Alzheimer's disease to assess the
degree of plaque removal by imaging.
I'm also pleased to report that we've made a key hire in our efforts to reinvigorate our discovery in cell biology
programs. Dr. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, who's been taking a sabbatical from the Department of Cell Biology at
Harvard and acting as our CSO, will be joining us permanently. Spryos's scientific reputation, his role in the start-up of
several biotech companies, as well as his deep network of academic colleagues will be an important addition to our
efforts to create a world-class discovery capability. This is a great addition to an already solid R&D team. Spyros will
be working closely with Alfred Sandrock and the rest of the R&D team to advance our pipeline.
As we move forward, I look forward to providing you key top-line data readouts from our pivotal and early-stage
program trials.
With that, I'll now pass the call to Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer.
Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Doug.
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.79 in the first quarter. The differences between our GAAP and
non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation. They include $49 million related to the amortization of
acquired intangibles, $2 million in fair value adjustments for contingent consideration, and $4 million related to stock
compensation expense. This is partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per
share in the first quarter were $1.97. Included in these results was the benefit of an unusually low effective tax rates
quarter. This was driven by a few discrete items, which added approximately $0.17 to our EPS. I'll talk in more detail
about this shortly.
Let me now walk down the P&L. Total revenue for the first quarter grew 10% to $1.4 billion. Q1 AVONEX worldwide
revenue was strong growing 13% to $746 million. Q1 global-unit AVONEX volume increased 4% versus prior year. In
the U.S., AVONEX revenue grew 23% in Q1 to $491 million; U.S. unit volume increasing 8% versus prior year. As we
shared last year, units in the first quarter of 2012 were unfavorably impacted by channel dynamics. This allowed for a
favorable comparison this year.
U.S. inventory for AVONEX in the U.S. ended at just over two weeks this quarter, a modest build. Internationally, Q1
AVONEX revenue was $255 million, a decrease of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2012. International AVONEX
revenue was unfavorably impacted by the timing of shipments to Brazil, a tender market where we recorded no sales
this quarter. Foreign exchange and hedging impact also weakened AVONEX revenue by approximately $5 million
versus 2012.
TYSABRI worldwide in-market sales were $456 million in the first quarter, up 15%. We recorded TYSABRI product
revenue at $312 million in Q1.
In the U.S., first quarter TYSABRI product revenue was $113 million. The first quarter benefited by approximately $11
million due to an increase in inventory levels at our distributor related to the asset purchase. Q1 international
TYSABRI product revenue was $199 million. TYSABRI product revenue was negatively impacted by approximately
$14 million of deferred revenue in our Italian affiliate. Similar to AVONEX, TYSABRI did not have tender sales in
Brazil, impacting revenue by approximately $4 million this quarter. The impact of foreign exchange and hedging for
Q1 softened revenue by approximately $2 million for TYSABRI versus the prior year.
FAMPYRA revenue was $23 million and in this past quarter the final price was established in Germany and we
recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately $8 million.
U.S. RITUXAN sales were $865 million in the first quarter, an increase of 9%. RITUXAN sales benefited from a Q1
inventory build-up in addition to continued uptake in the first-line maintenance lymphoma setting.

In the quarter, Genentech received an arbitration ruling in its dispute with Hoechst. This resulted in a reduction of
approximately $42 million of which $4 million impacted our U.S. profit share and $38 million impacted rest of world
royalties. As a result, our U.S. profit sharing and expense reimbursement was $282 million for the first quarter and
royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were a loss of $17 million. The result was $265 million
of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in the first quarter.
Royalties were $33 million for the first quarter and we also recorded $22 million of corporate partner revenue including
$13 million from our ZEVALIN supply agreement.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q1 cost of goods sold were $134 million or 9% of revenue.
Q1 R&D expense was $283 million or 20% of revenue. The lower than typical run rate was primarily driven by the
discontinuation of the dexpramipexole program and no business development activity during the quarter.
Q1 SG&A expense was $351 million or 25% of revenues, an increase of 17% over last year. This was driven by costs
associated with promotional planning and sales force development for TECFIDERA. Continuing down the P&L, our
collaboration profit sharing line totaled $85 million expense for the quarter. Other income and expense was a loss of
$14 million in Q1.
Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 14%. This unusually low tax rate was driven by three factors. First, we received
updated technical guidance from the IRS concerning our U.S. federal manufacturing deduction. This was related to our
unconsolidated joint business for the years 2005 through 2012. Based on this guidance, we re-evaluated our tax
position and recorded a net benefit of $33 million related to these prior years.
Second, we experienced favorability due to the 2012 reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. And finally, we
benefited from participating in the Massachusetts 2012 Life Sciences Tax Incentive Program. These discrete items
contributed approximately $0.17 to our non-GAAP diluted EPS.
In the first quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million. We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in
cash and marketable securities of which we deployed $3.25 billion to fund our asset purchase of Elan's interest in
TYSABRI early in the second quarter. This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $1.97 in
the first quarter.
Now let me turn to our full-year 2013 guidance. We're updating our guidance to reflect the completion of the
TYSABRI asset purchase, which closed on April 2nd, and updates to our core business. I'll walk you through the
various components and where applicable, break out the impact from changes to our core business versus changes to
the TYSABRI economics.
We expect total revenue growth of approximately 16% to 18% versus prior guidance of 10%. Our revenue assumptions
on our core business remain essentially unchanged. Included in this guidance is an additional $425 million to $475
million from the TYSABRI asset purchase.
Moving to the expense lines on the P&L – We anticipate cost of goods sold to be between 13% and 15% of sales. This
increase relates to the TYSABRI contingent payments owed to Elan, which will be recorded in cost of goods sold.
We'll also now book 100% of the third party TYSABRI royalties through COGS. Also note, we will no longer be using
the collaboration profit sharing line item on the P&L.
R&D expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of sales. Our balance of year R&D forecast now includes up to
$75 million earmarked for potential new early-stage business development opportunities. We continue to be focused on
building our pipeline with an emphasis of adding high-quality Phase I and Phase II assets.
SG&A is expected to be approximately 24% to 26% of total revenue. We continue to see 2013 as an investment year as
we build out the commercial efforts for TECFIDERA, including countries outside the U.S. and pre-launch efforts for
hemophilia in the U.S. We continue to expect SG&A leverage post-2013.

Our effective tax rate in 2013 is expected to be between 22% and 23% of pre-tax income. For the balance of year, our
effective tax rate is expected to be between 24% and 25%. As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share
results between $7.80 and $7.90 and GAAP EPS to between $6.69 and $6.79. We anticipate ending 2013 with a cash
balance greater than $1 billion, of which the majority will be located inside the U.S.
So the primary updates to our 2013 guidance are driven by three factors: the asset purchase of TYSABRI, the discrete
tax benefit and solid performance of our core business experienced in the first quarter and $75 million earmarked for
potential new business development activity as the strong results this quarter has allowed for reinvestment in the
business. We're excited about the remainder of 2013 and setting the foundation for what we hope to be strong earnings
growth over the next number of years.
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.
George A. Scangos
Okay. Thanks, Paul.
So in summary, our core business is doing remarkably well. The TECFIDERA launch is well underway in the U.S. and
now with three approved MS products in the U.S., TECFIDERA, TYSABRI, and AVONEX, we believe we have the
portfolio that makes us the global leader in the treatment of MS.
What's important to us is to drive leadership across the entire franchise. We believe that with the leading injectable, the
leading high efficacy therapy and potentially the leading oral drug, we're well positioned to do just that. So I believe
that with the accomplishments that we made since the beginning of the year, we're in a very promising trajectory for the
remainder of this year and for years to come.
We have three more potential new products coming forward in the next 18 months, PLEGRIDY and our long-lasting
Factors VIII and IX. We're focused and working hard to ensure that we complete the registration processes in a timely
fashion and successfully launch each of these late-stage products.
We're making progress with our mid-stage pipeline as well and also the important work of keeping the sustainability of
the pipeline going. We expect data readouts for daclizumab in 2014, TYSABRI and SPMS in 2015 and potentially
SMNrx in 2016. During that timeframe, we expect to have meaningful data readouts from our Phase II compounds and
proof of concept data from several other compounds as well. So we believe that we're on track to continue to bring
important new medicines to patients in the areas of high unmet need and further ensure that we have major value
drivers going forward.
So before I end the call, I'd like to note the enthusiasm and the passion that runs throughout our organization in terms of
the work we're doing for patients. Biogen Idec has been around for a long time. We're the oldest independent biotech
company in the world. We've had a great run off the strength of our science, our development group is world-class and
we believe that we have great commercial outlook ahead.
Now for our patients around the world and our shareholders, we need to continue to deliver, and we're committed to do
just that. We're working hard to enhance our internal R&D and pipeline, and we also expect to make some additional
investments through our BD group this year to further enhance the pipeline and provide additional value down the road.
So I'd like to thank all of our employees whose hard work, dedication makes these accomplishments possible, and at
this time we'll open up the call for Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question, and congratulations on a strong quarter, a lot
of progress.
Probably best question would just be to start off with a little more color on TECFIDERA. I know you don't have any
sort of firm metrics but could you give us a sense of whether the patient for the starting – are coming new to treatment?
Or whether they're prior treatment failures? Whether they're switches or have been off treatment previously? And then,
perhaps a little color on what their best alternative treatment was – are they patients that might otherwise have been
considered for TYSABRI? Or are they straight out of the ABCR pool? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Jeff. It's Tony. So look, early days, but surely answer is we're seeing
patients come from all those different categories. It's probably a little early to comment on any pattern that's developing
on that front. But as we said, we're encouraged with the early signs.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum, MD>: Hey, guys. First of all, I hope everyone at Biogen is safe after the marathon
situation.
And second of all, my question is, now that the TECFIDERA is launched, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the issue
of NAS in Europe if I might. I think you guys have said in the past that you think that TECFIDERA is entitled to full
regulatory data protection independently of whether TECFIDERA would qualify as an NAS, based on the fact that
TECFIDERA hasn't been previously approved as a single component medicinal product. I was wondering if you could
explain to us what that alternative path to regulatory data protection is? I understand you have patent allowance there.
But I'd really appreciate some clarification on that if that's possible. Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Sure. Geoff, first, thanks for your, sorry thanks Mark, thanks for your comments. Look, it
has been a tough couple weeks in Boston I think for the whole country and in some way this is kind of the worst of
humanity and the best of humanity, all rolled into one here. But we're getting through.
On the regulatory front in Europe, we continue to believe that we're entitled to the eight plus two years of data
exclusivity. Obviously, we're in the middle now of discussions with the European regulatory authorities. I don't want to
go into all the details of that on the call. I think it's just general good practice not to discuss the details of our
interactions with regulatory authorities. But we continue to believe that we are entitled to that data protection.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum, MD>: Fair enough. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey, thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter. Questions
related to TECFIDERA. Firstly, in CONFIRM and DEFINE, can you remind us whether you detailed lymphocyte
subset analysis to understand which subsets were affected and which are relatively spared specifically. Do you know
whether peripheral effector memory T-cells were spared? And, for Tony, I'd love to get your view on the potential
warehousing that may or may not have occurred within the MS market ahead of TECFIDERA. Thank you.

<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Yeah, Ravi, this is Doug. Thanks for the question. And with respect to the nuances of
different T-cell subsets, we didn't explore that in the study. We look strictly at lymphocyte counts, white cell counts as
sort of a monitoring measure. We looked at that pretty intensively as you know and that data has been presented at
several different forums and published in the New England Journal. I think the most important take-home message
from those studies is that we did see a drop in lymphocyte and white cell counts that sort of trended downward during
the first three months to six months on treatment and then plateaued and stabilized for the remainder of time that
patients were on study drug.
There was a low percentage of patients that met our criteria for lymphopenia, which was any single count that was
below 500. That was about half of the 6% of the patients that met the criteria of lymphopenia only had a single-count
that was below 500.
So, all the patients continued on study drugs throughout the course of the study. We didn't stop anyone. And as you
know, there were no opportunistic infections and there was no increase in infection risk in the patients that were treated
with study drugs. So, that's basically the bottom line with respect to lymphopenia.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Ravi, for the question. So, I've been publicly skeptical of the term
warehouse as you know so I appreciate you're asking that. But look, that's in the spirit of how do you actually define
that term in the context of that rhythm of this market. Having said that, we've always believed that there would be some
pent-up demand and early interest in this and that's a function of a great label in a good product profile. So, as we said,
their early indicators are encouraging. We'll see how that plays out in the coming weeks and months. This is a
marathon, not a sprint. We're focused on getting out and promoting and getting off to a strong start. But it's really about
building a sustainable trajectory.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Understood. George, do think the guests have left the party yet?

Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So quickly, can you give us an update on when
do you think the Italian TYSABRI dispute might be resolved? And just clarify – I know I think last quarter you said it
was included in your guidance. Can you clarify whether or not the lack of the dispute resolution is included in your
guidance? And then second, regarding similar dynamics in Europe you mentioned there was an impact from Brazil.
How are ex-U.S. units of AVONEX doing if you exclude the Brazil impact? Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Robyn, this is Paul. Let me take the first part of your question with respect to AIFA and the
Italian revenue deferral. It's frustrating for us as well. We are hopeful that it gets resolved this year. It is included in our
guidance. If it doesn't get resolved, we'll work hard to try to offset that. But it's included in our guidance. What
specifically is included in our guidance is that we get back to booking something in terms of a full price. And what's
not included in our guidance is any of the deferred revenue accruing back into the P&L this year. And I think that's
kind of a middle of the road assessment of the various outcomes. And I just would also note that there'll be accounting
judgments and accounting treatments that are applicable depending on hopefully when this gets resolved and negotiated
through.
With respect to the second part of your question, excluding Brazil, kind of if it was adjusted for Brazil, units were up I
believe in roughly the low single-digit range on an AVONEX year-over-year, rest of world basis. We were comparing
to a very strong Q1 2012 for AVONEX last year. It is always, even outside of some of these tender markets, there's
always some lumpiness in distributor markets in other geographic regions and the tender markets as well. Thanks for
the question.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks for taking the question, and, George, I appreciate your comments on the P&L
situation upfront. I really like the feistiness. On TECFIDERA, back in January, you guys, obviously there's a lot of
enthusiasm around the launch of this product. But it seems that you guys had tempered your enthusiasm a little bit
because one of the unknowns was how well patients were going to stick to therapy in the first month. I was just
wondering if there is any anecdotes or data points or metrics that you can share on the early launch here with respect to
persistency or compliance in therapy that sort of shifts your prior conservatism one way or another? Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Yeah, this is George. Look, I don't think we've tempered our enthusiasm. I think we have
had a fairly consistent view of TECFIDERA now for quite a period of time. We believe it will be the oral drug. We
were and are being realistic about the uptake rate. It's been three-and-a-half weeks since it's been introduced onto the
market. So I think it's a little early to comment on persistency.
But we remain very enthusiastic, and there's no reason not to be, about the prospects for the drug. It's a great label. We
have a great product profile. And our sales force is trained and ready to go. And we're about to start ushering the guests
out of the door.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Thanks for the added color.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks. Another TECFIDERA question for either Tony and/or Paul. We notice that there's a
lot of buzz in the patient community about the QuickStart program and the $10 co-pay assistance plan. Could you talk
about how each of these things are working? And maybe Paul could discuss the impact on revenue recognition and
gross-to-net pricing, and that sort of thing?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, thanks, Eric. It's Tony. So we have a co-pay assistance and other financial
assistance programs, which are I think very good, but typical for the industry. Patients at certain income levels can get
assistance with co-pay. We obviously also have free-drug program, et cetera.
We also have a program with our specialty pharmacies that will allow patients to get started on therapy during the
process of insurance adjudication, which may take a number of weeks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: And then just to add, Eric, it will present a little bit of noise early in the launch, in terms of the
gross-to-net. Obviously, patients that get on drug quickly – those that are judiciously pointed over to the early-start
program won't be paying patients or won't be paying product. So that will affect it.
We do see in the U.S. gross-to-net to be a little bit more favorable than our MS therapies. There's a lot of dimensions to
the gross-to-net, but one of the dimensions within gross-to-net is obviously the government discounts, which has been a
function of CPI over the years for a portion of those.
So at a more steady state in the U.S., we should see kind of a favorable gross-to-net. And then a similar but different –
not a QuickStart – a similar dynamic could happen in some of the international markets as well.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thank you.

<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Great, thanks. I think that a lot of people are looking at third-party data tracking for
TECFIDERA. And obviously I know there's a limited amount of data out there. But is there anything you can comment
about whether or not we should even be looking at this data? Whether it should track similarly, in terms of accuracy or
capture rates with regards to AVONEX? Which I think we can all agree is fairly consistent and accurate.
Are they through the same distribution channels? Is there anything different about [ph] that versus (46:05) AVONEX?
And anything you can comment about third-party data?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, so again, early days to comment on the details of IMS or other. We are not
blocking IMS.
I don't know what the capture rate is in IMS at this point. It's something that will obviously sort out over time or a
couple of weeks in.
We think, over time, IMS should become a reasonable proxy for reality, as it is with AVONEX. On a weekly basis, it
could be a little bit lumpy from time to time. But on a monthly basis, we think, with a mature product like AVONEX,
it's a reasonable proxy. We think at some point that's likely to be the case with TECFIDERA.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Is it all through the same distribution channels, generally?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Similar. This is – our distribution channel is – again, as is typical for these products
– largely specialty pharmacy, broad-based. There'll be some differences from AVONEX, but similar.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: I'd just reiterate Tony's point that – we don't know, right, the answer to that one, as it relates to
your specific question for TECFIDERA.
Our experience as it relates to AVONEX is a given week is a signal-versus-noise issue. But when you look at trended
data, it's actually not too bad to look at. And I think that's our view of the competitive therapies, as well.

Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've got a couple on TECFIDERA.
So I know it's early, but are CBC counts being monitored more closely versus, say, TYSABRI or AVONEX or any
other oral?
And in terms of the baseline, is there sort of a threshold that physicians are settling in at, for TECFIDERA? Or is this
not even part of the conversation? And I have one follow-up on re-imbursement.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Yeah, I mean I mentioned the monitoring requirements in my statements, which are pretty
minimal. It's a CBC within six months of starting dose of TECFIDERA, and then yearly thereafter, or at the discretion
of the physician.
So it's a fairly – I guess I'd characterize it – a fairly light set of monitoring requirements, based on the label that we
have. And I think that that's certainly supported by the data that we've presented to regulators.
We work very closely with them to define what the appropriate monitoring frequency should be, particularly with
respect to lymphocyte counts, as we've discussed. And I think we feel comfortable with where that's come out, and it's
fairly straightforward and fits right into the rhythm of patients coming back to see their treating physicians on sort of an
annual basis.

<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks, just a couple of questions, one on TECFIDERA and the other one on the guidance.
So I'm just trying to understand the TECFIDERA prescriptions for the first full week in the IMS data. I guess I'm
surprised that the average prescription size is 30 days, even though patients should be starting with a 7-day prescription
at 120 milligrams twice a day.
So how should we interpret that? Is that because people are getting that dose as part of the free program, and it's not
being captured as a script? Or are doctors actually writing 7 days at 120 milligrams, and then 21 days at 240
milligrams? Or sometimes what we've seen actually is that there are patients who are actually on a clinical trial and in
long-term extension who then transition off the trial, and start getting drug right away, which would obviously mean a
very different interpretation of these early script data.
And then the guidance question was just on slide 28. You referred to an $0.18 impact from the core business. But when
you look at the changes on a line-by-line basis on the slide before, it doesn't seem like any of those are related to the
core business. I just wanted to understand where that $0.18 positive impact was coming from, related to the core
business.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Thomas, I'll take the second part of the question, and Tony will take the first part.
Just the reconciliation on the guidance – the guidance is driven by the asset purchase, the earmarked
business-development reinvestment, and then the kind of upside in tax and then the core business.
Most of that – our assessment of the core business upside is in Q1. So we just had solid performance – kind of a little
bit of everything around the clock. On the little things on the P&L. AVONEX sales were very strong. We kind of had
some benefit of the FAMPYRA deferred revenue, et cetera, as I had outlined in my conversation.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thomas, we believe that the product is being prescribed per the label with –
physicians are writing for the titrated dose, which is recommended.
Frankly, I don't understand the inner workings of how IMS may be capturing that versus 14-day. I can't comment on
that.

Your next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew J. Andrews>: Good morning. This is Matthew Andrews calling in for Brian. Thanks for the
opportunity to ask a question.
One more on TECFIDERA. Can you give us your thoughts relative to the FDA's post-marketing requirements? In
particular, this abuse-potential study that you have to conduct? What's the rationale? What's the agency looking for?
And that's it. Thank you.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: I wouldn't read too much – this is Doug. I wouldn't read too much into that, beyond the
fact that it has become somewhat standard practice to run studies like that with newly approved medicines.
So I think if you look at our post-approval commitments, they are what I would characterize as very standard. And that
particular study you called out has become a very standard part of the post-marketing commitments for any new drug
that's approved.

<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wondering first – and apologies, I hopped on a little
bit late.
But in terms of the new guidance. So if I look at what the delta is on an absolute revenue basis from your old guidance
to the midpoint of your new guidance, it's about $380 million. But yet in the slides you were calling out specifically on
TYSABRI $425 million to $475 million incremental revenue. So just wondering what the delta is there between those
two pieces?
And then was wondering longer-term, if you can provide us on any update on your thoughts on cap allocation here,
post the approval of TECFIDERA? Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Terry, I don't think there's anything magical to the delta. The revenue guidance is really driven
by the TYSABRI asset purchase, and bringing in the full 100% in the United States for the last three quarters of the
year.
My guess is that the delta that you're kind of referring to there is simply rounding or something like that – using
different – at the 10% and at the 17%. So I don't think there's really anything more to it than that.
I think the read-through on the top-line guidance is it's driven by TYSABRI. We will obviously – it's early days for
TECFIDERA, and we'll obviously kind of monitor that as we walk through the year.
We are going to be – with respect now to capital allocation, I think the deployment early in the second quarter
obviously was a big deal. Of note, also in the first quarter, we paid off $450 million of the 2013 notes that came due.
And I think what we will now be spending a lot more time thinking about the next five years of capital deployment.
And essentially, I think our order of priority certainly is strategic deployment on Phase I/Phase II assets. That has
proved extremely good for the company to build sustainable pipeline, a sustainable growth engine. And then we'll look
for various ways to return capital to shareholders, if we have excess cash.

Your next question comes from Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Marshall Urist>: Hey, guys, good morning Thanks for taking the question. So a TECFIDERA question for me.
I just wondered, Tony, if you could dig in a little bit more in your comments about reimbursement? I know you
referenced some step edits and everything else. But I just wanted to get a little bit better sense of that process. And I
guess specifically how does that really differ from normal course of business from what you typically see for your other
MS products? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, so nothing unusual, I think, for products of this type and in this category.
Look, we have a managed-care team that's out engaging with payers to talk about formulary inclusion. That includes
medical discussions, economic discussions that unfold over several months. So that's all planned and under way.
In the short term, the payers in this category – and this has happened for the other new entrants – typically will ask for
some kind of prior authorization or step edit that requires some paperwork and justification from the physician office.
So it is an additional hurdle that takes place, while you are trying to get on formulary. We, again, with our specialty
pharmacy partners and our internal resources, we're working with physician offices to help them get through that
additional step and get patients on therapy.
So different than AVONEX and TYSABRI in that is a launch product, and it's not at steady state, obviously. So we
have this additional hurdle. But not different from other MS products, and not, frankly, other specialty products these
days.

Your next question comes from John Sonnier from William Blair. Your line is now open.
<Q - John S. Sonnier>: Okay. Thanks for taking the question.
Just a quick one on PLEGRIDY. I think a question that patients and treaters are going to want to know is how this drug
looks relative to the shorter-acting. And it does beg the question, do you guys have plans to run a non-inferiority study
against either REBIF or AVONEX? Thanks.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Hi, John. This is Doug. No plans to do that study at the moment – the head-to-head
comparison, non-inferiority study that you just mentioned.
And as far as the profile of the drug, I think obviously we were pleased to see the efficacy, in terms of the ARR
reduction, in the sort of mid-to-upper 30% range, which I think places it squarely into the high end of the range for an
interferon therapy.
Tolerability-wise, as I mentioned, what we saw was some injection-site reactions, which are not unexpected with the
sub-cu administered medication, and flu-like symptoms, which are again consistent with what we've seen with the other
interferons. Those tend to be clustered around the time of dosing. So, with the less frequent dosing, we think that this
will be a lower treatment burden for patients with respect to flu-like symptoms.
And coming back to the efficacy parameters, I think the other interesting and somewhat surprising observation was the
impact on disability progression that was seen in both of the treatment arms, both twice-a-month as well as
once-a-month. So, I think that efficacy data is very strong. And I think that tolerability data with respect to AEs, there's
nothing really surprising. And what I'd say is non-interferon like in terms of what was observed. So, pretty pleased with
those results. I think it will position the product very well.

Your next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek from Stifel. Your line is now open.

SMNrx I wonder if you could give us some sense as to the timeline for this and whether you – and how aggressive
you'll be in going after Type II, Type III patients? Which I think is the larger patient group. And on FAMPYRA just
quickly, what price were you able to negotiate in Germany? Thanks.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Do want to take the FAMPYRA one?
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yes Joel, the FAMPYRA price is right around $2,000. So, that's the price that's going forward
in the P&L at this point.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: With respect to SMNrx, again our working assumption right now is that if the trials were
to proceed as we envision them today and this would be two Phase II/III type studies that we'd be looking at data
readouts probably in the 2016 timeframe as George alluded to in his comments. We will be looking at Type II and III
patients and in fact the data that we presented thus far, ISIS presented at the AAN meeting is a combination of both the
Type II and Type III patients. We're obviously interested in the Type I patients as well where as you can imagine, the
sort of medical need is the greatest. ISIS just announced that they'll be starting an infantile study which will be patients
with Type I disease, the most severe form of the disease. And that's largely a PK study to confirm that the sort of
exposure in these neonates is very similar to what we see in the older patients that we treated in the studies that have
been ongoing today. So the program is moving quickly.

We're having a lot of dialog with the regulatory agencies because this is somewhat uncharted territory with respect to
end points and study design issues. But we've had good dialog back and forth and our anticipated timeline would be to
actually have data that we could file, assuming it's positive in a broad cross-section of Type I, II, and III patients in the
2016 timeframe.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thank you.
