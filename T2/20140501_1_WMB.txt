MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone. Welcome to today's Williams and Williams Partners' First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded.
And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking
statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in
our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation material.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thanks, John and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us. It's certainly exciting to be reporting
another great quarter and really on all key measures. But before we dig into the quarterly results, I want to remind you
that we remain very committed to our natural gas focused strategy and we continue to have – and this strategy really
continues to have us right in the middle of some great opportunities and really we couldn't be more excited about the
way we're seeing the tailwinds build for the opportunities that we've positioned ourselves for.
This has certainly been a wave that we've been seeing building for quite some time and we think we've got ourselves in
the perfect position to catch this wave. And certainly as we see a lot of our major projects start to come on here in the
last half of this year, and really for many years to come, we've just got a tremendous wave of great projects that we've
been working so hard on to get out in front of. So we certainly see it, the wave, building here in the first quarter and
through our guidance period and then well beyond. And we look forward to talking about that well beyond, certainly at
our upcoming Analyst Day.
So we are also well-positioned to return this value to our shareholders for many years to come with our
industry-leading dividend at WMB and as well our solid and very visible distribution growth at WPZ. So today we'll
talk about key measures for our first quarter results. We'll talk about the continued project execution and development
that we've got ongoing, discuss the drivers for our 2014 and 2015 guidance range. And I'll provide a little bit of color
on Bluegrass, the current situation which has improved for us dramatically at Opal and then I'll briefly touch on our
future growth. So as I did say though, a lot of that future growth and a lot of opportunities to really dig into at our
upcoming Analyst Day.
So getting in here to the first quarter and looking at our very strong first quarter operating results, I think the real big
keys for this quarter from my perspective is: one, first of all, we're continuing to see our fee-based revenues drive. And
so we saw a 9% increase over the prior year's quarter, and we continue to see strength on that.
We certainly had a tough winter, but I will tell you that our teams did a great job of driving reliable services. And,
certainly, we had some production outages upstream of our systems. But for the most part, our teams were able to keep
our systems up and running and available through some very difficult wintertime. So I want to commend our teams
who really had some great focus on that this year and did an extraordinary job on that.
Also, our 17% growth in DCF, which was really driven by the $63 million increase in the fee-based revenue growth
and as well the $8 million lower maintenance CapEx. And, of course, that lower maintenance CapEx was really driven
as well by a pretty harsh winter that made it hard for us to get out and get some of the work that we would have
expected to get done in the first quarter, done.
You will see – obviously, you'll see that those costs continue to build on the maintenance capital side of the build here
in the second quarter, as things thaw out and we're able to get in to get a lot of that work done. So bottom line, great
quarter, great start to the year, with many large catalysts for growth ahead of us in the last half of 2014 and certainly
beyond 2014.
Moving on to the growth that we expect through our guidance period, this is something we're really excited about. A
greater than 50% growth in our DCF from 2013 to 2015 and, of course, that really is on the backs of all of these big
projects that we've been working so hard on and investing so much capital into.

And you'll see a lot of that growth is going to be driven by about a $900 million increase in our fee-based revenues
comparing 2013 to 2015. And as well, though, I think something that's really impressive on this front, as we look at our
cost structure, really a pretty small increase in our cash operating expenses relative to the size of this growth because a
lot of this growth is already built out in terms of our assets being well positioned in the Northeast. And, as well, they're
along a lot of our existing right-of-ways and just additive to our existing lines of business. So our increased cash cost is
really not that high and so we see a nice increase in our margin over the period as well.
For 2014, some of the drivers, they certainly remain the same. Certainly, we're very focused on the June restart at
Geismar and also the successful recovery of our BI insurance proceed and those two things obviously go together. And
so we continue to be very focused on getting that done.
And I would say, on that front, John Dearborn is here to address more of that, but we're certainly still within the
window that we've been describing. And we'll be looking forward to starting up probably in the last half of June. And
I'll remind you, a start-up isn't a simple push of the button, and we are starting to return systems, various auxiliary
systems, into service as we speak. But again a lot of work left to be able to get hydrocarbons into the facility and
fracked.
We're seeing a planned ramp-up in the drilling in the Northeast G&P area. We've got great tailwinds building behind
this area. And certainly the strong gas prices are a boost to that. And so we're pretty excited about how we're positioned
there, but we do a lot have a lot of growth in the plan and Jim Scheel's here to address that.
Finally, our commodity prices, we certainly have got a clear explanation of what we're at risk to there on our
commodity prices. And I would tell you the thing I probably got my eye on the most relative to our plan today is higher
gas prices, which of course would impact our processing margins in the short-term. I think in the long-term, that's a
very strong positive for us because it's going to continue to drive volumes, not just in the Northeast, but it will drive
volumes in the West as well.
So I think that while we may see some short-term impact into processing margin, if we get above that average that
we've got stated, I think we're pretty excited to see that because it's really going to drive the kind of growth in our
basins and drive our volumes higher.
Finally, ethylene prices are certainly an obvious driver, but nice to see the very significant improvement we've seen
here in the last couple of weeks. And I'll tell you that John Dearborn and his team have done a pretty good job of
calling that. And so we're excited to bring Geismar back up right into running when there's a great need for those
ethylene particularly on the Mississippi riverfront.
In 2015, we get a big boost from all of the big 2014 projects being on for a full year. So you'll note many of our big
projects are coming on in the last half of the year, so in 2015 we get a full year of that. And then another round of fully
contracted projects that come online in 2015 as Transco continues to connect this tremendous demand for the Marcellus
supply into these markets that are rapidly expanding as well.
So the great capital investment opportunities continue to be a big opportunity. And certainly are going to drive great
cash flow growth. But I think looking to the next slide, an even more important change to WPZ really is the fact that
because we've been investing – been funding so much of this growth on the equity side, now we're going to be able to
rebalance to the debt side as these big projects come online.
And so as you can see here, on this slide titled growth plans require minimal WPZ equity and no WMB equity, that is
really powerful for the whole story, because, again, very limited needs for capital in the foreseeable future on WPZ
because of all of the equity we've issued positioning ourselves over the last couple of years. And so for 2014 all we're
seeing is a little bit of entrance into the ATM space on the equity side. And then no equity planned for 2015 at WPZ. So
great reward coming back to our equity side of our balance sheet.
Moving onto the next slide here, relatively modest growth in the WPZ CapEx. This is driven by the recently announced
1.2 Bcf a day contract to serve Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG facility. We're very excited to capture that business. And a
very nice piece of business for us because pretty limited capital for the size of the market that we're capturing there.

And that's a very long-term, well-secured contract, so we're very excited about that. And then, as you can see, in WMB,
a very fairly significant reduction in capital driven by us pulling Bluegrass from our capital plans at this point.
So we certainly continue to believe the Bluegrass pipeline is a great project. We certainly think it's the best long-term
solution in the marketplace for getting all these growing NGLs from the Northeast, from both the Utica and the
Marcellus into the Gulf Coast, but however we're not going to stick our necks out for the sake of the industry on that.
We've got great projects in our wheelhouse and a lot of tremendous opportunity. It just put us in a very envious position
of not having to stretch for that project. And so we certainly hope that Bluegrass or something like it gets built for the
sake of the space, but that's really going to be up to the shippers and producers to determine if they want to support a
project like that.
So we remain ready and able to push ahead on that project, but are plenty happy with all the great long-term contracted
business we're getting in the other sectors of our business.
Moving on to looking at a few of the milestones that – and the challenges here among executing large-scale value
creating projects here on slide six. And really this is really just to highlight a few of the milestones and challenges that
we are tackling this year. And this slide really is just the top of the wave of all the growth that we're executing on this
year. On the next slide, we'll see some of the bigger projects moving forward. So a few things I want to highlight,
though, here. First of all, on Transco, what a great position we continue to enjoy on Transco. And it's not just moving
the Marcellus and the Utica supplies out of the Northeast; it's really being driven even in a larger scale by market
growth on our system.
And so just here in the last couple of weeks, we've announced major progress on 1.9 Bcf a day of new markets, just in
the Southeast. So that doesn't include a lot of the market expansions we're seeing that go with Atlantic Sunrise, and
with Rockaway and Virginia Southside. This is just the Southeast markets proper. So 1.9 Bcf a day and, in fact, we
really are going to be working to make sure we keep the supplies delivering to these projects like the Dalton Lateral,
the Gulf Trace project that we mentioned a while ago and as well the Mobile Bay South III, which adds about $325
million a day to meeting some critical gas generation loads in the Southeast.
On Gulfstar, I just really want to give a big shout out to our team on the E&C side on this one. They really pulled it
together with some great designs and great planning on the Gulfstar operations to get that spar set. We got that spar set
in an offshore window of about four weeks. And that is, according to the experts we deal with out there that are in the
business of setting a lot of this, a record for getting in and out of the major offshore campaign there. So, that does not
come with luck; that comes with great planning. And just very proud of our team and the way they executed on that.
We're also very excited because we think this is going to be a huge success for Hess and Chevron on their Tubular
Bells prospect.
And we think with that kind of success comes more. And we think it's going to be a great project for them as they look
back and look at the project returns they're going to gain out of this. But it also helps other customers in the area like
Noble and we're helping them deliver Gunflint in extremely attractive schedule and returns for that project for them as
well. And so this is exactly what we're hoping to do is to help to create value for both our customers and for our
shareholders at the same time and Gulfstar is a great example of that.
Regarding several of the incidents that we've had lately, first of all, our Opal gas processing facility, and as you'll notice
we did bring back two of those trains back overnight. And we are – we had shut those down last week following a fire
at the facility. Those facilities weren't damaged in any way, but just as an abundance of caution, we had shut that down
to make sure we inspected everything and make sure we were safe before we came back into service out there. We have
two other trains that also were not damaged in the fire and that is train four and train five. And with those four trains
on, we have adequate capacity to serve all of our existing business out there. So we'll be working hard to get trains four
and five back on. But we're going to make sure that we do it safe first. And that's what we're focused on right now.
So, I think regarding these incidents, Williams, we've always been very focused on being safe and being reliable. And
certainly this has come as a big surprise to our organization. I can tell you that this has my full attention and the
attention of our board as well. We're conducting very thorough investigations into each incident and see – determine if

there's any common or root cause that's common to these incidents.
And I'll tell you one thing that is common, which is a bit surprising perhaps, is that these historically have been some of
our safest facilities when you look at typical industry standard for safety. And certainly have been – had gotten high
marks from regulators previously kind of across the board. So anyway, that's the one thing that's common, but we're
looking hard to determine what other contributing factors may be out there and to make sure what we're doing as an
enterprise to make sure that we're doing our business in as safe a manner as possible. Not just for our own benefit, and
our employees' benefit, but for the industry's benefit as well.
So you'll expect – you should expect to hear a little more on that on our safety performance at the upcoming Analyst
Day as well. And then one final note on this slide, I'd just like to commend the team at ACMP and Access Midstream,
continue to drive great performance for us. And that is certainly continuing to drive our growth in 2014 and beyond.
Looking to slide – to the next slide here, certainly a very large increase in our projects. And just tremendous backlog
that we're building here. A couple of things you can pull off of this slide, first of all, you'll see a line drawn in between
our WMB projects – sorry – at the top, our WPZ projects and then we draw a line for the WMB projects.
And you can see we continue to develop a pretty significant backlog of drop-down opportunities for WPZ at the WMB
level. And so that certainly should not be missed. And as well, I will tell you this is really just the result – this long
backlog of great contracted projects is really the fruits of sticking to our strategy and being very focused around
catching this wave of natural gas market growth both on the supply and the demand side.
We think by far we have the best visible contracted growth and it's certainly well beyond any of the other large-cap
midstream players including Kinder, Enterprise or Energy Transfer. And much of this growth is driven off of our very
well-positioned assets and the kind of investments we've made over the last several years, gaining our position that we
have today. Our strategy, we think, is very much in line with our customers and their access to markets. And that's
driving a lot of our benefit as well.
And then we remain very, very focused on connecting the very best supplies in North America to the very best market,
both for natural gas and for the natural gas derivatives that are coming because those are obviously low-cost, into the
markets they serve as well. So a very attractive set of backlog here and I'll tell you this continues to grow. And it really
just continues to present opportunities for us to allocate capital for the very best projects.
Moving to the final slide here, certainly going to continue right along our strategy. And this great line of sight that we
have to the major growth. We continue to contribute beyond guidance in terms of new projects and new growth. And
we really look forward to talking to you about that at our Analyst Day.
And finally I would just say we're focused on the business that's going to be there for the long haul. We're not just
focused on the opportunity du jour. We're really focused on where we can gain a competitive advantage and reward our
shareholders not just in the short term, but a great focus on sustainable investments that are supported by a long-term
market trend and competitive advantages.
And so we think that will continue to generate opportunity for not just years but decades given the kind of position that
we're staking out in the space and we're very excited about what that means for our shareholders long-term.
And so with that I'll turn it over to the questions.

<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Just a couple of quick questions first on Northeast G&P. So your segment profit in 1Q
was $12 million, but you also maintained your full-year guidance of $195 million which suggests a pretty meaningful
ramp up, so could you maybe just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes driving this and then also what some
of the main risks may be to this ramp?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Hi. This is Jim Scheel. Thanks for the question, Abhi. As we looked at this winter, this has
been one of the worst winters we've had in the Northeast. And I know, over the course of the last few meetings about
the reliability of the OVM [Ohio Valley Midstream] system, in particular, there have been some challenges with that.
Those we didn't face this year and so volume challenges that we had were more on the producer side versus the asset
side that we're operating. So we're very excited about having a reliable system ready to move gas, especially, in this
market of ever-increasing prices for our customers.
We see a rather rapid ramp-up of volume over the course of this year. Obviously, we saw a 2% growth between the
fourth quarter and the first quarter. But I want to remind you, Abhi, that during the fourth quarter of last year we had
some incremental volumes coming into OVM due to the Natrium fire. Those did not materialize or weren't in there
during the first quarter this year and we still saw an increase.
As we move through the course of the year, I would expect our volumes to be slightly under, perhaps, what we've
shown on our spreadsheet as the 335 average. But I want to emphasize we'll probably end the year with a much – with
above the 400 that we're showing.
So I'm excited about the asset's ability to move the volumes to reach those goals. One of the key risks that we may need
to look at is related to the Chevron well pad fire and how they react to that with bringing volumes online later in the
year.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: This is Don Chappel. Just to add to Jim's comments, I'd also just remind you again, we're
bringing a number of processing and frac facilities online during the year. And even on the volumes – on the growing
volumes, those will provide additional fees. So we'll not just get the volume growth, but we'll get additional fees for
additional services.
<A - James E. Scheel>: To add to that – that's a great point, Don – we will be bringing on a number of facilities
around OVM very quickly. We're already starting the pre-commissioning of these assets that include the stabilizer that
will provide a much larger netback for our producers around their stabilized condensate.
The de-ethanizer – I want to add that's going to be a great asset for our customers. Again, we've had some restrictions
in the ability to get product into the interstate pipelines because of ethane content over the course of the last couple
months. With the de-ethanizer online, that will no longer be an issue. It will allow basically unfettered flow out of the
assets into the interstate.
And then as we bring on additional capacity on the west side of the system with the 24-inch line coming in, we're
excited about the ability to fill up our cryos and continue the execution of building more cryos at the Oak Grove facility
as we move forward.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay, great. And just shifting gears a little bit, just a broader question on maintenance
spending. So this appears to be trending lower over the coming years, despite kind of more projects being put into
place. But we've also seen some of the operational problems that you referenced. So, I guess, how should we think
about all this? Do you need to spend more going forward or are efficiencies making up for it? Any color here would be
very helpful.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Sure. I would just tell you that, if we look over time, we've been at the – and I'm not
sure if it's good or bad, but we've been in the lead in having more maintenance capital as a percentage of our EBITDA,
if you look back over the last four years or so.

And that is really just driven by our focus on making absolutely sure that we're spending dollars wherever we can to
improve safety and reliability on our systems. We'll continue to do that. I would just tell you that we got a lot of work
out of the way, a lot of the big expensive work done out-of-the-way in terms of in 2012.
And that's for a number of reasons. Some regulatory, required, but as we inspected our lines, we went to the areas
where we thought we would have the worst conditions on our systems. And as we've moved off of that group,
obviously, we get to the newer and newer systems and the systems with less potential anomalies in it. And so our cost
per mile of inspected pipe is coming down dramatically on us because we're getting into the better and better pipe. So,
we saw kind of a big run-up there in 2011 and 2012 driven by things like the Clean Air Act and some pipeline
inspection rules and that was really kind of driving that.
So, not telling you that you should expect that to continue to go lower, because we don't have that built into our plan.
But so far, just the things that we've been hitting lately, as we inspect our pipes, we've had less repairs required. So, we
basically have to forecast what we do expect to find with our in-line inspection tools and our pipeline inspections. We
basically have to estimate how much of that we'll have to repair and that's been coming down over time just again
because we're into the better – some of our better condition pipe.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Okay, got it. And then one last quick one if I may. So, I guess one of the emerging debate
in the industry is the viability of the export market for ethane. And you guys are in a unique position to evaluate this.
So, could you maybe just share your thoughts on this in terms of where the supply/demand balance is headed
longer-term in your view? How big of a market you think this could be? Any color there would be great.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'm going to ask John Dearborn. He is quite the student of that issue. I'm going to ask him
to offer his thoughts on that.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Hi, Abhi. Thanks very much. It is an interesting idea. I think I'm a bit schizophrenic on the
idea, so let's talk about both sides. From one perspective, you'd really like to see some better price signals out there on
ethane so that the necessary infrastructure gets built. And you'd get supply reliability to the industry – to the
petrochemical industry which, of course, we're a participant of, but of course that could been ethane prices going up.
So, moving some ethane offshore, I think begins to increase some of the demand, which perhaps begins to create a
better balance there so that we do get the infrastructure that provides the supply reliability, which then assures on the
demand side that people continue to invest capital.
On a very positive note, though, and I can't speak to the project that was recently announced, but on a very positive
note to projects like this, I think there's also an opportunity because there are some shortages out there in the world for
ethylene that we could export some ethylene from some of these ethane facilities. And I think that bodes well for the
ethylene balance in North America, which would be a very positive dynamic for us with our investment at Geismar
today.
So, I see a fair bit of positive there. Exactly how big the market is going to be for ethane export, that's a difficult
challenge, a difficult question to answer right now, but I do see positive dynamics on the – potentially on the ethylene
side.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Great. Thanks for all the color.

<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just maybe a micro and a macro question. First, on the micro
side, with respect to Geismar – and, Don, perhaps, this is for you – if you could just give us an update on when you see
the next tranche of insurance recoveries coming?
And, I guess, perhaps, an associated question is to the extent that what was in the first quarter adjusted EPS was a
relatively large healthy number for Geismar. Given that amount, do you see business interruption actually being

sustained through the outage period or are we going to see a little bit of a gap between that ending and the plant coming
back online?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Good morning, Carl. In terms of the next tranche of cash, I would expect we'll see some
cash in the second quarter. We've made an application with the insurers for the next period of loss and it's going
through their process. So I would expect we'll see some cash in the second quarter.
I think we've disclosed that our business interruption insurance combined with our property damage insurance would
substantially offset the downtime. We think that's still the case. Exactly what that is will be dependent on the Geismar –
let's call them – pro forma margins, had Geismar been up and running, and as well as our negotiations with the
insurance companies. But I don't think anything has really changed. I think we're about where we were the last time we
talked.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Fair enough. Thank you. And then maybe a macro question for Alan. And this might, perhaps,
start getting into 2016 thoughts. But I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the ramifications, perhaps, of not
doing Bluegrass in the sense of do you think that, for instance, what had happened with Atlantic Sunrise where you had
to see that train hitting the market before people were willing to sign on to long-term contracts?
Without bluegrass, do you see, perhaps, the industry needing to get hit first before we will see longer-term contracts?
But, ultimately, I'm trying to kind of get to – are you more nervous than before, perhaps, of 2016 drilling activity? So I
know that's kind of an open-ended question, but any additional color there would help.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Carl, great, great questions, as always. I would just tell you that, certainly, I think that there
is a lot of people kind of counting on somebody else solving the problem as it relates to Bluegrass. And, frankly, we're
not going to be the ones that do that for the whole industry without adequate contractual support. And – but, yet, we
still believe that something needs to get done.
We're very interested in seeing the very best project available to the market come forward and get subscribed, and
whether it's Bluegrass or whether it's a combination of other projects. We're not all that jealous of the opportunity,
frankly, just because we have so many other great investment opportunities and very well contracted opportunities.
But we certainly think that something – a solution does need to get resolved. You used an interesting term there to say
that the train that we would have to hit out here and I would just tell you that that is going to be the issue is, is people
are going to understand in the not-too-distant future that railing all of this product out of the area is just not going to be
a sustainable solution. But I think that's kind of what's got the market thinking it can continue to ignore the longer-term
issue at this point.
So, we're going to remain very engaged in the subject for both our own project and for other potential projects that
might come along. And we'll certainly stand by ready with Bluegrass for the industry if it becomes adequately
supported by contract.
You are correct, that I do see this a little bit like Atlantic Access where the market just wasn't quite ready for it and just
didn't feel the pain quite enough yet and I do think that as we get into this summer and into next winter when all – a lot
of this new production starts to ramp up. As for our forecast, our forecast that we see through Access and our forecast
that we see through Blue Racer, we see a lot of liquids coming into the market. And we're certainly hopeful that we can
get a project supported that will not deter drilling in 2016 because this is some tremendous resource out here. And we're
going to have to work as an industry to come up with the right market access. And we certainly look forward to being a
part of that.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. And just to sort of paraphrase back though, you're thinking that with the supply models
that you all are seeing, that we could in fact see that pain as early as next winter?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: If you look at the ramp-up in volumes that we're expecting, I think we will see some pretty
big improvement in volumes.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. Thanks, guys.

We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Congrats on a great quarter.
<A>: Thanks, Christine.
<Q - Christine Cho>: I noticed last quarter that your ownership in Caiman Energy II had moved higher and this
quarter's data book confirmed an incremental 11% at book. Can you tell us about who sold and was management
included? Also can you discuss how the exit plan for the private equity guys work? Do you have the right of first
refusal and then it goes to Dominion and then any third-party?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, this is Don Chappell. We had an option in our Caiman II deal to increase our
ownership by funding a disproportionate amount of the capital investment. So we chose to – we had a good look at how
the business was developing. We liked what we saw, so we exercised our option to invest a greater amount than our
partners. And increase our ownership accordingly. So we did that. In terms of the exit, we have a right of first offer on
the sale. So we'll see what the sellers choose to do.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. We noticed some of the majors receiving permits in Marshall and Wetzel counties
in, you know, first quarter, and the very end of fourth quarter. But I was unable to tell if they were Utica or Marcellus.
Can you provide any insight into any updates on their plans to develop the acreage? Also, you know, one of the majors
also had an impressive well in the Utica in Marshall County. Can you talk about what that may mean for you on a
near-term and longer-term basis if the play is as great as the IP rates could suggest?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Sure. This is Jim Scheel. I'll let the majors speak for themselves as far as any specifics related
to their forecast, but I will say generically we've had a number of folks in our offices talking about the additional
drilling specifically around the Utica dry. I would say there's an upside opportunity for us at OVM to be gathering some
of that Utica dry gas into our system.
Gathering that for them, we have some extra capacity at the plants today so that wouldn't impact our liquids volumes to
provide us with the near-term additional opportunity. Right now that's not baked into our plans, but I think what you'll
see is as folks are delineating that dry side you'll see more and more permits issued so they get a better feel for what
they have in that particular area.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then I noticed you started to kind of put the Pacific Connector in your slides. Is it
looking like the probability of Jordan Cove is moving forward is getting higher? And something that I thought was
interesting was that we've seen some pipeline projects for other LNG facilities contingent on the LNG project receiving
FERC approval and not necessarily FID. For you can you discuss a little bit what has to happen for you guys for it to
move out from under the potential project umbrella and into development?
<A - Allison G. Bridges>: Yes, certainly. This is Allison Bridges. Yeah, we are very excited for all of the progress that
we are seeing on Jordan Cove and Pacific Connector. We have nonbinding agreements with shippers so that would
really exceed the total capacity. Before we would be ready to, I guess, move to approval for that project, we will be
looking to turn those nonbinding agreements into binding agreements.
We are hopeful that we will get the FERC certificate perhaps by the end of this year or early next year. So that is
another major milestone. I will say with respect to the FERC certificate, the route that we have on Pacific Connector
was actually previously approved by FERC. So we think it's just a matter of timing on that.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Well, I wasn't actually talking about FERC approval for the pipeline. I was talking about FERC
approval for the LNG project. But it sounds like for you it has nothing to do with the LNG projects you're seeing for

FID. It's the customers just have to contract with you?
<A - Allison G. Bridges>: No. I mean, we certainly are working jointly and expect the same FERC approval timing
and customer commitments for both Jordan Cove and Pacific Connector.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then last question for me, the Gulf Trace project, is that like just zone three max
rate? Is that how we should think about that?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, you want to take that, please?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yes. Christina, this is Rory Miller. That project is a – it's a negotiated rate. It will eventually
be rolled in and so it's a little bit lower than what the postage stamp rate would be, and therefore it's required to be
rolled in.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll hear next from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. Just wanted to talk about use of cash a bit at WMB now that you've canceled Bluegrass.
How should we think about the disposition there, whether it's passed to the dividends, maybe it's M&A, or obviously
you do have a big backlog of projects that you're developing potentially up at WMB? Can you just talk us through that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, this is Don. One, we do have – obviously we have dividend, but in terms of the excess
cash flow at Williams, beyond the 20% annual dividend increase that we've guided to, we do have some projects that
are in development that we've highlighted here and that cash is earmarked for those projects. Beyond that, we'll have a
high-class problem of choosing whether or not we have any additional projects or we just roll that cash into an even
greater dividend.
So we're moving more and more to a, I'll call it, a pure play holdco model. And as WPZ financial capacity grows, we
would expect more of the organic growth to be funded at WPZ and less so at Williams. And again, so moving more and
more to a GP holdco where Williams can put all – substantially all of our excess cash flow into the dividend.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. And then if I can ask about Geismar 2, can you just give us some more color about what
that exactly is? Is it an expansion, is it a greenfield? How big is it? What's the capital? Just maybe some rough numbers
there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Geismar 2 is – we're out in the market right now trying to
assess the market's interest in participating in an investment there. Our concept, and we're going to be talking more
about this at the analyst meeting coming up or analyst day coming up in New York, but our concept there is to build a
cost advantaged large cracker. It would be greenfield. We have expanded Geismar, if I can call it Geismar 1 for a
moment, about as big as Geismar 1 could be expanded. I think we're about done with expansion save for perhaps some
incrementals there. So that's a concept between about what we're thinking on another investment on the river in
ethylene.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: But you would do it as a JV or you would do it as a standalone by yourself?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. The current concept is we're considering a JV with perhaps one, at most two, other
partners that would build derivative capacity alongside it, so creating new demand, and then we would take our
volumes and sell them into the market on a fee-for-service basis.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: I see. Okay. And then if I can just ask one more, as we're thinking about Transco and the
ultimate – and the growth in the Marcellus, even in the Northeast, as you look at three to five years here and the ability
to do backhauls down to the Southeast, what do you think is the ultimate capacity that Transco could move in that
direction? And then maybe can you talk about the incremental capital you might need to spend to achieve that

throughput?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, would you take that, please?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. I'd be happy to take that. If you think over the last couple of years, we've had a series of
projects that were primarily designed to move Marcellus supply into the traditional market areas on Transco, the first
was our Northeast supply link. The second was Leidy Southeast. The third was Constitution. Now, that's not impacting
the Transco system at all, but it's certainly pulling reserves out of that area. And then the fourth project is Atlantic
Sunrise. And all of those projects, or at least the three Transco projects, had the feature of taking advantage of some of
the latent capacity or latent capabilities that existed on the system to be backhauled or to be designed to change the
flow from North to South.
As we start moving beyond the volumes that we currently have contracted, the costs do start to go up. And so I think
the big question there is where's the market for service for producers in that area to get to an end user that they can
contract with to take their gas? And the market's going to have to be higher than, say, the market that was established
for Atlantic Access for us to do more.
However, if you start looking at new greenfield projects out of the area, you'll be looking at rates far in excess of the
rates that we contracted for on Atlantic Sunrise. So I know that's a little bit unclear on – as to the question you asked,
but on a per unit basis, the capital required is going to be higher on future projects than it has been on the projects in the
past.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. That's helpful color. I'll leave it at that. Thanks.
Operator
We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi. Good morning. With regards to Bluegrass, do you anticipate that this could be a project you
would revisit within a year or two? And I guess do you have the contract set up with Boardwalk to enable you to do this
especially on, I guess, their ability to repurpose part of their pipeline?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Certainly, we have a great relationship with boardwalk. And I would tell you that
we're working to make sure that if there is a project there that makes sense, we've got the ability to move forward with
the project. And at the same time, Boardwalk's got the rights, under certain conditions, has the rights to utilize that
capacity for gas if they see a demand or a higher value in that direction after a certain period of time here.
And so I think we've struck the right balance between us in terms of how to move forward on the project. So I think it's
really kind of a matter of time. I think for the meantime, I think there's plenty of alternative uses or alternative ways to
move gas south. And quite a bit of capacity to do that on various lines including two other existing Texas gas lines that
would still be in gas service. So – or on Boardwalk's system.
So I would leave that to Boardwalk to answer a little more – in a little more fine manner, but from our vantage point,
we've struck the right balance that allows us to keep Bluegrass on the table and also under certain conditions allows
them to move forward with something that makes sense for Boardwalk.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. That's helpful. And any estimate on the potential financial impact of the Opal incident?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, this is Don. We expect a $10 million impact on property damage with the excess
property damage covered by insurance. We expect the, I'll call it, the business interruption loss to be very modest
particularly given that we already have two of the plants back up in operation and we're hopeful that we can bring the
other two undamaged plants into operation in the not-too-distant future. So expect $10 million in property damage and
a very modest loss related to the downtime.

<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And any update on the regulatory front for Constitution? And perhaps the timing of that
project?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, do you want to take that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Sure. On Constitution, we have started getting into some of the typical project milestones. The
FERC issued a favorable draft environmental impact statement back on February 12 and they had asked for comments
by April 7. A lot of parties were asking to get that date extended. The FERC did not do that and held fast with their
schedule. And we appreciated that. I would say in general, the FERC has been very workmanlike in terms of laying out
a plan and sticking to it. So we're very satisfied with what the FERC has been doing so far. They've been trying to, I
think, do their part in terms of helping us get projects built.
Right now, we're working with FERC and the New York DEC in a coordinated fashion to try to get any of the
remaining questions answered and the details checked off with the hope that we're going to get a final decision
sometime later this year. But it is part of a process and I'd say it's moving well. But at the end of the day, there's
probably more things that are uncontrollable in terms of going through the regulatory process than there are in terms of
doing just the actual physical construction.
In terms of in-service date, I think, right now, I'd say that what we've guided to so far is – those are still good
assumptions.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

We will hear next from ISI Group, Timm Schneider.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Hey, guys. How is it going? I just had a follow-up question on the maintenance CapEx.
Obviously, it was $36 million in Q1. You addressed so many weather issues. But if I go off your full year guidance of
$340 million, does that kind of imply, I just want to get the arithmetic right, that this actually jumps to $100 million
over the next three quarters?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It actually, if you look at our pattern of spending on that, Timm, you'd see that second
quarter is always kind of our highest, because we've got a lot of work going on kind of winding up, waiting for a thaw
out, and so I would say generally you'll see our heaviest spending on maintenance capital in the second quarter,
followed by fairly high third quarter and then it tends to taper off in the fourth quarter because winter starts to impact
our ability to get work done there again so, I think if you look back to our historical patterns, that's what you should
expect.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: But there's no change at this point to that $340 million?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That is correct.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Got it. And then next question on OVM, can you just kind of give us a sense of what
utilization rate these assets were running at in the first quarter and what is kind of implied to get to your 2014
guidance?
<A - James E. Scheel>: OVM was running during the first quarter of this year; let me look at this real quick. We were
running at about 271 a day. We, obviously, have a lot more capacity coming online than that. I'm really not focused on
the capacity issue right now. We can take everything that customers can bring to us. We're anticipating having that
growing to over 400 by the end of the year.
What I'm the most focused on as it relates to capacity really are the issues related to the new assets coming online this
year. That will help us both from increasing our fee-based revenue to also maximizing our customer netback. And so as
you see the second and third quarter come online with those incremental assets, that's what we'll be really focusing on

and then we'll be taking all the gas that customers can produce out of OVM.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Got it. And last question for me is on Atlantic Sunrise, is there any read through on the
regulatory front that you guys have picked up from Constitution versus that, or is it just a completely different ballgame
because it's more looping and just compression?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, Timm, I'll take that. First of all, I think one of the major differences is we're dealing
primarily with a big chunk of that will be through the State of Pennsylvania. And I would tell you the State of
Pennsylvania has been very businesslike and approach things in a fashion that's very cooperative. And so I think that's
probably one of the biggest differences, frankly. It is not all along existing right-of-way though, just to be clear. There
is some greenfield route coming South of the Leidy diamond, if you will, or the Leidy lateral where it ties back into our
mainline is a greenfield. And so we certainly will have routing issues to deal with there that we don't get to enjoy along
looping our existing line. So there is some existing looping on there, but there's also some greenfield expansion there.
But I would just say the area that we're going through does not deal with some of the New York DEC permitting issues
that we're focusing on at Constitution.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Actually I have one more quick one. In the slide deck you moved the opportunity set you
outlined with Pemex in the Atlantic Gulf segment from 2019 to kind of 2017 and I was wondering if you could talk
about those opportunities in a bit more detail?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. That is gaining some steam I would say. I think Pemex is very focused on developing
those deepwater reserves in a very timely manner for a number of reasons I think. I think their elections are in 2018 and
I think they certainly want to show that. But I would remind you there that 2017 is actually 2017 plus. So, not as big a
change that we were intending to indicate there. But I would say at same time while you asked the question that they
are going to try to accelerate that as much as possible. And that's why a project like or a system like Gulfstar with our
existing pipelines in there and our capabilities is really important to that in terms of speed to the market. So, we're very
excited to be positioned well for that opportunity.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: All right. Thank you.

We hear next from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Becca Followill>: On WPZ and your discussion of not issuing any equity in 2015 and minimal equity in 2014,
can you talk about how far you're willing to lever up at WPZ in terms of debt to EBITDA?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Becca, this is Don. That implies up to a four times debt to equity – excuse me, debt to
EBITDA ratio. So, again, well within BBB investment grade band that WPZ enjoyed. So, really nothing in terms of
levering up, it's just really the cash flows are growing at such a rapid rate that it creates substantial additional debt
capacity.
<Q - Becca Followill>: And does that – can we translate that over to WMB and can you discuss your willingness to go
non-investment grade again?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I think our position is as management team and the Board has chosen to maintain
investment grade at Williams and that's where we're at. But having said that, we'll certainly always be open to looking
at what kind of value we can create and balance that with risk. But again, the management team and the Board have
chosen investment grade at both WPZ and Williams. So, it mitigates some risk during more challenging financial times
and it puts Williams in a more opportunistic position during challenging financial times. And while things are rolling
pretty nicely in the capital markets, we know that on a pretty regular basis, the high yield market does shut down. So,

that's the advantage that having both WPZ and Williams investment grade provides us.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And last question is once again on the Northeast volumes and your guidance for
the year, the $195 million of EBIT for the year. Should we start to see a material ramp-up in the second quarter or is
this going to be very much a backend-loaded kind of thing?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Again, this is Jim Scheel. As we look at the second and third quarter, again to reemphasize,
we'll be bringing on substantial new assets during the end of the second quarter. That will be driving additional
fee-based revenue.
We do see a pretty significant ramp-up during the second – or during the third and fourth quarter. I mentioned earlier I
think in our package that we provided we're showing an average of about 335 million a day for OVM. I think that will
be a little bit short of that as far as the yearly average goes. Right now we're anticipating about 327, but ending the year
at a much higher rate. So in excess of the 400 that we're showing there is our current thoughts around that. So, yes, we
do have a pretty significant ramp-up and I think that's in line with what you see from others whether that would be
ACMP or Blue Racer, also showing pretty significant volume growth as producers take advantage of this gas
environment we're in today.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Great. Thank you, guys.

Our next question comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
<Q - Bradley R. Olsen>: Hey, good morning, guys. I just want to stay on the Northeast and maybe push a little bit
harder on Timm's question, which was related to the utilization rate. Just trying to tie together the kind of disparate
commentary that you hear from the upstream and your midstream peers in the Marcellus. We're hearing some
midstream guys talk about utilization rates for processing assets in the Marcellus that are kind of in the 60% to 70%
range, but at the same time, we're hearing upstream guys continue to mention that they do have wells that are waiting
on pipe or stuck behind infrastructure constraints. And so maybe just kind of go back to that question of utilization
rates and just to make sure I understand Jim's comments talking about the 327 Mcf/d average moving to above 400
Mcf/d by the end of the year. Am I right in thinking that you've got the 500 Mcf/d at Fort Beeler, another 200 Mcf/d at
Oak Grove by the end of this year? And I should think of utilization in excess of 400 Mcf/d across that asset base?
<A - James E. Scheel>: That's right. You know, not – again, I haven't really focused on the ultimate capacity of the
system. We're working to fill up what we've got today, but as we look at Oak Grove coming online with TXP1, you
know we've got the ability to add significantly more cryo capacity at that facility. We can have up to 10 cryos at that
facility. We have a great piece of pipeline. We'll talk to you a little bit more about this at Analyst Day. But when I think
of the total capacity for the OVM system, we're really in excess of 2 Bcf a day. So it's really – we will be able now with
these foundational assets to stay ahead of our customers and so as we see their drilling profiles coming online, we'll be
adding additional infrastructure if necessary. It's not going to be near as much pipe. It will be connecting to the CRPs,
making sure that we have the processing and the compression in place in order to meet their needs.
And what is so nice now is where we have struggled in the past around some of the challenges, as we've come into
2014, we're well-positioned to do that. Customers recognize the increased reliability and our ability to get their gas to
market. So we will build to meet our customers' needs. And we can meet all of the needs that they have today through
our assets as we bring on the stabilization, the de-ethanizer, the ethane line, the additional 24-inch line on the West side
and then TXP1 at Oak Grove. We've got a great story of growth to tell and the ability to meet customer needs.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: So, Brad, just to add a little color, that's a great job by Jim kind of describing the situation
out there. But it is not as simple as just, do I have processing capacity out there? It depends on, do you have the trunk
line laterals to be able to reach out and get the gas? Do you have the air permit requirement to set compression to pick

up the gas? Do you have ethane de-ethanization capacity to be able to not get constrained into the interstate and backup
gas that way? And so it's a tremendous amount of planning required between the producers and the midstream
companies to not have underutilized capacity, but to be able to be drilling where the capacity is.
And I would highlight a perfect example of that great planning that goes on between us and Cabot in the Northeast.
And if you looked at the utilization of our facilities there, you would see it very high and you would also see limited
constrained relative to their activity, limited constrained production on Cabot's part again relative to their tremendous
growth profile that they are on.
And so that's a great example of the kind of planning that can be done and that we'd certainly try to encourage with
customers. And as Jim mentioned earlier, that's starting to be recognized because he's had customers coming into his
office wanting to sit down and make sure that they've got capacity for things like some of this burgeoning Utica drilling
that is really starting to gain some attention right there in the footprint of OVM.
<Q - Bradley R. Olsen>: Great.
<A - James E. Scheel>: Even as a follow-up to Alan as we talk about the Susquehanna supply hub, or formerly ABA,
market area up in the Northeast, our capacity will be going up towards the top end of that as we go through the course
of 2014 into 2015 and we're already thinking ahead of how we can continue to expand that capacity through
compression in order to meet our customer needs across the board.
Those investments and that incremental volume isn't in guidance but those discussions have already started taking place
and working with our customers in order to facilitate all of their needs. And it is a complex issue as AIan was pointing
out. It's one that I think across the Northeast, we're getting much better at.
<Q - Bradley R. Olsen>: Yes. That's great color. I appreciate those comments. And I guess the one final question,
which kind of relates to the comments about the development of the drier gas portion of the Utica, do you think – you
mentioned that you have more of a 2 Bcf a day system in OVM, which I assume refers more to the aggregate gathering
capacity.
Do you think that you'll be more focused on high-pressure gathering services as opposed to incremental processing
once you're done with the Oak Grove build out just due to the fact that the drill bit does seem to be moving towards
drier areas around that Northern West Virginia area?
And then just one final one, which is it looks like the kind of per MCF margin implied by your guidance in Northeast
G&P is significantly higher in the latter half of the year than it is currently and is that just kind of the resulting higher
fees that you're able to collect with stabilization, ethane and the addition of the trunk line that you've got laid out here in
your presentation and that's all. Thanks.
<A - James E. Scheel>: Okay. Well, there are a lot of questions there. Let me start out and let's make sure I don't miss
one, starting out as it relates to the opportunity that surrounds the dry Utica.
I would say, we still continue to be very excited about the West Marcellus. Obviously, we've built a wet system at
OVM. It's one where we have the ability to continue to expand our Cryo facilities in order to meet that need and
maximize netbacks for our customers.
Yes, the incremental improvement in fee-based revenue will come through both increased gathering as well as the
additional services provided to our customers. So that will improve our overall revenue position for OVM.
As it relates to the dry gas area, I think we're perfectly positioned to go and in the near term put some of that dry gas
into our existing system. Obviously, we won't – we'll be running that through the plant but we won't be getting any
liquids for the surplus plant capacity. Right now, we have the ability to do that and work with our customers in order to
help them identify what they've got.
And as far as the resource potential of the dry area, we're all very excited about that potential. To the extent we need to
have a duplicate dry gas system built because I believe, again, I believe a lot of the wet area and to the extent where we

continue to build out that, it would really be a separate dry gas system.
As we think about putting in some of the 24-inch lines, there is the potential, I guess, to repurpose some of our lines.
Those would be – that would be on our planning horizon, as we've talked to the customers. Again, this all really comes
back to making sure we're planning with our customers about what they need and when they need it.
I think that that dialogue is beginning to open up as they learn more about this. And because of our great competitive
position in that marketplace, I think, we're well positioned to meet any of those requirements as they evolve. Again, a
big dry gas build-out, though, is not contemplated in any of the numbers that you see here today. I don't know if that
was every one of the questions, but I think it was.
<Q - Bradley R. Olsen>: No. That's great. And the only other one was just – am I right in thinking that margin per
Mcf is set to increase in the latter portion of the year...
<A - James E. Scheel>: Yes.
<Q - Bradley R. Olsen>: ... in the North?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Yes, it is because of the – the margin will increase because of the additional services we're
providing for OVM. In addition to that, we have some higher revenues coming from the re-contracting around APA.
<Q - Bradley R. Olsen>: Great. Thank you for the detail.

We'll hear next from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Hey. Good morning, Alan.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Thanks a lot for the added color this morning. Just one quick clean-up from me, and
actually it's probably for Don. And this was really just tied to NGL and Petchem. You know, lots of moving parts in the
quarter with BI and the drop-down.
I'm just wondering, if you guys could quantify the DCF impact from the dropped assets for the period owned and sort
of how that compares to the guidance you gave us earlier in the year? I think you were looking for 130 to 150 on the
full year-end. So I'm just wondering how sort of the initial one month of owned DCF sort of stacked up against that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I think our initial guidance, Chris, contemplated three months of ownership at WPZ. And
as it turned out, there was one full month of ownership because the drop-down happened a couple months later than
what we expected when we put out that guidance in the first place. The good news is Williams enjoyed those earnings
for January and February instead. And the one month was about $15 million to $20 million.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. And then you guys – just a quick follow-up on that. You guys had some tie-in
issues and third-party disruptions in 4Q up there. I'm just wondering if all that's resolved at this point.
<A - James E. Scheel>: Yeah. That's a great question. And, yes, we did through the first quarter. We're tightlined to
Suncor up there. They did have some operating issues at the upgrader, which reduced our volumes approximately by
about 20%. At the end of the quarter, all of those issues were resolved, and we're back to full volumes. So, looking
forward, we can expect Canada to deliver at its full potential.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Great. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it.
