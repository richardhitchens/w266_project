With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone.
We entered this year with strong momentum, and we are seeing our strategic investments driving an excellent start to
2013. Earnings per share of $0.68 was up 15.3%. Our investment returns are improving and becoming more evident in
our results.
Our strategic focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation and growth. By investing
consistently in these networks and platforms, we have positioned the business to take advantage of growth
opportunities in the rapidly evolving markets for broadband, video and cloud services. Our investment in 4G LTE
enables us to provide a superior customer experience in wireless broadband and video. Our investments in fiber to the
home enable a leading broadband and video experience to FiOS customers through higher speeds and capacity. Our
investments in global IP, managed services, cloud computing, security and machine-to-machine enable our ability to
serve the complex needs of large enterprise customers around the globe.
Our operational focus is on execution, which means performing the basics every day. In short, our approach is to meet
customer needs by delivering products and services in the most efficient and effective way. Our implementation of
Share Everything plans is simplifying decisions for customers, making it easier to upgrade and add devices while
eliminating the need for separate data plans for each device. Our FiOS Quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration
initiatives are examples of improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency.
In Enterprise, our ongoing retooling efforts, which include product rationalization and systems consolidation, will
result in a more efficient and effective service delivery model. Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted
across the entire business, and we are beginning to see efficiency gains in many areas, including customer care, supply
chain and system support to name a few. As we move through the year, successful execution in our key strategic areas
will drive incremental revenue and better operating efficiency, resulting in continued growth in free cash flows and
earnings.
Let me shift now to our first quarter performance, hitting a few highlights. Our Wireless results were strong, striking a
favorable balance between growth and profitability. We added 677,000 retail postpaid connections, up 35% year over
year. Service revenue grew 8.6%. And our EBITDA service margin was 50.4%, which was right in line with our
guidance. FiOS also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth. We added 188,000 new FiOS Internet
subscribers and had 169,000 FiOS video addictions. FiOS revenue grew 15.1%, and ARPU was over $150 a month. In
Global Enterprise, Strategic Services revenue continued to increase, up 6% year over year. Free cash flows in the first
quarter increased $1.5 billion or 64%, on the strength of higher cash from operations.
Now let's take a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide four. Total operating revenue grew 4.2%,
sustaining our solid top line growth performance. For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues coupled with
effective cost management resulted in 19.8% growth in operating income. Consolidated EBITDA also grew at a
double-digit rate, up 12.1% while our EBITDA margin expanded by 240 basis points to 35.1%.
Now let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide five. Our consistent investment in
Wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. Five years ago, we
committed to 4G LTE as the next-generation technology, and we have taken all the necessary steps to take advantage of
this growth opportunity. These actions include: securing necessary spectrum; allocating capital to deploy 4G LTE
nationwide; fostering a robust device and application ecosystem; and introducing a revolutionary pricing framework
with our Share Everything plans for consumer and small business. Once again, through solid execution of our strategy,
the Wireless results speak for themselves.

We also know that by taking advantage of the unique market growth opportunities in the fourth quarter, we would
quickly realize the benefit. Our first quarter results prove this out. Total Wireless revenues grew to $19.5 billion and
now represent two-thirds of Verizon's consolidated revenue.
Our strong momentum in terms of connections growth and smartphone penetration drove first quarter service revenue
growth of 8.6%. As expected, profitability rebounded quickly following the high-quality device activations of the
fourth quarter. EBITDA grew to $8.4 billion, up 18.1%. And our industry-leading EBITDA service margins expanded
to 50.4%, up 410 basis points over the first quarter of 2012.
Let's now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue and accounts, beginning on slide six. The increase in service
revenue was driven by a combination of factors, including customer growth and increased smartphone penetration. The
popularity and simplicity of our Share Everything plans is driving increases in both the revenue and number of devices
per account. During the first quarter, retail postpaid service revenue per account, or ARPA, grew to more than $150 a
month, an increase of 6.9%. Connections per account increased to 2.67, up 5.1%.
In just nine months, 30% of our postpaid account base is on a Share Everything plan. Customers have quickly
recognized the value of shared data across multiple devices. In late January, we also introduced Share Everything plans
for small business, which allow for up to 25 devices per account. In terms of the number of postpaid accounts, our
Share Everything plans have resulted in consolidation of accounts.
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on slide seven. In the first quarter, we added 677,000 new retail postpaid
connections, an increase of 35.1% year over year. Last year, postpaid connections increased sequentially each quarter,
and we expect a similar pattern of accelerating growth in 2013. We have an industry leading 98.9 million retail
connections, with 93.2 million postpaid and 5.7 million prepaid. Our postpaid connections represent 34.9 million
accounts. Postpaid gross adds in the first quarter totaled 3.5 million, up 15.6% year over year. In terms of upgrades,
6.7% of our postpaid connections base upgraded during the quarter.
Our churn metrics continue to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn was 1.01%. During the quarter, we
implemented several process improvements in the area of bad debt collections related to our Lean Six Sigma initiative.
These improvements resulted in an acceleration of involuntary churn, which we expect will be lower in future periods.
Now let's turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. In the first quarter, we
activated 9.7 million postpaid devices, 87% of which were phones. Smartphone activations totaled 7.2 million, and
68% of these were 4G LTE. We activated 4 million iPhones. Half of them were 4G LTE and the other half were 3G.
Our smartphone penetration increased to 61%, up from 58% at the end of last year.
A key point of differentiation for us and incremental revenue is the improved mix of gross adds and upgrades within
our smartphone activations. In the first quarter, gross adds or new-to-Verizon customers represented about 28% of the
total smartphone activations, much higher than the 22% to 24% range we reported in the first half of 2012.
We also have incremental revenue opportunities with upgrades. About 38% of customers upgrading this quarter were
buying a smartphone for the first time. I would also note that when customers upgrade from a 3G to a 4G LTE
smartphone, they are usually in a shared data plan, enabling higher usage and additional device adoption, which
ultimately drives higher revenue per account.
Customer adoption of 4G LTE continues to accelerate. At the end of the first quarter, 4G LTE phones and devices
represented more than 28% of total retail postpaid connections. 40% of smartphones and 63% of Internet devices are
now 4G LTE. And 54% of our total data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network, which is five times more efficient
than 3G.
In terms of 4G LTE geographic coverage, we are by far the market leader. Today, our 4G LTE service is available in
491 markets, covering 287 million POPs, representing more than 95% of our 3G coverage. We will continue to
leverage our advantage and expect that our 4G LTE footprint will effectively match our 3G network by the end of the
second quarter. Network quality and reliability will continue to be the hallmarks of the Verizon brand, and we will
continue to invest to maintain our leadership position.

Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting on slide nine. In Wireline, our investments in FiOS, global IP,
security, cloud, and machine-to-machine provide powerful platforms to deliver the services and leading-edge
applications and solutions that our customers are looking for. These services are increasingly efficient and in the long
run will help improve our cost structure.
In the Consumer and Mass Markets business, we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by 15.1% FiOS revenue
growth this quarter. In addition to increasing FiOS penetration, we are focused on improving our operating and capital
efficiency. We are also making good progress in our copper-to-fiber migration program. In Enterprise, we continue to
see mixed performance. Our strategic service revenue grew 6%, but declines in core services like voice and data
transport as well as CP more than offset the increase.
In terms of Wireline profitability, first quarter EBITDA was $2.1 billion. And the margin was 21.4%, roughly flat
sequentially if we set aside the impacts of Sandy in the fourth quarter. As we have previously indicated, we do not
expect much in the way of total Wireline EBITDA margin expansion in 2013. However, the continued strong
performance of FiOS, our copper-to-fiber initiative, and the benefits of new union contracts give us confidence that
Consumer and Mass Markets will contribute positively to Wireline profit this year.
In Enterprise, while growth in Strategic Services continued to improve the revenue mix, secular declines in both retail
and wholesale voice and data transport services are putting pressure on Wireline profitability. We believe that our
ongoing product rationalization efforts and other retooling efforts will ultimately improve our cost structure and result
in a fundamentally stronger enterprise business.
Looking ahead, we are positioned to improve the Wireline margin in 2014 based on better contributions from our
strategic investments, which include Redbox Instant, Hughes Telematics, and Verizon Digital Media Services.
Let's take a closer look at the revenue components, starting with slide Mass Markets on slide 10. FiOS is the foundation
of our growth strategy is the consumer market, and it shows in our first quarter results. Consumer revenues grew 4.3%,
driven by increased FiOS revenue, which now represents 69% of consumer revenue. FiOS is also the key driver of
growth in overall consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $107 per month, up 9.5%. FiOS ARPU remains at
over $150 per month. And two-thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play with voice, Internet, and video
services.
As I highlighted earlier, FiOS customer growth was strong in the first quarter. In terms of broadband, we had 188,000
new FiOS Internet additions in the quarter, and now have 5.6 million subscribers, representing penetration of 38%.
Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 99,000, marking a sharp improvement over the past several quarters.
In FiOS video, we added 169,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.9 million, which is 34% penetration.
We continue to make steady progress upgrading copper services to fiber, increasing the number of upgrades each
quarter. We are off to a strong start, converting about 83,000 homes in the first quarter, with a target of 300,000 for the
year. This network evolution initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older
technology throughout the business.
Aside from the obvious expense benefits and improvements in customer satisfaction, the conversion to fiber also
provides customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional ARPU over time.
Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail
residential connections declined by 5.6% compared with a loss of 6.8% at this time last year.
Let's move to our enterprise markets next on slide 11. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $99
million or 2.6%. CPE sales, which we are deemphasizing, represented all of the decrease. Strategic Services, which
comprised 56% of Global Enterprise revenue, totaled $2.1 billion, up 6%. Continued declines in voice and data
transport offset this increase.
In the Enterprise market, we continue to work through economic challenges. We still see cautious behavior on the part
of many enterprise customers in terms of new contracts and investment decisions. As we move through the year, we are
hopeful that companies will be able to be more definitive about capital commitments and will renew their investing

activities.
Moving next to Global Wholesale, first quarter revenues declined $134 million or 7.2%, due primarily to continued
declines in transport services. Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP network by driving a more
efficient migration to next-generation Ethernet services.
I would like to turn now to slide 12 to discuss our cash flow results. Our free cash flow in the first quarter was very
strong. Cash flows from operations grew $1.6 billion or 26.4%, and free cash flow increased to $3.9 billion. Capital
expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion, essentially flat year over year. We remain focused on improving
investment returns and capital efficiency, and we are expecting our CapEx-to-revenue ratio for the full year to decline.
In Wireless, capital spending totaled $2 billion, up 5.7%. Within our overall spending outlook, we expect to allocate
more capital to 4G LTE to further expand coverage and add capacity. With regard to capacity, we have started to incur
some capital cost associated with the AWS spectrum, which we expect to deploy in our network later in the year. In
Wireline, capital spending was $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 6.7%.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Our total debt at the end of the first quarter was $52.9 billion.
Net debt was $47.4 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2 times.
Let's summarize on slide 13. As we stated earlier, we entered 2013 with great confidence. Our strategic investments
and operational execution drove a solid financial start to the year. We expect to sustain this positive momentum
throughout 2013 and into 2014. We are committed to driving shareholder value by executing our plans and improving
the fundamentals of the business. Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key strategic areas. At the
same time, we will continue to transform our service delivery and cost structures through the Verizon Lean Six Sigma
initiative. As always, we will continue to invest in a disciplined manner, ensuring that we have the necessary platforms
for innovation and growth. Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive cash flow and earnings
growth.
Before I turn the call back to Mike, I want to take a moment to say a word about the tragedy that has unfolded this
week around the Boston Marathon. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. This is a very
tough situation for so many people. We also want to thank our employees in the Boston area for their work and support
of emergency personnel and law enforcement authorities. Verizon, of course, will continue to do whatever it can to
help.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great, thanks. Good morning; Fran, maybe a couple questions; first on Wireless, a very
good margin result this quarter. I guess when we think about the prior guide you had given, 49% to 50% margins for
the year. I think a lot of people were worried that we'll have good margins in the first three quarters of the year, only to
give a lot of it back in the fourth quarter. I guess related to this, last week you announced the intention to lengthen the
handset upgrade cycle to 24 months. A couple of questions; A), was that contemplated in this guidance? And then B),
just given the timing of that, which I think kicks in, in September, do you think that derisks the fourth quarter relative

to historical experience?
And then second question, I guess, I'll take a crack at the Vodafone question. There has been obviously a lot more noise
recently on the future of that relationship, and I'm just wondering. Is this the press and the analyst community really
getting ahead of themselves, or has there been some change related to the partners' desire and urgency to find a
resolution? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, Jason. Good morning, everyone. So look, on the 49% to 50%, if you
recall back to what I said in the first quarter is we said that we expected Verizon Wireless for the full year to be within
the range of 49% to 50%. And obviously, when I do something like that, I understand exactly what's on our plate of
strategy for the year. And we had said before that we look at all of our policies and procedures on a normal basis, and
this was one of those policies that we knew we were going to change. And as you said, Jason, it's going to become
effective September 1. And in essence, what it does is it lengthens our upgrade cycle will from the minus four months
from contract equal to the contract, so a full 24 months to be eligible for that upgrade. So I think that's all factored in
with what I had said coming into this year, and that's why I was confident with 49% to 50% on a full-year basis.
And then with respect to Vodafone, obviously we made a public announcement on April 2, and I would reference all of
you back to that announcement. Of course, as we've always said before, we're very interested in acquiring the 45%
stake in Verizon Wireless that we don't already own. I will say though that there has been a lot of speculation about the
tax consequences of a purchase of this 45%. And we are extremely confident that such a transaction could be
accomplished in a manner that is very tax efficient and would not result in a tax on the gain in that stake. So beyond
that, Jason, I don't think there's really much else to say. So with that I'll pass it on to the next question.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great, thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, I have a couple of quick things. On the
Enterprise, just any impact or questions or comments on sequestration; is that having any material impact on some of
the comments you made about cautious spending?
And then on to quad play, we've seen both in Europe and also with some of the comments out of DISH this week
around focusing on bundling wireless with video and with other wireline products. You talk a lot about your triple play.
You have the cable JV. Can you just give us your broader thoughts on bundling wireless more closely with some of the
FiOS and other products, either now or down the road? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, Simon, thank you. So on the Enterprise side of the house, obviously, we're seeing a
lot of issues around Enterprise. I think the sequestering has probably hit more of the government and state side of the
house than it has overall Enterprise side of the house. But on a much broader perspective around Enterprise, obviously
we believe that our platforms are there. We're having good growth in the areas of our cloud and our network strategies.
Our security is still growing at a good pace. But obviously, the voice and the data continue to offset this. And I don't
really see a change there given the fact that we really have not seen a consistent and steady economic growth profile.
We have not seen a consistent and steady employment rate. I still think there's some uncertainty out there around what's
going to happen with tax reform. So again I believe that most companies are still in this cost cutting mode, really not
investing but trying to get their P&L squared away. So until the overall macroeconomics change, I think we're going to
be in this situation at least for the near term here.
And then on the quad play, obviously we believe that the quad play is extremely important. That's why we entered into
the cable agreement that we did a year ago with the cross-selling agreements and also with the joint innovation that we
have agreed to do because I think that this is very important because as we look at how do we innovate and bring

content in and outside of the home on a seamless perspective, this is where that all comes into play. And I think DISH
has just again supported what we knew a year ago, which was this strategy was the right strategy.
The other thing I'll say is that with this it also supports the fact that you have a foreign investor who wants to come into
the North American wireless footprint. You have you a domestic investor who wants to gain share in the wireless
footprint. This again just confirms our overall belief that the wireless industry still has a lot of growth left in it, both on
the quad play and with the innovation of machine-to-machine and 4G LTE. So I think that's where we sit with the quad
play.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great, thanks a lot.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Brad, we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Thanks. Good morning, guys, two quick ones. First on the Wireline side, the wholesale
revenue decline improved nicely for the last couple quarters. Is that really a function of the repositioning work you
guys have done in VES, or are there some other more macro trends driving that? And then can we expect to see that
improvement continue?
And then over in Wireless, it looks like as I look at your prepaid and wholesale or reseller numbers, it looks like
prepaid was a little bit lighter than we thought despite a price cut. Can you talk a little bit about that? And then had you
stronger reseller numbers. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy in both of those categories and what we can
expect going forward?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, John. Thank you. So on the wholesale side of the house, this is just that I would tell
you I believe that this is tiny. And I think that if I had to predict what was going to happen the rest of the year, I think
we're going to be around this 8% to 9% decline in wholesale. And it is mainly around, again, the drive behind volumes
of voice and data. And again, it points back to everything I talked about in Enterprise because most of the volume that
we get on wholesale are people who resell that to enterprise customers and other customers for voice and data. So I
agree with you, it has slowed a bit, but I think we're probably in a period of it's not going to improve here in the future.
As far as prepaid goes, I guess a couple things here. So as I've said before, in the prepaid market, we will look for
niches to play that really complement what we want to be as a carrier in the prepaid market. And I've said before, we're
not going to chase the low end on our retail side of the house, but we will look for niches where we can make impact.
And I guess I would say this is the eighth consecutive quarter of a net add positive on our prepaid and retail. As you
said, John, we launched new pricing here in the first quarter. It was mid-first quarter, so we don't really have the full
impact of the quarter here on what we launched as smartphone pricing, which was the first time we launched
smartphone pricing on prepaid. We also launched a $35 plan to really go after the basic phone category with a little bit
of data in that. So you're seeing us become I wouldn't say overly aggressive but maybe a little bit more aggressive. But
again, it ties into our network strategy of using the 3G network and keeping that network full because it contributes a
lot of margin.
The other thing is though, as I've said in the past, we will always play in both arenas between retail and wholesale,
depending upon what drives the most value for Verizon shareholders. And you saw this quarter through a relationship
that we have with one of our resellers with a distribution agreement to Walmart, we added 1 million net subs on that
side of the house, which was really all prepaid subs. So again, balancing out where we think the most favorable
financial position is for us to get the greatest return, that's how you'll see us going forward in the prepaid market.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Brad, next question.

Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. First, if you could just give us an update on the ending
balance for Verizon Wireless net debt?
And secondly, when we look at some of the numbers in the Wireless business, it looks like the postpaid customer
device replacement cycle is lengthening. And I was curious if you could talk about the reasons for that. Do you think
it's because of the policy changes that you've made over the last couple years? Are you seeing any resistance to some
customers upgrading to the new shared plans that you've laid out? I'm just curious for some of your thoughts on that
subject. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Hi, Michael. Thank you. So Verizon Wireless debt gross is $10 billion, cash is $3.9 billion,
for a net of $6.2 billion.
On the device lineup, obviously, if you look at what we have done over the last two years, what we plan to do coming
here in the fourth quarter, if you look at the ecosystem of these devices, these are highly subsidized devices. And we
have to make sure that we position the value to Verizon and the value to our customer on an equal basis. So what
you've seen over the last two years in modifying the policies to make sure that we can still offer a great lineup of
phones at a reasonable price to our consumers for a two-year service contract, you're seeing us lengthen that cycle.
And to be honest, we're not seeing a lot of resistance here. You have to understand that a lot of the upgrades were
proactive by us, not by our customers. And so we're really just repositioning that the date of an upgrade is two years
now instead of say 20 months. We don't anticipate that there will be obviously a lot of dissatisfaction here, but we have
to watch this carefully. Obviously, we want to give our customers the most choice that we possibly can. We think we
have a great lineup. We have a lot of choices.
On the shared side of the house, we are not seeing resistance on people converting to shared. Actually, we're much
ahead of what our expectations were. We have 30% of our base now on shared, and that continues to go up. Also
within the shared plan, we're seeing exactly what we thought would happen is that as people move to 4G, and you
heard that 69% – or 68% of our upgrades are to 4G. That's driving usage, which is also driving up to the higher tiers,
driving the revenue profile. And also the connected devices; as we said on the last call, we see that when people come
in as a new Verizon customer, their actual device attachment is much lower than our base, but over that nine to 12
months we see them attaching more devices and moving up to where the average of our overall base is. So we continue
to see that happening, and it's all about customer service as well, not just when an upgrade period is. So I think we're
hitting on all cylinders here, but we have to watch this carefully.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Brad. We're ready for the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to circle back on the upgrade policy and your thoughts as
the year progresses. There has been a view that we should have some of your competitors getting a little bit healthier
towards the back half of the year. Does that set up to be another differentiator for those other carriers?
And then secondly, on the upgrade policy changes, is there a risk as the customer matures past the 20 months that the
ETF [Early Termination Fee] is low enough that it could create unnecessary churn for you guys?
And then lastly, just thinking about data usage, and obviously it's an important thing for ARPA revenue growth. How
much of that, if you can measure it as being offloaded onto the Wi-Fi network onto the wireline data side, to maybe

either try and save data usage on the wireless side or to get a better customer experience? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Hi, Mike. Thanks. So on the – look, on the upgrade policy, obviously, these decisions from
us are done based on a lot of customer input and customer feedback and focus groups, so we don't just jump into these
things. You saw us do that when we implemented the $30 upgrade fee. So we're very diligent in how we do this.
As far as customer contracts and ETFs, we manage this since we started with service agreements in 24 months, so this
is nothing new. And look, I think we compete on a number of fronts. It's not just on a service contract or pricing. We
compete on our outstanding network. So when you look at our network and reliability, the 4G network and our
superiority, I think if you compare our network with others that you'd have to say we're the leader in the market as far
as reach, as far as consistency of performance. So when you go to connect that data session, it connects, you get the
speed that we advertise in on a consistent basis; if you look at the Share Everything plan and the options we have there
and the flexibility within that plan, if you look at the number of our device lineups. So all of this, including our great
customer service from our customer service centers, this all goes into why our churn is the lowest in the industry and
will continue to be the lowest in the industry, and this is what we work for every single day. It's tackling the basics, as I
said in my opening comments. So again, we manage all of this.
As far as data and offload to Wi-Fi, obviously customers offload to Wi-Fi. But what we see is, again, because of the
superiority of our network and because of the authentication that our network has, we actually want people to offload
when they're in their homes. But when they're out in public areas, they want to stay on our network because it is
authenticated, it is secure, and a lot of Wi-Fi networks outside the home are not secure. So I think that plays into that as
well, but we do think that Wi-Fi is a good offload in certain circumstances, but not all.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, Fran, just quickly on cost of service in Wireless, it had a meaningful step down, which
obviously is a credit to your cost saving opportunities. But how should he we look at that progressing through the year?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: I think that all hinges on the upgrade. So when we came into this year, I said that our
upgrades would be flat with a year ago. So it's obviously sequentially, if I think that's what you're looking at.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Right.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: It is a considerable decrease because of the volume that we had in the fourth quarter versus
the first quarter.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. So, Fran, you noted the importance of keeping a close eye on
the level of subsidies that you incur, and that's why you made further adjustments to the upgrade policies. So if with we
look at the policies now, people have to just keep their phone for the duration of their contract, they have an upgrade
fee, it seems like you've done just about everything you can do from a policy standpoint to keep subsidies in line. Are
there any other steps you can take as a carrier to work on that even further? For example, are you rethinking whether
you should be favoring lower subsidized phones in the stores, or is there even anything you can do to influence the
actual cost of manufacturing the phone so that it's lower for you?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yes, thanks, Brett. So around this, again, I go back to if you look at the history of basic
phones and what happened over time, again, I think the smartphone category will also follow this where, as the
competition and innovation as new phones come to market, obviously, BlackBerry is coming back into the market. We
have the Windows phone. So as more ecosystem comes here and more competition happens, the cost of these phones
will eventually start to decrease. And we've already seen some of this competition happen in certain categories with the

decrease of smartphones. We've launched smartphones in prepaid. That gives you an indication that there are some
low-end smartphones out there because we really don't subsidize much on the prepaid products. So again, as the
ecosystem builds, I think this will follow what historically the basic phone did over the last ten years that that was
maturing. And that's what's going to impact the lower subsidies over time.
And of course then, as I've said in the past, as we move into our 4G and our VoLTE launch, which we'll start to have
VoLTE capable phones we think by the end of this year and we'll commercially launch early next year. And as we do
that and our footprint of 4G LTE really covers that of the 3G network and the experiences there, then we'll start to take
the CDMA chip out of those handsets. So again, that will impact subsidy going forward. So I think we have a good
roadmap here that says our strategy, we believe that we can start to reduce subsidy over a length of two to three years.
So I think that's where our position is.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: And was there any experience that you had with feature phones where you found that you
had the ability to push the ecosystem? In other words, do you think there's any opportunity to start driving customers
towards smartphones that already have lower subsidies, or do you really have to wait for the market to want those
devices?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: I think again, this goes back to customer satisfaction. And as I said before, we don't incent
our front lines to sell one phone over another. This is a customer choice because, again, the worst thing that can happen
to us is force a phone into a customer's hands and within our return policy of 14 days worry free, they can come back
and return that phone for dissatisfaction for any reason and we give them a new phone. That is not a good financial
model. So we want a customer when they walk out the door to have the right phone in their hand, whatever phone they
choose, and to make sure that they're educated to use that phone. So that's what more important to us instead of locking
them into a low subsidy handset that they're going to dissatisfied with.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: And just a point of clarification because you mentioned about eventually taking CDMA chips
out of devices, what is the commitment to CDMA? What would be the timeframe for getting there?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Again, I think that's going to come into play in 2014, so we'll keep posted on that. But the
strategy is to eventually within these 4G LTE devices to remove that chip at some point in time, so I think that's where
we're at.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: So we see our first device that doesn't necessarily have a CDMA chip next year, not all
devices?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: That's correct.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: All right, thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, we're ready for the next question.

Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, Fran, it's probably going to become
clearer I think through the quarter that you guys took another healthy chunk of the wireless market share for net add
growth. Could you talk a little bit about, as we think about the year unfolding, where this net add growth is coming
from in terms of tablets, home zone, the share that you're winning from the IDEN network shutdown over at Sprint, just
so we can think about how the market is unfolding and where the competitive tangent points are?
And then I guess second, on the cash flow front, it looks like you guys didn't actually pay taxes this quarter, which was
a big tailwind for that number. Could you give us a little bit more color about how you think that cash tax line is going
to contribute or not to the cash flow picture for the rest of the year? Thanks.

<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yes, thanks, David. First, on the all-categories growth, so as I said in my prepared remarks
here, as last year we came into the first quarter, I said that we would look at continuing to accelerate our growth
through the year, and I think we're on plan to do that again this year. As far as the mix of growth here, it's really evenly
spread among all devices. So we had net gains in smartphone customers. We had next gains in our Home Phone
Connect product. We had net gains in Fusion, tablets, Internet devices, prepaid. So it's across the gamut that we are
driving on every single device. So it's not one device over another, but we think that we will continue to grow each
individual category on a net positive basis.
As far as cash flow goes, there are all kinds of things that happen in cash taxes during the quarter. We pay a lot of
property tax, a lot of sales tax. There is a federal estimated tax that's in the first quarter. So again, I think that's included
in maybe some separate line items that you're not seeing. But we did make some cash tax payments in the first quarter.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay, we'll follow up. Thanks.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Jennifer Murtaugh Fritzsche>: Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, Fran, but I just wanted
to ask on spectrum. It was recently reported that the DOJ supports restricting the purchase of broadcast spectrum by
limiting those current holders of low-band spectrum such as yourself. There isn't a lot of spectrum in my view coming
over the next few years. You're clearly in a good position with AWS. But how do you handle spectrum needs, and how
will this impact your CapEx or your small cell deployments going forward?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yes, so thanks, Jennifer. I think it's an important question, so let's just back up a second.
So the FCC right now is targeting 2014 for the auctions and is working to develop the rules around the auction process.
Obviously, we're working very closely with the FCC and the broadcasters and others in the industry to develop the
rules around these auctions and make them successful.
Really, our basis is we want to ensure that the FCC develops and implements the auctions in a way that allows Verizon
Wireless to bid for and acquire the additional spectrum that it needs to run its business. As you know, the FCC, they
need to maximize the amount of spectrum available for mobile broadband services and ensure that the auction is
designed to encourage the broadcasters themselves to participate. These rules that restrict companies from bidding and
give other companies priority could actually cause the auction to fail.
So as you know the DOJ recently this week weighed in on a theoretical concern about the market foreclosure. We
believe the concern is really around some who buy the spectrum to keep others from buying the spectrum. And I think
if you look at history, that has not shown itself. Verizon has never purchased spectrum for that reason. We buy it to use
it, and I think our track record is we really efficiently use the spectrum that we have. And I think the secondary market
is another important one here because we've proved that the secondary market works in 2012 by divesting of some of
the spectrum that we felt others could use more appropriately than we could. So I think this all goes into that, but I
think that's our view around the DOJ. And we will work closely with the FCC in order to make that spectrum available
for the people who need it.
So as far as capital – CapEx and utilizing what we need, obviously, we're in a very good position with spectrum. And
as I said before, when spectrum comes up, whether it's in an auction or for sale in the open market, you have to be
opportunistic because it normally only comes up at one time. And we're very selective on what we go after, but we
have a very long-term strategy with spectrum, and we'll be opportunistic if the climate presents itself.
<Q - Jennifer Murtaugh Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Brad, next question?

Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Tom O. Seitz>: Yes, thanks, a couple of questions related to the copper-fiber migration. First, it looks like you're
a little bit ahead of plan. Is that just a function of fixing Sandy issues immediately, or do you think you can keep or
even accelerate this pace?
Second, you disclosed I think 83,000 forced conversions. Can you give us some idea of how many took just the voice
product versus how many stepped up and took broadband and/or video? And then finally, are there any states with
regulatory hurdles or rules that are acting as governors on this initiative?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right, thanks, Tom, so just a couple of things here. So around the copper-to-fiber
migration, so obviously with this one we did have very, very good process this quarter in converting these migrations.
And some of this obviously had to do with some of the Sandy impact. I would also tell you though that this is really a
technology change, and we need to really move to the new technologies.
From a regulatory standpoint, if you look at it, the FCC has longstanding rules in place that permit copper retirement.
Now I know some of the CLECs [Competitive Local Exchange Carriers] have urged the FCC to suspend or change
these rules, but we need to encourage our customers and others to move to the new technologies in order to provide our
customers with the best solutions that they have. And for many of our customers that service is best delivered over fiber
or even maybe a wireless network. And in some of these situations, we're not going to rebuild the copper. It doesn't
make financial sense to lay fiber to some of these remote areas. So wireless may be a better solution here, and we're
working with the regulatory agencies on that. And within Pennsylvania, a year ago we solved some of the Internet
provisioning via LTE instead of fiber. So I think the regulatory bodies are very open to it. We continue to work with
them. But as far as the copper-to-fiber migration here for the first quarter, I think we're off to a great start, and 300,000
is our target. That doesn't mean that we can't exceed that, but we will continue to migrate our customers to the new
technology.
As far as the breakdown between voice and Internet, we really don't despair there because what's happening is as we
move people over to fiber they're coming on to the Quantum product. 27% of our base now is on Quantum. And what
we're seeing is, is they're buying up in the tiers because once they get that 15-megabit-per-second,
30-megabit-per-second tier, they're buying up to the 50-megabit-per-second tier. And that's what's helping to drive the
stellar revenue performance in the consumer market of 4.3%, which is the highest I think we've ever had at this point
compared to some of the prior years and consistent with what we performed in last year. So I think we're on a good
path here to continue to produce solid wireline consumer revenue growth with our strategy that we've laid out. But
thanks, Tom.
<Q - Tom O. Seitz>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Hey, Brad, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question for today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks, guys. Around wireless, I have a few questions, Fran, if it's okay. As part of moving
to the 24-month cycle, I would assume there are a lot of variables that go with that. But it would seem to me that the
shared data plans are helping that out a lot. And maybe can you talk a little bit about the data usage on those shared
data plans, a growth rate or any other metrics you could provide?
And then also on the phones, it seems like the phones are getting a lot better. I know in my own family, we used to
break phones after 12 months. Now they seem to be lasting a lot longer. Was that part of the thinking? And just related
to that, both personally and professionally, are you flexible at all on the 24-month upgrades? Will you provide

20-month upgrades for high quality customers who are getting a lower subsidy phone, or how rigid is that? Thanks a
lot.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Tim. So on the 24-month cycle, obviously, our policies are our policies. And
obviously, I'll let Verizon Wireless deal with any exceptions to those policies at the front line because, again, we want
to make sure that the customers are satisfied. But the policy is the policy and we want to make sure that the front line
sticks to our policies. But obviously again, as you know, there's always an exception to the rule here and there.
As far as really thinking this through, I think that these are highly subsidized phones. These are miniature computers
walking around. People – it really goes to when you look at the demographics of the customers who upgrade,
demographics play a big role in this. The younger generation wants to update to the day. Some others will hold their
phones for three, even four years. So it really is a vast difference, and we're just trying to conform everything to a
consistent policy so that it makes sense for the customer and it makes sense for us.
As far as 4G LTE and data usage, as we said, 54% of our data now is going over the LTE network, so that should tell
you something about the usage of our 4G LTE customers. Beyond that, we're not going to disclose any individual
statistics around data usage. So again, thanks, Tim, for the question.
