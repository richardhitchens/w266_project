MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson investor conference call. During
today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the
conference will be open for questions. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, November 4,
2014.
Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including company's
outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from
those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with SEC.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson.
Please go ahead.
Patrick Fitzgerald
Thank you, Danny. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank
Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and [ph] Craig Rossman (1:13), who will be
succeeding me as Director of Investor Relations in the coming weeks.
Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will
accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and
slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.
We'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation.

Net sales were unchanged in the quarter at $6.8 billion, with underlying sales up 4%, reflecting increases in all
segments with Climate Technology strongest. Growth was strong in North America and modest in Asia, while Europe
was flat. Emerging markets improved to 5% growth after 2% growth in the third quarter but remained mixed across
regions.
Profitability improvement continued with a gross profit margin of 42.4%, up 120 basis points, and segment margin up
70 basis points to 20.2%.
An impairment charge of $508 million was recognized in the Chloride business, which has been impacted by protracted
economic weakness since its acquisition in 2010 and a deteriorating outlook in Europe and Middle East/Africa over the
next two to three years.
Earnings per share of $1.30 increased 10%, excluding charges in both years. It was a strong close in fiscal 2014, with
margin earnings and cash generation exceeding expectations.
Slide three: P&L summary. As previously stated, net sales were flat while underlying sales grew 4%, reflecting the
impact of currency translation and divestitures. Gross profit margin expansion benefited from improved business and
technology mix, which enabled funding of strategic investments as reflected in higher SG&A expense. The decrease in
other deductions was primarily driven by favorable currency comparisons of $43 million.
Excluding charges, EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points to 20.1%, with strong contribution from segment margins
and favorable stock compensation expense.
Share repurchase of $267 million contributed to EPS of $1.30, up 10%.
Next slide, sales by geography: in the fourth quarter, sales growth was led by the United States up 8% while Europe
was flat. Asia grew 2% including unchanged sales in China on challenging comparisons. Latin America increased 3%,
Canada was up 10%, and the Middle East and Africa was up 5%. Total underlying sales increased 4%, and acquisitions
added 2% while divestitures deducted 5% and currency translation deducted 1% for flat reported sales.
For fiscal 2014, 4% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in China drove the majority of the underlying sales increase.
Europe and Canada were up 1%, Latin America was up 2%, and the Middle East and Africa declined 1%.
Full year underlying sales grew 3%, and acquisitions contributed 1% while divestitures deducted 5% for reported sales
for 2014 down 1%. Strong market conditions in the U.S., an improvement in the emerging markets drove growth
acceleration the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly rate of growth of the year.
Slide five, segment earnings and cash flows: segment margin expansion of 70 basis points was driven by strong
improvement in process management and industrial automation. Lower corporate expense was primarily driven by
favorable stock comp comparisons of $54 million. Reported pre-tax earnings reflected the previously mentioned
charge. Cash generation exceeded expectations with strong conversion and working capital management to finish the
year. Trade working capital improved by 10 basis points.
Next slide, Process Management: Process Management underlying sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter with North
America up 13%, Asia up 1%, Europe flat, Latin America up 3% and Middle East and Africa 5%. Acquisitions added
4% and currency translation deducted 1%, for net sales growth of 8% percent.
Momentum continued in Global Energy and Chemical industries with growth strongest in North America, driven by
robust investment in oil and gas production and processing projects. Asia was slow as strength in Southeast Asia and
India was offset by challenging comparisons in China and Australia. Europe reflected improvement in Russia, offset by
lumpy project timing in the North Sea region. Market conditions in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa were
mixed.
Margin remained strong, up 130 basis points in Q4 driving 20.9% margin for the full year. Robust order trends have
resulted in double-digit year-end backlog growth providing strong momentum in 2015.

Slide seven, Industrial Automation: Industrial automation net and underlying sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter,
with North America up 12%, Asia up 5%, Europe and Latin America down 2%, and Middle East and Africa down 9%.
Demand for capital goods continued to improve with mixed trends across markets and geographies. All businesses
grew except for Motors and Drives, reflecting short cycle economic weakness in Europe. Strength in North America
was led by over 25% growth in the hermetic motors business. Asia benefited from continued strength in China,
particularly in the Power Transmission and Electrical Distribution businesses.
Strong interest has been received in the Power Transmission business and a decision is expected by the end of calendar
year. Varied market conditions are expected in the near term with favorable momentum in North America and Asia and
soft demand in Europe.
Next slide, Network Power: Network Power underlying sales increased 1% with North America up 1%, Asia down 3%,
Europe up 7% Latin America down 2% and Middle East and Africa up 9%. The divested Artisan and Connectivity
Solutions businesses deducted 20% and currency translation deducted another 1%, for a reported sales decrease of
20%. Data center markets have gradually improved globally. Strong growth in Europe benefited from a large project in
Sweden along with better market conditions in North America and modest growth in Asia.
Telecommunications infrastructure investments slowed in all geographies declining at a double-digit rate after strong
growth in the third quarter. It was a solid finish to the year on margin for the segment, up 400 basis points sequentially.
As mentioned previously, we've taken a cautious economic outlook in Europe and Middle East and Africa for the next
two to three years, and as a result we have recognized an impairment charge in the Chloride business that is not
reflected in the segment results. Business conditions are expected to remain mixed with gradual improvement in the
Data Center business, and inconsistent demand in telecommunications markets in the near-term.
Slide nine, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales increased 7% with North America up
7%, Asia up 8%, Europe down 3%, Latin America up 17% and Middle East and Africa up 25%. Growth was strong
globally in the Air Conditioning business, led by strength in the U.S. with the residential up over 20%, reflecting
demand driven by upcoming regulatory changes. U.S. Commercial markets improved as well. International Air
Conditioning demand was mixed with strength in Asia, Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, partially offset by
declines in Europe.
The Refrigeration business grew moderately, led by continued strength in transportation markets. Demand for sensors
and controls declined moderately. Segment margin declined due to unfavorable mix, higher investment spending, and
customer accommodation expense related to a manufacturing process improvement. Market conditions are expected to
remain favorable with growth momentum in North America and Asia, while regulatory demand will slow.
Commercial and Residential Solutions on slide 10. Commercial and Residential Solutions net and underlying sales
grew 5%, with North America up 7%, Asia up 3%, Europe down 2%, Latin America down 5%, and Middle East and
Africa down 22%. Strong demand in North America more than offset the slight decline in international markets. The
growth was led by the Professional Tools, Wet-Dry Vacuums, and Food Waste Disposer businesses. Sales increased
slightly in the storage businesses. Segment margin remained strong at 23.2%. Solid trend in Residential and
Commercial Construction markets in North America are expected to continue, supporting a moderate growth outlook
for the next year.
Next slide, 2014 summary. Fiscal 2014 net sales declined 1% and underlying sales increased 3%, with emerging
markets up 4% and mature markets up 3%. Gross profit margin again reached a record level, and EBIT margin of
16.5% expanded 50 basis points.
EPS excluding charges of $3.75 came in above previously communicated expectations on the strong year-end close.
Emerson completed a 58th year of consecutive dividend increases, precipitated by record operating cash flow, with a
payout ratio over 60% for the fourth consecutive year.
Next slide, 2014 performance versus plan. Most financial targets were achieved or exceeded in the year, net gross profit
margin and operating cash flow ahead of plan, EBIT margins meeting plan, and earnings per share just above the

midpoint of the range. This solid operational execution overcame lower-than-expected macroeconomic growth as
emerging markets excluding China struggled to maintain economic momentum, falling short of expectations.
Next slide, 2015 outlook. Underlying orders growth of 9% in the fourth quarter drove year-end backlog to a record $6.7
billion. The global macroeconomic trends mixed but gradually improving. There continues to be solid momentum in
the NAFTA region and China which balanced the increasing uncertainty in Europe and some other emerging markets.
We're planning cautiously for global gross fixed investment of 3% to 4% growth next year.
Based on current business conditions, the following is expected in 2015. Underlying sales growth of 4% to 5%,
reported sales change of 0% to 1%, reflecting a 2% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from the
potential Power Transmission divestiture.
Modest profitability improvement is expected as well. Business segment and other financial-metric forecasts will be
provided at our Annual Investor Conference in February 2015. Additionally, the first quarter 2015 dividend has been
increased 9% to $0.47 a share, equivalent to an annual rate of $1.88 and representing 44% of 2014 net cash.
With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much. First, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We truly appreciate your interest and your
support as we continue to invest, grow and enhance the value of Emerson's long-term sustainable value. And, as you all
know, I have a strong focus at this company on giving money back to our shareholders.
In 2014, we ended up passing back to our shareholders almost $2.3 billion, $1.2 billion in dividends and $1.1 billion in
share repurchase. A focus in this corporation is generate cash, invest that cash for growth and give the money back to
the shareholders that we do not need.
Today, the board did increase our dividends per share, as Pat just stated, to an annual run rate of $1.88 versus last year's
$1.72. We had a very strong cash flow year and as our targets are set up for dividends, we look at 40% to 50% of our
dividend payment coming out of free cash flow. And last year's free cash flow at almost an all-time record, we made a
decision to pass back more money to our shareholders and increase dividends to $1.88, starting our 59th straight year of
dividend increases for our shareholders.
As I look at it, I want to thank the operations for their strong operational performance across the board. As in any
company of this size and complexity, you have some pluses, you have some minuses, but in total, the team worked
hard, and they delivered. They delivered a very strong sales growth, they delivered a very strong orders growth, strong
cash flow, and conversion relative to the programs that we've been investing in the last couple of years.
So we see good momentum as we move into 2015, which we'll talk about. But the business leaders, the presidents, the
global operational leaders and the corporate executives that make things happen here at Emerson got the job done, and I
believe, in a very uncertain environment – global economic environment, delivered record levels of profits and earnings
and cash for our shareholders.
As Pat mentioned, he has given up on me, and he'll be stepping aside here at the end of this calendar year, moving to
Asia, working for Climate Technology. Pat has been a lot of fun to work with. Pat's had the joy of going through ups
and downs of this marketplace and my moods, up and downs, and managing shareholders. And we truly appreciate
what he has done for us and his insights, and we wish him well as he moves on to his next role with Climate
Technology located in Asia.
With that, we'll bring in a senior-level player in, a relief pitcher, [ph] Craig Rossman, (15:57) almost 20 years with the
corporation. [ph] Craig (15:59) worked for me at one time in the process world, then moved him over somewhere else,
a couple of other divisions, came out of Therm-O-Disc. He's coming in from a business perspective, so he'll have a lot
of background in business. He's not quite used to the corporate people here and he'll have a fun time learning what it's
like to work in St. Louis. But we'll welcome Craig, and he'll do a great job, and he'll bring a different perspective to the

business world given all the businesses he's been involved with in his job at Emerson for the last 20 years.
As I mentioned, as we look at the company and look at the performance this year, obviously we can always say there's
some good things, and I can equally say there's some bad things, and I know my shareholders out there and investors
out there will gladly point out the goods and the bads. They're real good at that. But I look at the company today from
where we are and where we started, and I'd say the company is in a stronger position today than when we started this
fiscal year.
We grew orders nicely, we made strategic investments, we did a couple strong acquisitions, got a couple divestitures
done, we're in the middle of one right now and hopefully we'll get it done sometime in the second fiscal quarter of 2015
on power transmission solutions. We've improved the order run rate. We've improved our margins, we improved our
profitability. Without the Chloride charge, we had ROTC, return on total capital, over 20% after tax. We had a record
level of operating cash flow, and we had a near-record in free cash flow. So operationally, yes, some good, some bad,
but in total, they got it done, and they did a great job in creating a stronger company as we go into 2015.
2015 is going to be an interesting year. We go in with a record-level backlog, we go in with strong orders, we go in
with record levels of profitability, we go in with strong investments. We have a very good U.S., Canada and Mexico
marketplace. The NAFTA region looks very solid right now. However, this year versus last year, we're going into a
situation where Europe is weakening. Europe is clearly heading down potentially for its third recession since the 2008
peak, which is a concerning issue for global companies like Emerson and global leaders like myself.
One of the reasons why as I looked at the Chloride acquisition we made several years ago, it was hard to justify the
goodwill on there given the fact I'm really concerned about the European environment for the next several years. So
concerned about Europe. A little bit of concern about Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa. They have a lot of issues
going on in those regions right now, and I would say the wind has turned from our back to our face in the last six
months, and I would expect those to be in our face for the next 6 to 12 months.
In South America, I am concerned, driven by my concern over Brazil and Venezuela. Chile, Argentina, concerns there.
I think those economies are still struggling, and will not give us a whole lot of growth in 2015 but will give us some
growth but not to the level I would expect in the normal economic cycle down there.
Asia-Pacific in general, we had a decent year. China was very strong for us, China we grew 7%. I would expect China
to grow again next year but not at the same level, probably closer to 5%. I expect Southeast Asia, India, and then also
Australia to have a decent year for us in growth, but net-net, a slightly more positive global economic environment for
us to operate in, though there is also more uncertainty as I look at today's economic environment than we faced as we
started fiscal 2014.
I look at underlying sales to be up slightly in the 4% to 5% range. I see improvement in our profitability, and I see
probably most likely cash flow being flat; more a function around what happens with our growth rates and also what
happens relative to just the overall performance of the growth of the company, around the world. We're clearly running
at record levels, high levels of cash flow.
We will clearly give a lot more color in the markets, as we always do, in February where we break down and give you
different underlying growth rates, what we see out there. But in general, in total I see a little bit better growth. I see a
lot more concern than I did last year this point in time. But I feel good about where were going into with our programs,
investments, and I feel good that we'll start 2015 on a good positive foot. And clearly, we'll talk about that as we get
into February time period.
We will clearly give you a lot more inputs in February. We don't always give guidance in November, contrary to what
people believe. We sometimes give you pieces of the action of what's going on, but clearly, with the uncertainty that we
see around the world, in particular right now in Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa, we are being
cautious. We're being concerned, and we're being careful about what we're going to say. We will get better clarity as we
move into the next calendar year as we move into that February timeframe. Albeit we see better underlying growth at
the top, we see margin improvement, therefore we will see some improvement in earnings.

And we'll talk about that in February. But in the end, a solid year. Got there a little bit differently than we originally
thought, but in the end it finished very nicely, very strong, good earnings-per-share, good cash flow. You'll also notice
on the cash flow conversion, free cash earnings, we did 110% this year on top of last year's 115%, so good high-quality
earnings and from a cash flow generation and a net earnings standpoint.
So I feel good about what the operations delivered. I want to thank them one more time, and will turn over the call to
the shareholders out there, I am sure they have questions. They always do. And we will, I am sure they will have
questions that I am not going answer, but we'll obviously talk a little bit about those.
So with that, I want to thank everybody for delivering a strong finish to 2014 and looking forward to a strong start to
2015. Thank you very much.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Josh.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: David, did you remember to vote today?
<A - David N. Farr>: I voted absentee three weeks ago.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Of course.
<A - David N. Farr>: I had a board meeting today and yesterday so I've already voted. I hope you voted.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Yes.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: I guess first and foremost on the correction in oil prices that we've seen, obviously you
guys are carrying high levels of backlog, order intake remains strong. What kind of feedback are you getting from your
customers on any sensitivity to some of these projects, if oil stays down, and what kind of duration would it need to
stay down before you see risk or your customers see risk to some of these bigger projects?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's – I mean clearly, there's not one simple answer here on this, Josh.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Sure.
<A - David N. Farr>: It is a concern to us. It's a concern to my customer base when I talk to them. There's not just one
number, but clearly as this price of oil drops down into the 70s, there's a concern that they will start slowing down
some of these – of the incremental new projects, from the standpoint of what they do next. So my concern will be as
their concern is, if the price of oil continues to slip down into the 60s, into the 50s if it goes that low, that clearly that
would cause them to really start pulling back on their spending, which will obviously impact us in a significant way.
We'll see it – we'll start seeing this in the, I would say, early 2015 calendar quarter if the price of oil stays down. I think
it needs to stay down for at least 30 days to 60 days, depending on the type of – whether the oil and gas, which they're
going after. But clearly right now, with this downward slope in the price of oil, it is a concern relative to our core
businesses and where the money is being spent. So a little bit nervous about that at this point in time, and a lot of
volatility.
So flags are up and we're going to watch it very carefully, and if we have to modulate our spending and things like that,
we'll obviously clearly start doing that. But it won't take long, we'll know early on in that first calendar quarter, where

things are trending.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Got you. That's helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks about capital
return to shareholders. I guess one thing that you guys have always wrestled with is some of the trapped cash. There's
been discussion that if certain things go right politically tonight, that maybe there's some tax holidays and repatriation.
Have you guys thought about what you might do if you get better access to the international cash?
<A - David N. Farr>: We'd bring it back, and I would say the number would have a two in front of it with a B in the
backside of it. And so we take that money, we bring over $2 billion back into the United States, and we'd invest it here
in the United States, we would give some back to our shareholders, and we'd internally reinvest it. And so clearly, that
would be a positive, positive source of cash for U.S. companies if we are able to bring that back at a reasonable tax
rate. And let's say they have a 5%, 6%, 7% tax rate on that, but you'd see that money come back into the United States
and get invested in this country, and passed back to our shareholders.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Do you think the bulk goes to internal investment or back to shareholders, or is that a
nebulous question still?
<A - David N. Farr>: That's a – yeah, it's a nebulous question. I'd be very – some of it will go internally, I mean
obviously what we see right now is a stronger North America, which means there's going to be more investments. And
so for, if I had that cash versus going to the commercial paper market, clearly I'd use that cash to invest. It's not going
to drive incremental investment per se but it'll obviously – we know that money will go to use here in the United States
because of the strong U.S. environment we see right now for both growth and investment. So it would be a good thing
for the U.S. economy because you invest the dollars in the capital, it's going to create jobs.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Got you. All right. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Hi. Hey, Dave. How are you?
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay, Rich. Good to see you.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Good. On process, what's the profile of the order base at this point between upstream,
midstream, downstream? How would you characterize that?
<A - David N. Farr>: I couldn't give you a number off the top of my head. I – that's not a number I see. I mean, clearly
we – I mean it's, we're involved in all aspects of that, but I don't have the number off the top of my head. I mean, some
of the large projects obviously are upstream from an investment standpoint relative to going to get the gas and going to
get the oil, but right now I'd say we're still predominantly downstream across the board.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Okay, all right. And then when you look at CapEx, the – almost $770 million this year, I
mean, are you expecting a slight increase next year? How are you thinking about spending?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're looking at – right now, our target all year long was going to be somewhere around $775
million to $800 million. We got a little bit under $800 million at $776 million. I would say next year the target's going
to be somewhere in the $800 million, $825 million. We still have some investments we're making on our global reach
and other investments, so at this point in time we're looking to spend around $800 million to $825 million. That's about
as close as I can call it.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Okay. And then on Climate with the pull-forward here with regulatory stuff, I assume that's
going to hit mostly in the fiscal Q1, maybe a little bit into calendar Q1? But how would you characterize the growth
rate? I would assume you'd see a pretty strong growth number here in the fiscal Q1 number quarter.

<A - David N. Farr>: The pull up due to the efficiency changes going into place on January 1, the production has to be
produced by our customer, the Carriers, the Tranes, the Lennoxes, it has to be produced by 12/31/14. So we'll see all
our pull-up impact will be done within – by the end of November, early December. So it'll be all finished. And then
we'll start seeing the payback here in some of that – the drop-off in our second quarter and our third quarter as we go
into 2015, which would be the first and second calendar quarter. And that's how we're going to see it at this point in
time.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Is there going to be...
<A - David N. Farr>: And the overall growth rate – I think – we'll talk about it, but the overall growth rate right now
we're looking at, if you look through this cycle, it looks to me – I think it's going be mid- to upper single-digit for North
America this year. It's – the best I can tell. It's a function of what happens with some of the housing, but right now it's a
5% to 10% type of range.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Okay. And then that helps your leverage here in fiscal Q1, right, in terms of climate? You
should get some pretty good operating numbers...?
<A - David N. Farr>: That helps – clearly helps us from a – yes, a cost absorption standpoint where usually at this
point in time, our plants are at the lowest level, and then we're sort of – now we're going to be running at the highest
level. And then unfortunately, we'll give some of that back in the second and third quarter because of what happens as
demand goes down. But that's what's going to happen. It's going to be a little bit different forecast in view of Climate
Technology in 2015.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: All right. Okay, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. Take care.

Our next question is from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Mark. Good talking to you.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: ...years of starting – what's that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Go ahead, sorry, go ahead. I thought I might have lost you, but go ahead.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Okay. After a couple of years of starting the year thinking we're going go one direction and
then it tends to slow, you said in your prepared remarks that your 3% to 4% GFI growth is considered conservative. I
mean, in light of what we've been seeing and your comments on Europe, it doesn't feel particularly conservative. Can
you kind of square that circle a little bit?
<A - David N. Farr>: If you look at [indiscernible] (30:31) forecast out there is still higher than those numbers, and so
we've been trying to figure out how to make adjustments. So I mean, if you look at our forecast right now for what I
would say the fixed investment around the world, the number would still be higher than that number. So that's where I
come from. And obviously, Europe is definitely weakening, and I'm concerned about that. But just the underlying
forecast that I see right now is a little bit lower than the economists would say.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Okay. Thanks. Looking at Process and the margins, a couple things. On the acquisitions Virgo,
Enardo, were they dilutive in the year, and if so, by how much? And then next year, qualitatively, do you think your
investment spending keeps pace with sales growth, or would we expect at least a little bit of margin expansion?
<A - David N. Farr>: Go ahead, Frank. Frank's got it.

<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: No. Hi, Mark. The acquisitions were not dilutive. They actually were slightly accretive
even after the purchase accounting charges that we took when we first acquired them. So they were good high-margin
companies that we bought.
<A - David N. Farr>: And what was the second part of that question, the capital spend?
<Q - Mark Douglass>: No, no, no. On your investment spending within Process, would you allow Process margins to
expand next year? Or do you think investment – you've had a lot of investment spending in Process. And...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, I would say right now Process is running at pretty good margin level. We'll look at –
obviously the mix comes into play a lot here, what markets are up and down, but they're growth investments. We're
going to be pretty well – I would say a little – their growth investment's going to be a little less than the sales growth,
and then a function of the margin slightly plus or minus about the same. There's not going to be much change there. It's
really a function of what mix – is North America good, you have a couple of big projects, so it's always hard to dollar
the margin for Process, but Process is going be running at higher levels and margins, with their growth investments
trending down just a little bit slower than the underlying sales growth.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And I want to say thank you to Pat for all the help. In terms of the overall kind
of incremental margins, you've said before that at 4% organic sales growth, you should get a very good operating
leverage. And I guess your guidance for the year ahead is for 4% to 5% organic growth, but the leverage, it doesn't
sound as if it's quite there. So maybe just explain what's happening there to drive only kind of modest earnings
improvement?
<A - David N. Farr>: One, we're looking at continuing to invest in the businesses across the company, and secondly,
right now, when I talk about stronger leverages, you get a little bit as you get forward and you get obviously greater as
you go up towards 5-plus%. So, right now, Julian, I'm a little bit nervous going back to the questions we've had about
some of the mix around the world, some of the oil and gas investments.
So we're just being very cautious about what type of level of profitability we see at this point in time and not make
commitments on the profitability that we don't feel we can deliver. It is just a cautious outlook and concern about what
we're seeing out there as we go into 2015, which is a completely different world, in my opinion, than what we saw
when we saw going into 2014.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then in terms of the overall incremental investment, 6 to 12 months
ago, you talked about a $110 million step-up company-wide in 2014. Just wondered where did that number end up for
that year as a whole, and what are you initially thinking for fiscal 2015 on that extra spend?
<A - David N. Farr>: It was within a couple of million dollars of that. I mean we don't track it that tightly. It's about
the same level when I look at where the money was spent, and I would say that that number is going go up pretty much
in line with what we're saying right now for sales. So if sales are going up 4% or 5%, we are looking at probably
increasing that number 4% to 5% next year incrementally. We're looking at some key programs which are
multiple-year programs to make sure that we invest in those programs at this point in time. And we move it around the
various businesses to make sure we're making the right investments.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then lastly, just thinking about the earnings growth year-on-year, you've
given us sort of an indication of what you're thinking for the year as a whole, but is it fair to say that you will start the
year at a much stronger rate than for the full year and then you're kind of embedding some tail off in the second half?

<A - David N. Farr>: Right now we're expecting the year to be – I would hope to see in the first half that it would be a
little bit better than the total year, but I do expect a slowdown in some of the businesses. I'm a little bit nervous relative
to some of the longer-cycle business if the price of oil continues to weaken, go down, if we start seeing the knock-on
effect of some of the economies around the world continue to weaken, so my concern is that we will have a better
growth rate in the first half and that it will definitely weaken in the second half.

Next we have Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question. So you outlined out how 2014 played out versus plan by geography, and I was
just wondering, given that you repositioned the company to focus on new areas of growth, the fact that the U.S.
continues to be one of the fastest-growing areas, does that accelerate anything internally in terms of how you're
thinking spending money internally and which businesses to push forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: It did last year. We started accelerating in North American spending about 18 months ago, and
we'll continue to invest more in North America. Therefore, if we are able to bring some cash back in, you'd see a lot of
that cash getting invested in North America. So I would say what I see right now, the NAFTA region looks very good
here for the next couple of years, and so we are continuing to increase our investment in the NAFTA region and some
regions, we're actually scaling back and slowing those growth rates down or it may be, what I'd say dis-investing a little
bit.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: But the question about North America, are you thinking about accelerating versus the original
plan of are we still on track versus what we thought?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're pretty well on track. I don't think North America – North America is trending pretty much
like we thought it would trend. We saw this coming and I still think it's going to keep trending that way. So from our
perspective, we're not going to accelerate any faster than we already had laid out the last couple of years. So we're
pretty well right there.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Can you – I don't know if you can talk about it, but what is your underlying assumption about
the run rate of business in Russia over the next year? I was assuming it's, and I'm not asking you to comment about
what's happening in Russia, but what's built into your forecast?
<A - David N. Farr>: Our forecast is Russia will be down next year. We've had a decent run, but because obviously
clearly our business will be impacted by what is going on from all of the restrictions being put on Russia, so our
forecast right now is Russia will be down in 2015.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: But do you make any assumptions about the run rate of the projects in Russia, or this is just your
compliance with the sanctions? Or maybe we can just simply take it offline, it's getting too complex. Any more color
beyond that?
<A - David N. Farr>: We look at where the money investment is going and what is going to happen, and we know
what projects we're involved with, it's not – and we can figure that out. It's nothing to do necessarily, it's just we see
what's happening in our customer base and the lack of cash and their – some of the restrictions and sanctions, and so we
have a feel for what our business is going to do next year, and it's going to be lower.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: That's exactly the answer I was looking for. Thank you.

Our next question is from Jeremie Capron with CLSA.
<Q - Grace Lee>: Good afternoon, Dave. This is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. I have a – we have a
question for Network Power.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes?
<Q - Grace Lee>: It seems that Network Power seems to have the weakest outlook for 2015, not so surprisingly, so I'm
wondering whether you could tell us how you think about the attractiveness of that asset in a going-forward basis? And
also, it would be great if you can share some of the metrics that you track in order to evaluate that business.
<A - David N. Farr>: We track – the same metrics we track that business, we track all businesses: growth,
profitability, cash, and returns, so those metrics are the same ones. And for my expectations right now, Network Power
has continued to make progress. There's clearly not as much progress as we would like to see. We have certain markets
which are struggling, and particularly I'm very concerned about the European and Eastern Europe and the Middle East,
so that I'm concerned about. I look for decent growth next year and I look for improvement in profitability. So right
now I have solid expectations and as I told the outside world, we continuously evaluate that. And at this point in time, I
still believe over the next couple of years, we can create incremental value for our shareholders from where we are. So
that's where we sit.
<Q - Grace Lee>: I see. Just one follow-up. If that business doesn't pan out in the way that you expected at this point,
would you consider some aggressive changes in the portfolio structure?
<A - David N. Farr>: The answer is yes. We do that – yes, we do that at Emerson. We do look at businesses getting
out of businesses, and if we feel like it cannot create the value for our shareholders, Emerson is not reluctant to do that.
And we've divested a lot of businesses under my 14 years of CEO leadership, and I guarantee that we will continue to
evaluate that, and will continue to evaluate all businesses. If they're not going to create value for our shareholders, we'll
get out of them. It's a part of doing business.
<Q - Grace Lee>: Great. Thank you.

Next we have Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Hey. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: So just first on Climate, what – could you just describe what you mean by customer
accommodation expense?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, very easy. We changed a coating on our motor to reduce rust inside the compressor and
by doing that, we created a chemical reaction within the new refrigerant and the new process. And with the new
electronic expansion valves, it created a clogging, so they had some failures out in the marketplace. And so we've had
to work with our customer base to figure out how to compensate them, and so that's what we do. And we had to take a
charge in the fourth quarter to – in anticipation of what that's going to cost. But it started around actually a quality
improvement in the product, and it clearly – it backfired a little bit with the new expansion valves, electronic expansion
values, and also the new refrigerant chemicals. So it's one of those things we tested for and we missed it.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: And then that's a resi – that's a resi dynamic?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.

<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Resi-related?
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, yes.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Okay. And then just on the geographic guide, I mean, you talked about China being a little
bit weaker, Southeast Asia being a little bit better, Europe being weaker. I mean, it looks like that incrementally, there
are not too many geographies that are actually getting better this year. So to get from the 3% to the 4% to 5%
underlying, is that just backlog conversion? I'm trying to reconcile that.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think that – I think the NAFTA region, which last time I saw North America was still our
largest market...
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Yes.
<A - David N. Farr>: I am actually having a little bit faster growth rate next year.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: All right.
<A - David N. Farr>: So that's how I square the circle.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: I got it. And then one last question, just on the – on kind of the order flow here. You
talked about Process potentially slowing down. You're obviously going to have the tougher comps in Climate. I mean,
is it possible, the orders have been pretty strong, up kind of a high single digits here. Is it possible that in the second
quarter, that those orders could go negative because of those comps? Or is there enough going on in the rest of the
business where the orders can kind of hold up here in a reasonable way?
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, it's always possible, Steve. It's hard for us to map out the trend line of orders, but if you
look at the order trend last year, I would say that there is a chance that we could have a negative three-month roll or
negative quarter. I'd say the answer's always positive, Steve. I mean, always potentially, yes.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: All right.
<A - David N. Farr>: And I haven't mapped them out per se, but if I look at the trend line, knowing where it came up,
I would say there's a chance you could see that just like you potentially could see it in the – the next fourth quarter
could have a problem, too.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: One last quickie. You gave an EPS range last year of 4% to 7%. The margin comment is
slight improvement. Could you maybe just provide a little bit of context around kind of EPS dynamics since there's
some moving parts here around pension and a little bit of share count benefit, all that kind of stuff?
<A - David N. Farr>: It will grow next year.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Earnings will grow next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Earnings will grow next year. I'm not going to give you any more, Steve, on that. Earnings will
grow next year.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - John A. Baliotti>: Hey, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: How are you doing, John?
<Q - John A. Baliotti>: I'm well. How are you?
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, not too bad. Haven't talked to you for a long time.
<Q - John A. Baliotti>: Yes, well, earnings have been pretty clear, so – I just had a, if we kind of go up in altitude, I
was just – you know, if we take a step back. I know we, as a practice, take out one-time charges, non-recurring events
to look at the underlying business, but as you pointed out, being CEO for 14 years, there's been a number of these, I
guess, events over the last couple of years, deals that were done before you were CEO, and I'm just curious in terms of
going forward, what kind of governors have you been able to put in place to mitigate the risk? Obviously, global things
change. There's not a lot you can do about that. Currency moves around. But given what you've learned over the last 14
years, what have you added to the due diligence process as you look to deploy capital going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think a couple issues from the standpoint of, I would say, from different technologies. I think
we're looking today at more of an industry that will be obviously less volatile and from technology standpoint, there's
always been a trade-off of how we try to figure out how to drive a little bit faster growth, and sometimes you take a
little bit more risk. And so I think we spent a lot more time around that issue, John, after the impact of the charges,
which have been very painful for the management team including myself and the board. So we spent a lot more time
around that risk and the volatility and the reward or the downside from that standpoint on the charge.
And secondly, I would say that if you look at where we've been making acquisitions the last several years, we've been
focusing more on the Industrial, the Climate and the Process side. So I think we've changed our profile a little bit to
where we've been making our acquisitions.
<Q - John A. Baliotti>: Okay, great. And just as a follow-up on – obviously, currency's beyond your control, but what
kind of, just academically, what do you think on a reported revenue base, if we use the context of modest improvement
in margins, what would you see as a, let's say, as an inflection point in reported growth that would, given the
investments you've made in the businesses over the years, that would kind of step that up? In terms of what kind of...
<A - David N. Farr>: Not from a currency standpoint, but you're just saying from an underlying margin, profitability
standpoint...?
<Q - John A. Baliotti>: Yes, so if you say 4% to 5% core growth, obviously currency is nothing you can control, so
you lose a couple points there, you're going to lose a couple points in divestitures. But if, including those things, you
were able to have a reported growth of a couple points higher, how much higher do you think – would you need to get
to the 4% to 5% on a reported basis to get a nice – a more significant improvement in profitability? Or could it be a
little bit less?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's going to be more on the 5%range before – to get that type of leverage point from the
standpoint of what we see at this point. Given where we are, given we're running at profit margins that I would say last
time I saw were record levels, and so I would say that we have to get above that 5% range to really have a nice leverage
point, but it's just from the standpoint of unless I wanted to dial back the long-term investments, which we have not
done because we feel quite strongly that over the long term, making those investments will strengthen our position in
the market leadership, which we are today. We're a stronger company today. And that's...
<Q - John A. Baliotti>: And so obviously...
<A - David N. Farr>: ...versus short term, thinking I could cut, I could cut, I could cut, I could cut, and I think then I
would have a much weaker company, and then you have a whole different situation on your hands.
<Q - John A. Baliotti>: Right. And so obviously the working capital comes down through that, your cash flow, all
those things are positively benefit from that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.

Your next question is from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Peter Richard Lennox-King>: Oh, hi. This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Just a couple of questions. The
first one being on – could you talk about the release of your backlog in terms of timing across the segments and how
that links to expectations for revenue growth given that you were talking about H1 probably being a bit stronger than
H2 in 2015?
<A - David N. Farr>: From the perspective of Network Power backlog, it's historically within, we expect that backlog
to come out in the first and second quarter. I mean, obviously, we also expect the order rate to keep growing, too. So
we see Network Power growing next year, and if the order rate keeps growing, I wouldn't be surprised if the backlog
doesn't keep growing, because backlog will grow with the orders if you have a vibrant business.
On the Process side, historically, you would start seeing that backlog be eaten away here in the first half of the year. I
would expect that to happen this year, and then again, it will start building back up if the order pace picks back up at
the second half of the year.
Those are the two big backlog players. I mean, Industrial Automation and Climate are smaller backlog and they'll
typically come out within – Climate comes out within two or three months and Industrial Automation usually within
three to four months, five months.
<Q - Peter Richard Lennox-King>: Great. Thanks. And could you talk about, have you been seeing any changing in
pricing, price versus raws in the order book?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, pricing has been pretty consistent all year long from the standpoint our price-cost has been
pretty consistent all year long, our net material inflation, that tells us that the marketplace is not growing all that
rapidly. And I would say that on the flip side, the oil price dropping, that will obviously help our net material inflation.
And so right now, we're slightly positive in price and slightly negative on net material inflation, so we're doing okay.
So the price-cost is fine. We haven't seen any changes there.
<Q - Peter Richard Lennox-King>: And then finally, do you have any early returns on order trending by segment
through October that you could share with us?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, nothing yet. Nothing at this point in time.

<Q>: Hey, guys. This is [ph] Jane (50:25) filling in for Nigel. Thanks for taking my questions. One, just quickly on the
Power Transmission divestiture. Would you guys use the proceeds to buy back shares? That's what you usually do and
if so do you expect to fully offset the dilution by year-end 2015?
<A - David N. Farr>: The answer is yes, we are expecting to do that and based on the expectations that we will
eliminate the dilution by the time we finish the fourth quarter. So yes and yes.
<Q>: Okay. Okay, great. That's helpful. And the second one, just a quick follow-up on Climate margins. So in the press
release, you call out some unfavorable mix impact. Just wondering if that's related to the 13 SEER pre-build and if so,

business was very strong, and it is slightly lower margin, and our North America – obviously with the customer
accommodation, that hurt us from a margin standpoint. So that is assuming we've got everything sized like we believe
we have it sized, that is behind us now in the fourth quarter. And so I think from a profitability standpoint for Climate
next year, we'll probably look at getting back to where we were trending on a positive way, so we should be fine.
Maybe a slight improvement in profitability at Climate based on a total year number.
<Q>: Okay, great. Just lastly, can you share some initial thoughts on growth investment and restructuring spending for
fiscal 2015?
<A - David N. Farr>: The growth investments will probably be up from the, I think it was $110 million last year; it
will probably be up like 4%, 5%. Restructuring spending will be down slightly, I'm talking about I mean – what did we
finally spend last year, Frank?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: $52 million.
<A - David N. Farr>: $52 million? So if I would look at – if I was picking a number I would pick $50 million, a nice
round number. The restructuring next year will be $50 million. I mean, it could be – if we had something pop-up, it
may could go to $60 million, and so right now, maybe $50 million-$55 million, something right around there.
<Q>: Okay, great. That's really helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: Is it $53 million?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: No, $50 million to $54 million.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: $55 million.

The next question is from Jonathan Wright with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Hey, guys. In the release, you called out significant favorable currency comparisons
in the Process Management segment. I just wonder how much of the 130 basis points of margin improvement in there
was from the currency?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: It was a pretty significant portion of that in the quarter. We had a lot of transactional
currency inside the businesses. So it was a significant portion of that improvement.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Was that related to the weaker euro? What drives that?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Part of it was related to the euro, but it has to do with various contracts they have in place
with customers, so it's really a number of currencies, not even predominantly the euro but the A-dollar, the Sing-dollar,
Brazil. It's a number of currencies where they have contracts denominated into a third currency. It's kind of a
complicated accounting thing, but it is – it just flushed through to be a positive in the fourth quarter.
<A - David N. Farr>: Sometimes it's a negative. If you go back and look at it, if you go back and look at the quarter,
Q2 was a big negative. So it moves around, and it's almost impossible to forecast.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: And that's a one-off impact? I mean, we shouldn't expect a stronger U.S. dollar over
the first three quarters of next year to a have a similar impact on Process margins?

<A - David N. Farr>: I don't think so. We don't plan on it. It really is a function, as Frank was saying, it's a function of
where we get the contracts and which currencies move against us, or positive, both ways, and sometimes some years it
hurts us, some years it helps us, some quarters it helps us versus it's – it just happened to be one of those quarters where
the contracts flipped the right way for us, and it's almost impossible to forecast.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay, great. And then on the corporate line, in the first half of 2014, you had a
number of one-off items in there, the acquisition costs, in-process acquisitions, the Artesyn restructuring charge. Is
there any reason or are there any offsets to sort of a $50 million reduction in corporate in 2015?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah, we'll have some headwinds that partially offset that in 2015. Pension will be slightly
higher, we'll have equity comp which will be slightly higher. So we wouldn't expect to see all of that flow through in
2015 versus 2014.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze one more if you don't mind, on Industrial
Automation, you called out the hermetic motors business up 20%-plus, but overall motors and drives down. Is there
any – I know that business is more levered to Europe, but was there anything going on there, any sort of competitive
dynamics sort of weighing on motors and drives as a whole?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, it was primarily driven via the Middle East and Western Europe. They have a very strong
presence and it was a very difficult marketplace for them...
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: ...and that's what caused it.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: All right. I guess thanks, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.
