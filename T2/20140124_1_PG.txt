MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of
forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a
discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business.
Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where
applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is a
ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to as the equivalent GAAP
measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP
and GAAP financial measures.
Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.

Jon R. Moeller
Good morning. Our October/December results came in pretty much as we had expected, keeping us on track to deliver
our fiscal year objectives. All in sales were up modestly versus the prior year, including the three point headwind from
foreign exchange.
Organic sales grew 3%. Organic sales were in line or ahead of year ago in each reporting segment. Coupled with 4%
growth in the first quarter, this leaves us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Organic
sales growth was driven by organic volume growth of 3%. Organic volume was ahead of year ago in each of our
reporting segments. Pricing added one point to sales growth and mix reduced sales growth by a point.
Consistent with the reported market growth and market share data you have seen, October and November were
relatively soft months for our categories and for P&G. December, on the other hand, was a relatively strong month for
us. December organic volume growth was over 5%, with each sector growing at or above 4%. Organic sales were up
mid-single digits.
December quarter all in GAAP earnings per share were $1.18, core earnings per share were $1.21, which leave us on
track with our plans to deliver 5% to 7% core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Earnings for all segments
were ahead of year ago, except for Baby, Feminine and Family Care, due to foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was
an $0.11 per share headwind for the company in the quarter. The year-ago period also included a $0.07 per share gain
from the sale of our bleach business in Italy. Combined, these two items constitute a 15% core earnings per share
growth headwind for the quarter.
Core operating margin was about equal to last year, down 10 basis points. Organic sales growth leverage and 230 basis
points of cost of goods, overhead and marketing savings were offset by foreign exchange and negative mix. Core gross
margin was down 90 basis points. Cost savings of 130 basis points and volume leverage were offset by geographic and
category mix of 130 basis points, foreign exchange of 90 basis points, higher commodity costs and higher
manufacturing start-up costs.
Core SG&A improved 80 basis points, driven by 100 basis points of marketing and overhead productivity savings.
These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange impacts and targeted innovation and go-to-market
investments.
The effective tax rate on core earnings was 21.5%. This included a positive 1 point impact from the release of a tax
reserve, following a favorable audit outcome in Asia. This reserve reversal accounted for roughly $0.02 of earnings per
share benefit on the quarter.
The net impact from all of the items below operating income: tax, interest expense, interest income, non-operating
income and share count was a slight headwind to core earnings per share growth for the quarter. We generated $2.4
billion in free cash flow, and remain on track to deliver free cash flow productivity of about 90% for the fiscal year.
As planned, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends, and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock,
bringing year-to-date share repurchase to $4 billion. Net, the second quarter came in pretty much as we were expecting
on both the top and bottom lines, leaving us on track to deliver our sales and earnings forecast for the fiscal year.
As we move forward, value creation for consumers and shareowners remains our top priority. Operating TSR is our
primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit
level, requiring sales growth, progress on gross and operating margin, and strong cash flow productivity.
Operating TSR drives focus on core brands and businesses, our leading most profitable categories and leading most
profitable markets. We will begin to make more operating TSR progress as we move into calendar 2014.
Our strongest brands and business unit and total company positions are in the United States. We need to continue to
ensure our home market stays strong and is growing. The actions we have taken over the past two years to restore
consumer value, expand our vertical product portfolios and horizontal regimens, and lead innovation have enabled to us
restore value creating share growth in many parts of the business.

We still have more work to do in a few categories and the competitive environment is intense which leads to choppy
results on a quarter to quarter basis but we are making good progress. We have a stronger brand and product innovation
program ahead of us in the US this quarter. We continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets with a
focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. This is where
the world's babies will be born and where more new households will be formed. Developing markets will continue to
be a significant growth driver for our company this year and for years to come.
In October, December, organic sales grew 8% in developing markets. We'll continue to focus the company's portfolio,
allocating resources to businesses where we can create value. We'll continue to exit businesses where we determine that
potential buyers with different capability sets can create more value than ourselves.
Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we are continuing to push forward with our productivity and cost savings
efforts. We have made solid progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong productivity plans for fiscal
2014 and we're working to accelerate some fiscal 2015 savings into 2014. Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we
are now forecasting more than $1.6 billion of cost of goods productivity savings this fiscal year, across materials,
logistics and manufacturing expense. This is up $200 million since our last update.
Versus the go-in target of 5%, we expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We're up
more than 8% fiscal year-to-date. We have now exceeded our 2014 fiscal year non-manufacturing enrollment reduction
goals, only six months into the year and have begun work to accelerate roll reductions planned for 2015 into 2014.
Our stretch objective is to get substantially to our end of 2015 objectives by the end of 2014. This would put us close to
or within the 16% to 22% reduction goal we have established one to two years ahead of target. And we won't stop
there. We continue to identify opportunities to simplify and streamline our organization design.
We continue to drive marketing productivity and effectiveness through an optimized media mix, with more digital,
mobile and social presence, improved message clarity and greater non-advertising marketing efficiencies. We expect
absolute marketing spending to come in slightly above prior year levels, but marketing as a percentage of sales to
decline. Importantly, the overall effectiveness and impact of our marketing spending will be well ahead of the prior
year.
We see several more years of effectiveness improvement ahead driven by new, more efficient digital mobile and social
media and big opportunities to continue to improve the efficiency, precision and effectiveness of our communication.
We remain committed to make productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage.
We are equally committed to being the product and commercial innovation leader in our industry. We are currently
bringing significant innovation to market in fabric care, including upgrades on all of our Tide Plus value added liquid
detergents; new extra-large tub sizes on Tide PODS; Gain Flings, a triple chamber, single load laundry pack, providing
Gain consumers with enhanced scent, better freshness and more cleaning power, all with the convenience of a single
load form; scent upgrades on Downy Unstoppables and Gain Fireworks in-wash scent beads; Tide Oxy, a multipurpose
stain remover that can be used in the laundry or around the house; and Tide Simply Clean & Fresh laundry detergent,
specifically designed with the right level of cleaning and freshness for mid-priced tier consumers. We have received
strong retailer support for these innovations, over delivering our distribution, shelving and initial merchandising
objectives for the launch.
The Ariel unit dose innovation in Western Europe is tracking well above expectations. We are continuing the
expansion, launching in Italy, Iberia and the Balkans earlier this month. Consumption trends on Tide Pods have
remained strong, growing in the low teens fiscal year to date versus the prior year.
We are also launching a very strong oral care innovation bundle next month, including: Crest 3D White Brilliance,
delivering our most advanced whitening and freshness benefits in one toothpaste; Crest 3D White Luxe, which removes
up to 92% of tooth stains in five days, and with our new White Lock technology, locks out future stains and microfine
lines in the teeth; Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips with new FlexFit film, an innovation created with technology from
our Baby Care business that stretches and molds for a custom fit for more whitening coverage; our new Crest

Sensi-Relief innovation, which delivers improved sensitivity relief combined with Scope freshness; And Crest Be, a
new line for experiential consumers including flavors like Be Dynamic Lime Spearmint Zest, Be Inspired Vanilla Mint
Spark and Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek.
In North America our recent Baby Care absorbency, comfort and design innovations are driving diaper market share
growth. U.S. diaper share is up a point and a half versus prior year with particular strength on the Pampers, Swaddlers
and Luvs product lines, retaking market share leadership for the first time in many years.
We continue to strengthen our share position in the US battery business behind the Quantum innovation and recent
distribution increases. P&G battery value share is up 2.5 points for the past three months to over 40%.
In December we started shipping Pantene in North America with improved product performance and packaging. The
shampoo and conditioner formulas contain a new Pro-V antioxidant complex, delivering clinically proven healthier hair
with every wash. We are also leveraging Pantene's "Shine Strong" advertising that has received global acclaim for
tackling gender labels and encouraging women to show their strength and shine. The advertisement has generated
nearly 1 billion consumer impressions globally.
We are expanding Old Spice into the rapidly growing North American male hair care segment behind a full array of
shampoos, conditioners, and styling products with Old Spice's most popular scent collections. This started shipping last
week. Old Spice body spray is growing strongly behind the new "Smellcome to Manhood" commercial campaign. To
date the campaign has generated over 700 million consumer impressions, the vast majority of which have been free
through social media and mass media coverage.
Duracell's "Trust your power" advertisement has gained high awareness online. It features Derrick Coleman, the only
legally deaf player in the NFL and the barriers he's overcome by trusting his inner power. The U.S. advertisement has
driven over 1.7 billion consumer impressions in just two weeks since it was launched on January 10th.
We recently launched our new commercial campaign for the Winter Olympics. The commercial program includes a
balanced combination of single brand, and multi-brand executions. Our research shows stronger purchase intent is
generated when individual brand executions are closely coupled with the multi-brand execution. The Olympics ad
campaign has generated nearly 1.6 billion consumer impressions so far and like Old Spice and Duracell, most of these
are earned or free impressions generated through traditional and social media.
These products and commercial innovations should contribute to strong top line momentum in the back half, which,
combined with productivity savings, should enable us to deliver our fiscal year objectives.
Next, we are improving execution and operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently and
more reliably. We need everyone playing their position and playing it well. Consistent with the customer service
improvements we discussed last quarter, we were recently named the top rated manufacturer in China, our second
largest market, as rated by our retail partners in both the Advantage Group and Kantar retail surveys. These surveys
reflect the quality of our customer business development organization, promotion plans and customer service
reliability.
Last, we are making strategic investments in innovation and go to market capabilities. Targeted R&D investments are
enabling us to strengthen our near and midterm innovation pipeline. Targeted go to market investments will enable us
to strengthen sales coverage in our fastest growing markets and fastest growing channels. We believe that the focus that
we are bringing to these four areas: Operating TSR, productivity, innovation, operational excellence, along with
targeted reinvestment will enable us to continue to improve results even as we work to address several remaining
opportunities.
We remain on track to deliver our 2014 guidance, topline, bottom line and cash. We are maintaining our organic sales
growth range of 3% to 4%, achieving organic sales growth in the upper half of our target range should result in a
modest overall market share growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of 2 points which
leads to all in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year. We are maintaining our forecast for bottom line
core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%, despite stronger headwinds from foreign exchange and softer market

growth rates. We aim to make up the difference through productivity advances, which will primarily benefit the fourth
quarter.
The fiscal year headwind from foreign exchange has continued to increase. We now expect foreign exchange to be a 7
point headwind to core earnings per share growth. As a result, our guidance now translates to constant currency core
earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 14%. We now expect the tax rate on core earnings to be a point or so
below prior year levels. On an all in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This
range reflects somewhat lower non-core restructuring costs in fiscal 2014 versus the prior year.
The second half earnings growth increase that's implied within our guidance is driven by foreign exchange and cost
structure improvement. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind in the first half, but will moderate in the second
half at recent spot rates. We will also annualize the operating impacts from last year's Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.
Manufacturing start-up costs will annualize in the second half of fiscal 2014. Productivity savings and
devaluation-related price increases will build sequentially.
As you prepare your estimates for Q3 and Q4, please keep in mind a couple items. We won't annualize the Venezuela
impact until mid-February, in Q3. We'll have a full quarter of laundry and oral care innovation impacts in Q4.
Productivity savings that are being advanced to offset stronger FX impacts and lower market growth will primarily
benefit the fourth quarter. Also, pricing will be taken to offset recent devaluations in some markets will take effect only
in Q4. We expect to deliver another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending
in a range of 4% to 5% of sales, and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion.
In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we want to continue to be very transparent about some key
items that are not included. The guidance we are reconfirming today is based on last week's FX spot rates. Further
currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor unrest in Egypt, which is a
large business for us and a base of export for the balance of Africa, as well as unrest and economic instability in the
Ukraine, though the situation has recently improved. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products
and devaluation present risk, as do import restrictions, price controls, and devaluation in Argentina. Finally, our
guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates.
Our first half results were in line with what we expected, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and
make progress towards our long-term growth objectives. We continue to operate in a volatile environment with
uncertainty in foreign exchange, some deceleration in market growth rates and a rapidly developing policy
environment. Against this backdrop we've maintained top line growth and improved constant currency operating
earnings growth. We have an even stronger innovation program in the back half of the year and savings from
productivity improvements that will build. We are making targeted investments in our core businesses, most promising
developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities and are aggressively driving productivity and cost savings.
Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our share owners.
That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, our business segment information is provided in our press release
and will be available in slides which will be posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call.
Our next significant investor event headed by A.G. Lafley is the CAGNY Conference on February 20. We hope to see
many of you there. I would be happy now to take your questions.

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. Jon, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cadence of the quarter, right. I
think you mentioned that December was up 5%. Can you put that in the context of sell-in versus sell-through? What
was going on in October, November? I think your shipments probably exceeded consumption by a reasonable margin

in December.
Why is that? How do you feel about inventory levels there? And then, if you can go through the same sort of cadence
through the quarter for the emerging markets too, given all of the concern there, that would be great. Thank you very
much.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Sure, Chris. You are certainly right, in that our innovation – the timing of innovation did affect
the timing of shipments in the quarter. We are very comfortable with inventory levels currently, and off take in January
has been very encouraging. So we don't see a reason for – we really do believe that there's strength behind the
December numbers and that that should carry through into the third quarter.
On developed and developing markets, there really wasn't a significant difference in aggregate across the months of the
quarter. We continue to see some softness in market growth rates, but there continues to be very strong growth overall,
between 7% and 8% in the quarter we just completed from a market standpoint, and we expect that to continue through
the third quarter as well.
So what we have seen in OND [October, November, December], while presenting some challenges, leaves us confident
as we head into JFM [January, February, March].

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Jon, as you look at the move to more local manufacturing, can you talk about sort of
the glide path that we should see in international operating margins over the next couple of years? It seems as though if
you exclude Russia and China, you are probably looking at maybe high single digit operating margin in your
international business, and how long do you think it will take to see meaningful impact there?
And then, a related question, given the fact that you guys are still producing in some high-cost countries and you're
seeing this massive negative transactional impact, are you thinking now about potentially hedging transactional going
forward? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, John. I mean, one of the big questions, as relates to glide path going forward on
margins and developing markets, obviously, is foreign exchange. But if you take that out, last year, we were talking
about growing profit ahead of sales growth, so improving margins on a constant currency basis in developing markets.
We made pretty significant progress.
This year is really the same story. On a constant currency basis, we'll grow earnings significantly ahead of the rate of
sales growth, so I really can't, because I can't predict exchange, give you an exact glide path, but we should continue to
make progress quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, on those developing market margins. As you mentioned, localized
manufacturing, but even more importantly, as we continue to bring innovation to those markets, value creative
innovation, which allows us to mix consumers up, which is happening pretty encouragingly in places like Brazil, and
places like China and Russia.
So, I've said from the beginning that our developing market efforts, particularly as they are focused on the biggest
opportunities with the highest chance of winning, should, over the long term, be a margin accretive endeavor, not a
margin dilutive endeavor, and we continue to see that.
As relates to hedging, we'll continue to look for all opportunities to operationally hedge, and obviously, the localization
of manufacturing is part and parcel of that effort. In terms of financial hedging, we continue to look at that periodically
as well. A lot of the FX impacts, though, frankly, are in non-deliverable currencies, whether it's in Egypt, Venezuela,
Argentina, the Ukraine, et cetera, where there really isn't a financial hedging option. And many of the other markets,
the interest rate differential is so high that even the cost of forward hedging gets pretty prohibitive. And as you know,
all that that does is buy time. As those instruments expire, we are right back to the issue that we started with, and I
would rather, where we have the opportunity, solve the issue real time, up front.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Jon, beauty continued to drag down the organic sales growth number. The other divisions
looked pretty solid. So, I was hoping for more detail on how you plan to drive market share improvement going
forward in beauty and when you think we'll start to see some improving share trends. And also, in grooming, you
mentioned market contraction in developed markets. Can you run through what's driving that and what are your plans
as the category leader to drive improved growth going forward, particularly on the innovation side? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Dara. We continue to make progress on our efforts to strengthen the growth rates in
beauty and many parts of the beauty business are growing quite well. Personal care shipments, for instance, increased
double digits in the quarter, strong growth really in all regions, up double digits in China, mid-teens in Central and
Eastern Europe, and more than 25% in Latin America. Cosmetics, we continue to do very well in. U.S. CoverGirl value
share I think was up about half a point in the quarter, behind innovations like the Hunger Games Capitol Collection and
the new Bombshell volume mascara collection. Our antiperspirant and deodorant business continues to perform well,
with U.S. deodorant value share up a point and a half versus year ago, driven by recent innovations on Secret and, as I
mentioned, Old Spice.
And then we come to hair care. Many parts of the hair care business are doing well. Head & Shoulders grew mid-single
digits in the quarter, including double digit growth in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and
Africa. Our biggest opportunity there is Pantene. I mentioned the innovation that's coming to market that we feel good
about. We are feeling increasingly good about our overall equity and advertising campaign efforts. And as you know,
as I mentioned, we will also be expanding hair care into the young male segment behind the Old Spice brand. So we are
hopeful that we are rounding the corner in hair care.
On skin care, we still have some work to do, and that's going to take some time. So we're not – we share the impatience
that exists externally. We know that we have more work to do, but we are comforted by the progress that we are
making.
On the question of developed markets, market growth, and our responsibility as category leaders for market growth, the
good news is that – I mean, markets – the developed markets are growing, albeit at a modest rate. It kind of oscillates
somewhere between half a point and a point of value growth per month. And, within that, the better news is that where
market growth is strongest in developed markets is in the U.S. and Japan. It's weakest in Europe. We are overdeveloped
in both the U.S. and Japan. And so, from a footprint standpoint, relative to developed market growth, we are fairly well
positioned.
We absolutely accept the responsibility for growing markets in the categories where we are leaders and in the countries
where we are leaders, and, increasingly, our retail partners are looking at us as partners in that regard, to grow their
business as well. We bring innovation that does grow markets. If you look at what's happened, for instance, with Crest
3D White and some of the other innovations, we bring innovation that increases trips and grows market baskets. So it is
very much a part of our focus. It's actually more important in many places of the world than share.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Just first a clarification. The 7% to 8% growth in emerging markets, less than 100
basis points of that, I assume, would be the benefit of new country or new category combination launches, so if you can
just clarify that and make sure that that's a real sort of same store sales number or close to it?

Then my second question is with regard to what A.G. has talked about, this sort of shrink to grow, and I know you said
you are looking for partners who can grow your business better maybe than you can, are you entertaining full brand
divestitures or is there the possibility too of country category combination exits, kind of what Kimberly is doing,
getting out of diapers in Western Europe. Is that the stuff that you're entertaining as well? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Wendy. From a developing market growth standpoint, the vast majority of that 8%
growth in developing markets that we posted in the last quarter is, if you will, same country, same category,
apples-to-apples growth rate. I don't know exactly, but I would guess that the impact of any new white space business
is well below a point. So that should be a pretty good number and representative of the progress that we are making.
And I apologize; I have now forgotten the second part of your question. What was that, John?
<A - John Chevalier>: Divestitures.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Oh, on divestitures. Sorry.
Historically, if you look at our efforts in this space, where we've determined we can't create value, whether that is at a
category country combination level, or a brand level, we've looked at other options. So in the past, historically, for
instance we exited the Family Care business, the tissue towel business in various parts of the world because we just
didn't see at that point a financial structure and an industry structure where we could sustainably create value for our
shareholders.
We did the same, as you know, in several categories recently, from pharmaceuticals to coffee, to snacks to water
purification, and in some markets the bleach business. Rather than point to specifics, because, as you know, this is
something we really only want to talk about when we have something to talk about, I will just reassure you that –
hopefully it's reassuring, that, as I mentioned, everything that we are looking at is through the lens of value creation and
there's nothing that's off the table.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thank you so much.
So a couple of things. Just a follow-up. What was the percentage of market share that's holding or gaining both in the
U.S. and globally? I don't think I caught that. And then the growth rate in developed markets. I know you gave us the
emerging markets number.
And then my real question is, clearly the March quarter has been a troubling one for P&G historically, so can you just
give us some more color? I know you gave us some data points and it seems like as we look at the back half of the year,
it's really going to be fourth quarter weighted. I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance, but maybe your
comfort level and where estimates are now, you know the Street consensus. That would be very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So percentage of holding – businesses holding and growing share is down a bit from where we
were last quarter. That's primarily driven by two items, one is fabric care in the U.S., and the other is hair care in the
U.S., both of which are big businesses which we're growing share and where we lost a little bit of share in the OND
quarter. Both of those categories are items that we highlighted going into the quarter, as likely going to be experiencing
a significant amount of competitive activity, particularly promotional activity, ahead of our launches in both of those
categories which are just happening now.
So the decline in percentage of business holding or growing share is really driven by those two things, which we
expected going in, and we're very comfortable that we'll – that both of those businesses from a share standpoint will
strengthen as the innovations hit the market.

Just for perspective, if you look at, for example, Lever's percent volume sold on promotion in hair care in OND, it was
up about 6% versus the prior year. If you look at some of our laundry competitors, percent volume sold on promotion
in the OND quarter it was up over 20% versus year ago, so again, these were things that we called out going into the
quarter, things that we expected and it's all ahead, encouragingly, of very strong innovation that's now just hitting
shelves.
Your second part of your question on developed market growth rates, we were about flat, slightly ahead in developed
markets. So the total is 8% developing, flat or just a little bit ahead in developed, and relative to the March quarter, I
think your statement in terms of fourth quarter predominance is correct and it's consistent with the various impacts that
I was calling out in terms of when the different pieces are going to fall in place. Having said that, I expect us to make
good progress in the JFM quarter on both the top and bottom line, but as you think about modeling across the quarters,
it will be fourth quarter loaded.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. Actually, I just wanted to, I guess – the first thing was just on
health care, you know, very big volume number, and then weaker just mix impact. So just curious if that was primarily
because of the expansion of the personal healthcare business in emerging markets or if there is something else driving
it?
And then the other question was just perhaps a bit nitpicky, but I was reading through the release yesterday that you
guys put out about Gain Flings and it just struck me as a little bit too reminiscent of some of the innovation in the last
two or three years where it's this massive bundling of benefits into one product. So it's Gain Flings with great cleaning
power, amazing scent, plus Oxy, plus Febreze. It reads like it's like 10 people sat in a room and couldn't make up their
minds as which was the most important benefit.
So I just would love some clarification maybe on the thought process on why so much in one product, where the form
should speak for itself and how this is or isn't different than the innovation that you guys had been putting out over the
last two or three years in terms of that messaging? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: The healthcare difference between the sales line and the volume line is really just category mix
more than anything. And John can give you the details on that later today. Sorry, I don't have that level of detail right
here in front of me. That's primarily what's driving it.
On Gain Flings, if you think about it, when we brought Tide PODS to market, which has been extremely successful,
that was a multi-benefit proposition too. It was not only the form. It was a better cleaning product. So it was an upgrade
from that standpoint as well. And obviously, you know, nothing comes to market without a lot of work to understand
what consumers – what will delight consumers and what they will be willing to pay for that. And that is certainly the
case here as well. Early, both customer and consumer reaction to the proposition has been very positive.

<Q - Olivia Tong>: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask about grooming margins because they were up
significantly year-over-year after being down in Q1. Going forward is Q1 or Q2 more indicative of going forward and
is this due more to timing of some cost savings initiatives or promotions or innovations or is there something
structurally different so that profit growth will continue?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: No, it's hard to draw meaningful understanding from one quarter's worth of margin increase or
decrease in any one of our categories. There's a lot going on out there, whether it's foreign exchange, whether there's

pricing in some markets, the cost savings program is itself not ratable. It moves up and down across quarters. So I
would encourage you to look more, call it you know, 12 months at margin trends as being indicative of what's
happening there.
We are reasonably happy with our margins on that business. That doesn't mean that we are satisfied and we won't stop

any thoughts on changes in terms of processes within the innovating group, any thoughts there would be much
appreciated.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Nik. Kathy Fish will be taking R&D leadership for the company, has a long track

So we're very excited to see Kathy taking that responsibility. In terms of – you know, we just announced this recently.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys, a couple of things. One is on beauty, we haven't really heard much about what you need
to do to fix Olay, and I wonder sometimes whether you actually need to acquire something in that business, because it
is really your only skincare brand to backstop that business. So I would love a perspective on that.
And then secondly, when we do see the beauty margins go up, I understand that a quarter doesn't make a trend, but it
leads to a broader question that I have, which is, when do you expect kind of that crossover point to happen as a
company, the crossover point to happen, where the productivity savings ramp up to above your investment level?
And, you know, if you could talk about that crossover point, as you see it going forward, in the context of some of the
supply chain work you guys are doing internally, the new supply chain work you are investing in internally, that would
be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Ali. You know, the great part of the Olay story is that that is an incredibly and remains
an incredibly strong equity with very high equity scores, very high net promoter scores, the highest in the category. So
from an equity standpoint, it doesn't mean we can't do more work, but we start with a very strong asset.
And, really from a product standpoint, as well, we have a very competitive product. The work to do is in brand
architecture, it's in packaging, it's in positioning the various properties in a way that is most relevant for consumers, and
it's entering some benefit segments that we frankly neglected and those are growing faster than the benefits segment
that we are in. It also involves ensuring that we reach consumers at different ages, which is part of what we were trying
to do with the Olay Fresh Effects item.
Now this is going to take some time, as I have said before, but, you know, I would feel much more concerned sitting
here if this was an equity problem or a fundamental competitive product problem, which it's not.
In terms of crossover point, back half, and, you know, the supply chain work, we'll talk a little bit more about at
CAGNY, we continue to be encouraged about the opportunity to potentially re-platform most of our supply chain in

to get to standard platforms across the world which allows for faster initiative expansion, to get closer to our customers
with multi-category manufacturing facilities in a way that allows us to serve them better, and it's something that we are

Your next question comes from the line of Jason English. Please proceed – with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the incremental color on
beauty. I wanted to drill a bit deeper on laundry. A few questions. First, on Europe, it sounds like Ariel PODS are off to
a good start but Nielsen data suggests that you are still struggling in the market. So what are the offsets there?
Second with the launch upon us, can you give us more detail behind the merchandising location and targeted price
point for Simply, and lastly, what signs are you looking for to gauge when or if the U.S. market will be ready for the
next round of compaction?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Well, it seems like Ali has now trained all of you well. You all ask three-part questions.
First of all, on Simply, you know, the price is ultimately at the sole discretion of our retail partners, but generally, we
are expecting that to be about 30% on a list price basis below current Tide. Compaction is something that we are
always looking at as an opportunity, actually across categories beyond laundry and if you think about it, we are really
actively doing that as we sit here, because the unit dose offering, whether it's Tide or Ariel or now Gain is the most
compact form that exists in the marketplace today and as more of the market converts to that, it has all the benefits of a
standard compaction in terms of lower cost, better value equation for retailer, better value equation for consumers.
And in terms of the question on Europe, really where we have lost a little bit of business is in liquids, where we are
responding to heavy competitive promotion levels. So it's just a very competitive marketplace, which makes sense as
we bring in PODS and people are emphasizing the other parts of their portfolio.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. I am just going to ask a question on Venezuela, and that is, as we
contemplate another pretty steep devaluation, has there been any change in the policy there about pricing? Have you
been able to work around any of the pricing restrictions and is there any – do you see any easing of that coming?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: That's a very good question, Connie. Currently there are price controls in place. That doesn't
mean that there won't be opportunities to take pricing. Pricing controls doesn't mean – the level of pricing is reviewed
regularly by the government and we are obviously in discussions with them and, you know, I would say that they
understand the need for some level of pricing for both international and local competitors to remain viable.
Also the price controls that exist apply to a portion of the portfolio, not to all. There's what is referred to as regulated
items where the pricing controls are relevant and there are unregulated items where there's more pricing flexibility. So
we continue to work to improve our financial situation in Venezuela, which starts off from a very attractive place to
begin with, but your question is an appropriate one as we look forward. To the extent that there's more devaluation, will
there be more pricing that's allowed and that's just something I don't have the answer to today. That's something we will
be very transparent about and keep you updated on, and that question is one of the reasons I continue, as I talk about
guidance, to hold that item out, if you will, because I have no way of forecasting exactly what the puts and calls are
going to be.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hello, good morning, everyone. Question on the negative mix again, but I would like to ask it
from a planning standpoint. Could you tell us, Jon, whether the commitments that the DBUs presented back in August,
when you created the fiscal 2014 plan, could you tell us whether beauty and grooming are meeting their plans
concerning these very negative gross margin mix? And if they don't, which DBUs have been asked to over-deliver in
light of the reiteration of the corporate outlook for the balance of the year or does it – the plan assume that beauty and
grooming are going to accelerate and therefore the negative mix to improve in the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Javier. On a macro point, in terms of delivery versus expectation, we have been talking
about, on the top line, a mix impact of 1 or 2 points going forward and this last quarter was one point, so pretty much in
line with what we expected as was last quarter.
Each of the businesses has a strong commitment to deliver their plan that creates value for consumers and for
shareholders, but equally, each of them is looking out for the company and is willing to help out where that's needed.
As hard as you can imagine going into a year, knowing exactly what's going to occur during the course of that year,
particularly given the volatility in FX, some of the policy volatility, commodity costs, which are up more in some
categories than other categories, and so that equation gets constantly rebalanced, but I can tell you that no one in any
category has given up.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: Thanks, good morning, Jon. I just want to go back to beauty for a second. I think in terms of
the question from Ali, you mentioned that you don't think it's an equity problem. I would probably agree with that. Is it
a portfolio problem? Do you think that you are sort of missing – you are still missing that brand that you can slide in
between SK2 and Olay, for example, on the skincare side in particular? Is there something that you could do there to
address that?
And then, you know, more secondly in terms of overall beauty, if you look at the successful companies in this space,
most of them are pure play. So is it a different mindset and culture that's really required to succeed in that business,
than say, let's say versus fabric and home care, for example? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Joe and thanks for reminding me of that part of Ali's question. Sorry, Ali that I missed
that.
In terms of additional equities that may be brought to bear in skincare, it's something that we look at routinely. It's
certainly not something that we have crossed off the list. But also, I think, you know, you shouldn't then therefore
assume that, quote; "We need to make an acquisition," in order to get skincare growth back to where it needs to be.
There are opportunities on both Olay and SK2 and there are opportunities if we needed to, to create equities or
properties organically.
If you think about Olay, really, that's a series of properties that were created organically from Total Effects to
Regenerist to Pro-X. And, so, I think the question is a good one, and, yes, we may need additional properties, whether
under existing brands or new brands, but I wouldn't necessarily therefore conclude that we need to acquire in order to
make that happen.
In terms of the capabilities and the skill sets that are required to grow a successful beauty business, you know, if you
just step back a bit here, over the last 20 years, Procter & Gamble with its skill sets and capabilities has built the largest
and the most profitable beauty company in the world. If you look at what we were able to do with brands like Pantene,
like Olay, like Old Spice, like SK2, like Hugo Boss, Lacoste that came from – Head and Shoulders is another good

example that literally started out as very small kind of one country, two country, less than $100 million in sales
businesses, and now are in some cases multibillion dollar businesses, category leaders, global leaders in their
categories, wouldn't indicate that, you know, we don't have the basic skill set and competence required to develop and
grow a beauty business.
Having said that, it's – we are not arrogant in our ways and believe that we have all the answers. We have significant
partnerships, many partnerships externally, which give us access to other thinking in the beauty space, whether that's in
the packaging arena, whether that's in the ideation and conceptualization arena, the equity arena, and we are also not
averse to where there's very strong talent that meets a specific skill outage to bring that in from the outside.
If you look at most of our – most of our design group was brought in and that applies to both beauty and the balance of
the company, was brought in from other companies, other situations with the knowledge that that was an important
capability that we weren't able to source sufficiently internally.
So we are – we will take any help that exists, wherever it exists, but I'm pretty confident we have the abilities across

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning, thanks for the question. First, on the other Bill's question, I missed the
actual percentage in North America and rest of the world of held or gained market share.
And then second, Jon, you talked about kind of being ahead of plan on the cost savings, the cost of goods sold,
restructuring and pulling some of that forward from 2015, yet, obviously there's no change to your EPS guidance. Is
that just conservatism? Is that, we are spending more back into promotion and marketing with some of these launches
or is that just FX is a little bit different from what you thought?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Bill. Back to numbers on market share. Overall market share was about flat in the
quarter and percent holding or growing, I don't have the exact number. It was probably 55ish. So that's the market share
numbers, both of which we expect will improve as we head into the back half of the year.
In terms of the acceleration of productivity savings, I would say there are two motivations for that, maybe three. The
first is we want to make productivity part of our culture. And just like we never ask the question in P&G, "What is
enough innovation?" we don't want to be asking the question, "What is enough productivity?" We'll always be
endeavoring to become more productive and we are doing that for multiple reasons. There's the financial reason,
obviously, but there's also speed to market, clarity of decision making, organization transaction costs, et cetera. So, if
we were in a position where FX was a tailwind, we would be looking to accelerate productivity savings into the current
year and identify the next round.
The second motivation is exactly as you describe, which is that, FX, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, has had a
bigger impact, a significantly bigger impact than we had been expecting, and, as you know, at the margin, while market
growth still offers ample opportunity for all of the best competitors to succeed, it is down somewhat from what we
were expecting when we went into the year. And as you remember when we started talking about productivity, this is
exactly the kind of thing we were working to be able to do, which is offset, as one of the objectives, macro level
developments, without having to compromise our earnings objectives.

take your 0% to 1% growth in developed markets and your 8% growth in developing markets and break those down
into mix, price and volume? And then, as the second part of that, will mix and pricing get better, do you think, in the
U.S. in the second half than the first half? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Let me just give you – and I think you can get the rest of it, Alice, the volume growth rates in
developed, which was 1%, and developing was 6%. So the mix dynamics, pricing dynamics are not that different
between the two. Though, obviously, there are some differences between them. But those are the volume numbers, you
have the sales number, and I think you can deduct the balance.
In terms of going forward, every problem is a significant opportunity, and any acceleration in developed market
business or growth rates represents an opportunity to improve mix going forward. And, clearly, to the extent we
continue to make the progress we are making on beauty, as an example, that's an opportunity to improve mix going
forward, and each of our businesses has its own opportunity to improve mix through value accretive innovation. And
so, while we expect that the developing-developed market dynamic will be prevailing, in other words, we still will have
some negative mix going forward, there are many reasons to believe that the magnitude of that impact can lessen over
time.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a bit broadly about expectations for level of
competitive activity in the back half of the fiscal year, and how we should think about the split between gross margin
and SG&A expense leverage to drive the operating margin that's expected. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: I expect that in an environment of growth, but modest growth, that competitive activity will
remain strong, and – but the biggest antidote to that kind of situation is innovation. We have one of the – much stronger
– the first half innovation program was fairly strong, behind the Baby Care innovation, the tissue towel innovation, the
batteries innovation, and the laundry innovation, on a global basis, and that just builds as we go forward with some of
the things I have talked about and, frankly, some of the things I haven't talked about yet. So, competing on the basis of
innovation is something that is much more comforting, than not, and we are in a good position in that regard.
I think the other thing that oftentimes is missed, particularly in a developing market context, but also in developed
markets, and it goes to the point of one of the questions that was asked earlier about market size. We really don't look at
this as a zero-sum game. There's enough growth for all of the better companies to continue to do well, and there are
opportunities to grow markets, to create new businesses, to build markets. Think about developing markets, for
example. It's really not about share, it's about market, and more competition tends to be accretive, from a market
growth standpoint.

be as high as they have been in many years in the quarter. If you could help us understand, I know you said we should
look at it on an annual basis but a couple of quarters now where margins are actually going up while the business itself
is challenged. Is that a trend that we should expect to continue, the margin growth in beauty and grooming while –
beauty, in particular, while you are improving things and working to turn around Olay and Pantene?
And then secondly, if could you just break out the volume growth in China, and you said it was very strong, but if you

<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Okay. First, on beauty, and I think the question behind the question is sufficiency of support for
the growth of that business, and we are – we are comfortable with the levels of support. As I mentioned, we are
working to increase the effectiveness and the strength behind that effectiveness of our advertising and marketing
programs across the business and that's obviously relevant in beauty as well. And so it gets more difficult to look just at
dollar trends and spending and assess sufficiency of support.
We are very comfortable. We are supporting the new innovations we are bringing to market heavily and there's no
reason that, if that's the case, we shouldn't be looking to take productivity savings to the bottom line. It's a balance
always and it will continue to be a balance. But you are starting to see in those numbers the reflection of very strong
productivity progress, which is a good thing.

<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Good morning. You made several references to your digital ad spending. Could you give us a little
more insight into it in the aggregate? Is it a third of your spending and what kind of impact does it have on your
impressions and what impact will it have on your future spending on an absolute and a relative basis, relative to sales?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Leigh. We are continuing to increase our presence in the digital, social and mobile
spaces as it relates to marketing. The percent that is in those media, or channels is different by category. In total, I think
we are probably at about – are getting close to 30% of the spending being in those areas. It does offer, based on what
we are seeing today, higher return potential and that's why the shift is occurring. And you heard me talk in the prepared
remarks about some of the dynamics of digital, social and mobile media in terms of earned impressions and that's one
of the reasons that we are seeing higher returns in that space. So a huge number of those impressions were not paid for
by us.
The other aspect of those channels and media is that it allows very effective and tighter targeting of a message to a
consumer, you know, think very simplistically about men and women. If you are advertising on TV or – in particular,
depending on what shows you are on, that's going to everybody. And we can much more carefully target content to
recipients in a digital environment. So I expect that that will continue to be an area of focus as we move forward, but I
really do think this is a world of "and", not of "or" and we are really looking at comprehensive campaigns across media
that consumers want to access.
