Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks everyone for dialing in today. I'll walk you through our third quarter results and then take
your questions.
Net revenues for the quarter were $6.7 billion, net earnings $1.5 billion, earnings per diluted share $2.88 and our
year-to-date annualized return on common equity was 10.4%. While there were some headwinds in the third quarter,
our year-to-date performance remains solid in what continues to be a challenging macroenvironment.
On last quarter's call, we talked about how market participants were trying to assess the outlook for the global
economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S. economy could potentially offset slower growth in other economic
regions. In addition, the shifting commentary on monetary policy was leading our clients to question the potential
economic and market impacts of reduced quantitative easing.
These discussions continued in the third quarter. Ongoing uncertainty around the economic outlook and the traditional
seasonal slowdown drove a significant reduction in client activity during the quarter. This reduction in industry-wide
client activity, obviously, impacted the opportunity set in many of our businesses.
In Investment Banking, equity and equity-related volumes declined 27% quarter-over-quarter. Debt underwriting
volumes declined 10% versus the prior quarter and completed M&A volumes declined 36% sequentially.
Within our Institutional Client Services businesses, most product areas also experienced reduced levels of client
activity. For example, within credit products, investment grade and high-yield volumes declined sequentially by 13%
and 19% respectively when looking at TRACE data. In U.S. equity markets stock volumes were down 13% to an
average daily volume of 5.8 billion shares. However, activity improved in September with our Investment Banking
clients. Announced M&A volumes increased significantly and overall backlog improved to its highest level in five
years.
During the quarter, we also saw continued positive trends with our Investment Management business. Assets under
supervision reached a record level aided by $17 billion of net inflows.
I'll now run through each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion,
down 25% from the second quarter. Third quarter advisory revenues were $423 million, down 13% from the second
quarter, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed M&A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first
in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that closed in the
third quarter including Softbank's $21.6 billion purchase of a majority stake in Sprint; Bausch & Lomb's $8.7 billion
sale to Valeant; and Apache's $3.75 billion sale of selected assets to Fieldwood Energy.
We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. They include Vodafone's US$130 billion
disposal of its U.S. group whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless; Applied Materials' merger with
Tokyo Electron for a combined value of $29 billion; and GROHE's $3.9 billion sale of a majority stake to LIXIL.
Third quarter net revenues were $743 million, down 30% from the strong second quarter. Equity underwriting revenues
of $276 million were down 26% compared with the second quarter, driven by a decline in industry-wide activity.
Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.

Switching over to debt, underwriting revenues were $467 million and represented a 33% decline relative to a record
second quarter. During the third quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions: BHP Billiton's $5 billion debt
offering; Schaeffler's $1.3 billion sale of a portion of its equity stake in Continental; and [ph] ADT's (05:47) $1 billion
high-yield offering.
Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services. Total net revenues were $2.9 billion in the third quarter. Fixed client
execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the third quarter, substantially lower than the second quarter, clearly not a
good quarter for FICC. The significant decline in revenues was driven in part by seasonally slower activity levels seen
across the industry and a more challenging macro-environment.
While rates was up relative to a weak second quarter, activity levels remained muted. Revenues within currencies
decreased significantly relative to the second quarter, on difficulty managing inventory and reduced activity levels.
Commodities decreased significantly versus the second quarter on a challenging market-making conditions and also
lower client activity levels. Revenues within credit decreased significantly on lower volumes. Mortgage results
decreased sequentially as clients became more risk-averse, given the potential for tapering in the U.S.
Turning to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.6 billion, down 13% from the second quarter. Equities
client execution revenues were $549 million, down 14% sequentially. If you adjust for the sale of our Americas
reinsurance business in the second quarter, revenues, essentially flat.
Commissions and fees were $727 million, down 13% from the second quarter, again reflecting lower market volumes.
Security services net revenues of $340 million declined 10% from the seasonally stronger second quarter. With respect
to risk, average daily VaR in the third quarter was $84 million, up 4% from second quarter levels.
Let me now review Investing & Lending. We produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the third quarter. Investing &
Lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds, as well as lending activities. These activities occur
across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $938 million, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments.
This increase in fair value was driven by company-specific events like IPOs, strong corporate performance and higher
equity prices. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million, primarily from interest income. Other
revenues of $237 million include the firm's consolidated investment entities.
Switching to Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion. Management and other
fees were $1.1 billion, 1% lower sequentially. During the third quarter, assets under supervision increased $36 billion
to a record $991 billion. Net market appreciation of $19 billion was primarily in equity assets, while $17 billion in
inflows were concentrated in fixed income assets.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards and other items, such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net
revenues ratio of 41% year-to-date. This is 200 basis points lower than the firm's accrual in the first half of the year.
The lower compensation accrual reflects year-to-date revenues and better visibility on expected compensation levels as
we approach the end of the year.
Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 4% lower than the second quarter, largely due to the sale
of our reinsurance business and lower brokerage, clearing and execution costs. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was
30.3%.
On capital, we repurchased 10.2 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.65 billion during the quarter.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased 30.8 million shares for a total cost of $4.77 billion. Today, we also announced an
increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 per share.
Moving on to regulatory capital ratios, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio on a fully-loaded basis is 9.8%, up 50 basis
points from the second quarter, driven by a reduction in risk. The risk-weighted assets are approximately $590 billion,

$345 billion in credit risk, $165 billion in market risk and about $80 billion in operational risk.
Our estimate for the proposed supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules is approximately 5% for the firm and
approximately 6% for the bank. This is our best estimate, subject to change, depending on regulatory clarifications.
Like all other proposed regulatory requirements, we will work closely with our regulators as they evaluate and finalize
the proposal. We believe it is our obligation to support safety and soundness within the financial services industry and
the global financial system. As it relates to how we'll run the business, similar to other regulatory metrics, the
supplementary leverage ratio will be an important input.
Clearly, concerns about the global economic outlook created a more difficult operating environment for our clients in
the third quarter. These challenges were amplified by the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in
July and August.
However, we don't build client relationships or build businesses for a quarter. Client relationships and operating
businesses require years, often decades of investment to build the durability that ultimately creates long-term
shareholder value.
Across the globe, our Investment Banking clients seek our advice on their most important strategic decisions.
Corporate, government and institutional asset management clients look to our execution and risk management
capabilities across a variety of products and regions. We are entrusted to provide investment management services and
offer investment products across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and individual clients, making us
one of the largest asset managers in the world.
Our clients often value our advice and services the most when the outlook is less certain and when finding solutions
becomes more challenging. The U.S. government shutdown and the debate in the United States surrounding the
government debt ceiling has become a concern for our clients.
The political complexity involved in finding a long-term solution has created uncertainty about the world's economic
outlook. And as we have all seen, has weighed heavily on market sentiment.
Now that the political impasse looks to be resolved for the near term, we're hopeful that greater certainty will drive
improved client confidence and activity levels. Having said that, a long-term solution is critical to a sustained recovery
for the economy.
These fluctuations have not distracted us from focusing on the long-term drivers of our business, so as a management
team, we are focused, first and foremost, on our clients; building deep, meaningful relationships and providing
solutions to their daily challenges. We are focused on conservatively managing our financial profile and being prudent
allocators of capital. We're also focused on being efficient operators, while at the same time, providing world-class
service to our clients. In the end, we are focused on creating long-term shareholder value for you, our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm happy now to take your questions.

<Q - Howard H. Chen>: I was hoping to come back to your commentary on FICC. Understanding all of your peers'
business mix is different, but the relative revenue performance this quarter is pretty wide. So I was just hoping you
could add a bit more color on how you would attribute that gap to your relative business mix, the positioning issues you
noted and maybe just more challenging comparables?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. Look, as I said a few minutes ago, clearly a difficult environment for FICC, and
we're not happy with the results. So having said that, we expect that the business mix – I think there could be
something there in terms sort of how different franchises are positioned. Certainly, as we've discussed with you in the
past, our FICC business may be somewhat more weighted toward institutional asset managers. And in a quarter like we
just had, if I back up for a second, remember on last quarter's call, I can't remember who, somebody asked me a
question about how I thought the market would respond to the potential changes in monetary policy. And the
discussion really was around how data-centric people would be. And of course, we came into the summer with less
certainty around monetary policy. And then there were events in the Middle East, and then of course, people actually
couldn't get data with the government shutdown. So I think there could be something in that. So I think the whole
market environment is not good for that particular client base. However, I don't want to sound offensive, again, just not
a good quarter for us in FICC.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks. And then you specifically mentioned foreign exchange in your commentary.
Can you talk a bit more on what exactly happened in the quarter in that business? And are you able to size the potential
facilitation issue and the impact it had on the quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of the currency business, obviously, it was a business I highlighted where it
was challenging market-making conditions. And certainly from inventory perspective, I think if – we look at various
metrics. I mean, one metric I can point you to for example, would be the VaR schedule in the earnings release. And as
you can see, basically from the first quarter to the second quarter, it was a lot of activity in the franchise and risk had
picked up in foreign exchange. And then you'll see quarter-over-quarter, it's a pretty significant drop in the currency
line, and that's virtually all driven by risk reduction.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Great.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry. In terms of the franchise itself, this I will say, we look at a variety of metrics like
you would think. All the numbers we can, we look at our own internal numbers, sales activity, where we can get
transparency into the market. But there's nothing in that data that would tell us that when we look at the metrics, client
engagement looks consistent with those kind of volumes. So franchise feels good, we just had a tough quarter.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Understood. Thanks, Harvey. And then shifting gears to the comp accrual. It's pretty
unusual to see the firm exchange the accrual in the third quarter. So I was just hoping to better understand what's
different this year. Is the message that in this still challenged backdrop your desire is to not fall below a certain return
threshold?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, as always, the comp accrual is based on our best estimate for what we think we will
end up for the end of the year. But of course, we still have a quarter to go. I think as it relates to compensation expense,
as we've talked about before, it's obviously the firm's largest expense. And so this process, no different – this I want to
be clear with everyone – no difference in terms of philosophy in the way we're approaching compensation. So it's still
all the same things we go through in terms of the pay-for-performance culture that we drive. And so we'll look at all the
components, competitive dynamic, performance as I mentioned, and of course, shareholders and ROE and the way we
incorporate that into our thinking, that's always, of course, an important, meaningful component of it.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks. And finally from me, with a few more months since the initial proposals
come out, have been out, I was hoping you could just update us on your thoughts on supplemental leverage ratio, where
the firm may sit today and potential mitigating actions? Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as I said before, under the U.S. rules, which are proposed, we're at 5% for the holdco
and 6% for the bank. I said that was approximately. We had time obviously in the quarter to analyze the proposed rule.
And again, I caveat this that it's a proposed rule, will likely change. And of course, it's not effective until 2018. But I

think you should assume that that's a somewhat conservative estimate, the 5% and the 6%.
And in terms of mitigating actions, too early for us to really be thinking heavily about mitigating actions. We want to
see how the rule evolves. We'll engage the regulators. And this – the way we incorporate this, for lack of better
language, Howard, will be how we incorporate this into our toolkit, will be no different than we do with other
regulatory metrics. Just like we talked about actually at your conference earlier in the year, which actually rolling out
some sample tools has proved to be fortuitous in terms of giving people an example of how we'll deploy it. But it's
pretty early in the process. We'll see how it evolves.

Operator
Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good morning. Maybe we could talk about I&L for a second. I wonder if you could provide
any update on capital and RWA in I&L. I'm not sure if you feel like breaking it out, equity versus mezz, but I'm
thinking down the process of is there a natural annual runoff, excuse me, runoff rate or realization rate in I&L, and if all
that capital generation that you have, if you're finding opportunities to reinvest it back in?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So really excellent question. We haven't broken down and disclosed the allocation
by those segments in terms of the capital, and I think it's clear if we think about the capital allocation in terms of sort of
the conventional market credit, et cetera. In terms of the way we're managing the capital deployment, as you've seen,
we've been in somewhat of a harvesting mode because that's what the market opportunity has provided. We've
obviously, as we've talked about before, we've stayed very disciplined in terms of return characteristics. As it relates to
capital itself, as you know, the investments in funds are deductions from capital under the Basel III ratios. Now there
are transitional provisions, so for example, under transitional provisions, our Basel III capital ratio would be about 100
basis points higher than the 9.8%, but I've been quoting you the fully loaded. So that, I think, we – I would think about
it.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. So from that standpoint, given that the market is providing you harvest opportunities
but not the same level of investing opportunities, it's just there is a natural runoff. I don't want to put words in your
mouth, but the production of the business unit or line item in general has been great, but there should be some natural
shrinkage until there's a reinvestment mode. Is that not a right way to think about it?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think I would think about it no differently than we've approached it in the past, which is
there will be cycles where the investment opportunities for us and our clients seem more attractive and there will be
parts of the cycle where harvesting is more attractive. We happen to be more, slightly more in a harvesting cycle, but
recently actually we've seen some good investment opportunities. They tend to be a bit more geographically-based
given some of the geographic differences and stress around the world, but that's no different in terms of philosophy and
I think the way to think about how we operate the business.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Understood. Understood. Just shifting gears for a second, you just alluded to Howard's
question a little bit. But just curious, the biggest users of gross balance sheet within FICC, and you guys were early in
pushing down Basel III requirements out onto the desk. Is it way early on leverage? I'm just curious on how the
leverage focus even is going to start impacting yours and others' balance sheets.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Again, too early to tell in terms of how we'll incorporate it as an operating metric. But at
this stage based on what we know, again, I want to be really careful about the caveats here because this is an evolving
rule. A couple of things. One, based on what we know about the rule, something that we'll be able to incorporate again
into the toolkit; and separately, remember again of course it's effective in 2018. So in terms of capital planning, even

we're at 5% or 6%, again under the proposal could change. Right now I see it as something that we'll digest into our
processes no differently than other rules has.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Last quickie, the Basel III numbers you gave, is that standardized or advanced? What's
the spread between the two?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. That's a good question. So Basel III, again, fully loaded with 9.8%; standardized is
approximately 9.1%, so lower than obviously the advanced. And under, again, referring to the transitional provisions,
I'm giving you fully loaded as though we're standing many years onto the future. They're both about 100 basis points
higher with the provisions.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. And just target-wise we should be thinking of the 7% plus the 2.5% plus a little buffer?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. We have announced a buffer of 100 basis points and targeting around 9.5%. We're
now living with the metric. We're not too wedded to that particular number. I think the way I would describe it
strategically is we want to run with enough capital, first and foremost, to position the firm defensively. We want to be
in an exceptionally strong capital perspective position. But also obviously the flip side of that is we really always want
to be in a position to commit capital to our clients, and it's been an environment for the last couple of years which has
been trending better but I wouldn't call it a top first quartile client opportunity set. And so we're moving across.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And to be clear, it's 1.5%, not 2.5%.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hey. Good morning, Harvey. So I guess coming back to the FICC business, just
broadly speaking. You talked about client activity, client volumes, positioning, and then I guess there's also sort of the
factor of market liquidity, which ties across the two. But your ability to trade around positions, you kind of think about
the impacts broadly on the third quarter. Where would you sort of rate those three things? I'm trying to think about the
balance of the impact.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, as I said before, I think from a client activity perspective when we look at all those
metrics, all that looks quite positive. So I don't think that was an impact at all. Liquidity is always a factor in markets
where you're in the summer, there's a fair bit of uncertainty. I wouldn't overweight it. Again, you know, the shift in the
second quarter, the third quarter, we just didn't execute as well as we would like to.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And what's your sense of how the market environment going forward here
with the whole evening to digest the deal in Washington last night pointing to January, do you think this is a headwind
for client risk-taking, or a relief or what?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, certainly a relief. We'll see how people digest what the events look like coming
into the first quarter. But certainly to the extent to which our clients, which are evaluating transactions whether it's
mergers, debt equity activity, institutional clients. Look, one good thing about the crisis is it's made everybody focus on
tail risk, and even though as we came into the debt ceiling negotiations, well I think you could've argued maybe the tail
risk was quite low. The world and all of our clients are very respectful of tail risk. It's much easier to do nothing than it
is to do something. So in the short term, got to think having this removed from the marketplace is quite good. The
longer-term solutions, sort of the continued path back to normalcy, if you will, which I think we've been marching

along pretty steadily but it's been kind of a two or three steps forward one step back.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think getting to a point we're just in a comfortable stride as a global economy. The long
term is quite important, obviously.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Right. Okay. And then on I&L, coming back to Glenn's question, I guess if you
think about a future investing cycle and factoring in the deductions to the capital under the new framework, what do
you think – and it might be too hard to answer here, but what kind of return hurdles would make that worthwhile? And
you think private equity-like investments where those firms target 20%-plus returns. I mean, with that kind of an
outlook, is that still viable with better capital hold backs on those?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So there have always been very high requirements to utilize the balance sheet for
multiyear capital commitments. And those would be more than enough to be beyond the hurdles of specific capital
requirements. So that's not a concern. That's a factor that I'm not worried about. As I said, what we're really seeing is
more of the cyclical back and forth. But you know in some respect and we've talked about this before, you neither get
good new investing opportunities or you get the opportunity to deploy the capital into other businesses or you can
return the capital.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Just quickly on commodities, what is the take in your mind to kind of get that
business getting, I guess, sort of back to some sort of normalcy? I mean it's been challenging for you and others. Can
this work inside of a broker dealer with the capital broker rules still to be determined, but...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I would maybe add to your question a little bit. So the commodity environment has
been a little bit difficult, low volatility, and obviously impacted by the macro backdrop. But to specifically get to your
question, the commodity business for us as you know, we've been in the business for 30-plus years. It's an essential
business for our clients. The nature of the activities is we're on the phone with CEOs, CFOs, Treasurers. The nature of
the business itself in terms of their objectives is no different than it would be, for example, for a retailer.
It's about hedging. It's about managing revenue. It's about financing activities, timing of cash flows where they need to
get – for example like, it's very into receivables, financing for a retailer or managing your expense base for a consumer
commodities.
Those are all normal corporate treasury functions that we perform now with clients for 30 years. We'll see what
happens in the regulatory discussion. It's an important discussion, but it's not distracting us from the focus on our
clients.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, Harvey.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, Harvey. You know maybe first, you had a comment that in September you saw a
pickup on the Investment Banking side, and we can clearly see that. I guess, just anything on maybe the FICC side, just
given the environment in the third quarter versus what you're seeing now. There's still some, obviously, macro
uncertainty. But just any color. I know you guys don't tend to give too much color in terms of the current quarter; it's
only a short period of time. But any trends that have been different in September and October?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, you have the July and August normal – what I'll call normal seasonal
slowdown. And then of course, you had a pickup in September. But activity from the client base was picking up
prematurely broadly in the early part of September, but then of course people got very focused on the government

debate.
So there really wasn't a chance for people to shift into what I'll call a mode where they had more conviction. It was still
an environment of uncertainty. But I guess if I had to really sort of slice it for you, I'd say, certainly there was a
seasonal pickup after August with kind of this backdrop of uncertainty, which unfortunately, at least for a while is
behind us this morning.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe as we head into next year and you look at the FICC
business, it seems like we've kind of gone through this clearing portion in the OTC markets with no big issues, it run
relatively smoothly. The SEF, it seems like it's a bigger implementation project for the entire industry.
If we start looking at February as an important timeline, based on the different scenarios that can play out, meaning
they work, they partially work, it's a complete mess. How do you think it impacts the FICC business heading into 2014
and beyond? And particularly, heading into that, like our clients still going to be transacting, do you think volumes are
a bit weak? Just any color on that.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we were, as you know, big supporters of clearing, and I'll give the market and the
regulators really high marks on our clients. A huge amount of work went in by all participants, as you noted, to get
clearing off. It was really uneventful as it should have been. And I think the three stages of client introduction in
clearing were quite thoughtful.
As you pointed out, [ph] in front (34:06) of the launch of SEF, it was harder, there's a lot of infrastructure and it's
complicated for clients, various rule sets. And so it's going to take a lot of work from everyone in the industry,
regulators, SEF operators, market participants like Goldman Sachs; all of our clients who have a deep-vested interest in
getting this right, to be active in that dialog between now and the spring, to really work out all the issues. I don't think
you can read too much into the October launch of Swap Execution Facilities other than there's a lot of work to do.
And I think the regulators were quite thoughtful in pushing out some of the decisions to November 1. Then of course,
we had the government shutdown, so they haven't been there to be able to focus on it. But we're going to all have to pay
a lot of attention to this. I don't think we can – as market participants, when I say we, I don't mean Goldman Sachs; I
mean all of us. I don't think, I can't remember what your language was. We can't afford to have a total mess.
I don't think that's an option that we should all accept. If it takes longer to get it in place, just like it took longer to get
clearing in place, that's what we should do. It's just too important for our clients and for the industry. So it'll be a big
focus over the next couple of months, but there is a lot of work to do.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Thanks. And then just finally, you guys haven't set, any new, like, ROE or return on
tangible equity targets. Obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of the rules. But when you do look at it in
terms of what management, the board, wants to generate in terms of return that makes sense and you've been
maneuvering whether it's on the revenue side, the expense side comp this quarter. What is still a, call it, adequate return
between now and when we get clarity? Because obviously once we get clarity, then you can make more strategic
moves. But just trying to understand; it's been a fairly long time horizon in terms of we haven't gotten the rules. And so
in this interim, before you kind of can set out that new cross-cycle target something in the interim?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So with respect to returns, this is what I would say. Strategically, the way we're
managing the firm is, as we've talked about, it's for the long run. So it's for the long run positioning. Now having said
that, we're very sensitive to components of the cycle, and as you point out, this has been a slightly longer cycle.
So the simplified, Cliff Note version of strategy for the firm over the past several years has been: one, extreme focus on
the clients globally; two, to make sure that while maintaining that focus that we're also managing the cost base, which
is why a couple of years ago we announced the multiple series of cost reductions which brought us down roughly $2
billion; and then along with that, a whole host of efficiency efforts. That's all been designed to create operating
leverage.
And so we feel like we're really, really well-positioned from an operating leverage perspective. We just need to move
back to a market environment that, as I said earlier, is not two or three steps forward, one step back, because that's

really what our clients will need to feel a sense of conviction. And then you get back to more of a run rate.
Now the rule uncertainty is still pretty significant, and as we digest the rules, we'll certainly be evaluating them in a
context of an overall ROE target. What I would say, because I don't want you to get off the call without this message,
things that are going to be on the balance sheet for multiple years, we are still just as disciplined as we always have
been; there's no change to those return hurdles and we're exquisitely focused on that.

Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Matt. How are you?
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Hi. If I could just drill into the equity trading business a little bit. I guess if we ex the
reinsurance and DVA in both periods, it seems like it's down about 10% year-over-year. And I realize the base is
always tricky, but the three universal banks have reported so far have been showing up anywhere from 20% to 35%. So
any additional color there would be helpful.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. So there's ins and outs, as you pointed out, year-over-year. Last quarter – sorry, last
year, of course, we facilitated the Knight transaction, which was obviously an input to – sorry, was a component of
revenues last year. And so there's back and forth sort of ins and outs, I think when you sum it all up; really what you do
is you get to a number that's more like flat.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just on the expense side as we think about
non-comp costs and litigation, just thoughts on those two going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So – I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry?
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Oh, thoughts on non-compensation expenses and litigation going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. Fine. So on non-comp as I said, a big part of the strategy, particularly in this
environment, which is very news-sensitive from a client activity level, we're staying very diligent, vigilant on
non-comp. And just as we have in the past, you obviously would've seen in the earnings release we accrued $142
million for litigation reserve this quarter, $149 million last quarter. We're evaluating all the normal inputs we would
with respect to litigation expense and reserving accordingly.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly on the comp and I think you had said this in your prepared
remarks. But making some of the adjustments that you normally do in 4Q this quarter, should we think about kind of a
more straight line approach in 4Q? So if you look at the year-to-date comp level about 41%, is that a good starting
point as you think about the fourth quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So we'll get the compensation in the fourth quarter when we get to it, but I more or
less went through all the components of how we thought about compensation philosophically which is no change. So
it's our best estimate, but it also reflects the fact that on a year-to-date revenue basis, we're running $500 million ahead.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Operator
Hello, Betsy. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Betsy, are you there?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Can you hear me now?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah, okay. Sorry about that. Okay. So a couple of questions. One is just on the comp ratio. I
know you talked about it a little bit earlier, but in the past I know you paid on all revenues. Is that still the same
approach you are taking? I just want to clarify that because as mentioned earlier, the ratio coming down in the third
quarter is a little unusual.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, no. I think it's our lowest accrual for nine months, but it reflects as it always has,
Betsy, it's the collection of businesses across the firm and I won't bore everybody with all the other components in
terms of our processes. But again, it's our best estimate.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then on the FICC, just a little bit of cleanup question. You indicated the
challenging macro environment obviously. I'm just thinking from a competitive positioning standpoint, obviously
underwriting can tend to be important as to how you are able to generate trading revenues over the course of the
quarter. And do you feel like there was any reason that you might've been behind competitors because you weren't
involved in all of the high profile deals that were out this quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, there were certain large transactions obviously where we were on one side of the
transaction versus others, but that's going to be in the normal mix of business. And so some quarters will be a big
dominant participant, and other quarters less. But over the cycle, as you know, you'll see us be involved in most of the
significant transactions.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then the other question has to do with the SLR. You talked a lot about the
advanced and standardized in the Basel kind of Tier 1 ratio, so I got that. Just wondering on the SLR side, is that also
fully loaded?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, yes. You should think of it as fully loaded.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And your – I know there's a couple of different ways that you can calculate
derivatives. Which way are you guys choosing to do that right now?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We're just following the rules as we understand them. We're not – there's no difference in
terms of different alternatives, but we're happy to discuss with you more offline.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. I'm just wondering about the CEM approach or not. Wasn't sure which one you're
choosing.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. CEM approach.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah? Okay. All right.

shorthand.

Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, hi. There's been a lot in the press about how the regulators and the government
officials want banks to divest their physical commodities business and there's another article in the Journal this
morning. And I wonder if you can talk a little bit
about A, how critical is the physical commodities business to the whole of your commodities business? And B, if
hypothetical they were to sell their divestiture of the physical business, does that free up capital above and beyond
whatever proceeds you would realize? Meaning does the physical commodity business come with meaningful RWAs;
or are there operational risk or charges or things like that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So we haven't disclosed any specifics around risk-weighted assets or capital
associated with physical commodities. The business for us – overly supplied really splits into two parts. One, there's
investment that we own and then there's the franchise, which I talked to bit more about in an earlier question. As it
relates to investments that we own, they're on a normal life cycle where we would intend to hold them for years. As it
relates to the commodities franchise, the extent in which we're involved in the physical business is the extent to which
our clients need us to be involved in the physical business because in commodities, which is a bit different from other
businesses obviously, they need to and many times receive delivery.
And so we could be arranged in that. Very often though under those types of transactions, we are not the holder of title
or maybe the holder of title. But it's important from the standpoint of being able to fulfill those earlier requirements that
clients have hedging, financing, et cetera. But that's how I would, very high level, split out the way the physical aspect
of our business. It's part of our strategy, if you will.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. So it's important to you. All right. Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, it's important to our clients. So by extension, it's important to us. Now we have a
long, long investment in the commodity business, and we have at this stage no intention of selling our business. We're
very committed to our clients here. And so we'll just work with the regulators. But ultimately, the regulators will come
to their own opinion about the business.

of color. It's more significant in equity underwriting and in the advisory side of the business.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then back to FICC. We've heard a lot of reasons why FICC was weak, and you said
you're not happy with it. And I'm still trying to get my arms around it. You said it's activity, it's seasonal. It's
Washington, D.C. It's macro. You said for currencies, it's lower VaR and inventory, commodities, market making,
credit. It's volumes, mortgage. It's tapering. So let me just ask a real simple question. Do you think the decline in FICC

that you're not happy with is a one-quarter blip, or that some of those factors should continue?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's just the quarter, Mike. And those factors, obviously – the marketplace had to deal
with a lot of those factors too, which is why I said we're not happy with it. But it's quarter. We have a very strong FICC
franchise, and that's why I highlighted earlier. We react to these things, and we're very data focused. But when we look
into, for example, all the indicators of client activity, it's just a quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well, a follow up to that. Is any of the decline related to how you're managing the business
differently, whether it's the balance sheet, I know the rules don't take effect until 2018, but you can take actions now.
Or the business due to some regulatory changes, which you talked about, or even how you empower the traders to
manage around risk-weighted assets more?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, not that we can see, Mike. And again I think that, for example, look at the second
quarter and the first quarter. There was no rule implementation or change in management in terms of the way we think
about ratios or the proposed supplementary leverage ratio that would've affected the way we run the business. This is a
really important strategic take away, the way we would run the business on July 1 and the way would run it on June 30.
Just not a great quarter, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I know you haven't disclosed this before but can you give us some detail of FICC whether the
revenues for currencies, commodities, credit and mortgage from the second to the third quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Not beyond what I covered in my opening comments. I highlighted currency, so I think
it's a good example of where we have some challenges. But look, year-over-year, I think we have a bigger mortgage
business than some other folks and so you'll recall last year we were coming into the environment of QE until appetite
from clients was significantly greater in mortgages, but I more or less covered it in my prepared remarks.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Just wanted to focus a little bit on the inflows you talked about in the assets
under management, specifically in the $12 billion in fixed income. Can you provide a little more color on sort of what
those assets were and sort of your thinking about how that trajectory could continue in the fourth quarter?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So in terms of those assets, this is a bit of just a result of our strategy and I don't want to
sound old-fashioned on this because there's nothing new here. This is just continued focus on performance, and the
fixed income team has done a good job in performance. In terms of flows and broadly speaking where they came from,
the flows were diversified, institutional also from our private wealth franchise which has had a long, long record now,
multi-quarter record of inflows. But really it's kind of old-fashioned, nothing new. Just performance.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: The flows generally focused in lower yielding fixed income assets or slightly higher yielding
fixed income assets?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's a mix. But quite frankly, I don't have that detail with me so happy to have Dane and
Heather follow up with you afterwards. In my recollection, it's a mix.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just secondarily, the Q1 balance – quarter end balances for the GCE were
down a little bit and granted maybe I'm making too much of this. But I guess I'm just curious as to why those were
down as you ended the quarter given that we've heard from a number of clients that they were increasing their liquidity
as a result of some of the macro issues in DC?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. So if you look at the last two quarters, you'll see second quarter I think we
averaged $180 billion and then we finished at $183 billion, so there's liquidity building up towards the end of the
quarter. And in a quiet market environment, you'll see us generally. Not always of course, but generally, we'll build
liquidity. And so, you'll see that the average for the quarter was even higher than the endpoint of June where the
average is $187 billion. There were just individual one-off things that utilized liquidity at the end of the quarter as part
of our franchise.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And just finally, you talked about this a little bit in terms of the commodity VaR but
overall with the VaR being about $84 million for the quarter, up a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I guess I'm just curious
as to if the change quarter-over-quarter was as much due to market volatility, or is that just your positioning within the
individual risk categories?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it was more due to volatility over the quarter. If you look for example, in currencies,
the decline was as I mentioned earlier, more related to positions. Same with most of the other businesses. Rates was a
little bit the other way but not much.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Kian. How are you?
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Hi. I'm fine. How are you?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good. Thanks.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Few questions. Starting with leverage, I'm more interested in the Basel III proposal leverage
and I was wondering if you could give us also some indication on how your leverage ratio would look like under the
Basel III proposal which came out recently?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's lower, Kian, but it's just a proposal. So we're in the proposal phase on that.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: What are the issues that you see as non-workable? Or let's put it differently, in terms of
concerns within the Basel III proposal relative to what you see from the U.S. proposal?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So our – I wouldn't want to draw a lot of distinctions between the two proposals. There
are certain things that the industry broadly and obviously you can check, we submitted a letter, I would say, collateral
for one and the treatment of collateral. I think at the highest level, we like metrics. And I think the leverage ratio can
play a valuable role in a suite of metrics. I just think, like all metrics collectively, whether it's the U.S. rule or whether
it's a Basel III proposal, I think we just all as market participants always need to be focused on any unintended
consequences. So the things that we're most focused on are things like liquidity pools and how they're incorporated into
metrics, and because we don't – we just generally don't think people should be incented to hold liquidity at the
regulatory minimum. And that might not happen tomorrow, but these rules will be in place for a very, very long time,
and so we need to incorporate them that way. But as I said, collateral would be one thing that we'd be focused on, on
the Basel III.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And credit derivative notional hedging, is that something where you feel quite comfortable
with the Basel III guidelines in the proposal, that you could meet a lot of netting? Or do you think that's something you
would actually have to change the way you hedge your positions in order to justify the netting under the proposal?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's very early to be thinking about responding to these, so again, let's start high level.
So getting gross notionals down, it's a good thing. It's clean living. Gross notionals certainly can create risk, but not risk
in the sense of the way that we think about market risk, and I'm not talking about market risk in an RWA sense; I'm
talking about risk in the marketplace. I think that the focus on gross notionals is an important one. But I think, and
again, this is difficult. But I think what you would see the industry do, is get very focused on collapsing gross notionals.
To date, when the industry comes together to focus on gross notionals, obviously everyone's very focused on the
economics. I think you could see people be more open to the economic cost of shrinking gross notionals. But all of this,
Kian, is included in our letter.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. Thank you. Moving towards the results, just – I wanted to come back to FICC. If I
look at the percentage decline that some of your peers have shown so far in this quarter, and as you've make an
adjustment additionally considering you may be slightly more impacted due to you being more of a credit-geared
house, I calculate that the potential inventory FX impact could be around $0.5 billion mark in terms of impacting your
results. I'm just trying to understand the material decline here in FX in your FICC results, and I'm just wondering if
there's something that I'm doing incorrectly looking at it from this perspective of looking at pure seasonality giving you
a slightly more of a decline due to your mix and then assuming the rest is FX inventory related.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think it's a little complicated to compare in an individual quarter if we're down a
certain percentage and our competitors are down a certain percentage and really take a lot of information away from
that. Now obviously, it's important. But I think trying to draw conclusions on the math is harder, so I don't know that I
can give you any more information as we talked about. I think to sum it up, we had a tougher quarter. By the way, we
will have quarters where we will have out-performance and we will have tough quarters. This happened to be a tough
one.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: But why would you have FX inventory in the first place, a very liquid market. I understand
you run your FX with your EM business together. Just trying to understand, what are the positions that would hold
inventory on behalf of clients?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: All right. As you would perfectly understand, Kian, I'm not going to get into the details
about specific positions. But as I said, you can see it in the VaR profile, the derisking. But I can't give you any more
color than that.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: No, I understood. Last question on this, then. Are the positions that you had sold or are they
hedged?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry. One more time?
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: The positions that you had in the inventory, are they hedged or are they actually sold?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry. What I think you're asking is, are the positions – I think you're misunderstanding
my message at this point. There are no core positions that are something that are a significant concern. So it sounded
like that's what you're asking, the question.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. All right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I won't talk about whether things – on how we manage the risk, but...
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yeah, yeah, that's what I was more interested in. If you still have the notional on the books
or you actually sold the notional?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. I didn't answer the question, actually.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks very much.

Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: Yeah. Thank you, and good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit, drilling down on the, I Bank pipeline. Just given sort
of the commentary around the trading environment and uncertainty, I'm just trying to reconcile that with sort of the
record – or not the record, but the 5-year record pipeline, which would require CEO confidence to do things with M&A
and equity. So maybe you can sort of relate the two back, it just seems like, while it's great, it just seems like it's
abnormally high for the environment that we're in to have such a high pipeline. What exactly are you guys seeing?
What's happening that it's so big, given the uncertain environment we're in?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So it's a great question. So as you know, the dialog around M&A activity and
financing activity, but M&A activity in particular, it's a very, very long lifecycle dialog. If we had one of our merger
bankers in the room, very often, in a particular transaction, not just the client, but the particular transaction could be
under discussion for multiple years. In an environment with very high uncertainty, which is a low conviction
environment, obviously, then transactions tend to get delayed.
So it's not one of these things that turns on or off, in terms of like a light switch. So nobody blows the all-clear whistle.
But I would say, there's certainly a desire in the corporate base to produce growth. And when they see strong,
underlying synergies, people will take action, but they need a backdrop in which they feel comfortable executing.
And as I said, the trend in terms of the backdrop, regardless of the fact that this quarter there might have been a step
back in terms of confidence and an increase in uncertainty, the trend is positive. But this is a multi-year phenomenon,
obviously.
<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: Got you. Okay. Shifting gears, maybe you could just spend a little bit more on the asset
management business. Maybe big picture, just from my vantage point, it seems like you guys are doing a little bit more
to buy, build, et cetera there. Do you guys have any long-term targets as to how big you want that business to be
relative to the whole organization? Obviously, it's a capital-light business. I know you guys have done some smaller
acquisitions here recently. So any color on strategic steps you guys are taking there that are different from maybe three,
five years ago?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, the focus has been very intense for several years. But as I said before, it's a bit
old-fashioned. The primary focus is performance and with performance, we know we will build assets. We'll look from
time to time at acquisitions, if we think they make strategic sense and it fits our business and it's additive to our clients
and our performance. But as I said, we're very pleased with the result in the growth, but we're relying on something
that's a bit old-fashioned.
<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: Got you. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi. I just had a follow-up question on the Basel III, all-in look-through number, I think the
9.8% versus the 9.3%. Could you talk us through – it looks to me like the deductions have gone down, because
obviously you've got buybacks offsetting profit or more than offsetting profit. And I think the [indiscernible] (01:03:04)
you said were down $10 billion? Correct me if I'm wrong. But is there something going on in deductions or something
else?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, as you'll recall at the end of the second quarter, obviously, we got the finalized rule.
One of the things about that rule, obviously, is there's the financial institutions deduction. What you're really seeing is a
reduction in a component of that risk, which is a deduction from capital as you know. So the fact that we – and we
talked about this before, the fact that our teams have both the tools and the ability to manage the balance sheet, what
you're seeing as we've seen the finalized rule, is you're seeing them take actions that affect the ratio. So, for example,
selling certain cash assets.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. So it's not private equity deductions per se, it's the other deductions?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. So, okay, you're bringing up a good subtlety of the significant versus the
non-significants. The significant deductions – and for anyone else on the call who's less fluent in this minutiae, happy
to set up some follow up time with Dane and the team. The significant deductions obviously they will come with
harvesting over time, because we're in the funds with our clients.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. Hi. Just a question on the Investing & Lending, the equities side, so the
language that you used in the press release and I think you've also said in your prepared remarks sort of made a
distinction between corporate performance and company-specific events. So, could we generally think in our mind that
the corporate performance ones are probably marks to a model and then the company-specific events are more going to
be either realized gains or marks to a market value that's visible?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So what I was referring to in the opening remarks, obviously, is public market equities
versus private equities, and we're very rigorous, as you know, in our mark-to-market policy. So we incorporate all
variables, but I'll list a few, obviously specific performance of the asset, which we have visibility into and the market
environment, and pending events. So if for example, we think an asset is going to go public in the next quarter,
potentially, if that's the strategic plan for the enterprise or a subsequent quarter, if that's there, then we'll have other
valuation techniques which we're in receipt of obviously. It's a very rigorous process as you know.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Oh, yeah. No, I don't doubt that at all. Is there any color that you can give us on the gain that
you recognized in the quarter? How much of that was actually a realized gain versus some element of a mark?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, it's all fair value, right? So I think if you're asking about specific monetization, no I
haven't delineated that, but we're marking the balance sheet every day.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Sure.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So net-net, it is realized.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Let me move on to the SLR. I know you're right, it's years off and you're already
basically compliant as you said. So you're not going to rush to do mitigation things. But you also had commented on
the fact that compression and reduction of notionals was probably a healthy thing. So I'm wondering, to what extent
you're engaged in more compression, more maybe looking to redocument existing transactions that are long-term in
nature into central clearing, so you can get rid of the CVA drag on the denominator of the leverage ratio, things like
that?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So again, just from a risk management perspective, we've always been very engaged in
trying to reduce those notionals. As I said, it's just a good way to run the business. Now because of the developing rule
set, the whole marketplaces is more engaged and we're very engaged and that's not to imply people weren't as engaged
as we are. The nuance I was trying to explain earlier was that people, historically, over many, many years, everyone
liked to reduce gross notionals but sometimes couldn't agree on cost. Now there's just a greater forcing function, so
there's more of a tailwind to everybody reducing gross notionals.
And so, now again, this is a little bit of the process of I think how we certainly, I suspect the rest of the industry, this is
a little bit the leverage ratio what it encourages you to do is to basically rank the exposures basically from a return asset
perspective. Start with the low ones and mitigate from there. And this would be high on the list for the whole industry, I
assume. Certainly, high on the list for us.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So I guess that I could interpret your remarks to mean that you probably are spending quite a
bit more time in hopefully getting more resolutions when you're sitting across the table from a counterparty who's
another dealer in getting these notionals down and maybe moving some of these long-dated transactions, as I said, into
a central clearing environment. Or does that not really work that well?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, that's a correct assessment, but it's just started. We just started and the industry just
started. So it's early going, but the answer is yes.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, fair enough. Like I said, I was just trying to get a sense for the direction of travel...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I know.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: In that.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I understand.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And then just a final question on sort of the intersection of the I&L business and the comp
ratio reduction. I mean, I know you've always had this – or generally, have had this policy of straight-lining it for three
quarters. But isn't it economically logical to conclude that the reason that the ratio came down as much as it did is just
the degree to which your profit mix this quarter was driven by Investing & Lending activities that really have
inherently a very low compensation ratio?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so, again, no change in philosophy. I want to be really clear with everyone. It's our
best estimate, it reflects the collective contribution of all businesses, certainly not an individual business segment. And
we have reduced before in the third quarter. So it's not completely out of sync with what we've done historically, but it
does reflect all those things I talked about earlier, the fact that we're running $500 million ahead, we have more
visibility into year-end, which is another way of saying best estimate. We have more visibility into year-end, and of
course, the cost reduction efforts give us flexibility.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, that's fair. Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hey, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Brennan. How are you?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good. Just a quick one, at this point and it's again on comps. Sorry. Hate to beat a dead
horse, but just kind of want to take a slightly different angle on this. During earnings here, we've seen another dominant
fixed franchise cut their comp ratio kind of materially this quarter too. And obviously, you can't speak to the actions of

a competitor. But in your view, is it appropriate to assume that, as an industry, we are maybe rationalizing FICC to a
new regulatory and business environment through these actions?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I have, as you know, zero visibility. You'd have a lot more visibility in your
engagement with our competitors than I would. Not to wax on and make the call long, but I remember the first day I
showed up at Goldman Sachs. One of the first things I was taught and mentored was that compensation was first and
foremost how the firm did, then how your division did, then how your business unit did and then how you did as an
individual. We haven't changed any of that. If anything, we're protective of that cultural mantra and I hope that every
new summer hire that we brought in this year, I hope they got the same lecture we had – I had back then.
So, again, it's the same culture and you're just seeing it based on performance. And when I say performance,
everything, the year-to-date run rate being ahead in revenues and also all the multi-year efficiency efforts we've built
in.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes. Good morning. A couple of related questions, really. And the first one really just
touches on what the last gentlemen said because I suppose you've been very, very honest about how difficult the
quarter was for fixed income. But I guess we've seen so many headwinds build up around fixed income since the crisis.
And then, during the summer, we obviously saw the possible issues around tapering, which will come of course, not
just in the United States but elsewhere, where a lot of liquidity will come out of the market, interest rates go up.
And you guys have tended to be the cutting edge of thinking through these issues, as you were post-crisis. And I
suppose what I'm interested in and maybe compensation is one of the issues, but what else are you thinking about in
terms of that withdrawal of liquidity, which may mean that you're going into a market where fixed income revenues are
not going to be anywhere near as robust as they were even in the post-crisis period when you're having to deal with
Basel III and the other capital issues?
And I guess relating to that, perhaps linked to it, the 10.4% return on equity, I know you're not happy with that. You
talked about the legacy assets. You've always talked about when the markets pick up you will really perform very
strongly because of your clear strengths in the market. But I suppose when I look at some of your diversified
competitors in the Investment Banking space, they are already moving towards the mid-teens. And I'm just wondering,
again given that you're normally at the front edge of these things, at what point do you start looking at the business
model and enhancing it by looking to broaden it rather than actually perhaps narrow it as you've had to do with
Dodd-Frank and et cetera? Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay. So that's a big question. So in terms of fixed income, we don't really try and
predict what happens in terms of the market reaction and what I mean by predict, I mean over a multi-year period and
let's just say we go into a period of rising interest rates. A lot of what will determine the size of the market for fixed
income, when I say that I mean the activity levels for us and all of our competitors, won't be the absolute level of rates,
it will be the backdrop of the environment. And so again, an environment where it wasn't – isn't so news-sensitive and
clients were high conviction/low conviction and very nervous, is a much better environment for our clients, which by
the way translates generally to better volumes in the marketplace and better liquidity for everyone.
The best case history is really the equity business, which as you know, went through a massive transformation from the
late 1990s to today as an industry and yet revenues continue to grow. So our responsibility to our clients and in running
the business is how we adapt. So in the past, we've been good adapters and we just have to continue to adapt. But the
cornerstone of adapting will be the interface with the clients and making sure we deliver to them.

That's what we've done in the past, we just need to continue doing it. But the changing interest rate environment, that
will determine strategy over a multi-year period. As it relates to returns, look, we strive every day to ensure that we
have the highest absolute returns while managing the firm conservatively and we really want to make sure we have the
highest relative returns. For us, this has been a good relative return environment. We'd love to see better absolute
returns, but it's been a pretty strong relative environment.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. Thank you for that for that, Harvey. We just talked about rising rates on
tapering, but is this with sort of liquidity as well, which I think was one of the great fears that we've just seen and that
does suggest the need to realign the business. And I think what you're saying is that you'll just keep an eye on that and
you have no plans at the moment to do that in respect of something that hasn't actually started, albeit it will keep going
for a long time once tapering starts?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So changing – what's critical about certain changes or whether or not the change what
clients need first and then how it impacts market structure. I don't see anything in a rising rate environment that
changes market structure. What will change is how clients view the marketplace. Again, if it's a high confidence, we're
back to more certain economic growth several years from now and interest rates are higher, that could be a very
positive environment for fixed income investors, but it might not be. All I know is we'll have to adapt and make sure
we respond to it better than our competitors.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Thanks. Thanks for taking a stab at it. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. With respect to maybe some of the positive
secondary impacts of regulation can you maybe update us on which businesses you feel like you've been gaining some
market share in and maybe where you're seeing some opportunities as competitors are just reevaluating their strategies
or how their allocating resources?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I think it's too early to see that. Obviously, earlier in the year and continuing, we've
seen some pullback from some competitors. I think that's a multi-year phenomenon as it relates to the impact of
regulation. We'll see that again over time. That'll be a big part about this operating flexibility that I was talking about
earlier. The real differentiating characteristics, firm by firm, and we all will live with the same rules, we'll have all the
same resources, is which firm can better deliver to their clients and which firm can better adapt? And I've talked about
this a lot, adapting too early can be a mistake and adapting too late can be a mistake and so we'll be watching it very,
very closely and doing everything we can to deliver to our clients.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, not to beat a dead horse on FICC, but we have seen some
flows out of bond funds in recent months. And we all understand they're small in the absolute, but just given your
exposure to institutional asset managers as you mentioned, did you see any change in client behavior in the quarter or
anything that maybe was a little bit concerning just with some of the outflows out of bond funds?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You know, it's been a while now but obviously I grew up in that business and I
co-headed it before my current responsibilities. I think what clients did is just normal client risk management. Maybe,
maybe a little different than you would have seen pre-crisis because people are just very, very sensitive to potential tail
risk. Quite frankly, I think it's a good thing for the marketplace, not a bad thing. But no, I think all the behavior was
very predictable.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Thank you.
