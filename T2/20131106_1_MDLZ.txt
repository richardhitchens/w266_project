Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dexter. It's easy to forget, but we just marked our one year anniversary on October 1st. We've accomplished a
lot this past year and have taken a number of actions to sharpen our focus and strengthen our capabilities. In the face of
challenging economic conditions, we've delivered solid results, strong volume mix, in fact the strongest in our industry,
accelerating growth in emerging markets in line with our double-digit target, strong market share performance in four
of our five regions and double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency.
We're also taking some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. As we detailed a
couple of months ago, we've identified significant supply chain savings. Together with reducing overheads these
savings underpin our margin improvement targets, including gains of 500 basis points in North America and 250 basis
points in Europe by 2016.
We've also authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program and increased our quarterly dividend. In fact so far this
year, we've returned nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. At the same time, we've had some challenges. Our revenue
growth was solid, but it was below expectations. This is due in part to factors outside our control like the precipitous
slide in coffee prices and the slowdown in global categories. But other challenges rest squarely on our own shoulders.
As you know, we hit some speed bumps in Brazil and Russia last year just as we came out of the spin. But in a matter
of months we identified the root causes and implemented effective solutions.
Both Brazil and Russia have rebounded well and are now growing in the mid-to-high teens. However, as you've read in
our earnings release like many of our peers we're now facing some headwinds in China. In a global enterprise there will
certainly be challenges from time to time, but our job and our promise to shareholders is to manage those challenges
and deliver our commitments. This needs to be a combination of more quickly adjusting expectations to marketplace
realities, improving early warning systems to stay ahead of potential issues and having the right leaders and capabilities
in place. We've addressed each of these issues. So as we look ahead we remain optimistic about the power and the
potential of our unique assets to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
With that perspective, let's look at our third quarter and year-to-date results. In Q3, organic revenue growth increased
5.3%. That's up sequentially from 3.8% in each of the first two quarters. Volume/mix was very strong driving all of the
revenue growth in the quarter and the vast majority of our growth year-to-date. The strength was also broad-based with
vol/mix up in all regions. The contribution from pricing year-to-date has been modest largely due to the impact of
lower coffee prices. Growth in emerging markets continue to improve sequentially from 9.4% in Q1 to 9.7% in Q2 and
10.7% in Q3.
The BRIC markets have been the key drivers of this increase, up double digits in the third quarter. Brazil, Russia and
India each grew mid-to-high teens more than offsetting the weak results in China, which I'll talk about in a moment.
Developed markets also improved sequentially, up 1.8% in Q3 versus performance that was essentially flat in the first
half. There's no question that 5.3% revenue growth driven entirely by vol/mix is strong especially in a difficult
operating environment and we have good underlying momentum in four of our five regions.
But we missed our expectations. 5.3% is below the 6% rate we had forecasted. And I'm extremely disappointed about
that. Lower coffee pricing and weak results in China drove the shortfall. We've been talking about the pass-through
impact of lower coffee prices on our revenue growth for more than a year now. We expected that coffee pricing would
be a headwind in the first half and then would stabilize. But instead coffee has continued to fall and is now trading
below $1.05. As a result, coffee was a 50 basis point drag to our growth in Q3. And with green coffee prices at this
level, we expect coffee will be a similar drag in Q4 and at least for the first half of next year.
Remember though we price to protect gross profit dollars. So the pass-through of lower green coffee prices on our top
line doesn't impact our bottom line, but it certainly affects our headline numbers.
The more significant issue this quarter was in our billion dollar China business. It's no secret that China's GDP growth
has slowed from north of 9% in 2011 to about 7.5% this year. The macro slowdown is affecting consumption across
most consumer goods and our Biscuit category is no exception, dropping from 18% growth in 2012 to 3% in Q1.

As we observed the sharp slowdown, we invested to stimulate category growth. We increased marketing and sales
support behind Oreo and Chips Ahoy!. We launched Golden Oreo, which has been highly successful in other markets
and from a share standpoint these investments worked with shares up for both Oreo and Chips Ahoy!. And the launch
of Golden Oreo was also successful with product placement in over 500,000 outlets in just six weeks.
So what happened? Well, our incremental investments did not stimulate sustainable category growth. After an initial
increase in Q2 the Biscuit category was up only 2% in Q3. Second, as we shifted spending to our Power Brands our
second-tier brands lost more share than expected. And while our trade stock targets were appropriate for double-digit
growth they became excessive when the category slowed.
We've taken a number of actions to address the situation. We're reducing and closely monitoring trade stocks while
shoring up our analytical capabilities to get more and better data in real time. This will allow our newly appointed
leadership to quickly address changes in the marketplace. Looking ahead, with an extensive multi-tiered network of
nearly 1000 distributors, it will take some time to recalibrate trade inventories and regain Biscuit momentum. So we
expect Biscuit revenue in China to remain soft in Q4 while progressively improving next year.
Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain optimistic about the future of China. From 2009 to 2012 organic
revenue grew 25% annually. The economy and the Biscuit category will recover. And our Gum business continues to
grow nicely in a very robust category.
Outside of China, we're also experiencing a slowdown in most of our global categories. They're still growing well in
excess of other food categories, but realistically it will affect our near to mid-term growth aspirations. In aggregate, our
categories last year grew approximately 6%. In fact that was the basis for our forecast last September. So far this year
however growth has slowed to under 4%.
We've offset the category slowdown somewhat with strong share performance, especially behind our Power Brands. In
aggregate, we're gaining or holding share in nearly two thirds of our revenue. Year-to-date Biscuits were up 7.5%. In
emerging markets, revenue increased 11% despite China's weak performance. In developed markets, revenue rose 6%
led by strong growth in both North America and Europe. Biscuit share performance was terrific with more than 75% of
revenue in key markets gaining or holding share. Our Power Brands grew nearly 12% led by Oreo, belVita, Tuc, Club
Social, Barni and Chips Ahoy!
Turning to Chocolate, year-to-date revenue was up more than 6%. In emerging markets, Chocolate was up 14% with
strong growth across all geographies. In developed markets, Chocolate revenue rose 2% led by mid-single digit growth
in Europe. Power Brands grew over 10% with Cadbury Dairy Milk, Lacta and Milka each up double digits. Our share
performance through September was only about 45% with strength in emerging markets offset by share losses in some
larger developed countries like the U.K. We're encouraged to see that recent U.K. share performance has recovered. It's
now flat for the year through the latest tracking period ending in early October.
Turning to Gum and Candy, global revenue declined about 1%, but we're beginning to see some signs of improvement
as revenues rose modestly in Q3. That's the first increase we've seen in quite some time. Candy was up 4% through
September driven by Halls. Gum in emerging markets was up 6% including strength in China and most of Africa.
While Gum in developed markets was down 16% year-to-date the rate of decline slowed in Q3.
Global Gum share was strong with about two thirds of our revenue gaining or holding share. Clearly, we're gaining
traction in those markets where we've implemented our four step playbook to fix Gum. And as we discussed last
quarter, we expect those share improvements will be a precursor to revenue gains as we implement our playbook in
other markets and as customers reset their shelves.
Finally, in Beverages and Cheese and Grocery revenue grew about 1% with Power Brands up nearly 4%. As expected,
Coffee was down 3% as we passed through significantly lower green costs. Vol/mix however continues to be strong,
contributing eight points year-to-date.
Our convenience coffee platforms continue to drive positive mix, with Tassimo up nearly 40% year-to-date and
Millicano sales doubling. After only about one year in the market Millicano is nearly a $100 million business. Coffee

share performance has also been strong with about 70% of revenue in key markets gaining or holding share.
So even in this more challenging environment, we've been able to deliver strong growth and share performance in most
of our categories. We're clearly not immune to the stronger headwinds that will temper our growth for the balance of
the year and into 2014. But we remain confident in our ability to weather the slowdown and deliver top-tier
performance over the long-term.
Now let me turn it over to Dave.
David A. Brearton
Thanks, Irene. As Irene detailed earlier weak China performance tempered our Q3 results. For Asia-Pacific region
overall organic revenue growth was flat in the quarter with vol/mix gains essentially offset by lower pricing in the
developed part of the region. While revenue was up 3% year-to-date, we expect Q4 to be down low single digits due
largely to issues in China. The region's emerging markets were up mid-to-high single digits year-to-date, tempered
more recently by slower China growth. In contrast, India was up mid-teens. With new capacity now on stream our
Chocolate business grew more than 20% in Q3 in line with continued robust category growth.
Additionally, the region's Power Brands grew 11%. With the notable exception of Asia-Pacific however our four other
geographies delivered solid results in the quarter. In Latin America, organic revenue was up about 17% in the quarter
and 13% year-to-date. Despite a persistently weak economy, softening category trends and consumption declines, our
business in Brazil has grown mid-teens year-to-date. Incremental investments in A&C delivered attractive returns,
driving strong vol/mix and high-teens growth in the rapidly growing Northeast region. Share performance in Brazil
remained solid with particular strength in Chocolate.
Outside of Brazil pricing in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina drove most of the growth. Our
teams there have done a good job of responding to the challenging economic conditions, but we have a cautious
outlook for these markets due to their volatility. Importantly, share performance in Latin America was strong with more
than 70% of our revenues gaining or holding share. Finally, the region's Power Brands increased 15% led by Lacta,
Club Social, Oreo, Halls and belVita.
Turning to EEMEA, organic revenue grew 13% in the quarter and nearly 10% year-to-date. Strong vol/mix gains of 16
percentage points in the quarter and 12 percentage points through September drove the region's growth. Lower coffee
and chocolate pricing in Russia accounted for the bulk of the pricing decline. Once again, Russia's performance was
exceptional, up nearly 20% in the quarter due to very strong vol/mix growth as well as a favorable year ago
comparison. Other markets including Ukraine, the GCC countries, South Africa and West Africa also posted strong
growth in the quarter. Year-to-date share performance across the region was solid with more than 60% of revenues
gaining or holding share. Overall, the region's Power Brands were up 14%.
Looking to Europe, revenues increased nearly 2% in the quarter and 0.7% year-to-date despite the continued economic
challenges in the region. In Q3, vol/mix was again up sharply, contributing 4.7 percentage points to growth. As we
mentioned earlier coffee pricing remains a significant drag on the top line. Lower coffee revenue reduced Europe's
overall growth by 1.4 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.7 percentage point year-to-date.
Looking at performance by category, Chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits year-to-date driven almost entirely by
vol/mix. Milka and Cadbury Dairy Milk each delivered strong growth while innovations like Marvelous Creations also
made a meaningful contribution.
Biscuits were up mid-single digits with most coming from vol/mix. Oreo, belVita and our chocobakery platform drove
much of that growth. Coffee declined in single digits due to lower pricing more than offsetting solid vol/mix. But our
convenience coffee platforms continue to grow strongly. Gum and Candy revenues were down mid- to-high single
digits mostly due to Gum. Here too, we're beginning to see some improvement in share performance as we implement
our new playbook. Overall, the region's Power Brands were up 4% year-to-date.

In North America, organic revenue increased 2.4% at the same rate as the first half. U.S. Biscuits continued to perform
well with revenues up at least 5% for the ninth consecutive quarter. Most of this growth was due to vol/mix behind
strong execution by our direct-store-delivery salesforce. Oreo was up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date on
the strength of base SKUs as well as innovations such as Birthday Cake and Mega Stuf. U.S. Biscuits continued to gain
market share as well, up 100 basis points in Q3 and 110 basis points year-to-date.
Candy once again delivered solid growth behind Halls. As Irene mentioned U.S. Gum share rose for the second
consecutive quarter with especially strong share gains in convenience stores. Gum revenue though declined as
anticipated as our customers continue to reset their shelf assortments to reflect faster moving SKUs. We're also lapping
a high quarter through a year ago in preparation for the spin-off. We expect revenue trends to improve beginning in Q4.
Turning to profits, adjusted gross margin declined 50 basis points in the quarter and was down modestly year-to-date.
In the third quarter, higher commodity costs more than offset benefits from strong vol/mix and net productivity. In fact,
net productivity accelerated to more than 3% of cost of goods sold in the quarter, about double the rate of the first half.
However, the lag in implementing pricing to recover higher commodity costs and currency impacts offset the benefit
from strong net productivity. Going forward, pricing actions are expected to fully offset commodity and currency
movements allowing net productivity benefits to flow through to margin.
Adjusted operating income margin in the third quarter was 12.2% consistent with our guidance of sequential
improvement each quarter. As expected, margin declined year-over-year. That's because last year's Q3 margin was
unusually high due to the spin-off of Kraft Foods Group and some prior year one-time items. Year-to-date adjusted OI
margin was 11.3%, down 140 basis points versus the prior year reflecting various factors including about 30 basis
points from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency, about 50 basis points from cycling of prior year one-time items
and about 50 basis points from incremental investments in emerging markets. We continue to expect adjusted OI
margin will be about 13% in Q4 and about 12% for the full year in line with our previous communications.
The sequential improvement in margin reflects a greater contribution from net productivity and continued focus on
overheads. In fact, overhead costs as a percentage of net revenue were down more than 50 basis points in the third
quarter led by significant overhead reductions in Europe. As we've said before, we expect to see greater overhead
leverage in the fourth quarter since absolute revenue is typically 10% to 15% higher than in other quarters.
Turning now to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.41 including a negative $0.01 impact
from currency. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 16.7% driven by lower taxes. For the first nine
months, adjusted EPS was $1.12 including a negative $0.07 impact from currency. On a constant currency basis,
adjusted EPS increased 15.5% again driven by lower taxes. Incremental investments in emerging markets were key
driver of the $0.03 decline in operating earnings.
Lastly, our cash flow continues to be on track. Comparisons are difficult because the year ago period was pre-spin and
included North American grocery. But the cash conversion cycle outside North America has improved more than 10
days this year versus the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date cash flow is in line with prior experience and our
expectations for the full year.
Turning to guidance. We're lowering our 2013 revenue guidance to approximately 4%, down from the low end of 5%
to 7%. That means our growth in Q4 will be only about 3%. This is much lower than we were expecting, but it again
reflects the impact of lower coffee prices, slower global category growth and a Q4 revenue decline in Asia-Pacific
largely due to China. Taken together these factors will temper growth by 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points in
Q4. Importantly, we expect the solid underlying momentum in our other four regions to continue. And as I mentioned
despite the lower revenue through a combination of increased net productivity and overhead management we still
expect to hit our adjusted OI margin of approximately 12% for the full year. In addition, we're raising our 2013 EPS
target range by $0.02 to $1.57 to $1.62 to reflect the flow through of some tax favorability. This range is based on
guidance currency rates.
Looking ahead, our long-term goals remain the same including 5% to 7% organic revenue growth, operating margin of
14% to 16%, double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders.

That said, when we laid our long-term revenue growth target over a year ago our categories were growing about 6%.
As we've discussed our categories have slowed this year to below 4%. While we believe that the industry wide
slowdown is temporary, we don't expect categories to accelerate in the near-term. Although we won't provide definitive
2014 guidance until February, we wanted to let you know how we currently see next year playing out. We expect that
slower category growth and lower coffee pricing will continue to pressure our top line. As a result, we believe our
revenue growth next year will be more in the 4% to 5% range.
Nonetheless, we expect to leverage our advantage brands to continue to drive strong share performance. And even in
the face of slower growth environments we believe we have the financial and operating levers to deliver strong adjusted
OI growth and margin expansion while the benefits from our share repurchase program should help mitigate some of
the tax headwinds on EPS. We're also exploring additional opportunities to accelerate cost reduction efforts both
throughout our supply chain and in overheads. Of course, while we take significant steps towards our long-term margin
goals, we're continuing to prudently make foundational investments to strengthen our sales and route to market
capabilities especially in emerging markets.
In addition, we'll be flexible in how we deploy A&C investments to balance affordability, opportunity and ensure
attractive returns. As a result, we expect to not only weather this slower growth environment, but also be
well-positioned when these markets accelerate once again.
So to wrap up, through the first nine months this year we delivered solid results including strong vol/mix gains, 10%
growth in emerging markets and increased market shares. At the same time, we continue to face headwinds from
slower global category growth, lower coffee pricing and weak China sales causing us to reduce our full year 2013
revenue outlook. Although these factors will continue to pressure top line in 2014, we believe, we have the plans in
place to deliver strong operating income growth and make significant progress towards our long-term margin goals.
Now we'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just two questions. One just Dave, just looking at how you've preliminarily laid out 2014. I
think previously you had talked about a margin goal for 2014 at being high 12s%. And I'm assuming that also was with
a higher organic revenue growth. So should we still be thinking about that high 12s% margin for next year? Or is that
somewhat in flux?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Well, we're not officially giving 2014 guidance, but as I said a minute ago I think we're
pretty confident that we have the productivity and overhead programs in place that we should be able to stick to the
margin guidance we gave before.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then just second question. Irene, you spent some time talking to investors over
the last couple of months and there's certainly been a lot of discussion – debate about the balance between spending in
emerging markets, what the right growth rates are, the pacing of cost savings. So could you just talk a bit about your
experience with that and albeit you're lowering organic growth for next year – just how you feel about those
investments and the opportunities and if anything has changed in your mind in terms of what the opportunities are?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, I think the meetings we had with our investors were very productive and they give us
a lot of insight in terms of how they're thinking about their business and gave us an opportunity to talk about how we
see the business. If I step back I think there were about maybe five takeaways. I think first and foremost there was

universal agreement among all of our investors that we have created a very advantaged portfolio that's got an incredible
collection of brands in very fast growing categories with a nice emerging markets footprint. I think that was a fairly
universal sentiment. There's no question I'd say second, all investors believe that we have significant margin upside as
we do. And we've laid out very aggressive plans as you had seen particularly in our developed markets. In North
America as you know we've set a goal of 500 basis point improvement over the next three years which should get us to
peer averages, and similarly in Europe we set a goal of about 250 basis points improvement and that also will bring us
actually to the high end of our peers in Europe.
We did at the same time though hear many investors tell us that they want to make sure that we continue to invest in the
emerging markets. They all see the same opportunities there that we do and the question really is just to make sure we
are continuing to make those foundational investments, but we're doing it prudently and at the appropriate pace relative
to market conditions to make sure that we're getting a good return.
I think the third point that you referenced is that a number of investors told us that they thought that our top line targets
might be too aggressive especially in the current environment as we have seen our categories slowing. And we agree
that when we set the targets back in September it was predicated on our categories growing about 6%. And so when we
set a top line target of 5% to 7% that was a reasonable expectation. The reality is as we have shown you those
categories have slowed from 6% last year to 5% in the first half and now to less than 4%. And so we clearly have to
accommodate that in thinking about what our targets are and I believe we have done that as we've given you the
outlook as we think about 2014.
Fourth, I think there's certainly some frustration about our ability to deliver expectation. And I'll say again we've got
operations in nearly 80 countries including some very volatile emerging markets. We're clearly going to have
challenges from time to time and we're not going to always deliver things in a straight line. But as we did with Brazil
and Russia and now with China we will get on it, we'll fix it and we'll make it better. The key though is to make sure
that we have the right targets out there, so that we're able to make the appropriate trade-offs. And without a doubt I
think all investors recognize that our fundamental business is really quite healthy and I think you see that again today in
the results that we reported. And finally I'd say we got very universal support and gratitude for our $6 billion share
repurchase program. That was quite well received.
So I think it was a very productive set of meetings. I think we learned a lot and I think it was a good opportunity for us
to continue to talk about how we see the future and why we are as confident about where things are going as we are.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Thanks for the insights, Irene.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Afternoon.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hey, Andrew.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Irene, you talked a little bit about the need to improve upon some of the early warning
capabilities that you have in some of these more volatile emerging markets. I know that last year following the issues
you saw in Brazil and Russia I think that you talked about some of this back then because some of that wasn't seen as
early as maybe you would've liked. So I guess I was hopeful that we wouldn't see something come a little bit out of the
blue in a big emerging market again. China it seems like was not something that at least you were talking about or more
recently whether it be on the second quarter call or in presentations you've done since then. So I'm trying to get a sense,
did that also come out of the blue where you didn't have enough early warning and if not, why following Brazil and
Russia – why weren't there better controls from that perspective on China?

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, let me answer that question in two parts, Andrew. Without a doubt as I've mentioned
we've taken a number of steps as we continue to evolve our thinking and our learning with the portfolio as it now
exists. We went from a company that was almost entirely in developed markets to one that has a very significant
emerging market footprint. And as we've said these markets have different characteristics than some of our more
mature markets. In the case of China as we saw the Biscuit category slowing as I mentioned, we could see it was going
from plus 18% last year to plus 3% in the first quarter. And we took a number of steps to try to address the slowdown.
And frankly, in the second quarter we actually saw some results. We saw second quarter the Biscuit business was up
9.5% and through July frankly it was up about 4%. So we were feeling pretty good that we were able to offset that. We
had very strong share performance in a number of our categories. So we really felt pretty comfortable that it could be
offset. The speed with which that plus 9.5% in Q2 became plus 2% in Q3 was really the issue that we are wrestling
with. And again the good news is, we know it, we took actions, we saw it. We took actions starting in August to start to
pull back a little bit, but as I said in my remarks when you have inventory planned to be at a double digit growth rate –
to support a double digit growth rate and it plummets down to plus 2% it just leaves us in a difficult situation.
We've got over 1,000 distributors in China and there's a fair amount of inventory at each level of the system. That's
why it's just going to take us a little bit of time to clean it up. But net-net we understood that the category had slowed.
We thought we had some actions that would help to stem that and to offset that and they simply didn't work as well as
we had thought.
More broadly, as I've said before we have a number of new processes in place. We've created dashboards for all of our
key businesses that leverages our SAP instance and allows us to give our local leaders and us at headquarters the right
data to be able to see the business in real-time. So for example, we're now able to see daily sales in China which is a
critical piece in our ability to continue to monitor how things are doing. We have much better inventory visibility in our
distribution networks. We are continuing to train our leaders. For some of them this is the first time these categories
have slowed down on their watch. And so they're learning how to plan a little bit more in a more disciplined way.
They're now doing 12 – 24-month rolling forecasts which allows us to have better visibility out into the future.
We're doing marketing ROI analyses much more frequently. In China for example, we used to look at marketing ROI
once a year. In the United States and in Europe that's a fine idea because it doesn't change. In an explosively growing
market like China it changes quite rapidly. And so our ability to get that feedback quickly and make sure that we're
getting a good return for our marketing investments is really essential to us. We're helping to develop capabilities in
strategic pricing in so many of these emerging markets. Coinage price size architecture is the name of the game
particularly as we go into these traditional trade outlets.
And so we're doing a lot of work to make sure that our leaders have that capability and that our factories have that
ability to make products that can deliver on those price points. And we've done a lot of work in a number of our
markets on what we call perfect store which is just making sure that the point of buying execution is as good as the
marketing programming. And for example, in markets like Russia, we used to have what we call a strike rate which is
how many times you get an order for your visit of about 30%. It's now up close to 80% and we've got much better
compliance to make sure that the right items are in distribution.
So we've taken a number of steps to improve the processes, the capabilities and in a couple of cases we've made some
leadership changes to make sure that we've got the right managers in place. Clearly the leaders that took a business
from $50 million to $500 million may not be the same leaders that take it from $500 million to $5 billion. And so
slowly but surely we're making sure that we have in each of our key growth markets, we have the right leadership to
accomplish that. So net-net we've taken a number of steps and that's why I feel increasingly more comfortable that we
will be able to continue to monitor this and we have the early warning capabilities in place. But I said in China we took
a number of actions to try to address that situation and they just didn't work the way we had hoped.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Well, thank you for all that detail. That's helpful. And just one quick one. In the global
category slowdown that you talked about, from 6.3% to 3.8% year-to-date, just was the primary change in that volume
or price or was it a mix of both?

<A - David A. Brearton>: It's a mix of both, Andrew. And it's fairly broad. It actually goes across all the regions. It's
not just emerging markets. So obviously pricing when it relates to coffee and a number of the other commodities, have
been fairly stable, but the vol/mix portion of it has also been slow.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I just have a question for you, first of all on the China business. You mentioned that,
that was a factor, obviously, in this quarter's reduction in your growth rate and revenue for the Asia-Pacific region. It
looks like it's going to bounce right back, though in Q4. And if I heard you correctly, Dave, you said it was actually
going to be a drag on fourth quarter revenue for the Asia-Pacific region, but in the slides, it indicated it was going to be
up nicely in the fourth quarter. So I just trying to put those two statements together, if I could.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think no. It's not going to bounce back in Q4. In fact, our Asia-Pacific region will
be down low single digits in Q4, mostly driven by China. And it will be biscuits and mostly inventory. So we started
taken inventory out of the system really in September when we saw what was coming through in the market and share
data. That's kind of playing its way through and because there's up to four different levels of distributors to get through
before you get to the consumer in some parts of China, it's going to take us through the end of the year to do that. So it's
a double-digit decline in China this quarter. It's going to be a double-digits decline again in Quarter 4, and that's the
biggest part of the reason why we've called our Quarter 4 down.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just a question for you, as you look ahead and you have a little more
modest revenue growth rate even for 2014, is it just the persistence of slower category growth that you expect? I think
you still expect to gain share. Is it just that basis for the softer revenue growth in 2014 that you expect?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think what we have done, as we've said, given that the global categories are
growing slightly under 4% today, we felt it was prudent to give you an eye to how we're kind of thinking about going
forward next year. And the guidance we've given of 4% to 5% is assuming we'll continue to drive per share growth
similar to what we've done this year. We will drive per share growth everywhere. That will be one of two things, it will
either drive upside versus the guidance we've given or if we have a disruption somewhere or an unexpected event in a
place like Egypt or Venezuela, it will help drive an offset. So I think by giving you guidance, that's more or less in line
with the category growth as we see it today. I think it gives us room to hopefully have upside, but at worst, at least be
able to offset the unexpected.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And do you have a recommended tax rate then for the year now where you'd
expect the tax rate to come in?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think it's obviously very low year-to-date, about 5%. I think it's in line pretty much
with what we said last time, about 10% to 13%, maybe a little bit lower, but the 10% to 13% range. Quarter 4, I would
expect our tax rate to be in line with what we said it'll be over the next three to five years, kind of 20% plus or minus a
couple of points.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think we're not expecting any big discrete events in Quarter 4.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That sounds great. Thank you.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Good evening, everyone.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Good evening.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just thinking about a big picture question, do you think Mondelez should operate in all 80
countries or is there some non-core regions that might be worthwhile to retrench from and reallocate your time and
capital to other more core regions?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No. I think we've done a pretty good job, Ken, of focusing on the countries that matter
most, and it starts with the BRIC countries. I mean, that's the biggest piece today of the 40% of revenue that comes
from the emerging markets. We have begun to invest in what we've talked about is our next-wave markets, which are
primarily the Middle East and Africa. But beyond that, we're not planting flags in lots of different countries. I made the
point simply to give you a sense that there's always going to be something happening. It is our job, however, to manage
that reality and to ensure that we can deliver the guidance we're giving to you.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: My second question, you talk a lot about the North American, European margin
opportunities. Can you talk about the opportunities to restore Latin American margins to mid-teen levels? I know this
year, your sales growth has been good. Your margins have come in. What opportunities do you have to actually
re-establish the Latin American margins back to more historical levels?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think, historical levels, they were relatively high last year because we had a number
of one-time items last year. We had insurance proceeds. We had some asset sales. So the Latin American margins last
year were actually unusually high. Having said that, I would say that year-to-date, they haven't been the greatest
because, as I talked on the call, on the gross margin line, our gross margins are down. Part of that is it's fairly common
across the emerging markets, but as currencies have devalued, the cost of imported raw and packaging materials into
those countries goes up, and in a lot of these markets it's very difficult to hedge that. So it hits the P&L almost
immediately, and there's a lag between that and when the pricing goes. So I think you'll see the pricing come through,
you'll see the gross margins improve, not specifically in Latin America, I think it will be across all the emerging
markets as we go forward into next year.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. And what interest expense should we use for the year? And that's my last question,
thank you.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I think the – we have a coupon rate of about 6% right now, but the interest expense on the
P&L was down around 5.3% in the quarter, which is probably as good a rate as any right now. And the reason for the
gap between the coupon and the 5.3% is because as we've been paying off debt, we've put more of our debt into
commercial paper and short-term, and obviously those cost less. So it's about 5.3% in the quarter, that's probably a
reasonable number for the year.

<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: ...and that seems to be a big hurdle, right?
<A - David A. Brearton>: It's probably going to be a big hurdle. We haven't given guidance for 2014. What we have
said in the past is that this year is unusually low, so the next three to five years after this, we would expect our tax rate
to be 20% plus or minus a couple of points. And eventually over the very long term, it'll probably go up to 25% range.
But I think for the next three to five years it's going to be 20%, plus or minus a couple of points. We haven't given
anything specific for 2014 though.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then a second question. A lot of companies have been talking about India actually
slowing down, and yet you've posted very good results there. Does some of your lower revenue guidance outlook
assume that India slows, just kind of aside from the China issue?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, actually we have high hopes for India. In fact, the challenge – our challenge is that our
growth in India has been constrained, as you know, because we were out of chocolate capacity. We're now putting that
capacity on stream, and we should continue to see growth in line with the category, which has been growing in the
high-double digit rate. So our outlook on India is, it remains quite bullish and I think we have the programs in place.
We've made some significant investments in route-to-market as well as in capacity, we're just starting up a greenfield,
and we're just – we just broke ground on the greenfield. And so anyway, our outlook is quite bullish.
<A - David A. Brearton>: The market [indiscernible] (47:18) there and chocolate are still up well over 20%. So that
chocolate is growing well. There are some other categories that for us is – are not nearly as important in India that are
slowing down, but chocolate continues to be really robust.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then Irene, if I could ask you just a last, like a more philosophical longer-term
question, the emerging market investments, I think on the slides that you gave over the summer although I don't have
them in front of me because I'm on the road, but in 2014 you were going to lower those EM investments to 10 basis
points from this year, which were 50 basis points to 70 basis points. But it seems like, in the kind of the race for market
share out there, and when you look at some of the very successful companies that have – whether private or public like
a Wrigley or a Coke or other names, when EM markets have slowed down, that's kind of when those companies have
put their pedal to the metal.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: And that's when they've really pushed. And so why wouldn't you, even though you've got
pressure from all kinds of sources these days, why wouldn't you take the opportunity of the slower EM to actually
really invest heavily and try to gain share, and so if the categories do come back, you're that much – you have that
much more land underneath your feet?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, no, we agree absolutely with your premise, Eric. As you know, we accelerated some
of our investments in emerging markets this year. And we feel very good about the return that we've gotten, particularly
in markets like Brazil and in Russia and India. So we will continue to do that. But because we had accelerated those
investments, what we said was, we didn't see the need to invest again next year incrementally. And so for that reason,
that's the 10 bps that you remember that – so we just said, we made the investments this year and in fact that's playing
through in our margins and you'll see that we don't need to invest incrementally we don't believe next year while we
play through and ensure that we get a good return on the sales capability and route to market investments that we made
this year.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: But we believe very strongly as you do that the opportunity to invest prudently in these
markets is the time is now and we will continue to do that.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. When I visited your team out in China, again, I guess I would echo what
Andrew Lazar said is that the message again there was that yes the category had slowed for biscuits but Mondelez
expected to outgrow its category. Maybe at that point you just had to keep with the corporate line but it does raise the
question about these early warning systems and how much your management team was communicating internally. So
that's more of a statement. But I was impressed by what I saw from the infrastructure in China and I thought that you
were thinking of launching chocolate in China because you had a very good hot zone distribution capability building up
with gum and it seemed to be setting the stage. Does your experience this year slow that down in terms of the timing of
when you might launch chocolate?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, as you might imagine, Rob, we're not going – we're not talking about any things that
we haven't launched before we launch them. So clearly there are many wide space opportunities and we will pick them
one at a time as we feel that the organization is ready to handle them. And at this moment I feel that the act of making
sure that we get the biscuit momentum back together to continue to fuel the momentum on gum which we just launched
a year ago should be and is the main focus of our China team. And that's what they're doing but there will be continued
wide space launches over time and as we do them we'll tell you what we've done.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Can I ask a follow up on gum in China? I imagine it was negative in the quarter. When do
you expect gum to turn positive in China, Irene?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Oh, gum in China has been a phenomenal success. It's actually almost about a $100 million
business in about a year. So we're feeling quite comfortable with the progress on gum in China. All that hot zone
activity that you saw is a key driver of that success. The gum category in China is growing mid-double digit rates and
in fact it's one of the reasons we launched there. And so we feel quite good about the performance there and frankly
gum in all of our emerging markets continues to grow for the most part. The issue as you know has been in our
developed markets and the good news is we're starting to see some good traction on share improvement as we've put
our playbook in place.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: So despite the tough comp to Stride's year ago launch in third quarter you were still up
versus that tough comp a year ago?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: That's correct. Yeah.

<A - David A. Brearton>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: So in developed markets, you've talked about supply chain cost reduction opportunities
on both the manufacturing side and also in terms of removing some of the SKU complexity from the business. And I
understand what the hurdles are – the uncertainty around timing in addressing some of the less efficient manufacturing
capacity. But if you wanted to more aggressively go after margin improvement in North America and in Europe, is
there an opportunity to accelerate the portfolio simplification aspect of the plan?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, it's – I'd say the plan we've laid out so far is 500 basis points of margin improvement
in North America and as you've talked about the supply chain is a key part of that. And we've started construction of
the plant in Mexico. That's a key part of it. I think simplifying the portfolio is a key part of that. We've already

accelerated by about a year the speed at which we'll get the 500 basis points. We'd originally said it would take us to
2017. We've now brought it back to 2016. The 500 basis points though is programs we have in our sights. We have
milestones and action plans and accountabilities against that. We know how to do it.
If there's ways to excel beyond that we're continuing to look at those and obviously we'd pursue those. But so what
we've given as our 500 margin point objective is what we know we can achieve. And it is based on some of the stuff we
talked to you earlier. We're clearly happy to accelerate. If -we've already done it once, if we could do it again we
would. If we could go further we would. And we'll continue to look for those kind of opportunities.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And, Irene, I just wanted to get your thoughts on category growth
dynamics for Biscuits within the U.S.? Obviously Mondelez has continued to do extremely well, but I think we're
starting to see the categories themselves slow a bit along with the rest of the center of the store. Do you see sort of low
single digit growth in those categories as the new normal for a while? Or have you observed anything in terms of the
phasing of innovation or merchandising across the competitive set that you think is weighing on the category growth?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, that category growth actually has been quite solid relative to many other categories in
North America and in the U.S., and I've been very pleased with the share performance that our team has delivered. And
we see continued opportunity as we leverage the strength of our brands and we leverage the strong DSD selling
organization that we have. We see continued opportunity to pick up share. So that's been a business that's grown. Our
Biscuit business in the U.S. has grown over 5% for almost nine – I think it was the ninth quarter that it has grown over
5%, and we feel quite good about the outlook there. So the category has been kind of, as you rightly say, in the
mid-single-digit range, but we've been able to grow in excess of that as a result of our strong brands and our strong
programming and our strong execution.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thank you again.

Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good evening, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Can I ask another question on the margin trajectory? Not just in North America, but
you've obviously got some quite big goals in place for margin expansion over the next few years. As you think of the
levers that are really going to get you from here to there, could you tell us a bit more about what the biggest ones are?
Is it mostly cost saving? Are you looking at cost of goods sold or input costs moderating a bit from here? Is there
positive mix from innovation worked in? Could you just give us some flavor of which are going to be the drivers that
will really help you out there? Thank you.
<A - David A. Brearton>: I guess I'll start with on the commodity and forex side, we're really only looking to price to
recover commodity and forex. We won't be looking to increase margins as part of our strategy to get there. If there's
opportunities, clearly we'll take those but our assumption is we price to recover commodity and forex. So that's kind of
a wash. It's really driven by a combination of mix as you say. Things like convenient coffee have higher margins. The
Power Brands have higher margins. So we'll continue to drive that, and we can control that. It is overheads. Overheads
have been the biggest source of our margin improvement over the last three years. We've driven about a three point
margin improvement between 2009, 2012. That was entirely driven by overheads, and I think overheads, just by virtue
of how quickly you can undo those versus supply chain programs, will continue to be a key driver of our margin
progress through 2014 and into 2015.
And then the third piece is the supply chain savings, and that's the program Daniel Myers talked about at the
Back-To-School Conference. And we have a pretty comprehensive plan on what is our long term vision, and how do
we stage ourselves towards that in both Europe and North America. That's a key part to getting there as well. So to

remind you the biggest gap between our margins and our peers' margins is in gross margin. It isn't actually in
overheads. Overheads is always an opportunity. We'll continue to drive overheads. And particularly given our size, if
we think there's more opportunity there, we'll go after that. But the gap versus our peers is really in gross margin, and
that's what Daniel talked about in September. So it's everything you mentioned, frankly, with the exception of pricing.

sometimes either makes it harder to turn a problem around or perhaps adds some execution challenges at times, but I
guess the reason for the split up was to minimize some of that complexity. So if it's still a bit of a problem, at what
point does it perhaps indicate you're considering making things even simpler? And I'm thinking specifically whether
you might more strongly consider divesting your coffee and grocery businesses now which frankly are holding back
your top line anyway at this point.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Look, I'm not going to comment on portfolio actions. I want to clarify my comment about
the fact that we are in 80 countries. It was simply to make a point that there's always things, there's different things
going on. As I said though, it's our job to manage that and particularly as emerging markets become and are a bigger
part of our portfolio, they are volatile. They don't always deliver their results in a straight line.
Egypt went from growing 29% in the second quarter to minus 3% in the third quarter. And so we just need to have a
robust enough target to make sure that we can accommodate that and again that's why we gave you our perspective as
we look forward. Because our categories continue to grow in excess of other food categories, but they are growing at a
slower rate. So this is not about complexity. It is about the fact that it is a robust set of countries and categories as a
result of the split, as you point out, it's quite focused and we feel quite comfortable that we have the tools in place to be
able to manage that complexity. But it is a different set of countries that are driving our performance today then used to
be driving our performance as Kraft Foods and we need to accommodate that and that's what I've talked about.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: And then quickly, in Coffee, why does your EBITDA not benefit from lower costs? I mean,
Smucker's does for example? Maybe the answer is that Europe is different than the U.S.? But I thought you might pass
back to your customers less than 100% of your deflation?
<A - David A. Brearton>: No, I think it's – yes it is different in the U.S. and there is a different dynamic there. In most
of Europe, there are many competitors in every country, all of which work to keep the market fairly disciplined. We
don't tend to lose margin on the way up. We don't tend to gain margin on the way down. It does tend to be a
pass-through both directions. And our customers keep us honest and our competitors keep us honest and that's just the
dynamic in Europe. I'll admit when I started in Europe 20 years ago, it was different. It was actually very much like the
U.S. market, but it's a fairly competitive marketplace. So it doesn't – it's not – you don't get windfall profits up or down.
You tend to pass it through and manage the margin at a fairly constant dollar level.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Got it. Thank you.

<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great. Thank you. Good evening.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, David.
<A - David A. Brearton>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Two little tiny ones and then unfortunately a China question. The two little tiny ones,
inflation in the quarter? What was – it just gross inflation in the quarter and what do you expect it to be for the year?
And then the same thing for productivity? I think you said productivity in the quarter was 3.5 points (sic) [3.5%]?
What's productivity on the year?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, I think on the productivity, we said it was about 3% net. It was actually about double
that on a gross level. So it's certainly the highest we've done. We have said that on the year we would actually expect
the average for the year to be in the 2.3%, 2.5% range is kind of what we said in September because the first half was
only about 1.5%. So that's productivity. Inflation, it varies dramatically from the 40%, 50% in places like Venezuela to
virtually none in Europe. I guess on average it's probably in the 3% to 5% range, but I'll be honest, I don't add that up
on a very frequent basis.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. Because of the strange mix of commodities, coffee in Europe and then the inflation
pressures in South America?
<A - David A. Brearton>: Yeah, and currency has a huge impact.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: All right. I appreciate the complexity there. On China, GDP growth in the second quarter and
the third quarter have been relatively consistent for the country and I think 7.5% and 7.8%? Gum is growing terrific,
mid double digits I think is what you said, Irene? Yet none of these facts seem to help understand kind of why the
China biscuit category slowed to just 2%? So maybe if I just try to get at this a little bit more, what is your team
saying? What is the consumer insight as to why? Is there a Chinese gifting issue? Sometimes we hear about the quirks
on gifting? And then maybe bigger picture, really trying to pull the insight as to why it slowed down? I've got to
believe that, that's what is driving your comments expecting that the China business, the Biscuit operations, will
continue to be slow into 2014? But I'd really just like to understand a little bit more as to the consumer insight?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, well, the GDP facts are correct and that's why we really did expect it that we could
see a recovery. It is a reality though that we have seen the key gifting occasions underperform relative to the year ago
comps. So we saw a slow Chinese New Year. We saw a slow Autumn Festival and so there's no question that some of
the government policies are impacting gifting in particular and biscuits is a big gifting item as you said. So there's no
question that there is some impact that these government policies is having on our business. And our job here is to
figure out therefore how do we overcome that? And we've taken a number of steps to improve our pricing and sizing.
We're looking at opportunities to make sure that our impacted point of buying is where we need it to be. So there's a
number of actions that we're taking that we believe can help to offset it and will get the momentum back. But in the
short-term the fact is we've got more inventory out there as a result of the fairly precipitous slowdown in our biscuit
category and we just need some time to work that through and that'll probably take us through the end of the year.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: I really appreciate the comments. Thank you.
Dexter Congbalay
