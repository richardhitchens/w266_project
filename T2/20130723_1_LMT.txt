Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, I want to offer
my appreciation and congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their continuing outstanding performance and the
achievement of strong second quarter financial and operational results. As we continue to operate in a dynamic and
challenging environment, their efforts and focus have our corporation poised for continued success in delivering value
to shareholders and solutions to customers.
While Bruce will cover the financials in more detail later, I'll highlight some key financial achievements in the quarter
that included growing earnings per share to $2.64, 11% above last year's second quarter level; expanding segment
operating margin to a record level of 13.4%, and achieving an increase of 110 basis points above last year's level; and
generating over $600 million in cash from operations after making $750 million in pension contributions.
Our continued strong cash flow is foundational to our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders
through share repurchases and dividend payments. In the second quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares of our
stock, more than double the 2.2 million shares we repurchased in the second quarter last year.
We deployed $465 million for share repurchases this quarter and paid slightly over $370 million in dividends. Through
the first half of 2013, we returned over $1.6 billion, or approximately 70%, of our free cash flow to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases.
Overall, I would characterize the second quarter financial performance as broad-based across all business areas, with
results exceeding our expectations. This strong performance enabled us to increase our 2013 financial guidance for
operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. Bruce will cover some of the specific drivers for the
improved performance in his briefing.
Before discussing other achievements this quarter, I'd like to outline the status of DoD budgets. Since we last spoke in
April, not much has changed in the budget environment. FY 2013 DoD budget appropriations have been enacted, and
incorporate the $37 billion in budget reductions required under sequestration. While some budget reduction actions are
being implemented by the government, they have yet to implement most of the required spending cuts.
To date, we have seen minimal impact to our portfolio of programs, with actions taken primarily limited to our
shorter-cycle business. Customers are continuing to determine how they will implement the cuts mandated by
sequestration, which they are required to do before the end of the fiscal year on September 30, and we are working
closely with them as they explore a host of potential scenarios.
For FY 2014, congressional deliberations on the budget are continuing. The President's proposed baseline defense
budget remains at $526 billion without inclusion of the $52 billion in sequestration budget reductions that went into
effect in March 2013. The Department of Defense has finalized a strategic management review that reexamines policy
and program priorities to account for the sequestration-imposed cuts. This review will be used to aid DoD in continuing
to formulate decisions on post-sequestration program budgets for 2013 and 2014.
While future budget levels remain uncertain, the strategic need and support of a number of our key programs, such as
the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, Littoral Combat Ship, and C-130J, remains intact. We will
continue to work with customers and respond to changes as required when budget positions are finalized by the
government.
Turning to the operational performance, our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional focus on skill in
providing critical products and services to customers. Of the numerous accomplishments in the quarter, I'd like to
highlight our continued success in missile defense activities, provide status of our expanding international work, and
finish with an update on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.
First, with the growing threat of ballistic missile proliferation, the need for proven, reliable interceptor systems is
becoming more acute daily.

Providing defensive systems designed to prevent the catastrophic damage that can be inflicted on civilian population
centers and national infrastructure by offensive missiles is essential to our nation and allies. Our portfolio of interceptor
systems, consisting of Aegis, Patriot, THAAD, and MEADS, will provide layered coverage intended to defeat missile
threats posed by rogue nations.
This quarter, our Patriot-3 missile conducted a ripple-fire test that successfully intercepted and destroyed two different
targets at White Sands Missile Range. This test was the first time a multi-target engagement was performed against
both a ballistic missile target and a cruise missile target, and its success provided a clear demonstration of the design
maturity and increasing capability of the PAC-3 configuration.
In addition to the Patriot test events, our second-generation Aegis Ballistic Missile System successfully launched and
guided a missile to engage and destroy a separating short-range ballistic missile target. This test validated the ability of
the Aegis system to engage increasingly more challenging and enemy threats. It also marked an important milestone for
the phased adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe. This approach will combine a land-based Aegis Ashore site
in Romania with a traditional Aegis system aboard navy ships to provide unique missile defense protection on the
continent.
These multiple successful launch events demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and technological advances we are
incorporating into our missile defense products. These advances will ensure we can provide defensive systems to
customers that can respond to an ever-evolving threat. With customers depending on these systems in their times of
need, it is an honor and responsibility to provide affordable and proven systems for our nation and allies.
The next area I want to highlight is the continued expansion of our international business portfolio. This quarter, we
secured new awards and made deliveries to new customers as we extended our international presence. New orders were
received across multiple business areas and consisted of Aeronautics' receipt of an award for 18 additional F-16 aircraft
for Iraq. This award now extends the F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, well into 2017.
Mission Systems and Training secured new work for Japan to upgrade Aegis multi-mission signal processors and other
equipment on their ballistic missile defense ships. Missiles and Fire Control received multiple international awards,
including an order from Saudi Arabia to provide LONGBOW Fire Control Radars for attack helicopters, an order from
Finland to provide integration support of our JASSM missile into Finnish fighter aircraft, and an award to provide
Patriot Missile Defense equipment to Kuwait.
International deliveries in the quarter consisted of delivery of the first C-130J Super Hercules aircraft to both the
Republic of Tunisia and to Israel. The delivery to Tunisia marks the first to an African country and entry into a new
customer set. Tunisia becomes the 15th country to select the proven, low-risk, and affordable C-130J for its air fleet
requirements.
Expansion of international sales remains a key component of our corporate strategy, and we are on a path to grow
international content from approximately 17% of total sales last year to at least 20% in the next few years.
Finally, turning to the F-35 program, multiple key accomplishments were achieved in the quarter, and you can feel the
momentum accelerating throughout the program. Last month, I attended the F-35 CEO roundtable in Fort Worth
chaired by Frank Kendall, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Logistics, and a program status briefing
by Lieutenant General Bogdan, the F-35 Program Executive Officer.
Attendees included representatives from all nine partner nations and our teammates on the F-35 industry team. The
meeting reaffirmed just how much progress the F-35 team has made. The customer expressed a renewed confidence in
the future of the program, and there's a strong sense of partnership across the whole team. We know a lot of work still
must be done, and at the same time it's clear that the tremendous efforts of the team are paying off.
One of the key accomplishments this quarter was the declaration by the Department of Defense of initial operating
capability dates for all three F-35 variants: 2015 for the STOVL aircraft, 2016 for the CTOL aircraft, and either late
2018 or early 2019 for the CV aircraft for the U.S. Navy. These dates reflect the confidence the customer has in the
Lightning II and in our team. Our job is to execute on the program to make sure we meet these critical dates for our

customers and deliver the capabilities of this aircraft to our warfighters and allies.
Beyond the establishment of IOC dates, the program achieved a number of key milestones in the second quarter,
including the delivery of the first F-35C carrier variant to the U.S. Navy – this delivery was important, as all three
variants are now at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where they're training pilots and maintenance personnel for this
next-generation fighter; completion of high-angle-of-attack testing by the F-35A, which is a key measure of aircraft
maneuverability; completion of the first vertical takeoff by an F-35B STOVL aircraft; and the successful first in-flight
missile launch by the F-35A variant.
Production activities continued to ramp up, with the delivery of 12 aircraft in the quarter, and we remain solidly on
track to deliver at least 36 aircraft this year. Program tempo is accelerating, and we currently have our 100th aircraft in
final assembly.
In the area of customer relations and contractual events, we were pleased with Australia's reconfirmation of its plan to
procure 100 CTOL Joint Strike Fighters for its national defense. We look forward to providing these revolutionary
aircraft to one of our key strategic partnered countries.
As we continue to work to bring down the costs of the aircraft, we were pleased with the reduction in acquisition and
operating and support costs reflected in the 2012 Selected Acquisition Report issued by the DoD in June. This was the
first year that cost reduction was noted since program inception, and we will work with the F-35 Joint Program Office
to implement further cost savings measures to secure additional decreases in the total program cost. The top priority of
the government and contractor team is to continue to cost effectively build and deliver the F-35's unprecedented
fifth-generation capabilities to the warfighter.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our financial performance, and then we'll open up the line for
questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. My comments will refer to the web charts that we included in our earnings
release today, if you'd like to follow along. Let's start with chart three and an overview of the quarter.
Sales in the quarter were $11.4 billion, 4% below our results from a year ago, but higher than our first quarter results
and, as with the first quarter, were above our expectations. Segment operating margin was a record 13.4%, a
110-basis-point improvement over the second quarter last year. Our earnings per share were also up significantly to
$2.64, an 11% increase over last year's results.
We generated $623 million in cash from operations, well above the outlook I provided in the first quarter. We returned
over $800 million of cash to our shareholders, including the repurchase of 4.5 million shares for $465 million. And as a
result of our performance, we're increasing our outlook for operating profit, EPS, and cash from operations. So we're
very pleased with our results for the first half of the year.
Chart four shows our sales in the second quarter this year versus last year. Aeronautics sales equaled our results last
year, as lower quantities of F-16, F-22, and C-130 aircraft were offset by higher volume on F-35 production contracts
and C-5 deliveries. IS&GS sales were lower due to reduced volume, primarily in our intelligence line of business.
Missiles and Fire Control continued its strong performance, with an 11% increase in sales, coming primarily from Air
and Missile Defense Programs. Mission Systems and Training sales were down 12%, due primarily to the end of
deliveries of the PTDS program last year. And finally, Space Systems was 13% lower than last year, due primarily to
the delivery of two commercial satellites in the second quarter of last year and none this year.
Moving to chart five and our segment operating results, despite our sales being down 4%, operating profit was up 4%,
driven by the significant improvement in operating margin of 13.4%. Again this quarter we had strong program
execution across all of our business areas, as we'll show on the next chart.

Chart six shows our segment operating margins by business area. Three of our five business areas increased operating
margin compared to the second quarter of last year, with MST having the largest increase due to the settlement of
certain contractual matters and better performance in our training and logistics business. Missiles and Fire Control
continued to have excellent results, and the increase this quarter was due to improved performance in Air and Missile
Defense Programs, Tactical Missile Programs, and Fire Control Programs.
Space Systems' margin improved primarily due to the increased equity earnings from United Launch Alliance,
reflecting the mix of launch-related activities in the quarter compared with last year. IS&GS's margin was flat relative
to last year's second quarter results, and Aeronautics' margin was down this quarter due to the absence of a favorable
contractual resolution on the F-22 program which occurred in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the contractual
resolution, Aeronautics' margins were similar to last year.
Moving on to chart seven, our EPS grew 11% over the results from the second quarter of last year to $2.64 per share,
due primarily to improved operational performance; and on a pension-adjusted basis, our EPS was $2.87 per share.
If you'll turn to chart eight, we'll discuss our cash returned to shareholders in the quarter. We returned over $800
million to shareholders in the quarter, with share repurchases in excess of dividends paid. Compared with the second
quarter of last year, we repurchased more than double the amount of shares. With the increase in our stock price in the
quarter, we saw a higher level of options exercised, and according, we repurchased additional stock to mitigate share
count dilution.
On chart nine, we'll look at cash returned to shareholders on a year-to-date basis.
We've had strong year-to-date cash from operations of $2.7 billion and free cash flow of over $2.4 billion. Through the
first half, we've returned almost $1.7 billion, or nearly 70%, of our free cash flow to shareholders. And our share
repurchases of over $900 million exceed the level of dividends paid thus far in the year, and greatly exceed the roughly
$700 million assumed in our full-year guidance at the start of the year.
Moving on to chart 10, we'll discuss our updated view of guidance for the year. As was the case last quarter, we saw
minimal impact to our sales in the second quarter as a result of sequestration actions, and we are maintaining the sales
guidance provided last quarter. On the other hand, we are increasing our outlook for segment operating profit by $225
million to recognize the strong performance through the first half of the year.
As a result of the increase in our segment operating profit, we are also increasing our outlook for earnings per share by
$0.40, to a new level of $9.20 to $9.50 per share. And, also reflecting strong performance thus far, we are increasing
our cash from operations guidance by $200 million, to a new level of greater than or equal to $4.2 billion.
Chart 11 shows our updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We're increasing our outlook in four of
the five business areas. MST's outlook is now $75 million higher, Missiles and Fire Controls is now $70 million higher,
and both Aeronautics and Space are $40 million higher than our guidance last quarter.
And turning to chart 12, I'll summarize by noting that we're very pleased with the results of the first six months of the
year, and they reflect our program execution, the strength of our portfolio and the focus of our workforce during these
dynamic times.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Saheed?

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a quick question on the order outlook; obviously, the book-to-bill was about 0.8 by my
calculation, and it looks like, obviously, you have a plan to have a pretty big step-up there in Q3 and Q4 to hit the
levels you talked about on the previous call. You said you hadn't really still seen any impact from sequester, but I
wondered if you could give us an update on your expectations for orders, and if anything's changed since the last
quarter and how that will shape up for what you're thinking about 2014. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Carter. So I'll start off by saying, actually, we're slightly ahead of where we
thought we would be at this point in the second quarter. I tried to tee that up, I think, either the first quarter or the call at
the end of the year last year. But we're actually tracking about as expected or slightly ahead of plan. There's several
items, and I should probably just kind of run down the list by business area just to give you an idea of what we're
expecting to happen over the next few quarters.
So the second biggest item, obviously, is the closure of the Lot 6 & 7 negotiations for F-35, and when that happens,
Carter, think of the increase in orders as being somewhere in the $4.5 billion to $5 billion amount for just that one
closure of contract negotiations, if you will. And we are expecting that to happen in the third quarter. I think we're
making good progress on that. Marillyn can fill in some of the details for you if you'd like at a later point in the call.
We also have a number of competitive orders we're watching in MST in the third quarter, including Space Fence and
the Air/Missile Defense Radar program, AMDR. We also have an Aegis order for the basic Aegis program.
Collectively, those are about $1 billion, again, that we're expecting in the third quarter.
Missiles and Fire Control has both domestic and FMS orders for the THAAD program that's expected in the third
quarter, so think of this as the annual buy from the Army on the domestic side and one of our international customers
tagging on to that order. And that's, I think I've said, worth about $1.5 billion in the third quarter. IS&GS, as usual is no
one program individually significant, but the third quarter is expected to be higher than either the second or the first.
And then, Carter, as we look forward, I would expect that the fourth quarter, as usual, will be our highest quarter of the
year.
Now, just to summarize all that, I think the third quarter, you should think us probably being back at a level maybe
slightly higher than where we were in the first quarter. And if all comes as I just laid out, including some of those
competitions, we should end the year pretty close back at about the $80 billion level like I've been talking about the
past two quarters.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Bruce or Marillyn, this could go to both of you, but I wanted to just talk about what we
learned in the interim between last call and this call from DoD on sequester. I think about $1 billion was taken from
2013 money for F-35, and it appears to cut, I think, five aircraft from the Air Force and about two from the Navy and
the Marine Corps, with the remainder of the $1 billion being RDT&E. So to what extent, if it all, does this impact LRIP
6 and probably more likely LRIP 7 negotiations, and how should we think about that, those lost seven aircraft from the
29 aircraft originally funded in 2013?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well – thanks for the question, Rob. First, I'd say that our customer really has not come
out with a definitive position on how they're going to take into account sequestration. I know there's been a lot of
speculation. I'm not going to speculate with you on what they'll come out with. We're working closely with them.
They're looking at different scenarios of how they'll – if they'll address it. One thing I will say is that they're very
supportive of the F-35, and we'll just have to see how it comes out.
We've seen – in terms of any impact that we might see on F-35, it will be back-filled probably by an international
opportunity, because, as you can see, that's where we're going to ramp up. In fact, if we look over the next five years,

close to 50% of our orders will come from the international customers. So we've got to just wait until they come
forward with – wait until the Department of Defense comes forward with what their plans are, and then we'll adjust
accordingly.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Rob, I'd just add a little bit to what Marillyn said. I think the negotiations on LRIP 6
and LRIP 7 were clearly targeted to keep the quantities pre-sequestration, so think of the negotiations that we hope to
close fairly quickly here as being the same quantities we had embedded within the fiscal years themselves, not adjusted
for sequestration. And I think Secretary Kendall has been pretty vocal in the press about trying to keep quantities and
trying to prevent the reopening of contracts. And so we're optimistic that that kind of plays out well for that negotiation
that were not impacted to the level that you talked about.
As Marillyn said, we're watching the FY 2014 budget closely, but at least as we've done comparisons, in particular the
President's budget, there seems to be more reductions to non-aircraft elements of the program than aircraft orders,
which we think, from a build rate and bringing the overall cost profile of the program down, is the right move
obviously our perspective.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So, Bruce, if I'm going to understand what you both just said, it's not so much about
quantities; it's more about total dollars, and these dollars don't necessarily come off of unit price but from other areas of
the program.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I think you said it just right, Rob. In fact, as I've said, we had a media event this
morning, and I think I said in my prepared remarks that we've seen less impact from sequestration, writ large, than we
expected to through this part of the year. And I'll say, frankly, from our perspective – I can't speak, obviously, for all
the industry, but I think the Pentagon Secretary – or all the way up and down the Pentagon have been very prudent in
the way that they've managed the sequestration impacts. And I think they've done a very nice job doing that from an
industries perspective.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citigroup.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Bruce, this question is for you. In the slide deck, you've got a line in there on chart nine that
says you're on track to exceed full-year cash return commitments. You've done that on the repurchases, the $926
million versus the $700 million, but keeping in mind that the goal here was to keep the share count roughly trying to
offset dilution. So can you just provide a little bit more update on what exactly you mean by on track to exceed
full-year expectations? Is that around the share count itself, or is that a comment more around the $900 million versus
the $700 million?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, probably neither, actually, Jason; it's more of a – our longstanding goal is to give 50%
or more of free cash flow. I'll say we pretty much get there, obviously, with just the dividend. So, in truth, I was saying,
do the $700 million plus the dividends for the year, so we've exceeded that already on a year-to-date basis. And I think
probably embedded in your question is, so what does the outlook look like for the rest of the year and how does that
expect to play out. I've got to believe, with the stock sitting where it is today and the level of options that have been
exercised to date, that those will continue if the stock stays where it is today – it's actually up a couple of dollars, at
least the last I looked at it today – we should probably continue that trend.
And just to give you some perspective there, we had 4 million options exercised in the second quarter of 2013,
compared to just over 1 million in the second quarter of 2012. So, if that trend continues, that'll be obviously the
motivation for us to continue the share repurchases at the level we've had in the past, but that'll be dependent upon us

Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Bruce, maybe a follow-on from Jason's question, if you are obliged to carry on buying back stock
at this sort of rate, does this jeopardize or impact on your flexibility to increase the dividend going forward?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Well, I guess you can't do that to infinity without impacting the ability to pay dividends back,
Rob. But, honestly, I don't think, if you look at our track record in terms of what we've done with dividend increases –
and I think that's probably always the best indicator what we'll do in the future. The one thing that's kind of interesting
about where we sit from the amount of options that are still outstanding and have yet to be exercised, I want to say
there's about 15 million shares of options that are outstanding; about 12.5 million or so are vested, and the other
remainder are unvested. But we've kind of weeded out, if you will, sort of the low-dollar option amounts, so the options
that are being exercised today come with option prices at the $80-plus-per-share for the most part.
So think of the incremental difference between buying back the shares to offset the dilution, and the price of the options
that are being exercised, as maybe less than they would have been years ago when we had some options at the $35, $45
level. So that's helping to mitigate what you might think of in terms of the overall level of cash required to continue the
share repurchases. And so, therefore, I think we've got the flexibility to do that. We're still looking at – with the
guidance we provided this year, $4.2 billion, our overall capital somewhere in the $1 billion, maybe a little less, so free
cash flow of $3.2 billion, we started out. I think we've got, what, $2.8 billion on the balance sheet as we ended the
quarter. So I still think we've got the firepower to continue to do that going forward, in part because of the reasons I just
said with the benefits coming from those options when they are exercised.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Noah.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: If I move to the low end of the revenue guidance range which you've indicated would happen
under sequestration for 2013, the back half of the year would experience something like an 8% organic revenue decline.
In that, what is your assumption for the growth rate of U.S. DoD versus U.S. non-DoD versus international? And then
to the extent you're willing or able, can you talk about how much different we should assume those would be in 2014, if
at all?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Help me with the last part of your question, Noah, if you would. Tell me more about what
you're looking for the comparison of 2014 to 2013, what was that?
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Yeah, basically, what I'm saying is, is there any reason why we should not take those growth
rates you've assumed in the back half of 2013 and carry them forward into 2014 in the scenario where sequestration is
sticking?

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So I think the first part of your question was, if you kind of squeeze for the back half of
the year, looks like we're down – I think you said 8%. I think that's about right. No, I don't have that off the top of my
head. I will say that as we – as I said to answer a previous question, as we look at the overall year and where we sit
through the first half of the year, our sales were ahead of expectations in the first quarter. Our sales were ahead of
expectations in the second quarter, albeit not as much as they were in the first quarter.
So we're tracking better than expected through the first half. The $825 million that we kind of came up with that would
point towards the low end of the guidance was sort of – as we've used in the past, sort of a parametric or a
mathematically derived number that, frankly, we haven't seen materialize as quickly or as much as we thought when we
did that calculation. So I'm hopeful that we actually are closer towards the – maybe a little bit higher than the low end
of the guidance as we sit here. As I said earlier, we've got one quarter to kind of squeeze out the fiscal year 2013
impacts of sequestration. It seems like a lot has to happen that quarter for that sort of mathematical modeling to come
into fruition.
As far as the build rate going into 2014, I think we're very similar to the situation that we were going into fiscal year
2013, in that we haven't seen truly the impacts in 2013 that we'd expected, in large part because, again, I think the DoD
and the Pentagon has done a fairly masterful job kind of deflecting some of that. It's come at the expense of operations
and maintenance and some readiness issues, which are not good by any means, but in terms of the industry's
perspective, it's been helpful.
And so we're kind of going to go into 2014 similar to the way we went into 2013, and there, I think we're going to have
a similar story, as I said at the start of the year, where our long-cycle businesses will not see much impact even if the
2014 budget is hit by sequestration, and our short-cycle businesses will have that impact. I've got to believe the ability
to continue to defer and push the sequestration impacts on O&M readiness and the like will be mitigated by 2014. So I
think 2014 versus 2013 will be similar to what we expected to happen as we entered the year 2013, if that makes sense.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rich.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: This question is either for Marillyn or Bruce. Marillyn, on your comments regarding the –
on the second tranche of the F-16s and extending the backlog out to 2017 now, I want to know if you could comment
on other opportunities for the F-16, and maybe also, if you could, make a comment here about what you're thinking
about in terms of production rates. And as long as we're on, maybe, legacy programs here, maybe you could also
comment on opportunities and outlook for the 130J in production rates.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, on opportunities for F-16, as I did say, with the Iraq
sale, that gets us out into 2017, but we also have opportunities for the UAE potentially or other Middle East countries.
We have opportunities in South America. So our production rate today is about 13 aircraft per year, and it should
continue on out through at least the 2017 timeframe. And then as we see additional orders come online, we would
continue to stay on whatever rate that would lend itself to. We also have F-16 upgrade work that we're doing today,
which is good work for us, as we – with the Taiwan upgrade of F-16s.
On the C-130J, our plan this year is to deliver 24 aircraft, and we'll continue on that rate. We have a lot of international
demand for the C-130J. And we're hopeful on moving through the multiyear opportunity with the U.S. government,
which would be up to 83 aircraft through that, opportunities in Saudi Arabia, opportunities in India; so the C-130J also
has good opportunities.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, very nice margins. I have, actually, just two quick ones. One is, Bruce, you talked
earlier about the backlog and what you expect to happen by the end of the year, about $80 billion. Is funded backlog –
does that look – at a similar profile? In other words, you were at $55 billion, I think, at the end of last year. Do you
expect that to be roughly the same? And then the second question is just on the F-35 SDD. You took another reduction
– profit rate reduction in the quarter. Could you just give some color on how you think that tees you up going forward
on that contract, what has to happen to make that the last write-down? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Joe. I'll try to take both those on. So the backlog, as you said, and we're looking
for a total backlog of $80 billion or so by the end of the year, and I think we are at around $55 billion or so of funded
backlog. I would think that relationship will hold pretty steady, would be my guess. Maybe a little bit higher, as I think
about it, because I would think we'd get full funding for a good portion of that Lot 6 & 7 negotiations, so that – on a
percentage basis, it might actually be a little higher than it sits today. And as far as the SDD, you're right; we did take a
de-book this year, essentially similar to the one we took a year ago at this timeframe.
The way I would describe that, Joe, is, in the quarter, we finalized an agreement with the government, which we'd been
working for quite some time for the plan for earning the remaining fee on SDD. And you should think of that as being
both for the remaining developmental milestones on the contract as well as sort of an overall measure of performance
that's an incentive-based measurement that'll take place at the end of the contract.
And I'll just say that both criteria – the developmental milestones, they're linked to specific dates and accomplishments
through the remainder of the SDD period. And even more so, I'll say the sort of overall performance measures at the
end of the contract – which you should think of as being tied to both schedule performance and cost performance
between now and the end of the contract – both of those I would characterize as very tough criteria for us.
So this is our best estimate of how we're going to perform against that criteria. I'd like to say that this is – well, I'll just
leave it at that, that I think this is our best estimate of how we've performed against that criteria, and it is a little tough,
maybe, than what we were thinking it was when we set the numbers a year ago this time.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Loomis from Stifel.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Thank you. Just staying on F-35s, so you talked about the productions, the quantities are still
undecided. But just from a revenue standpoint and the work you're doing, is it still running about 15%? Do you expect
that to continue? And then just as another question on IS&GS, with the backlog showing sequential decline, and you
had two big wins last year with GSM and Polar, and we're still declining; when do you think we might see some
stability in IS&GS? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Hey, Bill, I'll answer those. So we are at about 15% of total revenue for the F-35
program. I think that number continues to increase over the next few years. So I think we were somewhere in the
13%-ish or so range – I've lost track where we were last year. So we had about a 2% increase, if memory serves me
right. And the percentage of total F-35 compared to our total sales, that number, again, I think increases going forward.
And how much, I'll say maybe not as much as the 2013 to 2015, but still increasing between 2013 and 2014. IS&GS the
sequential decline, again, kind of as expected.
And the reversal, I think, that you talked about, Bill, this is still a business that's very much backlog similar to the sales
level. For us to get there, we would expect to have a greater fourth quarter, which is the historical trend for IS&GS.
And what I would expect to have happen is that we'll see, from an orders perspective, higher orders in both the third
quarter than we saw in the first two, and the fourth quarter will be higher still than the third quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Good morning, Marillyn and Bruce.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Bruce – or maybe this question for you, or maybe Marillyn can take it – just in general head
count levels, you guys have been out in front on reducing your overall cost base quite a bit over the last couple years,
and according to my calculations, it looks like head count has come down by about 8% during that period. Are you still
seeing a lot of opportunities for that, whether it's early retirement programs or productivity or just, in general, mandated
by the overall budgets? Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: We have taken the head count down from about 146,000 employees about two to three
years ago to 116,000 now. So you're right; head count has been coming down. We've taken some direct activities when
we took out a number of management back when we did our voluntary separation program at that time. We then
continued to adjust our business to what's happening in our business base, so that's what a lot of what you're seeing is
just the budget environment and adjusting to contractual delays or reductions that come with that. So those are the types
of actions we'll take. And what we don't know is what sequestration will bring. Certainly, if we have a significant
impact on our programs from sequestration, we'll see additional reductions to that.
So we just basically size our business to the environment that we're operating in. And we're also coming out of
footprint. We've done a lot, as you've probably seen, to reduce our capacity, both shutting down facilities as well as
moving out of leased space into our own space, and that's something that we've done for the past several years. It's just
an approach we take to managing our business to make sure that we get our infrastructure and our labor force aligned
with the business space that we have.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Quick one, and then one on pension. The quick one was the EACs – or revisions non-related
to revenue for the year, it looks like you'll come in roughly flat year-on-year. Is that currently what's built in to the
guidance? And then one on pension, Bruce, if you can kind of give us a little color; obviously, the rates are moving
higher here is going to help you pretty significantly if they stick around. I think, on a sensitivity basis, I have it as a
potentially $300 million, $400 million help for you for next year versus what you previously told us. As well, can you
comment on if that's changing your attitude towards cash contributions, the remaining $750 million you still have as
discretionary for the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Myles. So EAC revisions, I think, as usual, Myles, your math is right. We're kind of
spot on, maybe slightly different, little bit down from the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year in
terms of our overall EAC revisions. Looking forward for the rest of this year, the second half, at least in the plan, we
kind of expect that the level will be similar to a little bit higher than where we were last year. And that could obviously
change as risk retirements happen quicker than we'd planned them, obviously. But as we sit here today, overall, we
would expect to still be – I think last year we were about 34% overall, our EAC revisions versus our total earnings.
We're going to be right in that ballpark, maybe a little higher; 35%-ish, 36% is kind of what I would expect to see.
So, on pension, you asked about the discount rates or the interest rate changes and so forth, and I'll just – I'll give you a
little bit of perspective. Obviously, we won't set this until the end of the year. But, clearly, there have been changes to
rates through the first half of the year that warrant some discussion. So interest rates so far are up probably about 75
basis points. And our asset returns are also slightly positive as we sit here this year. But as you know, our pension

adjustments that we're talking about are much more sensitive to changes in the interest rates than changes in our asset
returns.
So, you did some calculations. Just to remind everyone else on the call, I think the sensitivity that we provided in
previous 10-Q and 10-K filings are still appropriate. So, for discount rates, every 25 basis points' change is worth about
a $145 million change in our FAS expense, whereas for asset returns, it takes a full 100 basis points' change to be about
an $18 million change in our FAS expense. So, overall, if we were to set the mark today, we would expect to have a
positive adjustment to FAS/CAS – again, if those results held. I'll remind you that, between now and the end of the
year, we typically do actuarial studies that look at the current population of employees to see what has changed, and
that population, as we do reductions in force, some of the dynamics of that actuarial study do actually change in terms
of the composition of the workforce upon which that liability is built upon.
One of the bigger changes that – and it may not happen between now and the end of the year, but we're watching it
closely, is we are expecting a new standard mortality rate to come out which, I guess from the good news perspective,
says all of us are going to live longer.
From the bad news perspective, it says your liabilities are likely going to be increasing for pension because people are
living longer. So that'll have a bit of a mitigating effect on what we just described there in the numbers that you said.
But, again, we'll set that up. We'll try to give you the same sort of preview, if you will, in the third quarter call that we
do typically every single year, and that's when I'll give you probably a little more detail into that.
As far as cash contributions, we've actually already made in the third quarter the second tranche of the $750 million, for
a total of $1.5 billion pension contribution, so that is done for the year. And we'll – as usual, we always evaluate
whether or not the need arises to do any more towards the end of the year when we sort of see our cash from operations
pulling out on a full-year basis. We will try to give you some insight into that, Myles, again when we talk again in the
third quarter.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I think this is kind of a two-part question, half for Bruce and half for
Marillyn. If we look at the outlook for you, Bruce, and we kind of split the revenue forecast and look at what you've
done for segment profit increase, it would appear as if margins are going to be down almost a couple hundred basis
points in the second half versus the first half. It looks like most of the increase in the outlook was attributable to the
pickup, so maybe, Marillyn, you might be able to address some of the productivity initiatives underway that have
enabled you, first, to do as well as you have in the first half, and then maybe also address why it wouldn't stay at the
same rate, other than that one large contract adjustment.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Howard, let me try to address, you asked a pretty specific question there on segment
operating margins in the second half and what's expected to happen. So we did have a couple of things happen in the
first half of the year, including, as you saw, within our MST business, a couple of contractual resolutions that were of
good size. Obviously, if you look at the margins for that business in particular, that's a record level of margin, and it
was obviously – or maybe not obviously, but it was driven by those contractual resolutions. Those are not expected to
replicate in the second half of the year, so that's one item that'll bring it down first half related to second half.
Secondly, Space Systems, also up a little bit first half of the year; think of that as some of the phasing and the mix of
where we're seeing some of the ULA equity earnings, and we expect to see a little bit of a reduction in that in the
second half of the year. So that's – I think you did the math exactly right in the guidance we have, Howard. The wild
card in all this is, is we have a certain level of planned, I'll say, risk retirements that we expect to occur in both third
quarter and fourth quarter, and just as we had some benefits beyond what we were planning in the first and second
quarter, if those occur as they did in the first and second, then it may be able to mitigate some of that reduction you see
or you're talking about. If they don't, then we won't see that happen. It's kind of that simple.

Now I'll flip the call back over to Marillyn for, I think, the second half of your question.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: And I think your question about what do we see in terms of continued cost reduction, I
would just point to the fact that we've been very proactive, as I said earlier, in the last several years on just getting
ahead of the budget cuts by reducing expenses and head count. But we have very seasoned leaders that don't just
manage programs; they manage their business on an ongoing basis, and they have very strong cost control discipline in
the business. So we look at that and monitor that on ongoing basis, so as I said earlier, we try to keep our structure in
line with the business base that we have.
The other thing, though, that is driving the performance of the businesses is just consistent performance on the
programs. We're performing well across all of the business areas, with very deliberate management of the programs and
making sure that we perform and meet the cost targets that those contracts drive, and continue to look at ways that we
can improve our margins on the programs. So I think it's just straight-up good performance by our leadership and our
teams across the business and executing on the programs that they have.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I wanted to ask something – Bruce, just your discussion about the options just triggered
something, which is just in terms of the incentive compensation and thinking about things on a going-forward basis, I
know that TSR is an important metric. But if a lot of people start cashing out of options, do you need to do something
to continue to incent people on a go-forward basis, is kind of part one. And part two, the higher stock price itself, what
is that going to do for the remainder of the year in terms of the Rabbi Trust or any other sorts of, I guess, compensation
programs and the shares outstanding as a result?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Sam, I'll address the first part. So if you've read the proxy, what you've seen
happen in the past few years is we've actually been lowering the number of options that are paid, not just to the senior
leadership team but to leadership in general. And in fact, at the start of this year, we eliminated option as a component
of our executive compensation program, so all of our equity compensation going forward is either in the form of RSUs
or performance stock units. And so one of things that I don't think we necessarily have a complete understanding of
amongst all of our investors is that some of the dilutive aspects that have been occurring that have been needing to be
offset through share repurchases have been because of the level of option exercises. So, if you track the number of
outstanding options over the past few years, that's has come down fairly significantly.
And I guess it's kind of a good news/bad news – as the stock price increases, we have more option exercise, which
increases the dilution effect, but it also gets rid of those options at a faster clip such that, going forward – and I don't
have this off the top of my head, but I want to say, on an annual basis, we were probably providing somewhere in the
5-ish million, maybe 6 million shares or so of options on an annual basis, maybe more like 7 million shares; and if
you're just providing the same amount of executive compensation, it takes a lot fewer shares to do that with RSUs and
performance stock units. So, on an annual run rate, we're going to see less dilutive opportunities, if you will, from our
executive compensation program then we've had in years past. And that's a direct reflection of some of the
conversations we've had with investors who've raised that point to us, and we made that change accordingly.
I think your second question was the higher stock price in the second half of the year and its impacts on the Rabbi
Trust, and really there is not an associated impact there as I think of it, Sam. Our Rabbi Trust, you can put it in
essentially the same sorts of options that 401(k) opportunities are for our employees, and we try to match that from a
liabilities perspective. So I'll say it's more targeted to overall market performance, if you will, than directly to the

Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On Aeronautics, as you look forward – you've had about 12% margin levels recently, and
when you look forward, you're going through a fairly significant mix change with F-35 growing in its share of
revenues, but at the same time, you've got more and more sustainment coming from F-22, F-16, C-130J. How do you
see those two things playing out going forward, and should we see Aeronautics margins tend to stay at the kind of
levels they're at today?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Doug, I'll try that one. We've said for quite some time – I always sort of describe
this as the algebra of this business when it comes to Aeronautics margins. So, going forward, even though the overall
F-35 margins are expected to increase going forward, we have a bit of a mitigation impact there because we just
lowered, if you will, the go-forward booking rate, if you want to think of it that way, for the SDD contract by virtue of
what we did with the adjustment we took this quarter. So if you kind of throw all of those things into the mix, what I
would expect to see is that the margins of Aeronautics will come down a little bit in the future, as we've predicted
probably for the last two years or three years, simply because of the higher F-35 volume. Even while the F-35, on a
standalone basis, is kind of increasing year-over-year, it still has a dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics
because some of – the volume that is offsetting was higher-margin C-130 and F-16 work.
Just to give you a little bit of perspective, so I think I've been fairly consistent saying we'd like to see the F-35
production contracts get into a double-digit margin level by the time we get to full-rate production. If we just strip out
the SDD performance from the overall F-35 program and focus more on the production contracts, you should think it as
we're kind of in the higher-single-digit levels today, so that program, I'll say, in general is kind of performing in line
with our expectations. SDD clearly – we don't like to have back-to-back adjustments like we had in the second quarter
of last year, the second quarter of this year, so that hasn't been performing from a margin perspective as well as we'd
like it to, and that has a bit of drag, as I said. But I think the production programs are actually performing pretty well,
but that still is what's causing, again, what I'd call sort of the algebra effect on Aeronautics margins.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Saheed, I think we're coming up on the hour, maybe one last question.

All right. And our final question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Two quick ones, probably for you, Bruce. Following up on F-35 in the quarter, you had
commented you had a $50 million increase in profit, and revenues were up a $175 million, so could you break out how
much of that was inception to-date pickups versus just maybe a bit of margin improvement itself? And then in the
Space area, you had a $50 million increase in the ULA profit, which struck me as a big number. Can you just kind of
just go through what caused that, and is there any way to forecast what that might be going forward? Thanks.

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. George, I'll try to address both of those. So you're right; I think the press release
identified the amounts that you talked about in terms of the $50 million and the $175 million. Maybe the simplest way
to think of that, George, is as sort of go into the mid-single to upper-single-digit levels on the sales volume, and take
everything else and assume that that's the step-up in the quarter. I don't have a number off the top of my head, but it's a
pretty good chunk of that overall $50 million on that $175 million sales increase, but again, I don't have the split
exactly in my head.
The $50 million ULA is an upper – that's one of the things I talked about earlier in terms of one of the reasons why the
margins in Space Systems are higher. That's a couple of things. Again, we mentioned the mix aspects within ULA. The
mix is supposed to better this year than last year in terms of profitability of some of the launches, and the volume will
be up as well. So we would expect to see, for the rest of the year, not probably quite a comparable level as the first half,
but pretty close to that level in the second half.
I think the thing that stuck out and the reason it's up so much in the second quarter of this year is because, actually, last
year, due to some of – opposite issues, the mix issues and the phasing within the year, last year's second quarter was, by
far, the lowest quarter of the year for ULA from an equity earnings perspective. So that made this quarter, although it is
higher than maybe it has been historically, it made the difference between second quarter last year and second quarter
this year appear even greater.
Marillyn A. Hewson
So let me wrap up our call today by again highlighting that I believe our second quarter results and increased guidance
illustrate the solid position and performance of the corporation to provide value to our shareholders and solutions to our
customers. Even in an uncertain budget environment, our program portfolio, strong balance sheet, robust cash
generation, and the exceptional execution by our 116,000 employees will continue to propel our corporation forward.
So I thank you again for your interest and for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our
next earnings call in October. Thanks.
