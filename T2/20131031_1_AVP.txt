MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
I'll now turn the conference over to Amy Chasen, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Chasen, you may
begin your conference.
Amy Low Chasen
Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Avon's third quarter 2013 results. With me today on the call are;
Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO; and Kimberly Ross, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Sheri will make introductory
comments and then Kimberly will take you through our results and provide color on our outlook. Then we'll have our
usual Q&A session.
With that, I refer you to the cautionary statement in today's earnings release, as well as to our non-GAAP
reconciliation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual, on the call we'll focus on
these adjusted non-GAAP financial measures.
I'll now hand the call over to Sheri.

Good morning. By now you've seen the press release with our third quarter results. It was a tough quarter. Working a
turnaround is not a linear process. And as we said to you on our last call, we knew that the third quarter would be
challenging. Given our sales performance, it's clear that it was tougher than we anticipated. As you'll hear this morning,
we experienced some macroeconomic headwinds and we continued to be impacted by the negative performance in
some parts of our business.
However, if I step back and look at the third quarter in the context of our overall turnaround, while it was tough, we
understand what the challenges were. We are course-correcting when necessary, and we're moving forward.
Avon is headed in the right direction. Parts of our business are stabilizing and we are making progress toward our
three-year financial goal. We continue to work against our strategic framework and are focused on executing growth
platforms, driving simplification and efficiency and improving organizational effectiveness. In the area of growth
platforms, we are improving our consumer proposition and have made good progress defining our product category and
innovation strategies and developing fully-integrated marketing plans.
We've been focusing the organization on improving all aspects of the representative experience and we continue to
work on our geographic optimization. In the area of simplification and efficiency, we continue to drive a mindset of
cost management and at the same time are tackling some of the larger, un-crunched processes that create complexity
and costs. And in the area of organizational effectiveness, I feel very good about my executive team and we continue to
build our management bench strength in our key markets which is crucial to longer term success. We have also made
good progress in instilling more discipline and accountability across the organization.
This morning I will speak briefly about our third quarter performance and Kimberly will take you through a detailed
review of our results. We will then open the line for Q&A. Overall we continue to trend of good performance from our
Latin America and EMEA business units although the results were not as strong as earlier this year. What is clear to me
is that when we focus on the fundamentals and execute well, we deliver solid performance. I'm particularly pleased
with our Brazil teams' strong results in both Beauty and Fashion & Home in a very competitive market environment.
I was in Brazil earlier this month and was impressed with the team and the work they're doing to drive sustainable
processes for the future. They continue to take an integrated approach with good direct-selling fundamentals, strong
execution of locally-relevant new product innovation, and continued improvement in service levels.
As you'll hear from Kimberly, while we are facing some macro issues in parts of Latin America and EMEA, we also
have the opportunity to improve the consistency of our execution. We must continue to improve our capabilities, for
instance, in brochure execution or in better balancing pricing decisions for driving unit growth.
Clearly we are not yet where we need to be on some capabilities, but we are diagnosing quickly, identifying issues, and
developing plans to address and course-correct. We need to build strong execution into our DNA. This will take time as
we build organizational capabilities but we are making progress.
Looking at our Asia-Pacific business, I'm not satisfied with our performance. We continue to work through our
challenges in China. But as I said in the previous call, it will take some quarters to stabilize that business.
We also saw continued softening in the Philippines. We've already taken corrective actions, including the appointment
of a new highly experienced Avon General Manager for the Philippines. We are in the process of replacing the
Asia-Pacific business unit leadership, which for the time being, is under interim management focused on stabilizing the
region.
In North America, while our situation remains difficult, I do have confidence that we now have the right leader in place
and that we have begun to map out an effective path to stabilization. I'm going to give you some perspective on our
North America challenges, and we'll then give you a sense of what we're focused on in our stabilization efforts.
The U.S. business continued to decline. At the same time, the overall North America business performance was also
impacted by the decline in Avon Canada, where there was significant disruption as we implemented the SMT pilot. As
you'll recall SMT or Service Model Transformation was an initiative that began several years ago to improve our order
management system and modernize the way our representatives do business with Avon.

When this was initiated in 2009, it was a global program. Most recently, the work has been focused on a pilot program
in Canada, which went live in the second quarter. While the SMT's pilot technology platform worked well, the degree
of impact or change in the daily processes to the representative was significant. This resulted in a steep drop in the
active representative count. We are working hard to get Canada stabilized and back on track on a solid performance
track.
This includes giving additional support to our existing Representatives both making some adjustments to the system
and helping them with the transition. We are also intensifying our recruiting efforts and supporting the new
Representatives as they learn the process.
In parallel with our stabilization efforts in Canada, we continue to analyze the Canadian SMT pilot and are considering
our approach to updating order management systems in other markets.
When I look at our experience in Canada with SMT, and the experience in the U.S. with one simple sales model, which
I'll discuss in a moment, it's clear to me that our business model has difficulty adjusting to these big bang, field
initiatives. The nature of direct selling, where our six million Representatives are independent entrepreneurs, it is one of
personal relationships and connections. It's about influencing and incenting behavior. It requires phasing change in
thoughtfully and strategically, not mandating abrupt changes. We need to make it – to take a more evolutionary versus
revolutionary approach to changes that impact our Representatives.
We see this in Central Europe, where we have good success in evolving the service model, but it was done slowly over
a period of several years, and in a way that gradually moved Representatives from an old model to a new one that
provided them with better options. This more-measured approach to field change with a focus on the impact on the
representative is one that we are adopting on Representatives facing changes moving forward.
Let's go back to the U.S. where the One Simple Sales Model was intended to transform the business. Implementation of
One Simple Sales Model began in 2011 and continued through late 2012. It was a big-bang change and has been much
more disruptive to the business than anticipated.
Into 2013 we continued to see an erosion of field health. I know you've heard a lot about field health issues in the U.S.
so let me start by giving you a brief sense of where we are today. As you recall, the One Simple Sales Model was
intended to migrate our Representatives to a leadership model. And the reduction in the number of district sales
managers and the broad-based redistricting were intended to facilitate that migration, and at the same time reduce our
fixed cost base. It is taking us longer than anticipated to recover from the redistricting.
We recently completed the diagnosis of U.S. field health and three things are clear; first, we need to stabilize and build
on the current field structure without forcing more disruptive change. Second, in the process of reducing the number of
district managers and reassigning Representatives, we broke some critical relationships and as you know, direct sales is
a relationship business. We are taking a deliberate, comprehensive, and disciplined approach to rebuilding and
strengthening relationships across the field.
And finally, our recruiting engine fell apart. Effective recruiting is not simply bringing new Representatives into the
system, but also giving them support and training they need to navigate through their first few campaigns. Moving
forward, we are working with the current district sales manager base to deliver incremental recruiting capacity. And
we've already begun to improve the quality and frequency of our training and support programs.
At the same time, we are redeploying resources to support our sales leaders and help them grow their businesses. And
across all aspects of the field, we are driving contact. Frequent high quality contact is critical to helping our
Representatives – new Representatives be successful, improving Representative retention and increasing productivity.
So in the U.S., improving field health is job one. This means rebuilding critical processes and putting discipline back
into the field management. This is crucial to ensuring sustainable field health.
The challenges that we surfaced aren't new, but our response to them is much more deliberate, disciplined and
comprehensive. And most important, we have put the Representative and what she needs to succeed back at the center
of our decision making. At the same time, we are working to improve our store, or brochure, which include

strengthening the brand, aligning our product mix and improving the overall brochure energy and shopping experience.
When we look at how the U.S. markets fits into the Avon geographic portfolio, it is clear that this business needs to
return to profitability. As part of that, we are working with urgency to move to a sustainable cost base that is in line
with our revenue.
To summarize, in the U.S. market we are focused on restoring field health, improving our store and creating a
sustainable cost base. We will take you through this in more detail for the U.S. at CAGNY early next year.
If I step back and look at the broader view of Avon business unit performance, we see good progress in Latin America
and EMEA. Asia-Pacific continues to struggle, but we are making the necessary management changes there to drive
stabilization. And North America continues to decline, but we are working aggressively to stabilize it to move toward
profitability.
Let me briefly give you an update on FCPA. As we reported last quarter, in June we made a settlement offer to the DOJ
and the SEC that was rejected. As you will see in our 10-Q, in September we received an offer from the SEC staff that
included monetary penalties of a magnitude significantly greater than our earlier offer.
We believe monetary penalties at the level proposed by the SEC staff are not warranted. We anticipate that the DOJ
also will make a counter proposal, although we are unable to predict the terms of its proposal or when we will receive
it. I hope you can appreciate that we cannot provide any additional information beyond what is in the 10-Q.
I am going to hand it over to Kimberly to talk about the details of the quarter. But before I do, I want to provide some
perspective on the less-quantifiable aspects of our performance.
There is no shortage of challenges for us. There are macroeconomic issues and continued uncertainty in some of our
markets. We can't control these, but we're getting better at understanding how they impact our business and we're
planning accordingly.
Overall, I'm encouraged by the improvements I see in how the organization is tackling our challenges. We are seeing
improvements in discipline and accountability but we need to see it across all parts of our business as this is key to
taking the volatility out of our performance. We're also improving on execution. A good example is our recent
re-launch of Avon Color.
Avon Color is our flagship makeup brand and plays a crucial role in our product portfolio as it's an entry point for new
consumers and Representatives. The Avon Color launch has global consistency, including brand positioning and
product benefits. It was brought to light in the market with our new global You Make It Beautiful brand campaign as
supported by locally-relevant celebrities and launch activities. It is a rolling launch and is delivering good results in
early market.
So, better accountability and discipline and improving our ability to execute. Equally important, we are learning to stay
the course. When things don't go exactly as planned, instead of making wholesale changes in strategy, we are
analyzing, adjusting, learning along the way, and sharing those learnings with the rest of the organization. Kimberly.
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri. As Sheri indicated, the third quarter was tough. As we outlined last quarter, in Q3 we expected
volume deleverage, inflationary impact and higher spend on new launches in Latin America. However, constant dollar
sales growth was weaker than we had anticipated which impacted results relative to our expectations.
For the quarter, our constant-dollar revenue declined 1%. This includes a one point benefit from the recognition of tax
credits in Brazil associated with a change in estimate of expected recoveries of VAT of $22 million. On a reported
basis, revenue was down 7%, negatively impacted by currency. We continued to see positive growth in Latin America
and EMEA but this is being offset by continued weakness in North America and Asia-Pacific.

Units declined 7% driven by Latin America, North America and Asia. Latin America was down partly due to the
impact of price increases as well as the comparison against Q3 2012, which benefited from the flowing of excess
inventory. Price mix was up 6% in the quarter with a one-point benefit from the Brazil tax credit. The increase was
largely driven by Latin America where we took price increases in some markets including Brazil. Active
Representatives were down 3% with continued declines in North America and Asia-Pacific, as well as declines in some
markets in EMEA and Latin America.
Adjusted gross margin was up 180 basis points to 63.1%, largely due to benefits in Latin America from price increases
and the comparison with quarter three 2012 when we flowed excess inventory, which negatively impacted our gross
margin.
Adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 5.4% in the quarter. This included an 80 basis point benefit
from the VAT credits in Brazil. The decline was due to deleverage given the weaker sales as well as some of the factors
we had flagged to you on our last call. These include the negative impact of currency, higher transportation costs and
higher field spending in Latin America, largely in Brazil in support of new product launches.
Adjusted EPS was $0.14 per share compared to $0.18 a year ago.
With that said, let me move to the regional discussion. Starting with Latin America, revenue rose 6% in constant
dollars, which includes a two point benefit associated with the Brazil tax credits. The growth was due to strength in
average order, which benefited from price increases across the region. Price mix was up 12% including a two point
benefit from the tax credit. Some of this was due to inflationary pricing in Argentina and Venezuela, but there were
also price increases in other markets including Brazil.
Active Representatives declined 1% and units were down 6%. Brazil constant dollar revenue was up 13%, which
includes a four point benefit associated with the tax credits. Growth in Brazil was driven by average order due to strong
innovation in the quarter. Active Representatives were up. Units were down driven by a decline in Beauty, which was
partly a result of the comparison to quarter three 2012, when we flowed excess inventory.
Fashion & Home units were up. Constant dollar Beauty sales were up 6% in Brazil, which benefited from the
successful re-launch of our Avon Color line which Sheri mentioned. Personal Care was also strong, benefiting from the
launch of Encanto, our new hand and body line. In addition, Fragrances benefited from the launch of Garoto de
Ipanema. We are pleased that these products were developed specifically with the Brazilian consumer in mind and that
we were able to successfully launch them at a higher price point.
Fashion & Home sales were up 18% in constant dollars with continued benefits from the more-effective pricing and
improved merchandising we instituted last year. While we had expected Fashion & Home growth to slow a bit, we are
pleased that it remains strong.
We also made stronger solid progress in improving our service levels in Brazil. As you are aware, we continued to
focus on driving sales with new locally-relevant products, rebuilding brand health and driving Representative
recruitment.
That being said, the competitive environment in Brazil remains intense and we don't expect this to subside any time
soon. As a reminder, we are up against a strong quarter last year in Q4. So growth may not continue at the same pace.
Mexico declined 7% in constant dollars, primarily driven by lower average order. Active Representatives were up,
while units were down. During the quarter we faced external economic issues and we also had some execution issues
that impacted us. The economic slowdown in Mexico accelerated over the past several months, and the resulting
consumer weakness impacted our business.
Competition has reacted by increasing discounting, while we were raising prices on certain high-unit movers during
this time. We are watching the economic and consumer trends in Mexico carefully. We are also putting appropriate
actions in place to address execution issues. Having said that we believe our business could decline further in quarter
four in Mexico.

Venezuela was up 15% in constant dollars. The growth was driven by an increase in average order largely due to
inflationary pricing. Active Representative count was down due to service issues impacting the Representative base, as
well as macro factors that continued to be disruptive to the business.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 11.3%, up 10 basis points. This included a 150 basis-point benefit from
the Brazil tax. Adjusted operating margin would have been down excluding this. Gross margin was up in Latin
America benefiting from price increases and the comparison with last year when gross margin was hurt by flowing of
excess inventory. This gross margin benefit was offset by the planned increase in field and selling expenses, primarily
in Brazil in support of new product launches as well as increases in bad debt and legal expenses in that market.
Increases in transportation costs in Venezuela and Argentina were also a factor.
As we look forward, Latin America will continue to be impacted by both weaker economies as well as continued high
level as of competition. However, we continue to focus on the core fundamentals of recruitment, new product
innovation and improving our pricing capabilities in order to continue to drive growth in this region.
Moving to EMEA, revenues increased 2% in constant dollars. The exit of Ireland impacted the region by less than one
point. Russia revenue declined 2% in constant dollars due to the lower average order. Active Representatives were up.
We had some challenges this quarter around marketing and merchandising execution. Specifically, we focused our
Fashion & Home spreads around higher-end items without enough focus on the lower-priced unit drivers. This was in
the face of continued high level of price competition from retail as well as weaker economic growth.
UK revenue declined 2% in constant dollars. The decline was due to lower Active Representatives which is being
impacted by a number of issues including high turnover among the zone managers in the field. As we indicated last
quarter, we have a new, experienced and highly capable team in place in the UK, but it will take some time to drive
sustainable improvements in this market.
Turkey revenue declined 4% in constant dollars due to a decline in Active Representative. This is a result of both a very
strong base and a conscious decision to focus on improving our return by not repeating costly incentives we did in
quarter three 2012, which only drove short-term results. We are starting to make some progress in reducing volatility in
this market. We put in place a more-sustainable field model, which is less incentive-driven and we are more focused on
brochure execution.
In South Africa, constant dollar sales rose 21%, primarily due to higher average order driven by an increase in units
sold. Active representative count was also stronger, as we are comparing against a quarter that was fully impacted by
credit policy changes. Having said that, the currency has weakened and we are taking actions to mitigate the impact.
This will temper growth in quarter four, but we continue to feel good about the fundamentals and underlying business
trends in this market.
Adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 9.9% up 140 basis points. Gross margin was up primarily due to lower
material and overhead costs. In addition, field compensation was down as a result of a high level of incentives in
Turkey last year that did not repeat. Brochure costs were also down as a result of cost-reduction initiatives in various
EMEA markets.
Turning to North America, this region remains very challenged and reported an 18% constant-dollar revenue decline.
Sheri addressed the key issues in North America, so I won't repeat her commentary. The bottom line is that Active
Representatives are down 16%.
As Sheri outlined, restoring field health, improving our brochure and driving costs down to a sustainable level are
priorities in North America. While we have made progress with our cost savings initiatives, it is not enough considering
the decline in our business. As a result, as Sheri indicated, we are in the process of analyzing further cost savings
initiatives.
Adjusted North American operating loss was 34% primarily due to the lower revenue. Transportation costs as a
percentage of revenue increased. As the volume declined, the cost per unit to increase. In addition, gross margin was
negatively impacted by actions to drive the sale of excess inventory.

We were also impacted by negative mix as Beauty continues to underperform Fashion & Home. We are working to
stabilize North America. But as we've said in the past, this will take time, and we don't expect recovery in quarter four.
In Asia-Pacific, revenue declined 19% on a constant-dollar basis, mainly due to continued weakness in China as well as
weakness in Active Representatives in other markets. We also lost about one point of revenue from the exit of Vietnam
and South Korea. Active Representative count declined 10% and units were down 24%.
Philippines revenue declined 5% on a constant-dollar basis due to operational challenges in this market that contributed
to a decline in Active Representatives. As Sheri indicated, we have put a new General Manager in the Philippines. It is
very early days, but she is working on our plan to stabilize and ultimately grow this business.
China constant-dollar revenue was down 69%, primarily due to the decline in unit sales, which is partly due to our
action to reduce inventory levels held by the Beauty Boutiques. A decline in the number of Beauty Boutiques also
negatively impacted unit sales in China. Our focus in China continues to be the stabilization of the BBs, which includes
the reduction of inventory levels in the trade, stabilizing the number of Beauty Boutiques, improving the look, tone, and
feel of the BB stores and improving brand health. This will take time and we expect continued softness as we work
through the issues over the next several quarters.
Adjusted operating margin was 1.6% in Asia-Pacific, down 500 basis points. This was largely due to revenue
deleverage and lower gross margin due to the underperformance of skincare primarily in China. We also had some
increases in advertising, largely in the Philippines. Asia-Pacific in total remains challenging, and we expect results to
remain soft in the near-term. In short, we have ongoing operational issues across Asia, and we'll continue to keep you
posted on our progress.
Now, I'll take you through two adjustments we made to our GAAP results in quarter. Similar to the first and second
quarter, as a result of the Venezuela currency devaluation, we recorded a $15 million charge from using the U.S.
historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets, such as inventory. We will cycle through the remaining amount in
quarter four.
In addition, we recorded a non-cash $42 million charge to write-off goodwill and intangible assets for China. This is a
result of the decline in revenue performance in China in the third quarter, which was significantly below our
expectations and the reduction of our long-term revenue and earnings projections for this market. In addition, we also
recognized the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets associated with China, due to these reduced projections.
Moving onto cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities was $96 million for the nine months ending
September 2013, compared with $208 million in the same period in 2012. The decrease was due to the $90 million
make-whole premium and unfavorable timing of accounts payable. Higher payments for employee-incentive
compensation and restructuring and a $25 million contribution to the UK pension plan in 2013. These items were
partially offset by improved operating profit.
Our net debt for Q3 was $2 billion, which is about the same as the year-end level but down $246 million from quarter
three 2012. Year-to-date, we reduced the overall debt balance by $412 million, of which $114 million was reduced in
Q3.
For Q3 we continued to make progress on working capital, which operationally improved five days compared with a
year ago. Accounts payable improved six days operationally as we continued to focus on renegotiating payment terms
with our vendors. However, inventory levels deteriorated by two days operationally, excuse me, due to Latin America,
excuse me. One key factor is that Brazil employed a strategy, excuse me, sorry about that. One key factor is that Brazil
employed a strategy to shift consignment inventory in Fashion & Home to purchasing that inventory outright in an
effort to reduce complexity and improve cost.
However, as I've said before, the teams are not yet where they need to be with regards to driving sustainable inventory
management and forecasting processes. This remains a key area of focus for us as we work to improve cash flow.

Thinking about the remainder of the year, the sales recovery is taking longer than we expected. We continue to make
progress in EMEA and Latin America, but our challenges in North America and Asia-Pacific continue and economic
uncertainty remains an issue as well.
And we are still working through some of these foundational issues in our business such as ensuring we have the right
Representatives and consumer proposition, driving sustainable process improvement, and improving our pricing
capability.
To this end, we will take a more strategic approach to pricing and discounting along with the work we are doing to
strengthen our brand image. This is not easy work and we won't always get it right the first time, but we know it is
crucial to our long-term success. And we continue to look very closely at our cost structure particularly in North
America for incremental opportunities to drive savings. Some of these initiatives could have restructuring charges
related to them in quarter four.
As we think about the full-year outlook, we expect sales to be down slightly, as the sales recovery is taking longer than
we expected. As it relates to adjusted operating margin, we are pleased with our progress so far this year and expect the
year to come in better than the modest growth we originally set.
For Q4, keep in mind that we expect to have a continued negative impact from deleverage given weaker sales. In
addition, we expect a continued negative impact from currency. In addition, we are up against a reversal in accrual for
management bonuses in last year's quarter four of $34 million which we don't expect to repeat this year. Note that we
will continue to focus on cash generation in working capital specifically.
We've said that turnarounds are not linear, which is what we saw in quarter three, but we remain focused on making
steady progress and continuing to achieve the right balance between the shorter term need to stabilize our business,
while ensuring that we make the right decisions to drive the long-term sustainable growth.
With that, I'll hand it back to Sheri for some closing comments and then we will take your questions.
Sheri McCoy
Thank you, Kimberly. So as you see a tough quarter, not unanticipated given the nature of a turnaround and the macro
pressures in some of our markets. And while the third quarter was challenging, we are in this for the long term.
When I step back and look at the quarter in the context of our overall turnaround, I'm confident that we're headed in the
right direction and that we are on track against our three-year financial goals. There is always tension around the pace
of change in a turnaround. We are acting with the sense of urgency to return our key markets to health, but we know we
need to be more deliberate and thoughtful about any changes impacting the field and our Representatives. We are
making progress. We're getting the right people in the right jobs. We are focused on execution and we will get better.
And most important, we have the Representative back at the center of our business and we are doing what's best for the
organization and our shareholders for the long term. As we move forward, we will continue to make the tough
decisions, facing challenges head on and moving forward.
We'll now open the lines for Q&A.

<A - Sheri McCoy>: Hi Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey, the whole sort of price mix equation, it looks like you're finally, I think, doing the
right thing for the business in terms of trying to realize pricing, but I guess the volume reaction has been probably a lot
worse than you thought. So how long do you think it's going to take to finally get the pricing transition right? And I
know it's hard to pin down numbers, but to your sort of percentages in terms of like how low you think your prices are
right now relative to where they should be?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, I think if we look at pricing, there are multiple things to look at. Certainly, we had
some challenges in some of our markets, Mexico specifically as we were managing price. We did have some success.
So as I look at pricing in Brazil where we actually were introducing higher-end innovation and were able to take price.
For example, with our Encanto line and even our Avon Color was priced more premium as well as some of our
fragrances. So I think where we are is, we have to look at that price mix component and then we have to look at pricing
by tier.
And I think some of the areas where we've struggled, we cannot take pricing across the board. As we look at the
low-end products, we need to make sure of our high unit movers, we need to make sure that we're actually not taking
price there, but looking how we move the consumer up more broadly. So I think we are making progress. It is going to
be something that is a little bit more delicate for us. As an example, in Russia where we were focused on premium for
Fashion & Home, that was probably okay, but we didn't have the merchandising to be able to offset that with the lower
end. So we just need to get better at these things and I think the organization is learning. We have stronger capabilities
in EMEA as it relates to pricing, but we don't have it in Latin America and the team there is really very focused on
putting more resource around that, because I think that will help us obviously, as you know, from a gross margin
standpoint but also help us from an equity standpoint as we build the brand.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks and then just on the U.S., you're looking at countries to exit. I mean, could
the organization handle getting rid of the U.S. business? I mean, because if you look at sort of the strategic metrics for
some of the businesses that you've already left, it looks like the U.S. is probably worse than a lot of those and I know
it's sort of a broad question, you're probably not going to answer it, but I just love to hear your thoughts.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. I mean, the U.S. is a big market, it's an important market and as I've spent a lot of
time with our Representatives and our sales leaders in the field and people are very committed and want the U.S.
business to work. I think some of the issues that we're dealing with are some strategic things that we've done over a
course of many years and even as I talked on the call with One Simple Sales Model. As we were watching that and
trying to figure out how to stabilize, we were struggling with that. But as I look at the brand, I look at the importance of
the U.S. market as it relates to Beauty. And even if I look at the U.S. market from a portfolio standpoint, as we're
talking about volatility, it's because we're so heavily indexed in emerging markets and we don't have the offset of a
stable U.S. business to help us moving forward. So I think there's a portfolio reason to get that back to profitability.
And as I talk to the Representatives and I look at sort of some of the issues we have, I'm confident that we're going to
get there. The challenge is the time it's going to take to actually build our field back and then we have the innovation,
we have the product. So it's a just a matter of being very disciplined and focused as we move forward and I think the
U.S. is an important part of our overall portfolio. Thanks, Bill.

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, just a follow-up on the U.S. comments and I think the comments that you're trying to
right size the cost structure for the size of the business. I mean, the business is kind of a third smaller than it was four,
five years ago. But do you think the overall revenue base now kind of $1.5 billion, is that the right size for the U.S. as
you think about your cost structure? I'm trying to get a sense for whether you're constantly chasing your tail, trying to
cut the costs and then the business shrinks and then you cut the costs and business shrinks. Is there a scenario where the
U.S. business, you should cut out X number of Reps and you should only have a $1 billion of business there?

And then just another follow-up and forgive me is the FCPA language, I know you've said historically in a couple of
different settings that what the negotiation or the settlement discussions pertain exclusively to China. Is that still the
case? Or are the settlement discussions covering a broader geography? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yes, so certainly as it relates to the U.S., I think as we look at it, some of the changes that
we've made have impacted the sales revenues. So I think your point about what's the base that you're looking against.
We're going back and saying, let's look at a range of where we think the business is going to be. And making sure we're
not doing things that are negatively impacting the sales basis and then looking at what will we have to do to drive cost
out. And so that's really the exercise that we're going through. We recognized that, to me it's not so much about the
what the size of the U.S. business is per se, it's about the profitability of that business. And so we're looking at various
ways of thinking about contingency as we look at the plans moving forward.
As it relates to the FCPA, Wendy we really can't say much more about that. I wish I could, but just given where we are,
it's difficult for me to add any additional commentary beyond what is in the 10-Q.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thanks. It's Barclays. So I guess I was struck by sort of contrast between your
comments on Russia and on Turkey, and the performance in the two. So in Russia, where it had felt like things had
really stabilized, they're evolving locally, relevant innovation, adjusting field, fundamentals et cetera et cetera, things
are on the right path. And then the business is down 2% this quarter.
In Turkey, the commentary around you were making steps in the right directions to reduce volatility long term, sounds
reminiscent of what you would have said and have said about Russia six months ago. So what's the difference I guess,
reducing volatility, where I'm still struggling is, it feels like the steps are in place to reduce volatility in the market X
and then the business declines. So how would you, I guess, explain that to say reducing volatility isn't really resulting in
that when you have Russia suddenly turning the corner again.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. I think a couple of things. One, as we step back and look at volatility from a total
perspective from a company, one of the challenges is we're very dependent on a few markets today based on our
performance. We need to get all of our top 10 markets performing at the appropriate level.
I think in the situation with Russia, we know exactly what the situation is relative to some of the issues that they had in
Fashion & Home. So I think the good news for me is, when we're seeing issues today, it's very clear what the issue is.
We have corrective action and we know how to address it. I think where we're struggling with Turkey for many years,
is we weren't having the diagnosis or the discipline to understand it.
In Turkey, we made a conscious decision because last year in 3Q, we put a lot of money into the field. We did an
analysis and we looked at the incentives did not pay off and we made a decision to look at how we're going to get this
more stable for the long-term. As we working through pricing, to Bill's question earlier, as we are working through
pricing and merchandising, we're still not as consistent as we need to be. So we're going to see blips like what we saw
in Russia or what we saw in Mexico. But I think the good news from my standpoint is we understand it, we're
addressing it, he teams are reaching out, we have expertise to be able to help fix that. And it's going to take us some
time to work through that but we're on the path to getting execution right. So it's one of these things that as we look at
the turnaround and we look at what's – why we set three-year goals, it's because we have some processes that we need
to work on and we have some talent deficiencies or capability deficiencies that we need to continue to focus on as it
relates to pricing and merchandising in all of our markets. We're getting better at it, but we still have more work to do.

Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hi. Good morning. It's Wells Fargo. I guess the question is as you go through this
turnaround, two of you bigger markets; Mexico and Russia have both been pretty strong pillars of support and they
wavered a bit this quarter. I hear you on Mexico that macros are a contributor, but it sounds like execution is an issue in
both places to some extent and I guess the question is, are these bigger kind of structural execution issues that will
ultimately prove to be part of bigger long-term fixes, i.e. multi-year? Or do you think that these two markets, which are
pretty big and relevant, can actually grow through this turnaround process?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: I mean I absolutely feel that they're both at the turnaround process. I mean – as I was saying to
Lauren, we understand what the issues are. We understand how to fix it. It doesn't mean that we're going to fix
everything overnight, but it's very clear some of the things that we need to do and make sure that we have guardrails in
place as we're making some of these changes to ensure that we're not making the same mistakes. With that said, we are
– we still have some talent capability gaps in some of our markets that we're working toward and making sure we're
training and developing people, so it is going to take some time, but it's not – if I look at where Russia and Mexico are
relative to where the U.S. is, we're in very different places. So I feel very good about us getting back on track in those
markets.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Thanks. And I guess it relates to that talent gap, right, I mean it's been a little while that
you've been at this now and I know it sounds easy, like Russia, the execution issue was pricing too high when
competitors are pricing down. It sounds like Philippines got the new head; you have interim management in Asia-Pac. I
mean to what extent is just this you getting to – you getting through all of the regions and finally being able to assess
management as opposed to maybe the ground sort of changing underneath you at all, so could you characterize that a
little bit?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Sure, I mean and I spend a lot of time in the field and continue to meet with management
throughout the world, at least in our top markets and what I will say is we've made a lot of progress in talent as it
relates to the executive committee level. We're now going through our top markets, as it relates to their teams and we're
making good progress there. We also have though in at the more junior levels, we're doing campaign planning and
we're doing some of the merchandising decisions. We need make sure we have expertise there. So it really has to be
cascaded through the organization and I think what gives me confidence is as I look at kind of our processes where
we're doing a good job and I go back to look at some of our older processes that were in the business years ago that we
sort of walked away from, it's in our DNA. We know we can get it back but we need to make sure that we're very
disciplined and we continue to train people and make sure that people have the skills that they need to drive the
business. So it does take time, I think we're on the right track, but we have to go through it because we're making
decisions, it's a management-intensive business and we're making decisions at the market level. Thanks, Chris.

<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Barclays Capital. Thank you so much for taking the question. I understand the difficulty
of adding a whole lot more clarity around what you said around FCPA but I was just hoping that you could give some
parameters around how we should think about various funding options that you might have in the context of a potential
settlement?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yes, thank you. Again we're not going to provide much color around this. So you correct on that
one and we're not going to speculate with regards to sizes but what I will say is that we do have cash balances and
obviously we also have a revolving credit facility that we have in place for backup liquidity needs.

<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Okay. That's helpful and then just has there been any discussion with the rating
agencies around the type of effect this might have on your credit ratings or is it still too early to say?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: You know, we have ongoing discussions with our rating agencies, we talk to them every quarter,
and obviously, this is something that we also talk to them about. So and you see what they publish at this point in time,
so, I'm not really going to comment on their behalf with regards to how they view FCPA, but obviously it is something
that we talk to them about.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation and pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys. I'm from Bernstein. So I'm still struggling with this, is this progress or not question. So
with the negative 2% organic sales growth, is the worst the company has reported at least as far back as I've modeled it,
maybe ever? So I'm still just confused about specifically why and are those things fixable and frankly what the strategy
is to fix it? I think the price mix versus volume discussion is a really illustrative one of this, because clearly the [ph]
austicity (48:35), is still driving negative top line growth. But is it even the right strategy to push pricing up the way
you did and through the volume response, without spending a ton more back, already in terms of improving in the
brand, already in terms of the field health?
Or are you realizing the effort spend a lot more money back, because there's just a real secular challenge that your
business is facing?
And I guess the broader question I have attached to that is, with 18 months plus now in your tenure and 24 months now
plus in your 10 years, are you where you want to be and how are your 2016 targets still really on the table?
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Thanks, Ali. As I step back, we set goals and we set three year goals because we knew that it
would take time for us to go through the turnaround. Particularly as we were looking at talent capabilities, some of the
processes that we needed to address and so from that standpoint, we were very clear that we needed to set those
three-year goals. As we look at the executional part of it, I think one – we've got sort of a tail of two. We've got North
America and Asia really draining on us today. We have to stay focused on those relative to fixing those businesses.
Latin America and EMEA are actually, there's some ups and downs in those markets, but in general if you look at the
CVU, performing in the right direction. If we look at what we need to do in those markets, we have to get more
consistent execution. And if you look at the reference price mix, I think Brazil is a good example where we did invest
in advertising, we did invest in pricing, we invested in higher-priced products and they're doing exceptionally well. So I
feel really good about that.
I just want to make it clear, we did not go across the board on pricing. We focus on some markets. Europe, for example,
wasn't heavily focused on pricing. They're really focusing on driving their unit growth. So what we're doing is, making
sure we understand it. We're learning from it, because it's important for us to get ourselves in the right place for the
long-term to both, as you point out, to build the equity of brand, but at the same time continue to make sure that we're
getting pricing to improve our margins overall. Thank you.

<Q - Olivia Tong>: Good morning. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I guess just following up on that, how is that
the recruiting engine fell apart to such a drastic degree, so much more quickly. I mean clearly North America and
Asia-Pac had been decelerating for a quite some time, but this is clearly a much bigger acceleration. So can you point
to one or two things that we know about the Beauty Boutiques in China and the excess inventory. But maybe in North
America, what drove such a drastic acceleration in the rep count decline and the sales decline?

<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Good question. So if you look at North America, we started the One Simple Sales Model
initiative back in 2011 and it was a combination of taking out district sales managers and then taking Representatives
and moving them over to sales leaders. So we broke some critical relationships between the district sales managers and
the Representatives. And as we were doing that, it was not clear who was controlling the recruiting piece. So the
district sales managers in the initial plan were not doing a lot of the recruiting. It was turned over to the sales leaders.
What we're doing now is having district sales mangers help support the sales leaders through recruiting and also
making sure that we're giving the right resources to the sales leaders for their recruiting.
The other thing I will say is that, as we were making all these changes, I think we lost focus on the discipline that's
required in recruiting. So it's not about just getting people to sign up. It's about making sure that the person that comes
in has a mentor, someone's that supportive from a field management standpoint to help her navigate through the first
three to six campaigns. And so what we were seeing is, we were getting people coming in, but because we had lost
focus on the processes as we were going through all this change, we weren't retaining people on getting them to
become Representatives. And so that's part of what we are working through is to really take the base of where we are
today and build off of that base, making sure we're clear about how we get more people in and supporting those
Representatives. So that's the critical piece. So the issue isn't new, but how we're addressing the issue is new. Thanks
Olivia.

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. Thanks. It's Stifel. Wanted to go back to an earlier question on the longer term
targets and basically try to drill down into your sales growth expectations. Do you think that mid single-digits is still
realistic considering the volume growth has worsened now sequentially on a two-year basis over the last four quarters?
And that it's just increasingly difficult to rely on pricing to drive growth longer term. Maybe if you can just talk broadly
about that and then sort of put it in context of how you think about the broader picture of your reason to exist, your
strategic positioning within the markets and the growth of the overlying market.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Certainly, as I look at our 2016 goals I feel very confident that we will get there. Certainly,
if you look at the critical markets in Latin America and Europe, we're performing in good shape. The real challenge for
us is getting profitability back in the U.S. and have the U.S. not be such a drain on it. So that's how we are looking at it
from an overall perspective and making sure that we continue to execute with excellence. I'm not sure I'm clear on your
comment about the overall market piece, the last part of your question, so perhaps you can give me more specifics on
that piece, Mark?
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. I guess just trying to think about it in broader context because I think as you had
talked about mid single digits previously, you'd said basically look at the markets and look at the categories that we
operate in and we're still there, Beauty is still a fundamentally favorable category yet the results have obviously not
suggested that.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah. Absolutely. I think as we look at where Beauty is going and the projections from a market
standpoint, it's still a very attractive market. Our opportunity is to get all of our top 10 markets performing at the same
level and executing well so that we're capitalizing on that. So it's important for us to do that moving forward.

reading that discussion right now, how could that impact consumer spending, since you alluded earlier already to a
challenging macroeconomic environment in Mexico?
And then with Brazil, related to your comments on competition, how much of that competition is shifting away from
the traditional guys like, can a tourist do more, the drug stores which have been growing very rapidly over the last
couple of years? Thank you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah, I'll talk first to Brazil, and then Kimberly, if you want to talk to Mexico. On Brazil, what
we're seeing is that direct selling is still very attractive in Brazil and you see O Boticário and other companies coming
into direct selling in the cosmetic space. So, while retail is a real threat and a competitor, direct selling is still quite
strong. And so we see that, that we need to continue to make sure that we're as competitive as it relates to innovation
and putting the appropriate spend behind our business that we still see as very attractive.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, and then if we talk, this is Kimberly, just talking about tax in Mexico, obviously the
government there has been quite active recently with a lot of different changes and tax being one of them. So there are
some different types of proposals that are on the table with regards to tax. We are in the process of evaluating those, it's
not clear which ones will ultimately pass at this point in time. So, something that's still under evaluation with regards to
overall impact and what will or will not pass.
And if I understood correctly, you also asked about tax changes in Brazil. And what I would say is every single day
taxes change in Brazil. So that's one of our full time jobs of keeping up with all the tax changes in Brazil. And so that's
an ongoing area that we continue to focus on, but I would like to stop for one moment and say that we have enhanced
our skill sets and our focus on taxes in Brazil as well as we recently hired a new head of tax for the company as a
whole. So definitely an area of focus for us in tax.

district sales mangers. And if so, to what extent that impacts your $400 million target. That will be my question. Thank
you.
<A - Sheri McCoy>: Yeah, so as we look at the U.S. it's about moving forward and we have a good base to build on
and that's really how we're looking at it. So as we look at the current district sales manager base, we are getting them
more involved in recruiting as well as looking at how we provide more resources to our sales leaders. So we feel good
about the base that we have. Our focus is getting that to work and that to work well, not necessarily going back and
making significant wholesale change. Thanks, Javier.

negotiated settlement? Is it imposed? If its imposed and you said that so far you don't think what has been proposed is
warranted, is there an appeals process? And the language in your 10-Q about the settlement is really ominous. I mean
it's changed from quarter to quarter. I mean can you categorically state that if it's as difficult as the Q suggests that
Avon is still a going concern?
