Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.
Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, and thank you, all, for calling in. As you saw in this morning's press release, Baxter
reported strong financial results for the third quarter, which exceeded expectations. Relative to our guidance, which
included vaccines, adjusted earnings increased 9% to $1.35 per diluted share, and worldwide sales advanced 13%.
Excluding foreign currency and Gambro from both periods, global sales increased 6%.
I'm very pleased with overall organic sales performance from ongoing operations as the third quarter represents the
highest quarterly growth of this year. This affords us the opportunity to increase investments in research and
development, and further enhance manufacturing, quality and operational excellence as we position our company for
sustained success. In recent months, we've continued to make progress in strengthening the portfolio with new
collaborations, advancing the new product pipeline through the achievement of meaningful milestones, and the
organization remains engaged in working to separate Baxter into two leading global healthcare companies aimed at
enhancing shareholder value over the long term.
For example, within BioScience, we're building on the strategic decision to expand our presence in the area of
oncology, leveraging the company's heritage of success in developing new therapies that treat unmet medical needs for
patients with rare diseases. Not only has Ludwig been building an experienced team of oncology leaders, including
senior clinical development, business development, and proven commercial executives, but we also continue to seek
partnership opportunities to expand the pipeline.
You may recall that last month, we signed an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Merrimack
Pharmaceuticals for the development and commercialization of MM-398, an investigational drug candidate for the
treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with the gemcitabine-based therapy. As you
know, pancreatic cancer is a rare and deadly disease that's difficult to diagnose and has limited treatment options.
Through this agreement, BioScience gains exclusive commercialization rights for all potential indications of MM-398
outside the United States and Taiwan. MM-398 has demonstrated robust survival results in a global Phase III trial that
will be the basis for regulatory submissions outside the U.S. beginning in 2015. BioScience now has four oncology
assets, MM-398, rigosertib, pacritinib and BAX069, with the potential for numerous indications for patients with
hematologic and solid malignancies. We look forward to discussing the progress of the oncology portfolio and
advancement of the pipeline in the future.
The BioScience organization also continues to enhance its focus on specific disease areas centered on core areas of
expertise in hematology, immunology, and through technology platforms like gene therapy and biosimilars. It's for this
reason that we elected to divest the Commercial Vaccines business, including the NeisVac-C and FSME vaccines, and
during the third quarter, announced a definitive agreement with Pfizer. We're working to close this transaction in the
fourth quarter and continue to explore strategic options, including the potential for partnering or divesting the R&D
development programs focused on influenza and Lyme disease.
In addition, we have also achieved an array of significant pipeline milestones, including the FDA approval of
HYQVIA, a transformational subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with primary immunodeficiency. HYQVIA is
the first subcutaneous immune globulin treatment approved with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion per
month and one injection site per infusion to deliver a full therapeutic dose, while maintaining the same efficacy, safety
and tolerability profile as currently marketed products.
Today, many patients receive IV infusions in a doctor's office or infusion center, and current subcutaneous treatments
require weekly or biweekly treatment with multiple infusion sites per treatment. We expect to launch HYQVIA in the
United States next week, and are evaluating regulatory requirements and initiation of additional clinical trials for new
indications. As a reminder, the global market for primary immunodeficiency is approximately $2 billion, and only
approximately 35% of patients are treated subcutaneously, providing the unique opportunity for HYQVIA as a

differentiated therapy.
In addition, in August, Baxter released positive top-line results from the Phase III pivotal clinical trial of BAX 855, an
extended half-life recombinant factor VIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. BAX 855 met its primary
end point in the control and prevention of bleeding, routine prophylaxis and perioperative management for patients who
are 12 years or older, with patients in a twice weekly prophylaxis arm experiencing a 95% reduction in median
annualized bleeding rates as compared to those in the on-demand arm.
In addition, BAX 855 was also effective in treating bleeding episodes, 96% of which were controlled with one or two
infusions, and approximately 40% of patients were bleed-free. No patients developed inhibitors to BAX 855 and no
treatment-related serious adverse events, including hypersensitivity, were reported. Our continuation and pediatric
studies are progressing, and we're planning to submit a biologics license application to the FDA before the end of 2014.
Also, during the quarter, Baxter received FDA approval of RIXUBIS for routine prophylactic treatment, control and
prevention of bleeding episodes, and perioperative management in children with hemophilia B. We launched RIXUBIS
in the U.S. late last year for the adult population and are very pleased with its market acceptance. Our application for
adults and pediatric patients is currently under review in the European Union, and we expect a regulatory decision later
this year.
Within the Medical Products business, recent highlights include an exclusive agreement with Rockwell Medical to
commercialize their leading hemodialysis concentrate product line in the United States and in select overseas markets.
Hemodialysis concentrates help to clean the patient's blood, and remove waste and extra fluid from the body. This
agreement enhances Baxter's comprehensive range of therapeutic options across home, in-center and hospital settings
for patients with end-stage renal disease. And finally, we recently announced the expansion plans at our state of the art
manufacturing facility in Opelika, Alabama to help address the growing global demand for dialyzers. Baxter will invest
nearly $300 million in the Opelika site, and we expect to begin commercial production in 2016, augmenting several
other recent capacity expansions for dialyzers across our footprint.
In addition to delivering solid financial results and accelerating innovation, the organization is fully engaged in the
process of separating Baxter into two leading global healthcare companies, one focused on developing and marketing
innovative biopharmaceuticals, and the other on life-saving medical products. During the quarter, as you know, we
formally unveiled Baxalta Incorporated as the name of the new publicly traded biopharmaceutical company. The name
Baxalta celebrates and sustains our heritage as an innovator and legacy of leadership by incorporating the Baxter name
and coupling it with alta, which derives from altus, which is Latin for high or profound.
Upon completion of the separation, Baxalta, Inc. will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BXLT,
and Baxter International will continue trading under the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BAX. While the
corporate headquarters of both companies will be located in Northern Illinois, we recently announced that Baxalta is
forming a new global innovation and research and development center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This will position
the new company to optimize R&D productivity, accelerate innovation by building on its robust pipeline in core areas
of expertise, strengthen and increase R&D collaborations with partners in new and emerging biotech areas, and
enhance patient care globally.
As many of you know, we've now named our senior leadership teams for both companies, and have established the
international and commercial structures for both organizations. We validated several senior leaders into new roles, and
have complemented our strong commercial and operational teams with some new talent, including experienced
professionals from leading biotech pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Many of you have also asked about
appointments within Investor Relations, and today, I'm pleased to announce that Mary Kay Ledone, after a 26-year
career at Baxter, will become Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations for Baxalta upon completion of the spin.
In the interim, Mary Kay will continue in her current role and will be responsible for the ongoing Investor Relations
efforts at Baxter.
In conjunction with Mary Kay's appointment, I'm pleased to announce that Scott Bohaboy, a senior level finance
executive with eight years of experience at our company, will become Baxter's Vice President of Investor Relations and

Treasurer. During his tenure, Scott has held several senior finance roles with Baxter, including in corporate planning,
the U.S. hospital business, our Asia Pacific region, and he currently serves as Vice President, Finance, for our
international operations. Scott also has previous experience in Investor Relations at two other companies earlier in his
career. In addition, Clare Trachtman, who many of you already know, will be named Vice President of Investor
Relations for Baxter and will report directly to Scott. Both Scott and Clare will continue in their current roles for the
near future, and will work closely with Mary Kay and her IR team as we transition into two separate companies in mid
2015.
In closing, Baxter has an established history of executing successful spinoffs, and we believe this separation provides
two unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders. Our decision underscores our commitment to
ensuring our long-term strategic priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest, while we seek to improve our
competitive position and performance, enhance operational, commercial, and scientific effectiveness, and create
long-term value for patients, healthcare providers and other key stakeholders.
As always, I'd be happy to address any questions you may have with regards to the spinoff or other topics during the
Q&A, and so with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob Hombach. Bob, please?
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone.
As Bob mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter advanced 9% to $1.35, which exceeded our
previously issued guidance range of $1.28 to $1.32 per share. This performance reflects strong sales growth as well as
continued investments in research and development, unplanned gains from equity investments totaling $0.03 per
diluted share which will be reinvested in the business, and adjusted income from discontinued operations of $26 million
or $0.04 per diluted share.
As we mentioned in the press release, GAAP earnings of $0.86 per diluted share includes income from discontinued
operations of $21 million or $0.04 per diluted share and after-tax special items totaling $273 million or $0.49 per
diluted share, primarily for intangible amortization and costs associated with upfront product development and
milestone payments, integration of the company's acquisition of Gambro AB, and Baxter's planned separation.
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2014. Please note
that with a few exceptions, for purposes of today's discussion I will focus my comments on the adjusted P&L line items
as seen on page 10 of the press release, which shows the reconciliation of adjusted and GAAP earnings and reflects the
Vaccine franchise as a discontinued operation. For reference, we disclosed historical financial information for the
Vaccines franchise last week and have also posted the schedules to the Investor Relations page of Baxter's website.
Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4.2 billion advanced 13% on both a reported and constant
currency basis. Excluding Gambro from both periods, Baxter sales rose 5% on a reported basis or 6% on a constant
currency basis, reflecting an acceleration of organic growth versus the first half of the year. You may recall that our
sales guidance for the quarter included vaccine revenues, which were expected to decline given the receipt of lower
milestone payments versus last year. When including vaccine revenues, Baxter's global sales grew 5% on a constant
currency basis, which is at the high end of our previously issued guidance range.
Sales in the U.S. increased 7%. And international sales, excluding Gambro and foreign currency, also increased 7%.
Sales from emerging markets, which now represent almost 25% of total Baxter sales, advanced nearly 20% given very
strong performance in the BRIC markets, driven by the timing of tenders.
In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales totaled approximately $1.7 billion and advanced
8% on both a reported and constant currency basis. And despite a difficult comparison to the U.S. BioTherapeutics
franchise, BioScience recorded the highest quarterly growth in almost two years.

Within the product categories, Hemophilia sales of $942 million increased 11% on both a reported and constant
currency basis. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit ADVATE growth, which continues to be driven
by strong global demand, as well as benefits from recent tender wins in the UK and Australia and conversion to
RECOMBINATE therapy in Brazil, where to date we have converted approximately 40% of the estimated 10,000
hemophilia A patients, and continue to expect to generate sales of more than $100 million in 2014. In the U.S.,
ADVATE growth was high single digits, supported by continued conversion to prophylactic treatment and very
minimal loss of share to a new competitive entrant.
We are also benefiting from the launch of new products and indications. RIXUBIS, our treatment for hemophilia B
patients, was launched in the U.S. late last year, and we continue to be pleased with its uptake. Our Hemophilia
performance also reflects robust demand and double-digit growth in FEIBA for the treatment of hemophilia patients
with inhibitors. As you may recall, only 15% to 20% of inhibitor patients globally are treated prophylactically. And
with approvals of this new indication across multiple large geographies like the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Japan, we
expect this to represent a significant growth opportunity for our hemophilia franchise over the long term.
In BioTherapeutics, sales of $546 million improved sequentially due to enhanced product availability, and we continue
to see robust demand and stable market growth for our immunoglobulin and albumin therapies globally. Sales growth
for this product category was 3% in the quarter on a reported basis and grew 4% on a constant currency basis. As
mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected an acceleration in international growth this quarter, as we're building
on our position in many foothold markets. And we also expected growth in the U.S. to moderate due to tough
comparisons created by supply availability and the easing of constraints beginning in the third quarter last year.
In addition, we are being prudent in managing our global supply and inventory levels as we prepare for the upcoming
HYQVIA launch, which is expected next week. And given the renewal of albumin licenses in China, we are once again
optimizing our geographic mix with albumin shipments into that large and growing market.
In BioSurgery, sales totaled $185 million and increased 7%. On a constant currency basis, sales rose 6%, driven by
increased penetration for surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL.
In Medical Products, global sales of more than $2.5 billion increased 17% on a reported basis and were up 18% on a
constant currency basis. Excluding Gambro, Medical Product sales grew 4% on both a reported and constant currency
basis.
Within the product categories, Renal sales were approximately $1.1 billion, which includes a contribution from
Gambro of $391 million. Recall that we closed the Gambro acquisition in September last year and recorded sales of
$100 million. Excluding Gambro from both periods, Renal sales of $664 million increased 3% or 4% on a constant
currency basis, strong global PD growth of 7%, somewhat offset by the impact of the CRRT divestiture.
As mentioned last quarter, PD patient gains remained strong, particularly in the U.S., where PD sales increased 12% for
the quarter and 13% year to date. Given this very strong demand, we are experiencing back orders and are expediting
shipments, as we remain committed to ensuring patients have uninterrupted access to their therapy. We continue to
produce PD solutions at maximum capacity, are working to expand capacity to meet the growing demand, and are
beginning to source product from our facility in Castlebar, Ireland through the much appreciated support of the FDA,
which granted a temporary import license.
Going forward, we will continue to work with customers to carefully manage inventory and maintain continuity of care
for our patients. We are very appreciative of the close collaboration and great support we received from the agency in
this regard. Going forward, we will continue to work with customers to carefully manage inventory and maintain
continuity of care.
Within the Fluid Systems category, sales of $827 million increased 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant
currency basis. Performance is driven by favorable demand and pricing for IV therapies. As you may know, to date we
have not experienced any new competition for cyclophosphamide, and we're updating our guidance for this new
assumption. For your reference, sales of U.S. cyclophosphamide in the third quarter were approximately $120 million
and were lower than the prior year, and sales on a year-to-date basis now total $345 million.

Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $386
million, reflecting an increase of 4%. Sales rose 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by mid-single-digit
growth of our anesthesia portfolio, where we are increasing international penetration, and low single-digit growth for
nutritional therapies.
Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $256 million and increased 5%
on a reported basis or 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance can be attributed primarily to strong pharmacy
compounding revenues.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 50.5% compared to 52.7% last year. Positive mix from
franchises within BioScience was primarily offset by the impact of foreign exchange and Gambro, which collectively
reduced the rate by approximately 130 basis points. In addition, the gross margin was impacted by product mix within
Medical Products, expedited freight for PD solutions, and lower than expected production volumes as we continued to
make investments to enhance our quality systems, processes, and operational excellence to meet evolving regulatory
requirements.
SG&A totaled $921 million and increased 13%, with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the
growth. Excluding Gambro, SG&A increased 2%, as leverage was derived from benefits associated with our business
optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by select investments in promotional and marketing initiatives for new
product launches in BioScience, and incremental customer freight and logistical expenses to support the strong demand
for IV solutions.
R&D spending in the quarter of $292 million increased 16% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro, R&D rose 8%,
driven by the addition of new R&D programs in BioScience through acquisitions; the acceleration of other programs in
the areas of hematology, oncology and immunology; and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient
outcomes across the continuum of care.
The operating margin in the quarter of 21.6% is lower than last year's operating margin of 23.8%. Excluding Gambro,
the operating margin was 23.4%, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange and incremental investments referenced
earlier.
Interest expense was $31 million in the third quarter compared to $45 million last year. As expected, we benefited from
debt maturities and a favorable change related to the mix of floating versus fixed interest rates. Other income totaled
$39 million, and was driven primarily by the favorable foreign exchange impact at balance sheet positions, and
approximately $20 million or $0.03 per diluted share in unplanned equity gains related to investments in the Baxter
Ventures fund. The tax rate was 21.8% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. And as previously mentioned,
adjusted earnings per diluted share advanced 9% to $1.35.
Turning to cash flow on a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $2.1 billion. DSO ended
the quarter at 55.9 days. And excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 53 days, lower than the prior year by more than
two days. Inventory turns of 2.2 are modestly higher than the comparable period. And lastly, to date, we repurchased
approximately 7 million shares for $500 million, or on a net basis 1.5 million shares for $200 million.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our updated financial outlook. For the full year, we
expect adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $4.86 to $4.89 per diluted share. After adding the expected
earnings contribution from the vaccine franchise of approximately $0.27 per diluted share, this guidance is in line with
our previously issued and disclosed range of $5.10 to $5.20 per diluted share.
In addition, we have updated our assumptions for cyclophosphamide, and do not expect any new competition before
the end of the year. While this has resulted in a transitory benefit, it is offsetting incremental headwinds associated with
foreign currency in the fourth quarter, of approximately $0.04 per diluted share, and other investments to enhance
quality and operational effectiveness in the Medical Products business, and additional investments in SG&A and R&D
in BioScience.

Specifically, by line item of the P&L, and starting with sales, we now expect sales growth, excluding the impact of
foreign currency, of approximately 11% to 12%, which includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At
current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 10% to 11%. Excluding Gambro, we
expect Baxter's organic sales to grow approximately 4% on a constant currency basis.
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins for the company of approximately 50.5%, this compares to the
prior year gross margin of 51.7%. In terms of expenses, we now expect R&D and SG&A to grow in low to mid-teens
for the full year. We expect interest expense to total approximately $150 million and other income to total
approximately $90 million for the full year.
We expect a tax rate of approximately 22%, slightly higher than our original expectations, as the Vaccines franchise
carry a very low tax rate. And we expect a full-year average share count of approximately 547 million shares, which
assumes approximately 300 million in net share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5
billion, which excludes the cash costs associated with the spin-off of the biopharmaceuticals business. We now expect
capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, which excludes pre-spin capital expenditures, primarily in the area
of information technologies.
Let me move to sales and expand on our assumptions for the two businesses in the major product categories. Beginning
with Medical Products, on a constant currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro, we now expect sales
growth of approximately 15%; and excluding Gambro, we expect sales from Medical Products to grow approximately
3%.
Specifically, we continue to expect Renal sales to grow approximately 40%. We now expect Fluid Systems sales to
grow approximately 4%, as we assume no material impact from cyclophosphamide competition this year. We continue
to expect Specialty Pharmaceuticals sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in
the 3% to 5% range. And we expect our BioPharma Solutions sales to be flat for the full year.
For BioScience, we are once again raising our guidance and now project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, of
approximately 6%. Our outlook includes strong growth in our global Hemophilia franchise of approximately 8%,
fueled by underlying global demand for ADVATE, conversion to RECOMBINATE therapy in Brazil, new tender wins,
and continued benefits from new product launches, including RIXUBIS and FEIBA prophylaxis.
For the BioTherapeutics franchise, we continue to expect growth of approximately 4%, driven by increased demand
and the contribution from the HYQVIA launch. And finally, for our BioSurgery business, we continue to expect growth
in the low- to mid-single digits.
As mentioned in our press release, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share from continuing
operations, excluding special items, of $1.30 to $1.33. We expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign
currency of approximately 3%, and we expect reported sales to be flat to the prior year.
Before I open up the call for Q&A, let me take a moment to update you on some of the financial aspects of the spin.
First, we expect to file our initial Form 10 for Baxalta before the end of this year, which will include historical financial
results, on a GAAP basis, for the years 2010 through 2013 and year-to-date results for 2014. These financial statements
will be prepared, as if on a standalone basis, and derived from Baxter's consolidated financials, and will include
allocations of various costs previously held at Baxter corporate level.
I would highlight that these financial statements are inherently limited, as costs associated with corporate overhead,
income taxes, support services and interest expense, may not be indicative of future costs associated with running
Baxalta as an independent standalone corporation.
We expect to file amendments to the Form 10 in 2015, which will include 2014 and year-to-date 2015 financial results
for Baxalta, in addition to pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of expected debt and interest expense, and other
associated agreements and transactions.

As we previously disclosed, we're in the process of designing the two new organizations, and at this point our rough
estimate of initial dis-synergies, including stranded cost is approximately 2% of total Baxter sales or more than $300
million. About half of these costs would be incurred beginning in the second half of 2015, and both companies will
have the opportunity to reduce a meaningful portion of these costs over the next several years post-spin.
In addition, spin-related costs incurred in the first half of 2015, will be considered special items, and will be excluded
from our adjusted earnings. Also, as we continue to work through the details of our IP ownership and manufacturing
footprint, we have not uncovered any substantial issues from a tax perspective. While we will be finalizing the capital
allocation strategies of each of the businesses in the coming months, we expect that both will have strong balance
sheets; generate significant cash flow; and have the flexibility to follow a disciplined capital allocation approach, which
balances reinvestment in the business and CapEx, R&D and M&A; with returning value to shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases.
We look forward to sharing more information with you, as we get closer to completing the spin. While we continue to
work through the complexities, this process is unfolding in line with our expectations, and we continue on track toward
a mid-2015 completion. This assumes the Form 10 registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, and final
approvals have been obtained including from our Board of Directors.
As we proceed towards the separation date, we plan to host an investor conference in the second quarter of 2015 to
introduce you to the new senior management teams, and provide investors with more information regarding the
strategies, growth prospects, and financial outlooks for each company.
We recognize that investors and analysts would like more information to help them model both companies separately,
and the intent of the conference is to help you establish a baseline as each company will have a different financial
profile after the separation. We will also engage in a comprehensive investor relations effort, including investor road
shows for both companies with our respective senior management teams, several weeks before the spin-off is
completed.
Thanks, and now, I'd like to open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded, and a digital
replay will be available on the Baxter International's website for 30 days, at www.baxter.com. Our first question comes
from David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - David H. Roman>: I wanted to start with the Hemophilia franchise, and just taking a step back for a second. The
last time you provided your long range plan, I think you had talked about Hemophilia as a 3% to 4% grower, and you
had caveated in there the potential for new competition, which we're now starting to see. Can you maybe just help us
put into context the year-to-date growth that you've seen? And the 8% guidance that you provided, how much of that is
a reflection of some benefits you're seeing this year, versus the potential to see a sustainably higher growth rate in that
franchise than what you had initially targeted?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: I'll make a couple of comments, and then maybe I'll turn it over to Ludwig, to give you
some more perspective on the dynamics we see in the hemophilia market. The guidance we gave several years ago was
over a five-year period and 3% to 4% growth. Clearly, pre-competition, we expected to grow faster than that, and then
with the impact of competition, it would moderate over the timeframe.
Clearly, we've had a very strong 2014 to date, and given how things have played out, as we've discussed previously, the
overall competitive landscape has played out largely, as we expected, if not slightly better, in terms of what others have
been able to achieve with on-label indication for an enhanced extended half-life product. And so I think, going forward,
we have the opportunity to certainly achieve that, if not potentially exceed that long-term guidance. But maybe, I'll turn

it over to Ludwig to add some color here on market dynamics.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Thanks for the question, David. So at this moment, we're not changing our five-year sales
CAGR of the 3% to 4%. But as Bob was saying, there is a probability for us to go beyond these numbers. The numbers
that I gave you or that we gave you a couple of years ago, clearly were probabilized for R&D milestones. As we are
hitting our R&D milestones, it means that the likelihood that we're going to overachieve those numbers is greater. And
we do expect that in addition to ADVATE and continued pharma growth and continued growth in emerging growth
countries that our new product launches, such as RIXUBIS, [ph] Urbisur (35:20), BAX 855, a recombinant [ph] of
ObiVant, (35:22) will have an impact here on the five-year plan.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay, and then maybe just a follow-up on the emerging markets more broadly. The 20%
FX-neutral number that you gave, I know you said there's strength in BRIC and timing of tenders, so maybe you'd just
help us frame up those markets a little bit more broadly? We've seen some disruption across the healthcare landscape
there the past several quarters. How confident are you on being able to sustain, call it a mid-teens type growth rate, in
those franchises on a go-forward basis?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, the big one for us is clearly Brazil. I think, we have a strong plan in place. The
strategy is there. As Bob was saying, we've converted 4,000 out of the 10,000 hemophilia A patients so far. Just to
remind you, this was a plasma market. In addition to that, it was an on-demand market. So, we're moving from plasma
to recombinant. In addition to that, we're moving a lot of those patients from on-demand to pro fee. So, we feel pretty
good with the strategy that we have in Brazil, so this is our biggest one.
But in addition to that, we have opportunities in China where we launched. In addition to that, we got approval for
ADVATE in Russia, as well as in Turkey, where we're launching. And outside of these emerging growth markets,
clearly, the UK tender as well as the Australian tender will continue to help us, moving forward.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: And, David, across the entire business between Medical Products and BioScience, as we
said, Medical Products, about 25% of sales already in emerging markets, very strong presence. And with the Renal
franchise in the broader portfolio, great opportunity to continue to grow there. BioScience has only penetrated about
15% of sales in emerging markets, and that's really the opportunity here to continue to accelerate growth, as Ludwig
has laid out. So, we feel very good about our positioning in emerging markets and the ability to sustain double-digit
growth going forward.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Got it, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. There have been a lot of new job promotions and opportunities for people in
the room, so congratulations to all involved, but just two quick questions. The first one, Bob Hombach, for next year,
and I appreciate you gave us some good details, relates to the step-up cost and – but I wonder if you could help us
understand a couple things. Is there any sense of what the impact of FX could be for 2015, given that cyclo competition
has not happened yet this year, how you're thinking about cyclo for next year, or any other important dynamics we
should be thinking about for 2015 numbers? And then, when are we actually going to hear, from an investment
perspective, in January, Bob? And a quick follow-up.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Sure. So, starting with FX, clearly, very volatile timeframe here, just within the last couple
of weeks. As we indicated, we expect an incremental headwind of about $0.04 here in the fourth quarter, and given
where rates have been throughout the course of the year, where there was a timeframe where things looked like they
might be getting slightly better.
I think, the fourth quarter I think, would be fairly indicative of what we're likely to see, if rates stay where they're at
today on a run-rate basis. So, we're probably in the $0.15 to $0.20 range of a headwind, if rates stay where they're at

today for 2015. But again, a lot of volatility here, and we'll see where things are at as we get to January and give
guidance.
For cyclophosphamide, we continue with a very robust competitive intelligence effort to understand where things are
at. Again, we know there are seven or eight players who are awaiting approval. We continue to hear that it's likely to be
in the not too distant future. But again, the specificity around that just isn't great. So I think as you get to January, we'll
have a better sense. But again, we framed it as a $0.50 contributor to profit for Baxter. And over time we expect
numerous entrants and the vast majority of that to go away, with a likely pretty significant impact in 2015. But at this
point, no further clarity that we've got to give.
And as it relates to what you're going to hear in January, we continue to work through a number of things here. But I
think key assumptions like sales guidance, I think we'll be in very good position, as we always do, to give sales
guidance for the franchises and the two businesses. And in the process of doing that, I think we'll make very clear what
our assumptions are on key value drivers like the Hemophilia franchise, like cyclophosphamide, which will clearly
have a very meaningful impact. We'll also be able give you a sense of FX and pension and so on. So while it may be a
challenge to give a full P&L at the level of detail we normally do for the full year given the midyear split, I think we'll
be able to give you a lot of information to give you a good sense of where the profitability trends are heading for each
of the two businesses. But very clearly, we'll be able to give you sales guidance.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, very helpful, and maybe a quick one for Bob Parkinson. Bob, one of the key catalysts
that's coming out as we think about the Baxter business, the Medical Products business for next year and the year after
is this dynamic of cost opportunity and some of the things you may be able to get after. It's not clear to us whether
there's a true cost opportunity, like an SG&A opportunity in Medical Products or the opportunity you see as more from
portfolio reshaping, which could be very positive for gross margins over time. So I think this is shaping up as a key
investment debate. So maybe help us understand. How do you see the cost opportunity broadly defined at Medical
Products?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Sure, David. So obviously, as we get closer to the spin, we'll be in a position to be
actually quite specific in terms of what are the elements that we believe are going to drive earnings for new a new
BAX, if you will, at a I believe meaningfully faster rate than top line revenue growth. Cost structure is very much part
of that. But let me just take a minute maybe to comment on the other aspects or the other dimensions that we believe
can drive margin improvement over time.
First and foremost, we've been very specific in terms of the future synergies associated with Gambro, both the margin
drop-through on commercial synergies as well as cost structure synergies, which I will tell you were tracking very well
through 2014. And that's a material improvement over time, which will make a large contribution to the earnings
growth of new Baxter, if you will, going forward.
Focus on mix shift of products, so the relaunch of SIGMA, if you will, with the recent approval provides a great
opportunity to recapture margin. I think I commented on this specifically on the last quarterly call. But that's a big
opportunity to regain market share in the infusion pump business, intensifying focus in areas that continue to be
undeveloped markets on a global basis, like BioSurgery, like parenteral nutrition, and then of course, the anesthesia
franchise. So there's a mix shift effect, toward higher growth, higher margin products, which also will contribute to
accelerated bottom line growth.
Portfolio, you mentioned that in your question, David, is also a big part of it. And I will tell you we will be very
aggressive in evaluating the existing portfolio, not only from a business and a product line point of view, but from a
geographic point of view. There may be businesses that we want to stay in, in certain markets but exit in other markets.
And obviously, to do that will provide fuel for adding to that portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and so on.
And then cost structure clearly is an element. I think once we are able to split up the two new companies, and we
through that process obviously integrate all the corporate support functions in the two businesses and get a better line of
sight, I will tell you I think there's significant opportunity to fundamentally take out cost structure.

And then lastly, new product introductions like, VIVIA, like [ph] Prismax (43:24), our next-generation CRRT system,
second-generation infusion pump platform. So that frames the various dimensions that will contribute to margin
enhancement and growth, again, at a faster rate than revenue. And as we get closer to the spin, we'll be in a position to
be much more specific, including the aspect of cost structure on all those elements. Okay?
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions, a couple of follow-ups. Just to
drill down a little bit into Hemophilia, U.S. versus OUS, you obviously have very strong worldwide number and driven
by Brazil. But in the U.S., just to understand how you're looking at the rest of the year, I guess what are you assuming
in terms of the ADVATE launch? I haven't seen much competition yet, but are you still dialing in pressure in the back
half? That would be helpful color, and one more follow-up.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, thanks for the question, Matt. First of all, we continue to expect solid growth across
the Hemophilia franchise, both on the U.S. side as well as the international side. As far as the ADVATE U.S. market
share is concerned, we gave you guidance that we expect a decline of high single digits in between the Biogen launch
and the 855 launch. So 855 continues to be on track. You have seen the Phase III data. We continue to move towards a
BLA submission before the end of this year.
And as you saw, our Q3 sales data in the U.S. for ADVATE remains strong. We grew at 8%. And year to date, we have
a net patient gain versus previous year, and this is on top of our continued prophy conversions. So we believe that since
ELOCTATE's approval about four months ago, we have seen very minimal share loss. And we're also aware that
several patients switched back to ADVATE over the last weeks. And we realize that this data is still early, but so far it's
aligned with our expectations.
<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: And then one more, same subject. We talked about this before, there in our checks, I
guess, in conversations, indicate increasing interest in fine-tuning the dosing for patients in line with your PK analysis
and data that you put out a couple of years ago. The MY PK FIT reaching the U.S., can you walk through maybe the
timeline and how much of a factor is that going to be as you look at the competitive landscape over the next year?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, so one of our strategies is to continue to strengthen the ADVATE label. So as you
know, we just launched the Baxa 3 device. MY PK FIT is another opportunity for us to strengthen the label. We got
approval in Europe. We are launching in selected countries as we speak. For U.S., this is under regulatory review. It's a
510(k) submission. The impact of that will be very limited this year. This will be more a 2015 event.
<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Great, thanks. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yes, we can, Bob. Go ahead.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Great, thanks. Just to follow up on that ADVATE comment about anecdotally hearing that
some patients are switching back, can you just develop that a little bit more? What are the circumstances behind that?
What's happened that they switched back? And then, I was just wondering, if you could comment if your guidance that
you gave last call, that you don't expect ADVATE share loss in the U.S. of more than single digits, if that still holds,
given what you're seeing?

<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes. As I mentioned, so thanks for the question, Bob. As I mentioned, we expect that the
ADVATE U.S. market share will decline high-single digits between the ELOCTATE launch and the 855 launch; so to
be more specific on the 855 launch, so submission before the end of this year. So 855 hitting the market by the end of
next year, so that's the timeframe. Yes, we have anecdotes, we know of several patients who switched back for different
reasons. I'm not going to talk more about why those patients switched back, but we're really pleased with the fact that
ADVATE is the gold standard, and remains the gold standard in hemophilia A.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: So, no change – but no change to that guidance then?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: No change in the guidance.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Okay. And then last question for me, just very quickly back on the U.S. plasma side. I
know you walked through the U.S. result this quarter pretty thoroughly, but I'm just wondering, was that number for the
U.S. business, about as you expected or was that a little bit weaker?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, I think the most important thing here, is that our U.S. demand for IG remains strong,
and is growing with the markets, which is double digit. So, that is the critical piece here. And as Bob was talking about,
we had a major event last year, as well as we are gearing up for the HYQVIA launch, we want to make sure that there's
space in the inventory for HYQVIA, which we'll be shipping next week.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And Bob, the major event that Ludwig is referring to, is the fact that we were able to
enhance our capacity situation, and in Q3 began shipments at an increased level. So, we had a difficult comp here in the
third quarter.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Great, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Thank you, just a couple follow-ups to some of the earlier questions. So one, will we see the
full data set on 855 at ASH? Do you know if that's going to make it?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: We have submitted to ASH the design. And now, we are submitting as a late-breaking
news, so we don't have a full yes yet. So, we'll keep you posted. Having said that, I think we have disclosed the most
critical information on the 855 study, with all of you. And again, to repeat what the key messages were, first of all, we
had great control of bleeding, 95% of the bleeds were reduced, 40% of the patients were bleed-free, no inhibitors, no
cases of a hypersensitivity. And with the PK profile, extension of 40% to 50% versus ADVATE. So, these were the key
messages. But we'll keep you posted, if it will be an ASH event.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Okay. And really quick, while I've got you here, on 826, can you just give us an update on
when you think you'll be into humans with that?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Our objective is by the end of next year that we will be in human studies.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Okay. I want to clarify just the commentary, Bob Hombach, on 2015 and expectations or
said expectations around guidance. So, in January, you'll guide for revenues and you'll give some other items, but you
won't actually give EPS guidance for 2015, is that correct?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: We certainly will for the first half of the year. But for the full year, it becomes very tricky
with the midyear separation. At the investor conference in early Q2, would be the timeframe I think, where we'd lay out
the full-year picture in more detail for both companies.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: And that first half guidance, you're saying you will exclude the dis-synergies that you'll start
to incur in the first half, you'll actually back those out?

<A - Robert J. Hombach>: We do expect that to be fairly minor, because we'll time the adding the resources that
create the duplicative corporate overhead, as and when we need to, in order to be prepared and appropriately prepared
on July 1. So, there will be some cost there, but we don't expect that, that aspect of it will be overly significant. But we
will call that out separately, yes.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Okay. Last question for you, and then I'll drop. You reiterated your cash flow guidance for
the year. But I was looking at the cash flow statement, it looks like you're about down 2% for the year. Your guidance
is $3.5 billion, which is close to up 10%. So, is that you're confident in the big fourth quarter in your cash flows?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, as we look at things, working capital was a bit below, a bigger drain on cash flow
here in the third quarter than last year, receivables and payables in particular. Some of that just have to do with timing
of a strong sales quarter and when that occurred and when we're likely to collect that. So, yes, there is a big fourth
quarter here, driven primarily by the timing on some of these working capital items.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Lawrence Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Circle back on HYQVIA, and I just wanted to get some further thoughts on the ability to
line up the patients, the caregivers and the payers, as you launch that product, as well as see if you're willing to talk at
all about price. And then, for Bob Parkinson, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the environment that you're
seeing, both in the U.S. and overseas in the Med Products business. JNJ obviously indicated that there was some slight
improvements in utilization. I just wanted to see what you guys are seeing.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So, with respect to HYQVIA, we're really pleased with the approval, and we're gearing up
as was mentioned. We're planning to ship product next week, and that's on target. When our goal for HYQVIA is to be
the preferred and leading subcu treatment for PID, and that should be supported by its differentiation. And we plan to
extend HYQVIA into neurological indications in the coming years, so beyond PID.
At this moment, there is a broad market awareness. There's high interest from physicians, patients on HYQVIA, and we
are expecting accelerated sales in Q4. With respect to pricing, we're introducing HYQVIA to the PBMs and the payers
as we speak. Our pricing strategy is consistent with HYQVIA's differentiated and unique value, which is to provide a
subcu IG treatment, that can be administered once a month, at doses equivalent to that of IVIG. So, with respect to the
price consistent with Europe, we will be launching at a price premium.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: And can you say how much that might be?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No. At this point, Larry, until we get things finalized, and get some traction in the
marketplace, I think it's premature to talk about that.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Larry, Bob Parkinson here. In terms of hospital utilization, I did see JNJ's comments.
I guess our view would be, pretty much in line with that. Clearly, hospital activity in developed markets around the
world, is not as dormant as it was a year ago. So, I would say, there's a slight improvement there, but falling far short of
being robust. I think, I would distinguish that, however, from the emerging markets. And while the general economies
of emerging markets have been softer than anticipated, in terms of dollars spent on healthcare, these markets continue
to dedicate more of their national budgets to healthcare.
So you've got so many therapies and procedures that previously, there was no access or limited access in undeveloped
markets. So we do see more robust growth underlying demand in emerging markets.
<Q - Lawrence Keusch>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get a little bit better sense of exactly
where some of the investment spending is taking place, and to what extent, just talking through I guess, the underlying
net income growth of the company if you were to take out the Gambro accretion for this year. Because it looks like
next year, just adding up some of the things that you had referenced, with $0.50 for cyclo, you've got the separation
added dis-synergy cost, FX, I assume pension may actually be a headwind next year. It just seems that next year is
shaping up to be a challenging year and potentially kind of more of a decline in overall performance.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yes, so a couple...
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: I'm trying to get a sense for the underlying business.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Sure. Sure. Well, again, I think we're pleased with the strong organic top-line growth of
the underlying business that we've seen across some of the key franchises here and good strong momentum there that
we expect that to carry forward into next year. As we look at some of these high leverage variables, it's a little difficult
sitting here in October to have a clear sense of where some of these are going to go. As we mentioned, cyclo, the longer
this goes, the more likely it is that it's not just one, but multiple players will get approval in fairly short order, which
means that the market dynamic could change pretty dramatically and the impact could be accelerated.
So again, we've – we're looking at $0.50. We don't have a sense of how much of that would impact 2015 at this point,
but that would be a very high leverage variable depending on when that occurs. As I mentioned earlier, FX at current
rates would be about a $0.15 to $0.20 headwind incrementally, but again, a lot of volatility there. Pension, interest rates
have moved dramatically in the last two or three weeks. That has certainly become more of a potential headwind. As
we gauged it previously, every 25 basis point change in the discount rate amounts to about a $20 million impact to the
P&L.
So we've seen about a 75 basis point move here relative to where it was last year. There are other factors that play into
that, including asset returns and so on, so that's not necessarily a one for one. But thinking about that at the moment in
the $50 million to $60 million potential headwind at this point at current interest rates would be where we will be at, at
the moment.
So stripping a lot of that out, and if you look at Baxter today ex-FX in 2014, we're talking about operating income
growth in high single digits here, so I think the operating performance has been very good. We are consciously making
incremental investments, though, in SG&A to support multiple new product launches in BioScience that have already
occurred and could occur going forward. We have ramped up R&D expense a bit as well through some of the business
development activity that we've done within Bio. That will continue into 2015 as well. We did talk about some of the
operational challenges, largely driven by very strong demand in PD and ID solutions as well that are causing us some
incremental headwinds here, and some of that is likely to continue into next year.
I would gauge that in the fourth quarter, as approximately a $0.03 headwind or around $20 million to $25 million of
incremental impact that we're likely to see operationally within Medical Products. So a lot of moving pieces here and a
lot of volatility around a few of these factors. So again, a bit early to look at the picture for 2015, but I think the
underlying business is actually performing pretty well.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: What is the underlying business ex the contribution from BAX – from Gambro from an
earnings perspective?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, We've talked about a 4% top line growth with some leverage in the P&L. So I
would gauge it in the mid to high single digits.

<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just in terms of the costs, you guys had mentioned with business
optimization costs, but also spending on quality. How should we just think about the quality spend? And can you just
remind me if you have any outstanding FDA warning letters or notable 483s?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, Kristen, Bob Parkinson. Maybe let me take that because most of that activity
would be in the new BAX domain. One of the challenges that we're managing through right now is a combination of
one hand expanding capacity on both IVs and PD. We're experiencing unprecedented growth on PD in the United
States and pretty robust demand for IVs, while concurrently managing through some existing warning letters and
ensuring that we continue to enhance our production standards. I mean, we're focusing on areas like particulate,
container integrity, in some of these areas that as we expand capacity, we have to make sure that we maintain the focus
on these other quality issues, particularly in facilities that are older, and facilities, and most notably, North Carolina,
where we have an outstanding warning letter.
So we want to balance expansion of capacity on one hand, yet be very vigilant to ensure that we have acceptable – meet
acceptable quality standards. And that's really the area that we're investing in. So we've added head count there,
investment in terms of process modifications and so on, while we're also expanding capacity. In fact, we're bringing on
a new line in Northcove to produce more PD solutions to assist us in managing through some of the short-term product
shortages that we have that hopefully, we'll be able to manage through that through, I would say, the first quarter of
2015. But we are sensitive to the existing warning letters and make sure we can bring those to a close at a time when
we're expanding capacity.
I will tell you, we have very constructive dialogue going with the agency. We actually had a regulatory meeting with
them last week to talk about how we balance achieving systemic – or systematic improvements, really, in quality and
ensure that the supply issue is addressed. You may recall, it was a year ago, the U.S. market was in very short supply
on IV solutions. And here we are approaching flu season, and we read about Ebola and all these other things, so the
agency is very sensitive, as they should be, as are we, to supply. It's why we were encouraged that they stepped in and
provided the kind of support they did to approve PD product to be manufactured in Castlebar, Ireland to ship to the
U.S. to help address our issues.
So those are the things we're balancing, and Bob kind of quantified the financial impact of that. That will continue for a
while, but I think at a certain point, we will certainly manage down those costs and get back to a more normalized
level. Okay?
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Thank you.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: We have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks for taking my question. Ludwig, there's just a general anxiousness about the pace of
change in the hemophilia A treatment optionality as it were. The Chugai molecule, the biospecific antibody mimics, the
cofactor behavior factor VIII, could be subcu, could be relatively long lasting, good in inhibitor patients, and relatively
low immunogenicity. Could you just comment on molecules such as this and your long-term positioning of the
company and give some assurance that Baxter has the options covered, as it were?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, so thanks for the question, Bruce. We believe that we have a solid short-term and
long-term strategy for our hemophilia franchise. As you know, we are building breadth and depth in our hemophilia
portfolio. And I think it's also fair to say that we're doing better at hitting the R&D milestones.
We continue to monitor the competitive landscape, and we are aware of the technologies that you were mentioning.
The Chugai opportunity, the company is still in early clinical development, and the clinical data is limited. As a matter
of fact, one of our exploratory programs is in subcu technology. And a couple of years ago, we moved the subcu

treatment into the clinic. However, we had to stop the program because of a lack of efficacy.
To go back to our strategy, we believe we have a strong strategy. First of all, we continue to strengthen the ADVATE
label. We talked about MY PK FIT as well as Baxa 3. We have strong Phase III data for 855, which we will be
submitting by the end of this year. We plan to bring 826 as well as our gene therapy program for hemophilia A into the
clinic in the next 12 to 18 months. And all of these are programs that we have. So 855, 826, and gene therapy we
believe are programs that are both proof of concepts.
When you think about the ultimate goal of hemophilia treatment, it is to have sustainable high level of factor expression
without peaks and troughs because you would induce – you would see traumatic or spontaneous bleeds. And that
protection should be there irrespective of the patient's activity level. And we believe that gene therapy could be a true
game changer. And with respect to progress in this technology, we're really pleased with our early clinical data in our
hemophilia B program. We see factor-level expression in our patients that is sustained over a longer period of time.
And as I mentioned, we're planning to bring this to the clinic in about a year from now.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: And, Bob, my follow-up pertains to the U.S. dialyzer opportunity. There was a press release
this quarter about enhancing your manufacturing capability. Could you just scale that opportunity for us because I
know Baxter is a little light on the share side? How big is it? Is it something that should be considered as a major
initiative for the new Baxter?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Bruce, Bob Parkinson here. So clearly, expansion of dialyzer capacity is one of
multiple drivers to the renal growth long term. As I think you know, even before the acquisition, Gambro was
constrained on capacity on dialyzers. Our share on dialyzers today is I'll just say disproportionately low. So I think
there's a significant opportunity there long term. We're encouraged by the recent performance of the Gambro business.
In the third quarter, our sales were up mid-single digits, and we're starting to I think get focused and aligned after the
integration.
So that will represent a step function in growth when that capacity comes on in 2016. But in the meantime, we've done
some other things with third-party suppliers and so on, which will allow us to increase the supply. So right now, the
demand is exceeding our ability to supply. We have some smaller interim expansions that should help that out in the
short term, but it won't be as material until the Opelika capacity comes on. So that's a significant opportunity and a
significant driver of long-term renal growth, Bruce.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: And how big is the U.S. market for dialyzers? I'm sorry.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: In terms of – in dollars?
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Yes.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: So just to frame the Gambro business as we acquired it, dialyzers represented about $500
million in sales for Gambro on a global basis, but as Bob mentioned, very under-represented in the U.S. market. And
through this Opelika expansion and the others that Bob mentioned, we expect that over three to four years to increase
capacity by 50%. And so as we grow into that capacity, this represents an opportunity to grow share, grow 50% off the
$500 million base that we've got in the coming years, so a fairly meaningful opportunity here. But clearly, given the
very low monitor placements that Gambro had historically in the U.S. and overall capacity constraints, again, a very,
very small player in the market at the moment.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Mary Kay can get back to you, Bruce, with the exact specific answer to your
question. I don't know for the U.S. market. The reality is the production at Opelika will source global markets, not just
the U.S. And the largest opportunity is outside the U.S. for a number of reasons, including obviously the concentration
with Fresenius given their centers that they run and where they utilize their own dialyzers. And so that's a major
segment of the U.S. market that largely is off the table even when we get expanded capacity. So this is really more of a
global opportunity, but we'll get back to you with the specifics on that.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much.

<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And our last question, please.
Operator
Our last question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi, good morning, guys, two questions, one for Ludwig and one for Bob Parkinson. Ludwig,
outside the U.S., the hemophilia franchise did very well, and you called out Brazil and you called out some tenders. I'm
curious about the tenders, and I think that those tenders are UK and Australia. When you start on a new tender, is there
a channel fill? And are the sales you see there one time, or is this demand sustainable at current levels into the fourth
quarter and next year? And is there a way you can quantify what the tenders gave you in the third quarter?
And then for Bob Parkinson, some of the companies that have reported so far have talked about some softness in
Europe. I'm wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing on the supply side of the business in Europe. Thank
you.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Glenn, it's Bob Hombach. Let me answer the financial aspects of the tenders, and maybe
Ludwig can make some comments about our somewhat unique positioning, particularly in Australia. So the UK and
Australia represent very good opportunity for us. We had very low share in the UK from the last tender, and we're
completely out of the Australian market. And so what I would frame these as about $50 million in incremental sales
opportunity combined between the two. We'll realize about $20 million of that $50 million here in the back half of
2014, less than $10 million contribution in the third quarter, ramping up a bit in the fourth. And the other $30 million of
that $50 million we'll get in 2015 as we get up to scale.
But I guess the one thing I would add about Australia is our preferred position there in the tender gives us an
opportunity to perhaps get disproportionate share of the overall Australian market, which may allow us to go a bit
above the $50 million overall benefit that I mentioned.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Glenn, repeat your question on the supply side, Europe. I wasn't sure what you were
getting at there. If you could, just maybe rephrase that.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: So if you look at some of the companies that have reported so far this week, they've talked
about some softness in Europe. So I was wondering what you're seeing, if you can provide any commentary in Europe.
I know in 3Q, you're always going to see some softness due to seasonality, but I wonder if there is anything from an
economic point of view that – or whatever you're seeing that would create any softness in Europe at this point.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, well, I commented earlier on just hospital activity of
developed markets versus emerging markets and distinguishing the two. I would say Europe, clearly, Western Europe
clearly is the softest area globally, and I think to a large degree, that is directly correlated with the general economic
condition, Glenn. So we see less – we see less robust demand in Europe, for example, than we would – than we do in
the United States. And I would project that given the broader macroeconomic environment, that's likely to continue. So
it's really about market share to drive growth and so on as opposed to depending upon robust underlying hospital
activity, if you will.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yes.
