In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on
our website at abbott.com.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.55 ahead of our
previous guidance range, strong performance across our businesses as well as gross margin and operating margin
expansion, expense controls and a lower tax rate enabled us to deliver strong double-digit ongoing earnings per share
growth, despite the impact of a supplier recall in International Nutrition.
We also announced this morning a 57% increase in Abbott's dividend, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term
growth of the company and our commitment to increasing shareholder returns. This declaration increases our quarterly
dividend to $0.22 per share from $0.14 a share effective with the dividend to be paid in February of 2014.
Reviewing the results of the quarter in more detail, total company sales increased 4.3% operationally, but excluding the
sales disruption in International Nutrition, sales would've increased approximately 6%.
Sales growth in International Nutrition was affected by a supplier recall initiated in early August in China and two
other markets for certain pediatric nutritional products. While there were no health issues associated with the recalled
products and the supplier subsequently determined the products had been safe for consumption, the recall created
significant disruption in these markets.
As a result, International Pediatric Nutrition sales were significantly lower than our previous expectations in the
quarter. We anticipate that it will take time to work through the impact of this supplier recall and expect lower sales
growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first half of 2014.
We initiated additional marketing investments in the third quarter in these markets as part of our recovery plans. The
long-term fundamentals of this business haven't changed. Demand for both Adult and Pediatric Nutrition is strong, and
we remain optimistic about our growth prospects. Excluding the impact of this disruption, International Pediatric
Nutrition sales would've increased in the strong double-digits.
Reviewing the results of our other businesses in the quarter, performance was in line with or ahead of expectations.
Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth and Medical Devices delivered nearly 4% growth, with double-digit growth
in Medical Optics. We again saw a strong growth in emerging markets and also began to see better performance in
developed markets.
Total company sales in developed markets increased in the low single-digits, which was ahead of our expectations and
a sequential improvement over the second quarter. Abbott's leading market share positions and the introduction of new
technologies are driving profitable growth in these markets.
Diagnostics, one of our most durable growth businesses, increased more than 6% in developed markets with
double-digit growth in Point of Care and strong growth in U.S. Core Laboratory Diagnostics, driven by several large
customer account wins.
Medical Optics also contributed to our improvement in developed markets. Growth of our cataract business has
accelerated over the last three quarters, driven by new product launches, including the TECNIS Toric in the U.S. and
TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan.

Total company emerging market sales in the quarter increased 8% operationally, driven by double-digit growth in each
of our three diagnostics businesses, as well as high single-digit growth in Medical Devices. Excluding the sales
disruption in International Nutrition, emerging market sales in our Nutrition business would've increased in the high
teens.
In Established Pharmaceuticals this quarter, sales increased modestly, while recent macroeconomic and market
pressures in certain emerging markets resulted in somewhat slower sales growth this quarter. Growth rates in emerging
markets have been and are expected to continue to be higher than the growth rates of the developed world and the
overall global economy.
Established Pharmaceuticals remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long-term growth in emerging
markets; a rising middle-class, improving access to healthcare and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for
high-quality brands. Emerging markets are projected to drive 70% of the global pharmaceutical growth over the next
several years and the majority of that growth will be from branded generics.
In addition to sales outperformance in several businesses, we delivered strong gross margins and operating margins.
Adjusted gross margin was nearly 56% in the quarter, ahead of our expectations, with strong execution in both
Diagnostics and Nutrition. Adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, a 210 basis point improvement over third quarter last
year. We've sequentially improved adjusted operating margin each quarter of this year, as we remain focused on
improving gross margins and reducing G&A expense. In the third quarter, we increased marketing investment in our
Nutrition business to support recovery from the supplier recall, while we reduced G&A expenses in other areas.
And as I mentioned earlier, this morning we announced a 57% increase in Abbott's quarterly dividend. As we've
indicated since early in the year, over the course of our first year post-separation, we've continued to assess capital
allocation for the company. We've now completed that assessment, and this announcement reflects Abbott's
commitment to providing immediate and significant returns to shareholders in the form of dividends.
A strong and increasing dividend has always been important to Abbott. We're recognized as an S&P dividend
aristocrat, having consistently increased the dividend for each of the last 41 years. We've built the company to continue
to deliver sustainable earnings growth and our investment identity continues to be one of growth, with now an
increased commitment of returning cash to shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss third quarter results in more detail. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. Before I go through our results for the quarter, I'd like to summarize at a high level the major changes
from the expectations we had when we provided guidance back in July. As Miles indicated in his remarks, the
disruption in our International Nutrition business that occurred in the third quarter had a meaningful impact on that
business in the quarter. As a result of this event, sales in our International Nutrition business were around $90 million
lower than our previous expectations.
In addition, we decided to make additional marketing investments in the quarter to accelerate recovery. Combination of
lower sales and higher spending related to this event negatively impacted our ongoing earnings per share by around
$0.05. This was offset in the quarter by better-than-expected gross margin performance, reductions in G&A expenses
and a lower tax rate. This resulted in ongoing EPS of $0.55, which represents a 31% growth over 2012 and exceeded
the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.03 per share.
Turning to the details for the third quarter; sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis, that is excluding an
unfavorable 2.3% impact from foreign exchange. The sales disruption in our International Nutrition business is
estimated to have reduced Abbott's worldwide sales growth by nearly 2%, so sales would have increased around 6%
without this event. Emerging market sales were up more than 8% in the quarter on an operational basis, and would have
increased more than 12% on an operational basis without the disruption.

Sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses, including operational
sales growth of more than 10% in Diagnostics and nearly 12% in Medical Optics, along with an improvement in total
company sales growth in developed markets. Reported sales, which include the impact of exchange, increased 2% in
the quarter.
The third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, ahead of our previous guidance and up 70 basis points
over the prior year, despite the impact of exchange, reflecting strong underlying performance. Foreign exchange
negatively impacted the gross margin ratio by almost 150 basis points in the quarter, somewhat more than our previous
expectations.
In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was approximately 6.5% of sales, in line with previous expectations. Ongoing
SG&A expense was also in line with previous expectations, reflecting additional marketing investments in our
International Nutrition business, offset by G&A expense reduction. Overall, our adjusted operating margin ratio
improved 210 basis points in the quarter over the prior year.
Our year-to-date ongoing tax rate through the third quarter was 19%, lower than the forecast we provided on the second
quarter call. This 19% rate also reflects our expectations for the full-year 2013. The revision to this lower tax rate for
the full year resulted in a tax rate of 15.7% for the third quarter.
Turning to the outlook for the full-year 2013; today, we're confirming our ongoing full-year earnings per share
guidance range of $1.98 to $2.04, reflecting double-digit growth. We're forecasting operational sales growth, that is
excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the low to mid single-digits for the full-year 2013. Based on current
exchange rates, we'd expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on full-year reported sales. This would
result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55.5% of sales, ongoing R&D at
around 6.5% of sales, and ongoing SG&A expense of somewhat more than 30% of sales. We also forecast the full-year
net interest expense of approximately $100 million, non-operating income of around $50 million and around $40
million of expense on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L. Finally, as previously indicated, we forecast the full-year
ongoing tax rate of 19%.
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2013; operational sales growth is expected to be in the low to mid
single-digits, which includes the impact of the Nutrition disruption. At current exchange rates, we'd expect roughly 3%
negative impact from exchange. We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter of
approximately 55.5% of sales. We also forecast an ongoing tax rate of 19% for the fourth quarter, inline with the
year-to-date rate. And lastly, similar to the third quarter, we expect the recent sales disruption in our International
Nutrition business to impact our ongoing earnings per share by approximately $0.05 in the fourth quarter, which is
factored into our forecast.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for the operating highlights and growth outlooks by business.
Brian Yoor
Thanks, Tom. This morning, I'll provide an overview of third quarter performance and our outlook for the fourth
quarter. My comments will focus on operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
I'll first discuss Nutrition, where global sales increased more than 3% in the third quarter. The sales disruption in
International Nutrition is estimated to have reduced global nutritional operational sales growth by approximately $90
million. Global Pediatric Nutrition sales grew 2.7% in the quarter, including International Pediatric sales growth of 3%.
Excluding the sales disruption, International Pediatric Nutrition continues to drive strong growth as it launches new
product innovations and executes on geographic expansion initiatives.
U.S. pediatric sales were up 2%. Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula
markets and continues to drive uptake of recent innovation launches including Similac Total Comfort, a first-switch

formula that addresses a broad range of mild tolerance symptoms.
Global Adult Nutrition sales increased 4.4% operationally in the quarter. International Adult sales grew 7.5% overall
and double-digits in the emerging markets, driven by product innovations in our Ensure product line and execution of
market expansion initiatives. U.S. Adult Nutrition sales were up 1%, negatively impacted by the exit from certain
non-core business lines, as part of our margin improvement initiative. Excluding the impact of these exits, U.S. Adult
sales would have grown mid-single-digits.
As previously discussed, we will continue to see the impact of the sales disruption on International Nutrition growth in
the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2014 as we continue to work towards recovery. So for the fourth quarter, we
expect our global Nutrition business to grow low single-digits on an operational basis.
Moving on the Diagnostics, which delivered another quarter of strong growth with sales increasing 10.5%. Core
Laboratory Diagnostics' operational sales increased 9% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and
internationally. International sales grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.
U.S. sales increased 15%, driven mainly by a number of new key account wins as large health systems continue to
choose Abbott's integrated and flexible solutions to manage the testing volumes and to increase operational
efficiencies.
We also continue to broaden and differentiate our industry-leading assay menu and expect to launch new tests in the
area of diabetes, cancer and cardiac care. Most recently, preliminary clinical trial results suggest that Abbott's High
Sensitive Troponin test on ARCHITECT may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with heart
attack symptoms.
In Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 16% in the third quarter. International sales growth of 24% was
led by continued strong infectious disease growth and geographic expansion in emerging markets including the benefit
from tender wins in Brazil, Russia and Africa as well as continued growth of companion diagnostics.
In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 17%, driven by continued growth in the U.S. hospital and
physician office lab segments as well as strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. For the fourth quarter, we are
forecasting our global Diagnostics business segment to generate high single-digit operational sales growth.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals business, sales in the quarter increased modestly. Sales growth in key emerging
markets was 2.3%. We continue to focus on implementing tailored strategies to accelerate growth in emerging markets
that are projected to remain attractive for branded generic pharmaceuticals over the long term. In the fourth quarter, we
continue to expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our Established Pharmaceuticals business.
And lastly Medical Devices, which includes our vascular, diabetes care and vision care businesses. Sales growth in
Medical Devices increased 4% in the quarter. In our vascular business, worldwide sales increased 2.5%. Sales growth
continued to improve sequentially over the second quarter inline with our expectations.
International sales increased nearly 3%, driven by continued momentum in key geographies of our next-generation
drug eluting stent XIENCE Xpedition and our bioresorbable vascular scaffold Absorb. This includes continued share
gains in Europe as well as Japan, where we launched XIENCE Xpedition in August, following a successful launch of
the XIENCE PRIME small vessel drug eluting stent earlier in the year. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for treating
mitral regurgitation also contributed to international growth in the quarter.
U.S. sales increased nearly 2%. While the drug eluting stent market declined in the quarter, we have continued to gain
share over the course of the year with the U.S. launch of XIENCE Xpedition. Mid single-digit growth in our global
endovascular business also contributed to vascular performance in the quarter.
In August, Abbott completed its acquisition of IDEV Technologies, which expands our endovascular portfolio by
adding the SUPERA stent. SUPERA is available in Europe and is under review by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of
blockages in the superficial femoral artery or the SFA. This unique technology provides Abbott an opportunity to
further penetrate the largest and the fastest growing SFA segment of the global peripheral market. For the fourth
quarter of 2013, we expect our global vascular business to increase in the low single-digits on an operational basis.

In diabetes care, global sales in the third quarter increased 1%. International sales, which comprise 60% of total
diabetes sales, increased nearly 9% in the quarter, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in the emerging
markets.
As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare
patients. We project fourth quarter diabetes care sales growth to be down low single-digits on an operational basis,
reflecting the impact of CMS competitive bidding in the U.S., partially offset by strong growth internationally.
In vision care, we exceeded our previous expectations by delivering nearly 12% growth in the third quarter. Cataract
sales, which represent more than 60% of our global vision care sales, increased double-digits well outpacing the
market. Strong cataract growth was driven by the uptake of new products, including TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan and
TECNIS Toric in the U.S. Both products provide Abbott with access to large and growing segments of the cataract
market, where Abbott wasn't previously competing, with Toric lenses representing the fastest growing category in the
premium segment.
Strong double-digit growth in key emerging markets also contributed to performance this quarter. In August, Abbott
completed its acquisition of OptiMedica, which provides Abbott with a state-of-the-art laser system and immediate
access to the rapidly developing laser cataract surgery market; this allows Abbott to have broader reach in the growing
cataract market. For the fourth quarter in our global vision care business, we expect another quarter of double-digit
operational sales growth, driven by continued strong performance of our cataract business.
In summary, while sales and earnings were affected by disruption in our International Nutrition business, we delivered
strong performance across our businesses and improved operating in gross margins. Excluding the impact of the
supplier recall in Nutrition, total company sales growth was balanced across both developed and emerging markets,
with continued sequential sales growth improvement in developed markets and continued double-digit growth in
emerging markets. We improved gross margin by 70 basis points and expanded operating margin by 210 basis points in
the third quarter.
And finally, we announced a 57% increase in our quarterly dividend, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term
growth of the company and our commitment to increasing shareholder returns.
We will now open the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks. First off, I thought you did a good job of covering all the issues in the
nutritionals business and the impact of Fonterra. I think that's pretty straightforward. Let me start with the dividend,
because obviously, it's a very significant increase. You've meaningfully changed the profile of Abbott's payout and the
ongoing payout ratio for the company. My question, Tom, is the mix of the company's cash flows, because as
everybody knows, Abbott, post the spin, is generating 70% of its sales outside the U.S. Can you talk about the ability to
fund the dividend long-term given your mix of sales and cash flows as you look out? And do you need to repatriate
profits in order to sustain that longer-term? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, I think we're in really good shape for that, Mike. I mean, as you know, we have
very strong cash flow as a company on a normalized basis, this year probably approaching the $4 billion range. And
we've been in a very good position to-date to cover our cash needs between the various geographies; and as we go
forward, I think we're in a good position to do that with this dividend payout. And, obviously, that's part of the plan. I
think over time, as the company grows and we fund growth wherever it is, debt levels might gradually increase over
time, but we're in very good shape to fund this dividend increase.

Page 7 of 19
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And so, when the board, I guess, contemplated what the right mix was going
forward of dividend and buybacks and acquisitions, maybe Miles can give us a little insight into how you came up with
this payout ratio and what's the thought process on the right mix with the company on capital allocation?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. Well, Mike, if I take you back to the fourth quarter of last year when we split the
companies and we aligned cash flows and debt and so forth with dividend payout. Everything kind of aligned in a
proportional way with the cash flow generating capability of the two companies. And you recall at the time, AbbVie
announced a disproportionately higher dividend, we had a disproportionately lower dividend and payout ratio than we
had as a combined company historically.
And we thought that was appropriate for a pharma business like AbbVie's and the question we had at the time, because
we were actually not trying to be dividend-neutral between the two companies, the combined dividend as you'll recall
went up a little bit. Not a lot, but a little bit, and we wanted to kind of stabilize and see what cash flows going forward
were, because as we looked at the investment identity of remaining or new Abbott, it was unclear to us exactly where to
kind of put the dividend. Not only from the strength of our performance, but just in general, what the peer group and/or
investors would expect.
Over the course of the year, we got a fair amount of feedback and we had a chance to look at that, and we've concluded
that it was so essential to the overall identity of the company that the combination of growth and income was important
to our investment base. And that income piece was actually, probably a little more important than we had placed it at
that time, which I acknowledged to investors over the course of the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters of
this year.
So, in terms of looking at the expectation of it, I acknowledged to investors during the year we'd look at it, we'd look at
the capital allocation. As Tom already indicated, it's not a strain on cash flows or a strain on capital allocation. We're a
healthy cash generator. And, frankly, I think we're going to continue to be a healthy cash generator going forward,
because we're seeing great progress in the margin initiatives we have, both on the gross margin line and on the G&A
line. And I think there's still a lot of opportunity there for us to improve margins and improve cash flows as we grow.
So as we looked at that, we said making sure we live to that historic identity of a combination of growth and income
was important and we came to the conclusion that at the payout ratio we began the year, we weren't quite where we
needed to be or wanted to be on the income side. So, we chose to take it to where we believe that was at least relative to
a peer group, and there's probably several different peer groups investors would compare us to. But relative to the peer
groups we'd be compared to, we put ourselves in a position where we think we're a pretty competitive, if not attractive,
combination of growth and income. And from a cash flow standpoint, it's completely achievable.
With regard to share buybacks or M&A activity or other things longer-term or, frankly, even debt pay down, we think
that the cash flows, just as they have been historically, are strong enough to accommodate all of that. So we made the
move.
And I think rather than tickle our way into it a little bit at a time, we just sort of concluded, let's just go where we think
it needs to be or would like to be and we'll just set it there and not do this incremental creep up over time. Our investors
ought to know what our identity is and what our payout is going to look like, and that's why we just chose to announce
it now and get it over with.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me just follow with one fundamental question, if I can, then I'll jump. If we
look at the quarter, outside of the whole issue with nutritionals, there's really kind of two things that stood out to me,
and one was the strength of the Diagnostics business. I don't think people would have expected your U.S. core
Immunoassay business to be up as much as it was.
And then on the downside, the EPD business, which continues to struggle, I think people were hoping that as you
anniversaried some of the price cuts from last year that that business would start to pick up in the second half, and
obviously it didn't. So, can you talk about what gets EPD going, and if the answer a quarter, a year from now, two years
from now is that maybe that just isn't as good is a business as we hoped, does that business remain part of the portfolio?
Thanks.

<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. That's an easy one. It absolutely remains part of the portfolio. Couple of things. Earlier
in the year, I acknowledged I think a couple of times on these phone calls that, what I saw as the bigger issue in EPD
for us was our own execution. And while we had bumped up against some of the volatility of emerging markets from
time-to-time, whether it was price pressure or whatever it might be, the fundamentals underlying that business in those
markets over time were strongly in our favor.
So the part that was more in our control that I was not as satisfied with was our own execution, and we've made a
number of changes in the last few quarters here on that in terms of the structure of our organization, some of the
management leading the organization. Frankly, the commercial strategies and a linkage between the breadth of our
product lines and the therapeutic categories of products in markets that we're marketing and promoting. It takes some
time for that execution to sink in and show some results. So, I would tell you, as much as I was self-critical of us early
in the year about our own execution, I would tell you today what I see coming out of the business is all inline with what
I'd want to see there.
I like what we're doing. I think we're doing the right things. But I think it's going to take probably several quarters here
before we see the impact on the top and bottom line. So from an anecdotal standpoint, what I see is all good. And I
think the team is doing exactly what it ought to be doing on the executional line for every one of its geographies. But
it's going to take some time to see it roll through. So, I haven't lost any confidence at all.
And I'd say, it's going to play out here. Has it been delayed relative to our initial expectations, either because of market
conditions or own execution? Yes. Do I expect it to be further delayed in terms of what the performance would be
going forward? No, I don't. I expect it'll take a few quarters for it to start to emerge and show up on the top and bottom
line, but I haven't lost any confidence at all in the business and its prospects for us going forward.
As an example, I would tell you in the early part of the year, we also saw depressed performance in our Device
businesses, and we took a number of actions beginning late last year in those businesses. And what we've seen this year
is every quarter, in particular the vascular business and the Medical Optics businesses, sequentially improving on the
top and bottom line and sequentially improving share. And we track share in these markets geographically as a real
measure of whether we're succeeding or not. And we've seen great evidence across the board here that we're increasing
share in these businesses, improving our positions, and that the actions take place.
So, I'm pretty confident that everything in these businesses is headed in the right direction. It's just going to take us a
couple of quarters to see it. I wouldn't have said that quite as strongly about EPD probably three quarters ago, but what
I see now I like. And I think you're going to see that in the top and bottom line coming forward.
Now back on Diagnostics, there's another story that's taken time to play out. I mean, that business keeps getting better
every quarter. And I don't think anybody expected double-digit sales growth on the top line. And yet its growth keeps
improving, its margins keep improving, it's ahead of its own plans and schedule in terms of operating and gross margin
improvement. It's ahead of anything that we've communicated to investors and you on the Street. And I think that
they've got a great pipeline of systems in development, all of which are on schedule to sequentially rollout in the next
few years.
So I think that sometimes, because we've got this quarterly orientation as public companies, we're impatient about how
quickly we want to see the impact, and it does take some quarters to see the impact. So, since I've seen it in
Diagnostics, I've seen it in vascular, I've seen it in Medical Optics, I've seen it in Nutrition, I've seen it in the
performance of our gross margin initiatives, I'm confident that EPD will be just fine and that it'll play out in the
commitments that we've made to you and forecasted that we think that business will do. I think it's fortunate – I mean I
think this quarter is a good example that we've had so much success with the margin initiatives, because, had it not
been for this supplier recall in Asia, we'd be spewing profit and sales growth this quarter. And I think you'd be
ridiculing our guidance. But the fact is, the issue with Fonterra in our Asian markets did set us back.
And yet we still were able to exceed expectations this quarter. We think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance
for the fourth quarter, because I think the recall is going to continue to impact us there for a while. You know, it was
about a $90 million hit this quarter. We're currently forecasting it to be about $100 million in the fourth quarter. And

yet we're going to maintain our guidance. And I think we would have been in a position here to be substantially raising
our guidance, but for that. So, the underlying fundamentals in all of these businesses, and I think EPD too, all look
good to me. You just can't see the visibility of the EPD performance yet, but we will.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with a margin question for
Tom. So the gross margin, I think I heard you say that there was 150 basis negative impact from FX in the third quarter,
Tom. Could you talk about when that goes away? And what the implications are looking forward to 2014? Then I just
had one product related question.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, we do expect, Larry, some of that to continue into the fourth quarter, probably at
somewhat lower level, probably closer to 100 basis points, since we're currently modeling it. This is an item that does
bounce around depending on the currency volatility.
Obviously, you know, revenues immediately impact margin and sometimes there is some timing differences on the cost
side, but this quarter did come in a little heavier than we thought and we overcame it quite nicely, we would expect
about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter. And then if rates would stabilize, hopefully next year will be a better year
relative to exchange on the margin and it'll be pure performance, but we'll have to see what volatility brings.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for that. And then on the product side, it would be great to get an update on the
progress of Absorb in Europe. And also the next steps from MitraClip in the U.S.? And I'll drop. Thanks.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Hi, Larry. This is Brian. Yeah, with Absorb, we're still continuing to see some sequential
improvement there. We had another nice quarter. It's starting to become a more meaningful portion of the portfolio. I
think we'll continue to see further increases from it in the fourth quarter, particularly as procedures pick up and more
adoption takes place. And also in Europe, just as we come out of the summer months, we tend to see procedures pick
up. So, Absorb is on track with our plans and continuing to make progress. Go ahead, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Larry, let me just insert one comment there before Brian moves on. We're representing a whole
portfolio of our stent products now across the board, including Absorb, particularly in Europe. And we're seeing
sequential share pickup, both versus last year and versus last quarter.
And I think that, as we forecasted in the past, what we've done to bring pricing into a tighter band across the products
and allow physicians and hospitals, let's say, easier substitution of which product they wish to use and we've got
Absorb, I think, priced in a better place now, we're seeing a pretty good share pickup. Actually, we're seeing it in
Western Europe. We're picking up share in Japan, although that's with the Xpedition, same in the U.S. So, we're seeing
good share pickup now across the board in all these markets. Europe gets the extra benefit of having Absorb and we're
definitely seeing the impact of it there.
<A - Brian Yoor>: And then with respect to MitraClip, Larry, I mean, again, a meaningful contributor to our
international sales growth. The status with respect to the U.S. is, we just still remain in conversations with the FDA and
we'll have to see where that lands. But we know that they talked to us about a decision by the end of the year and
nothing's really changed from that position with respect to MitraClip. And it's not factored into our guidance at all at
this point.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could come
back to the Diagnostics business a little bit. And I think, specifically, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a
number of big – or a few big contract wins. When I was down at AACC over the summer, one of the things that seemed
to be clear among lab managers with whom I spoke was a propensity for labs looking to do sort of one-stop shopping or
looking to buy across the portfolio, where you and Roche consistently sort of came up. Can you maybe just talk about
the dynamics in the lab market, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? And whether you're seeing the benefit of scale
play out at all?
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah. Hi. David, this is Brian. With respect to Diagnostics, it is one where it's more about the total
solution that you bring. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've had a lot of adoption from people who like the
flexibility and the scalability and the offering that we bring from end to end with respect to our tests, with respect to our
equipment.
We've had, to your point, some nice key account wins in the U.S., with takeaways from multiple competitors in the
core lab with respect to our core laboratory business. And recall, we put in place this enterprise approach to selling. We
started with the European markets. As we moved into the U.S. markets, we're definitely seeing that pay dividends in
terms of the approach there, in terms of selling the complete solutions that we're talking about.
So in the U.S., you saw the results in the quarter. That's largely attributed to these account wins. There was like five or
so major account wins that we had taken, which helps to build momentum. And it tends to be sticky over time as well,
when you're talking about these contracts, because they tend to be longer term in nature.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay.
<A - Brian Yoor>: If you look at Molecular, we have strong growth there. Again internationally infectious disease has
been our strength. We continue to penetrate there. We had strong double-digit growth in emerging markets having
some key tender wins in some key countries; Brazil, Russia, Africa. And most of our sales, again 60% of Molecular is
outside the U.S. and that's where we're really growing nicely. And the U.S. is more of that durable growth that we
continue to expect to see.
<Q - David H. Roman>: And then maybe just a follow-up on the overall top line outlook, both for this year and also
how you think about the business going forward. There's obviously been an evolution of your thinking throughout the
course of 2013. I think we started mid to high single-digit growth for the year and then mid to high single-digit growth
in the back half and now it sort of looks like where you are year-to-date is kind of where you're saying, things are going
to be for the balance of the year. And understandably, there've been some new factors like the Fonterra situation that
have emerged. So maybe if you could just talk about the top line growth profile both on a near and longer-term basis?
Is 4% the right baseline? And then how do you get back to that 5%, 6%, 7% type level?
<A - Miles D. White>: That's an easy one, David. We are right where we expected to be, but for the issue with
Nutrition in Asia in this quarter. Had that not happened, we'd be at 6% on the top line and there's a lot of ins and outs
there. I mean, I guess, first we should probably talk operationally, which would be the case. I mean, clearly, exchange
this year, I think for everybody has been a significant issue. But in any case exchange comes and goes. The underlying
operating strength of the business has ramped just as we had expected it would. It hasn't done it in every single business
the way we thought it would. EPD has been slower, Diagnostics and Devices have been faster, but what it boils down
to is, we'd be right where – in fact, we are, I mean, we are where we said we'd be on the bottom line. We're where we
said we'd be on the top line, but for the issue with Nutrition in Asia.
And I'd tell you that our plans haven't changed at all nor have our expectations. I wouldn't be setting a 4% top line
target. I'd be doing higher than that. And we haven't changed our expectations, because we don't see the underlying
factors any differently than we have before and we don't see our strategies any differently.

We're not changing our investment profile. We're not changing our geographic profile other than beyond what we told
you. So for us, it's all systems straight ahead and it's so far playing out exactly as we had hoped and expected. We're
getting very good gross margin improvement, very good G&A improvement, we've got a lot of room to go there. Our
pipelines are evolving very nicely in R&D. Our execution in EPD is progressing just as I have wanted it to. Our growth
in Nutrition is progressing as we've said and remains strong. Diagnostics particularly strong. The Device businesses all
improving and Medical Optics dramatically so.
So, I'd say, it all looks to me very strong. The one exception and it was a significant exception in this quarter, was the
Asian issue with Nutrition. And that's one, we'll just recover our way out of and we're not going to change our
intentions with China or any of the other countries. We're not changing anything about our strategies. It happened. It
wasn't of our making. We're dealing with it and we'll continue to deal with it. But our prospects and our expectations
haven't changed one bit.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. And then maybe just a last thing, I know there was some discussion earlier around use
of capital and the decision to raise the dividend. Maybe you just sort of frame up how you're thinking about M&A and
if that deals that you've been doing as of late is a good reflection of the type of acquisitions we should expect on a go
forward basis?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'd say a couple of things. And I go back to the bigger picture. The overall intent of the
company as we've described now for the better part of the year as a great combination of growth and income hasn't
changed. And we're in emerging markets for a reason, for the growth that they represent. We're broadly spread in those
emerging markets, so we're not over-indexed in one.
We're focused on our margin initiatives, et cetera, which is going to be an absolutely great improvement over time here
to lever the bottom line with that growth. It's going to generate increasing cash flow, so we have the cash to do the
things we want to do. So, I think all the working pieces are progressing as we would wish.
One of the things we saw in the quarter that I think is important for investors to note is that when the company hits
adversity, like any company, you expect your management to navigate that adversity and protect your investment.
Either protect that investment or improve upon it in some fashion. I think that what we saw here was even in the
absence of the pharma business, we spun off, the company and its management are capable of managing through
adversity and protecting the investors' investment in the company and still delivering the expectations on the bottom
line. And it hasn't knocked us off of our trajectory or intent.
Now to go more specifically to your question about cash allocation or capital allocation, on the M&A front, it remains
an opportunistic world. I would tell you that there's a lot of things that we have looked at and turned down, or decided
that they weren't economic to pursue. I would describe the deal market in terms of attractive opportunities right now as
limited and where there are businesses that might be available, I think some of that price expectations or value
expectations are frankly out of line with reason. And we're not poor buyers as you might know.
And I think also one of the things that's affected that M&A market, if you're a dollar-based company and you're looking
overseas, exchange is definitely affecting the valuations of companies. And I think when exchange is volatile and/or
moving as much is it did this year, it's prudent to wait. It's prudent to wait to see values align. And so in some cases,
we've looked at a lot of things. We're always vigilant, we're always paying attention. I can't say we're aggressively
hunting, but we're mindful of opportunities as they might fit our businesses or intentions, should we want to add to the
business.
So, I'd say we're opportunistically ready if it happens. We're not constrained from a financing standpoint, nor would
anything we might look at affect our capital allocation as it might relate to dividends or share buybacks. So, we've tried
to maintain a pretty healthy balance for our shareholders over time. Obviously, very steady dividend and share buyback
to return cash to our investors on a meaningful basis. And if we can enhance the growth prospects of the company with
something in M&A that fits what we're doing and fits our businesses or fits our overall governing strategy, then we take
a good hard look at it. But if the value is not there, we don't move.

And I'd say that in the past year here, there's only a couple of times when we've found that the value and the strategic
intent of the company have lined up. And on those occasions, both with IDEV and OptiMedica, we moved on it. But
other than that, I'd say we're cautiously surveying and not overly jumpy.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's very helpful perspective. Thanks, Miles.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Had a quick question, a follow-up on the gross margin. You
had 55.9% in the third quarter, so great gross margin and you're calling for about 55% in the fourth quarter. And I know
nutritionals are going to...
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Glenn, actually that's 55.5%, I think.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: 55.5%, sorry. I know nutritionals are going to weigh a little bit more, but are there fewer
offsets in the fourth quarter? So, Tom, I'm wondering if you can just give us the put and takes. Then, as a follow-up, is
55.5% a good number for the first half of next year given the nutritional issues, and then strength thereafter? Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. Glenn, we're not in a position to talk about 2014 right now. So, we get through this
year, and then obviously we'll talk about our guidance at the appropriate time.
<A - Miles D. White>: What Tom really means is we're not going to talk about 2014 even if we're able to.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. It's probably just some mix things between the divisions. I mean, every division is
showing nice progress. I wouldn't read too much into that slight change in outlook. And then, hopefully, if we continue
to execute the way we did in the third quarter, maybe we'll do a little bit better than that forecast. So, I wouldn't read
too much into it, and as Miles has indicated and we've said in our remarks many times, this driving gross margin
improvement over time is a major focus of the company. It has been for a number of years now, and as we go into
2014, we're obviously going to be pushing to drive that up. So, I think we'll be in good shape when we report in the
fourth quarter and nothing significant in terms of what that guidance means.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, can I just sneak in a quick one then? Absorb, I'm assuming Absorb is being priced at a
premium in Europe. You talked about certain ranges. Can you give us a sense of kind of what the premium ranges are
in Europe? Thanks.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Glenn. This is...
<A - Miles D. White>: We're trying to decide which one of us is going answer this question.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Glenn, I'll be glad. And we talked about this before, it really depends by market. I mean, certain
markets are going to demonstrate different premiums versus others, just where the baseline is. But I think it's really a
market-by-market segmentation in terms of how we compete with our portfolio of products. But it's meant, again, as
you know to be a workhorse type stent. And as Miles mentioned, it's part of the portfolio solution along with Xpedition
and the other things that we have out there, which is contributing to meaningful share gains. By market it'd be even – it
would be hard to just quote an overall number. But I don't know, Miles? Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. I'll just say a couple of things. As Miles talked about on the second quarter call, I
mean our goal on this pricing is that the price is not a barrier to use. And now that's kind of what supports the use of the
product as a workhorse stent. So, I'd say, as we look at it in any one market, it's a relatively modest premium and
certainly not a barrier to the use of the product.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Is the only barrier right now reimbursement in certain countries?

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: No, I just think it's a matter of not all lesions lend themselves to Absorb right now. And
it's a matter of physician training. Physicians need to become comfortable with it. Those that have used it quite a bit
find that they can apply it to a relatively high percentage of the lesion. So, those are really the two things that the
commercial team continues to work on in terms of increasing the uptake for the product.

<A - Brian Yoor>: You bet. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning. Good morning, Miles. Can you talk a little bit more about how the new EPD
management team is settling in? You touched on it a little bit. Maybe use some language like we're taking tailored steps
to drive better growth. Can you give us any more color on new team strategies or focus? Are they focused more on
execution or something else? We'd be very grateful for any perspective. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. Well, first of all, let me address the team. We've brought a number of new people to the
company from other companies and other places that have been a terrific addition in terms of their knowledge and
experience. The branded generic markets around the world are all a little different country by country. But that said,
they've got a lot in common from a similarity standpoint. They are not like proprietary pharma.
And among the things that we've found, at least in our own management and our own team as we separated the
company, we have a lot of people in positions that are very experienced with the proprietary pharma businesses, but not
so experienced with branded generic marketing, which is marketing a brand, marketing broad product lines, marketing
broad therapeutic categories, where a lot of your attention isn't to a given molecule, it's to a channel, to a pharmacy, to a
hospital, to a consumer in a lot of cases and often so, but it's about the breadth of offering the brands and so forth and
less about a patentable advantage. So, the marketing skills and the channel skills, the commercial skills around that are
different.
And we've made some changes in our marketing teams at the top. We've separated the developed markets from the
emerging markets, because, frankly, their business structures and characteristics are quite different. The channels in the
markets are quite different. The way the markets behave are different. Our emerging markets don't reimburse. The
developed markets do. So, there's very different points of call and points that drive the business.
And I'd say now, we've got our management team much more aligned with the differences of the various markets and
we've got our marketing teams better aligned with it. And frankly, then, it's a question of tailoring the particular
elements of a therapeutic category. There might be 10 or 12 different therapies in a category like gastrointestinal and
we want to make sure we've got the right mix for each given market. It could be different from country to country and
that alignment is taking us a little bit of time. But I'd say, we're in a much stronger position now knowing exactly what
the mix of products is we want by country, by therapeutic category, by channel, et cetera. And all of that working in
concert is just taking some time.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: That's very helpful. Turning to margins again, you clearly indicate you're seeing continued
improvements in Diagnostic and Nutritional margin. Am I understanding correctly that you're ahead of plan in
Diagnostics? And when I think maybe, Tom, when you talked about a 20% margin goal for Diagnostics and Nutrition
by 2015, is that now looking possibly conservative from a timing and/or magnitude perspective? And maybe you could
talk about the ramp up in the manufacturing distribution facilities and where we are in all that process, Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. I mean the division already has had quarters in that range. And they're not halting
their progress and their activity. And I think it's fair, you characterized it pretty fairly, Rick, that we certainly think
we're going to do better than that. And I think if you follow the results over the next couple of quarters, you're going to
see really, really good progress relative to that goal. So yes, is the situation in Diagnostics.

In Nutrition, obviously with the event, we're going to get a very temporary setback here until we recover. We still did
expand the margin in the quarter, but a little bit short obviously of what we were targeting before the event, because we
need to invest to recover. So, we get a little bit of a bump in the road there, but I think within a matter of a few months
we'll be rapidly back and continue to target that same high level of improvement in Nutrition that we've been talking
about for some time. So, Diagnostics, I'd say, ahead as you characterized it properly. And Nutrition, we should be right
back on track in relatively short order.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Tom, or for Miles, just a quick question on this particular recall and the
dynamics. In other larger recalls we've seen, and this is different in that it's not an Abbott quality issue, and the severity
of the impact is actually a little bit less. But you're actually assuming the recovery period is going to be quite similar.
So, can you help us understand the dynamics and whether this guidance kind of as it heads into our early next year
reflect any conservatism? And I wonder, just given the dynamics of this recall with other larger players in China, if this
actually presents a long-term share opportunity for the company?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I would say this. I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell us that exactly, because our
experience in the past – we've had experiences in the past with whether it's been a recall or some other event that's
impacted share. But what happens in the market is, mothers in China are acutely aware and acutely informed and same
with Vietnam, same with, frankly, I suppose, any market in the world. Mothers are acutely aware of what they feed
their babies and they follow infant formula and so forth closely. And with social media and other things, there's just an
awfully informed consumer base.
So when something happens that creates any kind of concern, whether it's rumor or otherwise, around infant formula, it
impacts mother's confidence in the product or the brand. And in this particular case, the fear that was created was
around botulism. And as it turned out, not to be valid and not to be true, it didn't turn out that there was a result that
way till weeks later. And we can take exception to why it took weeks and so forth, and we've had those conversations.
But in the meantime, the mother switches to another brand. When she switches to another brand, she doesn't have a lot
of incentive to switch back real fast. And it's like a lot of things, the media around the negative, meaning the fear of
contamination of some sort, is far greater and more intense than the media around, gee, it was a mistake. And so
consequently, we and other companies that were affected by this find it more difficult to switch the mothers back than
it is for them to have switched themselves in the first place.
So we try to model what the behavior of the consumer is going to be and how we might affect that behavior to get her
back. But it's frankly, just more difficult. So, we model it, and the end result is the same, whether it was a quality issue
from our company or a quality issue from another company or simply a rumor that wasn't a quality issue at all. At the
end of the day, if the mother is in any way lacking in confidence about a brand or a product, she switches to something
else and it takes some time to get her back.
So we have invested considerably in a number of things in marketing to rebuild consumer confidence in us, our
product, our brand, and to attempt to switch mothers back to us who were our consumers in the first place. You follow
that model and what eventually happens is, the baby moves off of infant formula to baby food and other things. And
you're starting with a new set of moms coming along who are at a stage where they're going to feed their infant
formula. And in effect, you end up replacing the consumer who was affected by the adversity with new consumers, and
it's about rebuilding the brand and the brand confidence.
So it takes time. It's not an instantaneous recovery and the damage tends to last a while as you cycle out the consumer
who has switched away and new consumers cycle in. And that's what keeps the pace of recovery more measured than
we otherwise might like it. The more immediate recovery depends on our ability to get that mother back. And that

depends very heavily on our customer relation management systems and so forth that we know who that consumer is,
that we can reach her through social media and other mechanisms. And unfortunately, we've had this experience a few
times, so we're getting better and better at it.
I don't know that we're at a point where we can very reliably forecast what that recovery looks like. I would tell you
that in the first weeks here after the event became or was – became known to we and the public, the initial drop-off was
significant and then there was a steady ramp of recovery. There was a major week-long holiday in China and
consumers loaded up prior to the holiday, because stores would be closed. That created a blip. And then, of course, it
drops off during the holiday. So, you've got a bump in the recovery rate. So, you look at the trends of the sales and it's
choppy because of buying patterns affected by holidays and other things.
I would say the underlying trend in performance is encouraging, but it's still going to be at a measured pace and I think
we're going to need some weeks, if not a couple of months here, of experience to see how our recovery is going,
because, frankly, in some markets we can only measure data monthly. Otherwise it's anecdotal.
In China, we can measure data weekly, but it's only segments of the market. So, we're getting partial data and a lot of
anecdotal evidence about what the magnitude of loss was and what the recapture rate or recovery rate is. And I'd say
we've seen some encouraging things, but we need more data and time here to trend it out. So, it's hard to forecast it out
very far.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, Miles, very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up question. If I think about your statements
about this nutritional business in the beginning of the year, obviously during the year we've had this recall issue that's
well understood. We've also had statements by the NDRC in China as well. If you think about structurally your
nutritional business over the next several years, do you still feel as confident in your ability to take share in China and
as confident in your ability to drive margins higher? Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, let me deal with the last one first. I'm not lacking any confidence at all about the margins.
I think that, first of all, it's a very good business and it's a very good business in China and other markets as well. So,
I'm not concerned about that. And the issue that occurred this summer for all manufacturers around pricing, I would
say, small bump in the road, dealt with. But the bigger issue here was this recall.
Now, has that changed our prospects or anything in the way we view China? China is a choppy market sometimes. I
think it's big, it's very attractive, it's clear the Chinese government has its own policies about Chinese companies and
what it would like to see as the evolution of its own economy and its own companies. And I think you see that across a
lot of businesses, a lot of different industries and so forth, not just infant nutrition or medical products and so forth.
That said, China is an attractive market. And it's attractive for us from a growth standpoint and from a share standpoint.
It's a very, very competitive market. It's competitive among multinationals and it's competitive with China-based
companies with whom we compete. So, I'd say it's an intensely competitive market. Share can move, share can change.
It tends to change the most when there's some adverse event. Otherwise, you're in a battle every day for share, much as
we would be in any consumer-like market around the world.
Our prospects and our expectations of China haven't changed. Our investment profile hasn't changed. We have built a
large plant in China. We intend to build more, and we will build more. I suppose it's rather convenient, but we've been
looking at our entire global sourcing and supply chain with regard to our Nutrition business and, owing to what we
believe are the growth prospects globally, China is part of that. This doesn't change it. In fact, if anything, it's pretty
convenient timing that we are considering our total global sourcing strategy at this time. And I'd say, if anything, this
helps us acutely focus on what the answers to that might be.
So, while China will from time-to-time, as any emerging market may be from time-to-time, be choppy; I'd say,
collectively, the emerging markets overall are pretty attractive opportunity. And as we've said before, you've got to be
in more than a few of them, so that you can balance and mitigate the adversity in any one of them in any given point in
time.

I can't recall a year when we didn't have some developing market have a problem, whether it was a devaluation or a
supply problem or something – or an exchange issue, whatever the case may be. There's always been a problem
somewhere, and there's been over-performance somewhere else.
I think collectively, the emerging markets represent an awful lot of growth and an awful lot of development. And to the
extent that you can balance a portfolio of businesses and geographies across them, there's a tremendous growth
opportunity there for companies to participate in.
If you over-index in any given place, like a China, then your trip is going to be a little rockier. And in our case, China's
a big opportunity, but all of our businesses have somewhere between 8 and 14 markets that they've targeted as primary
growth opportunities to balance that potential choppiness from time-to-time.
Unfortunately, the investor will read the media about any given one of them and I think that looks volatile to investors.
And if you were only in that country, it might be. But we're pretty well diversified across them. And this is a really
good example, this was a fairly significant hit. But we've been able to absorb it. I wouldn't want to have to absorb this
very often. But the point is with the diversity we have in product line, geographies, et cetera, we were able to absorb
this, navigate it and keep right ongoing. So, I'd say, that's a plus. I mean if you're going to participate in these kinds of
growth markets and access the growth that's there, then you've got to have enough breadth to manage that volatility
from time-to-time and we do.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just firstly on nutrition, what kind of confidence do you
have in some of those outer year revenue guidance ranges that you talked about in the $9 billion to $10 billion range for
2015? And does the recent impact of the recall in China impact that aspiration at all?
Secondly, do you think there could be any positive structural tax benefits for you going into 2014? Which is a closer
rate to think about? Is it more like 21%, more like 19%?
Then just on the buybacks, you made some helpful commentary. But could you just be a bit clearer? Would your
intention to be to actually reduce the net share count for the company? Or just to more or less offset employee stock
options?
And then, just lastly, consensus margins call for flat margins, basically between 2014 to 2016. Obviously, that's calling
for maturation of the margins and a topping out of the underlying efficiency gains. Would you be disappointed with flat
margins at the EBIT level between 2014 and 2016? Do you think you can do better? Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, you got all that done with one breath. Let me see if I can run back through all that.
Margins for starters, I haven't looked at what the consensus is across the analyst community. But I would tell you that it
depends an awful lot on what happens with exchange for starters and what happens in general in the economies of the
world. So I would say, as a company, we expect to improve our margins, and I have great confidence in that.
That said, actions taken from time-to-time either by governments on pricing or exchange or other things do affect
margins one way or the other. And that is less predictable for us, of course. But had we not had the progress we've had
in our own operational margin improvements and G&A margin improvements, we wouldn't have been able to absorb
those for our investors. And we have and still improved margin in spite of that. So I would tell you that as a baseline in
terms of margin improvement, I would expect us to continue to improve margin. What I can't predict for you is the
external factors that might impact it. Tax rate in 2014, Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. Just like all of the guidance-type questions, we'll cover that at the appropriate time
in the future. Obviously, as I indicated in my remarks, we expect this rate to continue through the fourth quarter and to

be our rate for the full year 2013 and we'll see how it trends as we go into 2014.
<A - Miles D. White>: You better be clear which rate you're talking about.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah.
<A - Miles D. White>: This quarter's rate is not a fourth quarter rate.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Right. The 19% rate that we have in the year-to-date third quarter and the 19% we predict
for the fourth quarter, 19% for the full year is how we're going to finish 2013, we believe. And we'll see how we trend
into 2014 as we finalize all our planning activities on 2014.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. We're careful, Jeffrey, not to give guidance in pieces. And I know that a lot of you want
to build models for 2014, but we don't talk in terms of payout ratio and dividends. We don't talk about some of these
elements, because everybody will be backing into some earnings estimate for next year, which we're not prepared to
talk about yet. I want to see how some of this trending is going to come in the fourth quarter. Our goal is always
double-digits. So that part is fairly straightforward. You could start there every year. But how the elements will come
together is still to be seen.
Now I've got to back up and remember the other early parts of your question. Growth in Nutrition over the long term
here. The goals in terms of revenue growth in Nutrition haven't changed. What I can't tell you is what this recall in
Southeast Asia will do at least in the near term. I think I know what it's going to do, and I think I know how we're going
to recover from it. And I think I can project that to some degree. But frankly, it was a setback. So, it's probably cost us
some time, but I wouldn't say it's going to cost us longer term the revenue we aspire to or the share we aspire to, et
cetera. It's just a question of time and the pace at which we can recover it.
So, I think there's kind of a finite magnitude of its impact on us and we then grow beyond it. So, I would say our
revenue aspirations haven't changed, whether we've got the timing just right or not? Unclear. What I want to be careful
about doing is giving you a specific number for 2015, because I don't know what that number ought to be exactly. So,
it's a little transitory that way. But in terms of general growth rate here and general trending, I'd say our aspirations for
the Nutrition business haven't changed. And then finally, you asked about buybacks. Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah. I mean, we've continued to be a company that buys back shares most years,
virtually every year. We've been pretty active this year, continued to buy back probably in the $1.5 billion range.
<A - Miles D. White>: The question was specifically, though, around whether we're just trying offset options in stock
comp versus share count and frankly at a bare minimum we do...
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah.
<A - Miles D. White>: ...the employee grants and so forth. And generally share count has gone down.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Right. So obviously, the baseline would be the dilution impacts, and we've been pretty
opportunistic to increase beyond that. And like the other questions, we'll see how we do in 2014, but we have a
substantial authorization in place, I think, over $2.6 billion remaining on that authorization. So, we have plenty of
room, we continue to buy back shares as we see appropriate.
<A - Miles D. White>: We don't like share count to go up. Actually, we like it to go down.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks, guys. That's really helpful.

<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Miles, I was just wondering if you could just give us an
update on your thinking within the medical product side, specifically within devices. A lot of companies within the
space have been talking more and more about the increased importance of being really deep and broad across product
lines. So, I'm just wondering, how you're feeling with the vascular business, and to what extent going forward you think
you need to be more broadly in cardiovascular to really be successful there? And then also, kind of your thoughts on
how to position the diabetes business, whether that might be another opportunity for you to expand as well?
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. First let me take the cardiovascular device business. We have a desire to be broader, I
suppose, like everybody else does. I think the timing in the categories you're broader in depends on your strategy. And
it depends on how you want to get there. So I would say, our acquisition of IDEV was in a category where we wanted
to be broader, no question about it. That was an attractive opportunity for us. We always have a pipeline of
opportunities that we're tracking, some of which we have equity investments in and participate either passively or
indirectly in and others more directly. So, I think it's kind of a question of when those opportunities ripen and when the
right time is to bring them into the portfolio, if we do that. I'd say, we're always looking to broaden the Device
businesses and we're always looking for innovation beyond our own.
That said, I think it depends on the timing. There's a lot of times in the Device business that companies will go out and
invest in a lot of things early. And it'll take four, five, six years for something to develop. We've made equity
investments early, but we tend to wait until we can see the whites its eyes, before we're ready to move more
substantially on an investment, when we can tell it's coming to commercial fruition. So I'd say, we definitely continue
to have aspirations for breadth that way. That would be true of our Medical Optics business as well.
Turning to diabetes care, a lot of change going on in that market right now. And I'd say that in particular in the U.S.,
with the competitive bidding and so forth, if you track the few competitors in this space and their responses to that and
compare our various performances, you will see that there's definitely been an impact on the diabetes care business
dramatically for some relative to others, less impactful for us. Our strategy has been different there than some of our
competitors. And I think we've held share and revenues very well.
Longer-term the strategy at least for us is a focus on very innovative family of products coming in our R&D pipeline
that we've alluded to in the past and are beginning to emerge now. I think are beginning to get some visibility now in
terms of continuous testing and so forth that I think will be game changing and very well received by the market. That's
very different than the base core business today. But we have actually great expectations and aspirations about that.
And we think we're in a position here that others are not in, at least in this particular category. So, we've got great hopes
for what our R&D people are coming with. As I said, it's beginning to show and as the next 12 months or so progress,
we'll start see more of that.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: With continuous testing, is that just expanding or I guess some sort of a Navigator
iteration?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I'd say, it captures some of the intent of Navigator, but in a very different way. And so I
think it's meant to address the frequent tester, the insulin-dependent tester and the person who clearly wants easy but
frequent continuous monitoring instantaneously and in a different way, somewhat different way than Navigator. But it's
clearly meant to address those who were Navigator users and others, frankly, on top of that.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Just last question, I guess. Would you also be looking to expand beyond the existing
businesses that you're in within Devices or just deepening across more adjacencies?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I just never forecast that. It's always possible because we look for businesses that have
characteristics or criteria that are consistent with the characteristics in our portfolio and it depends to some degree on
whether those businesses have an advantage being part of Abbott or we can do better with it than what we see at doing
standalone or as part of somebody else. So I'd say, first priority is always related strategic fit with our existing
businesses, but in some cases, it might be a new category. Although, today, I can tell you I'm not focused on something
that's not part of Abbott now.
