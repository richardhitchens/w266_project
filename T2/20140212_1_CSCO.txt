I will now turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Mel, thank you very much. In Q2 Fiscal year 2014, Cisco delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 on revenues
of $11.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The market and the dynamics in our business played out largely as we
described in our last quarterly conference call. We saw the impact of emerging markets, service provider, and high-end
product transitions in our business as we discussed last quarter. I will provide more detail in the business update.
As we navigate these economic and product cycles, we are managing our business to deliver shareholder value. In this
quarter, we returned a record $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends of approximately $900 million and $4
billion in share buyback.
We manage non-GAAP operating expenses, reducing them in the high single digits year-over-year. And Gary, Frank,
really nice job on that. And we build backlog type just as we said we would. We believe the strategy that has enabled
us to emerge stronger from every previous cycle remains solid. We capitalize on the major market transitions. We
partner with our customers to deliver innovation and solutions that fuel their business.
In our view, this next wave of the Internet, the Internet of Everything, willing to help us every technology transition
we're seeing in the market today with the network squarely at the center. We are building a platform for the Internet of
Everything, with scale and security. To address the unparalleled complexity requirements we plan to continue to disrupt
the market and disrupt ourselves to deliver the value and solutions our customers require.
Last year, we introduce entirely new approaches to networking, designed around future-proofing the bets customers are
making today and enabling them to harness the benefits of the Internet of Everything.
As we capitalize on these transitions, I would like to summarize the dynamics of our business in the following five
points. First, the Internet of Everything has moved from an interesting concept to a business imperative driving
opportunities across every major vertical. It was the central conversation at the Consumer Electronics Show and the
World Economic Forum over the last couple months with CEOs, industry and country leaders globally. Anyone
walking away from these events should characterize this year as the tipping point.
Second, we continue our strength in U.S. enterprise and U.S. commercial, as we said we would do last quarter
conference call with year-over-year orders up 13% in U.S. enterprise and 10% in U.S. commercial. While we face
SDN, white label servers, and public cloud solutions in this market, we see our ability to deliver architectures and cross
portfolio solutions with scale, security, and CapEx and OpEx savings as a driver our success in this market.
Third, we are managing through the economic and product cycles just as we outlined on the last call. Emerging market
orders declined 3% year-over-year as compared to last quarter's down 12% with the BRICs, Mexico down 10% this
quarter. SP orders declined 12% and product transition in core routing and switching contributed to double-digit
revenue declines. As we move to reaccelerate growth across the businesses, we remain focused on managing the levers
to deliver value to our shareholders, while making investments to position Cisco for the long-term.
Fourth, we believe our focus on architectures is really paying off. As the pace and complexity of IT increases, Cisco's
ability to bring together technologies, servers and solutions across silos should continue to drive differentiation,
preference and, over time, gross margins. Point players will push us faster at times, but I believe you will see our
advantage in delivering integrated architectures at scale win in the end.
And fifth, we said last quarter that our goal was to build product backlog, and we exited Q2 with book-to-bill greater
than one. We are pleased with our progress managing through the cycles in our market and our businesses and, as such,
wanted to give you an update on our Q3 revenue guidance, before Frank details guidance later. That allows you to help

frame the rest of the discussion on this call.
For Q3, we expect revenue to decline in the range of down 6% to down 8%. As we execute on our plan to return to
growth over the next several quarters, subject to all the appropriate caveats discussed during this call, we also plan to
continue to build backlog.
There is no question that we have moved from a compute-centric to a network-centric model for IT. Cisco is building
the simple, smart and highly secure solutions that will enable our customers to capitalize on the cost efficiencies, agility
and growth opportunities that lie ahead.
Our approach is unique. It starts with the central role of the network, which is the only place that connects everything;
people, process, data and things. Our transition is from selling boxes, like most of our peers, to selling business
outcomes. Our delivery is through architectures, partners and services, and we will help our customers utilize their
$180 billion Cisco install base to capture the most value today and build for tomorrow.
As we move into this next era of the Internet, with our customers, our commitment to you is to invest to sustain our
industry leadership position, while balancing the evolution in our business, and a very strong focus on shareholder
return.
Frank, at this time I'd like to turn it over to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thank you, John.
In Q2 FY 2014, our business performed as we expected. We continue to manage through the transitions in our business
and challenges we outlined in our last earnings call.
From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $11.2 billion, down 8%. Non-GAAP net income was $2.5
billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.47 per share, down 8% year-on-year. Our GAAP net income was $1.4 billion and
GAAP earnings per share, on a fully diluted basis, were $0.27. Product revenue declined 11% and service revenue
increased 3% with product book-to-bill greater than one. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 27.8%.
In Q2, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3%, within our expectations of 61% to 62%. Non-GAAP product
gross margin was 58.8%. As our overall volume of business was down this quarter, it negatively impacted our
non-GAAP product gross margins in several ways.
First, we have less leverage in our cost structure. We did not get the full benefit of cost efficiencies at these lower
volumes. Second, as our volumes in higher-margin core products were lower, we saw an unfavorable mix impact
toward lower margin products such as SP video and service. Third, while the impact from pricing was consistent with
prior quarters, it was at the higher end of our historical range in Q2. As we improve business volume, we expect it will
balance the drivers of our product gross margins.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 33.5%, as a percentage of revenue. That's compared to 34.1%
in Q2 of FY 2013. Our head count decreased by approximately 1,000 from the end of the fiscal year to 74,065. Our
expenses benefited from reduced variable compensation expense, as a result of our lower financial performance, and
efficiencies associated with our recent work force rebalancing.
GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 included a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the
expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years. The
charge is related to the expected remediation costs for certain products containing memory components manufactured
by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. These components have been determined to have a potential to fail due to
a design or manufacturing defect. These are widely used across the industry and are included in a number of Cisco's
products.

Although, the majority of these products are beyond Cisco's warranty terms and the failure rates are low, Cisco is
pro-actively working with customers on mitigation. This results in a charge to product cost of sales during the second
quarter of fiscal 2014. This charge has been excluded from non-GAAP results, as Cisco does not believe it is reflective
of ongoing business and operating results.
Total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $47.1 billion, including $3.3 billion available in the U.S. at the end
of the quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $2.9 billion during the quarter.
We continue to drive our capital allocation strategy. As you recall, in Q4 FY 2012, we committed to return a minimum
of 50% of our free cash flow annually through dividends and share repurchases. In FY 2013, we returned over 50% of
free cash flow and I'm pleased that in the first half of FY 2014 we have returned in excess of 150% of free cash flow to
our shareholders, comprised of $6 billion of share repurchases and $1.8 billion of dividends.
In Q2, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders, a quarterly record for Cisco. This included $4 billion through share
repurchase and approximately $900 million through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count decreased by
approximately 100 million shares, driven by these repurchases. We expect the remaining impact of the Q2 share
repurchase to further reduce share count next quarter.
In addition, today, our board approved an increase of $0.02 to the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share, an approximate
12% increase representing a yield of approximately 3.3%. This dividend increase, combined with the anticipated share
repurchases in the second half of the fiscal year, would comfortably exceed a return of over 100% for the full fiscal
year of our free cash flow. In Q3, we anticipate incurring additional debt to refinance our maturing bonds and enhance
our domestic cash balances to support our ongoing commitment of returning cash to shareholders.
John, I'll turn it back over to you.
John T. Chambers
Thank you, Frank.
I'll now provide some additional detail on our Q2 performance and trends we are seeing in our business and in the
market. I will start with an update on the three economic and product cycles we outlined in our last call.
First, we saw emerging orders decline 3% year-over-year compared to the 12% decline in Q1 with the BRICs plus
Mexico down 10%, as I said earlier. While we saw some improvement quarter-to-quarter, the emerging markets remain
challenged, as we discussed in the last conference call. While this economic trend remains out of our control, we have
put in place important programs and efforts designed to capture growth and position Cisco to capture share, even if
these markets remain challenged.
Second, Service Provider orders declined 12% year-over-year. SP video orders, including the set-top boxes, were down
20%. Service Provider orders, excluding SP video, were down 7%. Product transitions in core routing, along with the
emerging markets weakness, also negatively impacted Service Provider results.
And third, product transitions. At the end of last year, we introduced new switching and routing platforms, which
typically ramp up over four to eight quarters. Our next generation routing business saw year-over-year revenue decline
of 11% with orders down 5%. As we manage through these transitions, we have announced reference customers for the
NCS platform, including Telstra, KDDI and BSkyB, and we expect both the NCS and CRS-X to ramp through the back
half of the year.
Switching revenue declined 12% year-over-year, with orders down 6% as we saw some deals delayed as customers
architect and qualify their new application-centric infrastructure systems. We were very pleased with the first shipping
quarter of the Nexus 9000, as the booking pipeline from the beginning to end of the quarter nearly tripled.
We believe we are firmly taking share in the 10-gig and 40 Gig data center switching markets. I'll now walk through
the elements of the product portfolio that I've not yet mentioned in terms of year-over-year revenue growth. Data center

revenue grew 10% with order growth rates in the mid-30s. Revenue this quarter in data center had some impact from
lower backlog coming into the quarter and the timing of shipments. The pipeline continues look very strong and UCS
continues to take market share.
Wireless declined 4%. Cisco's cloud networking platform, Meraki, continues to perform very well, growing over 100%
year-over-year and more than doubling customers from 4,300 one quarter ago to 9,600 in just one – in this quarter, due
largely to the power of the Cisco channel. Approximately one-third of Meraki's business is deferred. We have also seen
the wireless impacted by more complex architectural deals. In our large enterprises and service providers where
wireless is part of a much broader solution, which have long sales cycles.
Security revenue grew 17%, with particular strength in network security, up 21%, and content security, up 5%. We are
seeing orders grow significantly faster than revenue, up 30% this quarter, as we continue to shift toward more recurring
revenue models in this business. The Sourcefire acquisition continues to perform very well, and there is no question
that the Sourcefire acquisition has accelerated our position as a leading security company, and in our view, the only one
capable of delivering an end to end architectural approach. We're very pleased with the performance of both Meraki
and Sourcefire acquisitions as part of our build, buy and partner innovation strategy.
Now moving on to collaboration. Collaboration revenues declined 7% with a decline of 9% year-over-year in Unified
Communications as we plan for an upcoming product refresh with our customers. The WebEx conferencing business
had a very strong quarter, up 21%. In WebEx, we saw many metrics, including billable minutes and new customer
adoptions, grow quite well. This growth came from both very Large Enterprise deals as well as good traction in the
SMB space.
It is worth noting that our goal to move more of Cisco's revenue to recurring is taking place today in our collaboration
businesses, security businesses, and with respect to some of our recent acquisitions, like Meraki. This quarter, we saw
product deferred revenues increase approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter. Over time, you will see us
introduce new consumption models in other parts of our businesses that align with how customers want to buy IT today
which will also help us drive better visibility going forward.
Services revenue grew 3%, with both technical services and advanced services up 3%. As we discussed last quarter,
service revenues are currently tied closely to product growth so the deceleration product momentum continues to
impact service revenues. Continued investment in consulting services, remote monitoring smart services, and analytics,
will drive additional opportunities in the quarters to come. We did begin delivering a new set of security services this
quarter, continuing to better address our customers' top priorities.
Now on to our cloud business, while not reported as a specific product category but rather reflected across our product
categories, continues to grow very well. On the cloud infrastructure side, we once again advanced our position as
leading cloud infrastructure provider. In Q2, we saw double-digit booking growth with massively scalable data center
customers as they chose and purchased the Cisco UCS and Nexus portfolio.
Our cloud services business also continued very strong growth. As mentioned before, we experience very strong
growth in Meraki, WebEx, and security cloud services business. At Cisco Live in Milan in January, we announced
several important additions to our Cloud portfolio, including Cisco InterCloud, the ability to create inter-operability and
highly secure hybrid cloud environments across multiple public and private clouds. While peers tout workload mobility
within their proprietary cloud offerings, only Cisco can enable organizations to combine and move workloads, storage,
compute, and applications across different clouds and hypervisors, securely with all the associated network and security
policies.
I will now move on to provide background on our geographic and customer segments in terms of Q2 year-over-year
product orders unless specifically stated otherwise. In Q2, product orders declined 4% year-over-year and, as we said
earlier, total product book-to-bill was greater than one. To provide a geographic view of orders this quarter, Americas
declined 5%. In the U.S., balancing out strong Enterprise and Commercial momentum, U.S. Public Sector declined 4%.
Within U.S. Public Sector, state, local and education grew 7% and U.S. federal declined 16%. U.S. Service Providers
declined 11%, as we managed through the SP video transition and product cycles mentioned earlier.

Now moving on to Asia Pacific, China and Japan, which as a region declined 5%. China declined 8% percent as we and
our peers continue to work through the economic and political dynamics in that country. The Europe, Middle East,
Africa and Russia region declined 2%. Northern Europe and the U.K. are showing good momentum, while Southern
Europe continues to be challenging. Signs suggest Europe is stabilizing, though still fragile, especially in the South.
Moving on to a segment view, Enterprise declined 2%, Commercial grew 1%, Public Sector grew 1% on a global basis
and, as mentioned above, Service Provider declined 12%.
As we said in our last call, managing through product and market cycles is part of being a leader in the technology
industry. We feel very confident in our ability to work through these cycles, overcoming the coming quarters. We will
continue to tell you exactly what we see, and manage the business to perform to the expectations we set with you, as we
did this quarter.
Frank, I'm now going to turn it back over to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Let me provide a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. Let me remind you, again, that our comments
include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and
understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in these forward-looking statements, and that
actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a
reconciliation to GAAP.
As John discussed earlier, we expect total revenue to decline in the range of 6% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. For
the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Given the business volumes
assumed in our revenue guidance, it is most likely to be at the low end of this range.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 is expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, and our non-GAAP tax
provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the third quarter. Our Q3 FY 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share
is expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.49 per share. As we communicated last quarter, we expect FY 2014
non-GAAP earnings per share to range from $1.95 to $2.05.
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than non-GAAP EPS by about $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q3 2014 and
$0.56 to $0.62 for the full year. This range includes pre-tax impact of approximately $50 million in Q3 FY 2014 and up
to $550 million for the full year, as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our work force reduction
plan that we announced last quarter.
During Q2 FY 2014, we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $73 million related to that
announcement. Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more details.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and
our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or
other events, which may or may not be significant. And as reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance
during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I'll now hand the call back over to John for detail on our business momentum and trends. John?
John T. Chambers
Frank, thank you very much.
Managing transitions has been a core foundation of our success for nearly 30 years. The Internet of Everything is the
biggest market opportunity ahead, encompassing every technology trend in the market today. In recent months, the
Internet of Everything has become the center of most every conversation with CEOs, industry and country leaders.

2014 will be the inflection point for the Internet of Everything.
The level of excitement we see in the conversations we're having today and with customers about the next wave of the
Internet reminds me of the mid-1990s. At that time, we saw the Internet and e-commerce moving from just a tech thing
to something that did impact every industry. Like customers did when the Internet and e-commerce were becoming
mainstream, customers are, turning to Cisco as a trusted partner today to capitalize on the opportunity and minimize the
risk in their business as they move into the Internet of Everything.
As we saw in the e-commerce day, there is a lag between thought leadership and mainstream adoption, and we still are
only in the beginning stages. We are seeing tangible early traction, for example in our top 50 targeted accounts, with
over a $2 billion opportunity for Cisco. We're managing the transitions in our portfolio today and building for the
Internet of Everything for tomorrow.
This is how I am looking and evaluating our progress. First, our willingness to change and disrupt. You've heard me
say for at least two years the pace of change has become exponential. Multiple transitions are occurring at the same
time, requiring Cisco to transform on multiple fronts faster than we've done before. Our scale, customer relationships
and number one market position in most of our targeted categories gives us a huge advantage as we deliver a new
model for IT.
The next generation of network will collapse the OSI stack from seven layers to three, bringing applications,
networking and security together at scale. This will not only happen in the data center as we are seeing today, but
across the campus, access, and into the cloud.
Second, customer traction. We don't get to decide whether or not we will emerge as the number one IT company, our
customers do. What we do get to decide is how we can continue to deliver the value to our customers to retain the
market-leading position. This will be done by selling business outcomes enabled by architectures. I look closely at how
we're engaging with customers and moving from technology provider to a trusted business partner, whether it is the $3
billion of value created in the city of Barcelona through connected, intelligent infrastructure, or the first digital country,
Israel, or several major retailers basing their networks on Cisco in order to prepare for the Internet of Everything, our
customers are coming to us to capitalize on the opportunity.
Third, operational excellence and disciplined cost management. We managed non-GAAP operating expenses very well
this quarter, decreasing 9% as we focused on cost management and productivity. This execution shows we are able to
focus on costs as we transition the business. We continue to focus on operating an efficient organization while at the
same time making the right investments to drive long-term growth.
Fourth, creating shareholder value. As we execute our strategy to become the number one IT company, we have also
committed to returning at least 50% of cash flow annually to our shareholders. As Frank said earlier, we will
comfortably exceed this amount for the balance of the fiscal year.
When our operating results have been impacted by a challenging macro environment, in the emerging markets, along
with choices we are making to transform the company, we demonstrated our confidence in the future and our support
for shareholders by materially increasing our capital return as we did last quarter. We continue this focus on
shareholder value with the $4 billion share repurchases quarter and the dividend increase we announced today.
Change has always been good for Cisco and our track record for transforming ourselves, both as a company and as
leaders, is unparalleled. We are as close to our customers and partners as ever. We understand their challenges and
where they need us to be there. And we're using this position to build the products, solutions, and platforms to meet the
demands of the market. This to me has always been the key leading indicator of future success and financial results and
gives me confidence that we will emerge as the number one IT company.
Mel, let me turn it over to you.

Thank you, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analyst please ask only one question.
Operator, please open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Jess I. Lubert>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Question is on the product gross margin which
declined quite a bit sequentially, was at the lowest level we've seen in a while, and when you went through some of the
volume and mix issues in the call so I was hoping you could touch on the competitive environment from both
traditional and non-traditional vendors and to what degree there was any change in pricing?
And perhaps beyond Q3, do think you can get the gross margin back towards the mid-to upper end of the 61% to 62%
gross margin range as volumes improve and new products ramp or should we be thinking about the lower end of this
range longer-term?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Frank, I am going to have you handle the second part. The first part, there was nothing
abnormal about this quarter's pricing trends at all, no abnormality in terms of competitors we saw, new or existing
models of new startups. The field is going to go after key wins and opportunities to capture major franchises and key
strategic beginning of architectural plays. And I think it's good as we begin to drive for growth.
In terms of the timing, what we said traditionally in terms of the growth, you watch our order improvements, you watch
our steady progress each quarter, which I think we've done up to this point in time and are going to do again this next
quarter, and you will see as we come through these product transitions at the high-end routing and switching, and as
you see us begin to pull our service provider strategy more together, you'll see these turns up in Q4 and Q1 and Q2 in
terms of momentum from an order perspective.
Frank I'm going to switch it over to you in terms of gross margin comments.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So, Jess, as I mentioned, we came in at 61.3%, within the range of 61% to 62% and
provided the guidance in the range of 61% to 62% for the next quarter and saying it's at the low end of that range.
Primarily in Q2 as well as Q3 the issue is volume. So to answer your question, and that's driving mostly the cost as well
as the mix that I talked about.
So as volume does improve, that gives us the ability to also improve the gross margin. So when I think about it from a
long-range perspective, we've talked about 61% to 62% for some period of time. As volume improves and we get into
more growth scenario from a top line perspective, that enables us to be at the high end of that range or even above that
range.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: When you really think about it, Jess, we have control over our pricing, our expenses and
gross margins and we're managing these as levers. As volumes come back, as Frank said, and I believe very firmly that
they will, you will see the gross margins improve as well, reminding everybody for the last couple of years, I've been
saying gross margins will be in the 61% to 62% range and plus or minus 1% or 2%, I think, Mel, the last time we said
that very openly was in fact in 2012.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Yep, absolutely. Thanks, Jess. Operator, next question.

<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi. Thank you. John, what is the risk that you've got yourself too spread across too many areas
where you're fighting multiple battles on multiple fronts with just a massive rate of flux in each of your markets? And
the reason I ask is I'm a little surprised that the Service Provider segment for you continues to remain relatively weak.
NCS has been out for some time so I'm surprised we're not seeing any traction there. So I'd love to get your thoughts in
terms the portfolio. Is there room for further rationalization or are you spread too thin?
<A - John T. Chambers>: So first, the answer is no. If you watch, if you're a single product company in today's
market, you're going to have a real tough time competing against a number of different competitors and differentiating
yourself.
We saw these trends coming and we have articulated for four or five years the importance of our architectures where
you combine products that combine 13 products that are number one in their field, four products that are number two in
terms of market share, two product areas that are number three. You combine these into architectures with services and
partners that very quickly bring you to solutions and dramatic differentiation, and that is what you're seeing in play
very strongly in the U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise as proof points.
The second part of your questions in terms of service provider, we basically are again going with architectural
approach. We are literally saying how do you influence the key issues that are most important to the service provider
from mobility to video to cloud to speed of services delivery to reducing OpEx and CapEx and say how you approach
these in an architectural approach? So I think this will be an industry where architectures will win, and I think we are
very well-positioned versus our key traditional IT players and future challenges.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Next question, operator?

Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with TheJudaGroup.
<Q - Subu Subrahmanyan>: Thank you. My question is on the product transitions you are seeing. Is there a way to
quantify the impact of data center product transition and core routing product transitions on this quarter? And John, as
you look at the recovery in these, is there a timing expectation which one will rebound first between these two?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. As you look at it, let's go to data center and let's go to switching. If you watch and use
the Nexus 9K as an example, our product pipeline is up to 522 customers. That's almost a 2.9% increase
quarter-over-quarter. Our win rate is extremely good versus traditional players and new challengers. You'll see us, over
the next four to five quarters, blow by some of the early start-ups in this area. And if you look at the transition, I think
you'll watch our orders in Q4 and Q1 in this area, and we're going to follow a path very similar to what we did in UCS.
A similar game plan that this team, that has done so many times before from a technology perspective, we will put in
place our steps in terms of how we identify the top customers, how we get the close rates, how we ramp the volume and
at the same time, tie that to what we're doing in the Nexus 7000 and below in terms of the data center.
In terms of the routing, the routers are little bit longer sales cycle. As you know, when you put these routers that have
such tremendous capability and function where you can literally transfer the whole Library of Congress in a second or
the Netflix library in a second, you basically are talking about tremendously powerful capabilities with NCS and the
CRS-X. That will take a little bit longer. I'd watch our franchise wins in Q3 and then you should begin to see orders
pick up in Q4 and Q1 on those. A little bit longer sales cycle, in terms of implementation.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Subu. Operator, next question?

<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hey, John. Switching over – switching to the Nexus 9K order ramp, will you see that this
quarter? I mean, our checks continue to indicate more of an evaluation phase on that product still. Will we start seeing
that ramp this quarter? Will that help get Switching back into positive territory heading into July and into fiscal 2015?
And then, can you give us an update on Campus Switching and how that's doing? Thank you.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. Rob, I'm going to give you the Campus Switching piece. Let me go to the Nexus
piece. Literally, I review, almost every other week, with the team where we are on this. Reminding everyone, this team
has never missed in terms of our telephony approach, our combination of storage with the network, with processors that
really made us a major player in the data center. And now what you watch on this one, you're going to see a steady
ramp to where we will just pick up momentum in key accounts, and we're tracking those key accounts.
The volumes are small. We won one, for example, today that is a huge opportunity, but it was the first opportunity to
get the door in the foot (sic) [foot in the door] (37:34). So we deal with, first, getting the pilots in and then scale. But
this is a product that is extremely competitive and every aspect of the commitments they've made on the product are on
schedule on the quarters that they committed to. So I feel very comfortable with the product ramps on this. And as you
begin to see the Nexus 7K and 9K both available in the market, then you will move through perhaps a little bit of pause
where customers are saying, which way do I go and I have a hesitation here.
Rob, additional thoughts on campus?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: Yeah, John. In addition to the data center, I think that the entire two big transitions, which are
from 1-gig to 10-gigs, and now from 10-gigs to 40-gigs, are playing to the strongest trend we've had in terms of our
portfolio. So we have a product for every part of the market right now, and you covered some of the data center
technologies. We haven't talked about the new 40-gig uplinks on our Nexus 5000, an important part of the product, and
of course the 10-gig and 40-gig links on the Campus Switch, which is a 68000. So right across-the-board, great
portfolio strength. And you mentioned it, but we do have the pedal-to-the-metal on the 10-gig to 40-gig transition, and I
think you're going to see some good market share movement in the quarters ahead.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, I think the market share gains on that are going to be dramatic.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks, guys. John, I want to focus on two specific segments, the wireless and the data center.
Both, for a couple of quarters now, have either completely flattened out or, in the wireless case, have even declined on
a sequential basis. And I'm trying to understand – I understand these – I would assume that some exposure there relates
to emerging markets, and that's probably one of the sources of the weakness. But, nevertheless, for you, those are very
high growth opportunities, especially on the server side, and on the wireless many of your competitors are still growing
at very nice clips. So I'm trying to understand if there's something going on in those two businesses that's not related to
the macro issues you've been discussing?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So first on the data center, the answer would be I don't know. If you watch the rate at
which our orders come in, as I said in the script, the order rate was in the mid-30s, and this was more of a timing of
shipments. Book-to-bill, across most of our product lines – you can do the math quickly as quickly as I can. Most all of
them were in good shape in terms of book-to-bill. We clearly built backlog in many of the categories, and I'd be very
surprised if you don't see the numbers up in the 30% range this next quarter with all the appropriate caveats. That
momentum feels good. We are very, very well-positioned versus competition.

On the wireless side of the house, there were areas such as Meraki that were just very, very good where you go in with
solutions and position it. Some of the other wireless decisions on very large service provider decisions are very long
sales cycle such as a small-cell SP Wi-Fi, et cetera, on it, and I think you're going to see as we brought out some
additional product functionality that just came out with our wireless LAN capability, Rob, you'll see the orders in that
category pick back up as we look out over the next couple of quarters.
So on the data center, we're going to win that one, and I think you see tremendous momentum there, and we have no
fear here. That one really feels good. And then in terms of the wireless, there are couple of areas that we need to put
momentum back on. Rob, I think we know what we want to do on that. You talked to a group the other day, I think?

Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.
<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: I'm hoping you treat this as a clarification, but let me give it a shot. Going back to gross
margin, I just want to confirm something. With respect to the pricing environment, I think, John, if I go back to the
previous quarter, you all were fairly assertive in your commentary about the health in pricing, especially with new
products that were coming in consistent with your current margin structure. So returning to this quarter, is it essentially
a volume issue or when we look at pricing, when we look at the new platforms, has there been any change in terms of
the margin profile of those new products in particular and more generally in terms of the overall product portfolio? I
heard your response on the call previously, that it was not an issue, just want to clarify to what extent is this a volume
issue or is it something more?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gotcha. So, Paul, great question, it allows me to expand a little bit. It is purely a volume
issue. If you look at cost, you look at mix, you look at pricing, et cetera, those three come together. Volume is what is
driving each of the areas. The areas that you're being very gentle with me on is you are saying, all right, John, are you
seeing unusual things on switching, has that been a surprise, even within the switching segment, our gross margins are
remarkably favorable, even with lower volume.
So we're not seeing anything unusual in the switching at all, we're very, very competitive, and as we mentioned before,
Paul, these new products which we are just now beginning to get out and haven't seen the effects on gross margins are
all coming in with gross margins that are very typical of our high end gross margins.
That's a much better job than we've ever done on high-end products where usually we bring them out in the low 50s
and over, literally almost 2 years, bring them back up to more traditional margins. So I feel good with that, so it's
volume and volume ties to what the costs, what the mix, and what you see overall in terms of pricing in the field.
Pricing in the field is a little bit up versus what we've seen before, but with well within the range of what we've seen, a
point, plus or minus half a point.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question?

The next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Just a question on the services side. I think Frank mentioned early on in the call
that services should follow product revenues and I guess what we're seeing is that we're seeing the product revenues
obviously declining. Can you upsell services to offset that or is there a risk that one or two quarters out we start to see

services maybe decline? How should we think about that dynamic?
And then just one further clarification on gross margin, if I can. Are you saying there's no real change in the pricing
environment, it's all volume driven? The reason I ask is that you guys knew that revenues were going to be pretty weak
this quarter, and your guidance for lower gross margins – gross margins were weak on product this quarter, they're
going to be relatively weak next quarter, so why aren't the cost efficiencies coming through or is that more longer-term
discussion? Any comment on that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gary, do you want to take the services one? I don't know if you could hear it or not?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yes, I think I do, John. So, Kulbinder, on the services, the services business is tightly tied to
product, but we have added a number of services that John mentioned during the call earlier, and those ramping up, and
the fact that our product decline has been what it's been, those services aren't coming up as fast and offsetting that. But
we are very happy with the way we've been able to drive continued growth in the services business as well as
continuing to drive the margins that we've had.
<A - John T. Chambers>: In terms of the gross margin, comments?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: As far as the gross margin, just to reiterate, as far as the guidance we gave last quarter,
61%, 62%, as I said, we came in at 61.3%, so we did assume the lower volume when we gave the guidance, and then
also assuming the lower volume for Q3 in the guidance that we just gave for the coming quarter.
As far as the volume and cost impact, so when you take your volumes down, we have a fixed base within our
manufacturing organizations, things like logistics centers, things like the data center that supports WebEx and things
like that. When you have lower volumes, you're spreading that fixed base over those lower volumes, and therefore you
don't get some of the magnitude of cost benefit that we've seen in prior quarters.
So some the initiatives that we're driving like value engineering, will continue to drive those. We don't see the full
impact when the volumes are down because it's offset by the fixed cost piece of it. So as the volumes, as I said before,
as the volumes improve back to, let's say, normal levels, then you can definitely start to realize those efficiencies from a
cost and then also from a mix standpoint as the volumes improve in switching and routing, that was one that basically
had the most delta on a quarter-over-quarter basis which tend to have higher margins, that's going overall affect the mix
in a positive direction. So we're having those impacts in periods when the volumes are lower and as the volumes
improve, they should be offset.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Very simple. If we were seeing major pricing pressures, we would just tell you, and the
switching is the prime example where even in a product transition time period, the margins are remarkably stable on
them. So we control the pricing, we control the expenses, control the gross margins, we think we are positioned very
well versus the changes in competition at this time.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question.

Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you. John, I'm sorry for the background noise. In an up cycle, I guess the bigger the better
[indiscernible] (46:50) with an architectural approach, yet some of your assets are past their peak cycle and having a
negative impact to your financial model, so are we at a point where Cisco has to choose between customers and
margins and Cisco actually proactively look at corporate ecology so that we can actually have margin, customers happy
and investors happy as well?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I think I got part of the question. The question is do we have to choose between customers
and margins, and I would say the two actually come very tightly together. And this is something that I think we need to
both articulate and give you a feel for the examples.

When you begin to look at an architectural sale, and I was just at World Wide Tech this last week, WWT, technologies,
and they this last year did about $2.8 billion as a partner reselling for us, growing in the high 20s year-over-year. They
align completely with us by architectures, and they align completely with us as we make the transition into the Internet
of Everything. Now bear with me as I walk through this, because you understand why during this with you.
They standardized on Cisco and they literally build in their labs the architectures instead of interfacing the customers
with white papers or slides, they basically say here's what you can do through architectures, that's why you have to
have all of these 18 different product areas, to be able to get the result that you want when you combine it with services
to get the outcomes much faster. And they already show that in each of their labs with the capability to bring it to life,
so you see the growth, you see the realization on it.
On the Internet of Everything, they are already almost ahead of us, Gary, in terms of they are already talking to areas
like in mining, where you connect the sensors to all the equipment in a major mining operation. They get feeds, if you
can imagine, probably 10,000 sensor feeds per second. It goes into six or seven different databases applications. As you
begin to think about the Internet of Everything and as they share that architecturally, you all of a sudden show by doing
this how you can make decisions with people, process, data and things much quicker, get the right information at the
right time to the right person or device or machine to make the right decision.
So this is why you have to be in these various product areas. This is why when you bring those together, your gross
margins come up, because you're delivering results. This is why you don't want to be a single product group like a
router or a switch or a wireless capability, et cetera. You can get caught in a huge squeeze as you move forward, and it
is that combination to provide gross margin capabilities.
If you're in service providers, and of course we look at the analysis as we go forward, we are very much committed to
the video side of the market, because video after voice, I'm sorry, video after mobile is the number one application area
that they receive differentiation in. And two thirds of the load on mobile devices in just a year will be video. So you
have to be in these areas really to tie it together. Does that make sense?
<Q - Mark Sue>: Helpful. Thank you.

really. The clarifications were just if you could give us, Frank, the – because you're buying back so much stock, just
what the ending quarter share count was? That would be helpful. And then a comment on linearity, if you could.
A clarification on the Services businesses. I had thought – because at your Analyst Day in December you said 80% of
your Services is maintenance. I had thought it was more a function of your install base than on quarter-by-quarter
product revenue. So if you can just clarify that?
And then my real question is about Service Provider. Service Provider video, obviously, continues to fall. Is there a
bottom? Is there a spot that you can calculate it and kind of look at your customer base where that kind of bottoms out

and you should be modeling that?
And on core routers, is that a cyclical funk that we're in right now in core routing?
<A - John T. Chambers>: You're getting so many questions, I can't even write them down quick enough. Let me stop
right there, and see if we go through it. I'm going to take the linearity question.
The quarter was very linear. No surprise on that at all, and played out much in the range that we do with the first month
being a little bit average at 25%, let's say; second month, a little bit more, and third month in the 40% to 45% range,
depending on which quarter you're in. That went – this quarter was very, very much in-line with what we traditionally
see in Q2.
I want to say, so that everybody understands this, we exited the quarter with the best booking backlog, in terms of
weeks, that we've seen in 10 years in Q2. So the number of weeks of backlog we had was very solid coming out of the
quarter.
Frank, I gave you a minute to look up the share count.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Yes, so the diluted share count, the average diluted share count at the end of quarter was
about 5,300, approximately 5,300. And as I said, it came down about approximately 100 million quarter-on-quarter
related to the buyback that we did, the $4 billion of buyback that we did in this past quarter.
I also noted that when you do the buyback over a period of time, depending on the timing, you don't get the full impact
of the reduced share count. It takes another quarter. So we'll see a further reduction this coming quarter, and then
whatever other additional buyback that we do in Q3 and Q4 will then reduce it even further.
It also has offset any increase to the share count related to options and to RSUs and ESPP that normally increase. So
we've offset that and then reduced it through the buyback. And our objective, as we said over a period of time, is to
manage share count down over the next couple of quarters, and over the next several years, in order to help improve the
return to shareholders.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, Frank and I always provide a good balance. We're going be aggressive in the market.
You're going to see us well above our 50% free cash flow buyback, and we'll continue to be opportunistic there, much
as we were in the first six months of this year.
Gary, in terms of Services, let me break the question into three pieces. First, how much of Services is actually tied to
the products side of the house, and maybe a real quick discussion of Technical Services versus Advanced Services?
And then Advanced Services, how over time you're going to move to more outcome based, all in 2 minutes?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yeah, or less. So hi, Ehud. So the first part of that is roughly 80%, and that's a combination of
Technical Support Services, as well as Advanced Subscription Services. Those contracts are normally one to three
years and you book them, and then you deal that revenue out on an equal basis over, whether it's a 12-month deal or
36-month. So as the product ramp – product revenue and bookings have ramped down over the last several quarters,
there's no new attach to that on either TS or AS.
On the business that is not subscription, the Advanced Services that are more advanced engineering and capabilities
around support services that are project oriented, when people aren't building out new networks or we're not deploying
large deployments, then that business also comes down. And that has come down fairly significantly, as well, over the
last several quarters.
We're ramping up in the areas that John mentioned around smart services, the analytics around that, as well as remote
managed services, some large wins there and we're really doubling down on our capability there. And then we've also
shifted and brought together – we're building out a very architecturally oriented, with technology people as well,
consulting services and then security. And we have already delivered some of that, and those are ramping up, and that's
why we have this gap here.

You'll find us being less dependent on product as we go forward, and you'll see us continue to manage that business
extremely well through automation and things that allow us to drive the margins we do.
<A - John T. Chambers>: So two real quick thoughts because I think you are going to find services really make a
difference in our future. Gary and I have given Edzard a challenge to move 50% of these advanced services to
outcome-based capabilities, that's only about 20% today. Very important in the transition.
If you look at the Internet of Everything, purely the consultancy piece over the next several years is a $1 trillion market
that we can address, and so you begin to look at us looking at this is a major new revenue scenario mostly for the
consultancy services, more importantly, pulling through our whole product architectures and once again, going back,
there's a reason that so many people fail with the Internet of Everything in cities.
They do it one step at a time. It is complex, it's got to be able to scale it's got to have the architectures all coming
together, it's got to be mobile, it's got to be data center, it's got to be analytics at the edge, it's got to be secure, it's got to
be collaborative, and you have to have a game plan to bring these customers together and just using cities or countries
as an example, when you bring them together with these architectures, that's why you win. That's why you see a digital
Israel where literally our business grows in the high teens year-after-year because of what we've done together there.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Ehud. Next question?

Our next question comes from Tal Liani with BoA Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Tal Liani>: ...very much for the questions. I have just one question left, which is I'm still trying to understand in
your numbers what's related to the last quarter, what's related to the next quarter? What I mean by that is the quarter is
definitely weak, but I don't know if it's incrementally weaker than last quarter, and what are the parts that are
incrementally better? So maybe you can just go through kind of the major segments just to tell us, where did you see
improvement from the previous time that you updated us about three months ago, and just overall kind of the delta
from the last time? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. Well, just repeating some of the same themes and expanding on them, the quarter
played out almost exactly as we expected in terms of the three areas that were challenged, and in those challenging
areas from a revenue perspective, using high-end routing switches as an example, they were down in double digits, yet
bookings were down in the minus-5% and minus-6% respectively.
The emerging countries were better this quarter than last quarter but way too early to call a trend, and I don't want
anyone to take away, we are basing our estimate on this next quarter with no improvement in terms of the current
economic scenarios or what we're seeing with inconsistencies in emerging countries in terms of the direction.
The product orders were down 4% in the direction, and as we alluded to earlier, there were several areas that we felt
very, very good about in terms of security and the data center progress that we made. Reoccurring revenue, that's about
1% delta that we would've had if we had recognized this in traditional ways to just increase from last quarter this
quarter.
So I feel very good about where we are now. I think the transitions are working, we are playing it out. We gave
guidance for this quarter. Last quarter was 8% to 10%, we said this quarter 6% to 8% and you're going to see us just
move this market right along through the transitions and return to positive growth one quarter at a time. So I feel a lot
better where we are now versus where we were a quarter ago.
I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Frank.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Tal. Next question.

Thank you, our next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Hi, John. I'm curious, we look, sales down 8% this quarter, 6% to 8% in the third quarter. To
get growth moving again here, do you feel like Cisco needs a new product category? I mean, you're obviously a leader
in networking, you've done very well in servers in a short period of time, but to get the revenue growth to more
reasonable levels, do you think Cisco needs a new product category?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Let me think about that for a second, collect my thoughts. Okay, I think we've got four or
five major product categories, using your words, in play at the present time. We have the explosion, and remember
when we entered the data center saying we're going to bring together the network with server technology with storage,
which has really been a huge part of our growth and positioned us very well in the data center from the CIO's
perspective as well, that's playing out extremely well.
We talked about the application-centric infrastructure: remember just four months ago when everybody really got what
we're doing with this, and how you can have intelligence throughout the entire network and what we're doing with both
applications and the network and the infrastructure and the ability to do not northbound and southbound API. I mean,
that is a huge product category for us in terms of direction.
Then as you pull together the Internet of Everything, we've been on this for six years, heavy lifting, a year ago I'd have
to buy somebody a drink for me to talk very long about the topic, now they're offering to buy us dinner and they bring
their board of Directors here. A light switch went off in a very, very positive way with the CES and the World
Economic Forum, and when Google bought Nest, it was a light switch that all of a sudden every consumer player,
manufacturer realized.
Now the size of those markets is $19 trillion. That's a profit potential. That doesn't count all the infrastructure
underneath of it: $1.5 trillion in retail alone, $2.9 trillion in terms of manufacturing. So you can imagine the
conversations that we are having with the leaders in this. And we don't go in there selling them routers and switches,
we sell them outcomes, and there's probably no better example of an outcome sales than what we did in Israel. The
challenge from the top government leaders in Israel, 18 months ago, focused on job creation, focused on inclusion of
minorities, focused on healthcare, education, innovation, the ability to move some of the cities to the south, security,
and to do this in terms of support with all three major political parties from the top down. And we did that together in
18 months, we won every single major bid in total on that.
So you really begin to think about the key takeaway here is the network is at the center of every transition you're
seeing, every one of them. It's going to be an intelligent network and we positioned ourselves very well to both handle
the new competitors coming at us piecemeal and the old peers who candidly have also stayed piecemeal, and if you're
just a piecemeal hardware player with a single product, you're going to really have a tough time as you go forward. I
believe architectures win, and I think the categories we outlined, if we execute well, will fuel Cisco's growth for the
next decade.
So I actually think we have plenty in terms of the opportunities in front of us, and I want to be careful we prioritize
them the right way.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. I think that's the last question?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Mel, you're the boss. Go ahead.
