MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft second quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank
you, Chris. You may begin.

uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the
comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other
reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any
forward-looking statements.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, please keep in mind that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will
relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current
quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferrals and recognitions related to
Windows, Office and Xbox video games.
As a reminder, with our new segment reporting structure, we have consolidated adjustments of this nature into
Corporate & Other to provide better comparability of operating results. You can find details of the adjustments and the
reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today.
As I look back on the quarter, I am pleased with the results as we exceeded our expected revenue growth while
continuing to maintain our focus on improved execution and cost management. Our Devices and Consumer segment
had a very good quarter and grew 13% with a successful holiday. Our Commercial segment had another great quarter
and grew 10% to over $12 billion as we continued to deliver on our differentiated cloud strategy. We performed well
this quarter and you see it in our financial results.
This holiday we continued to make significant progress in the consumer space, headlined by Xbox One, which
launched in 13 markets and sold in 3.9 million units in just over five weeks. According to NPD group figures Xbox
One was the leading console in the U.S. for the month of December, which was its first full month in market. When
adding in Xbox 360, which held the third spot, Xbox led the U.S. market with 46% share in December. We are excited
by this enthusiastic response from our loyal customers and are working to increase the availability of Xbox One.
With Surface, demand continued to grow, benefiting from improved execution at retail and favorable reviews of the
new Surface devices. Sequentially, both units and revenue more than doubled this quarter, with customers recognizing
Surface's differentiated value proposition as one device for everything in their life. We feel good about the progress
we've made over the past couple of quarters and are enthusiastic about the overall opportunity ahead with Surface.
The Windows ecosystem as a whole is also making important progress. Earlier this fall, we launched Windows 8.1
which enabled smarter, faster and more personalized devices, and our OEM partners are take advantage of this. Over
the last few months, they've delivered a breadth of differentiated devices designed to meet a wide range of customer
needs. We're encouraged by what we've been able to accomplish with our partners and collectively we will continue to
focus on driving the Windows ecosystem forward.
Now, let me share some perspectives on what we saw in the PC market, which was slightly better than our expectation.
Business PCs grew again for the third consecutive quarter and benefited from an improving macroenvironment, better
availability of innovative new hardware and a refresh cycle ahead of Windows XP end of support. Additionally, growth
was higher in large Enterprises than small and medium size businesses. Consumer PCs, while better than our
expectations, continued to be soft as they faced challenges from competing form factors. And as a general theme,
developed markets outperformed emerging markets.
Windows continues to be the platform of choice for business. This quarter, Windows Pro revenue grew 12% and
outpaced the underlying business PC market. This was driven by faster growth in both enterprises and developed
markets where Pro attach is higher. Windows non-Pro revenue however was down 20%, reflecting the dynamics of the
consumer PC market.

Now let's move to our commercial business where key metrics remain strong. Bookings grew 12% and renewal rates
remained in line across our product portfolio, even with a large expiring base in the quarter. Unearned revenues grew
12% and our contracted not billed balance is at a record level of over $23 billion. To me this is important, as these
long-term commitments demonstrate the confidence that customers have in our product roadmap where we are
investing in key areas such as Big Data, infrastructure management and cloud computing.
In Big Data, our upcoming release of SQL Server 2014 builds on the momentum we've established. Offering a
complete business intelligence solution for big data, SQL Server is driving significant in-memory performance gains.
Additionally it enables hybrid cloud solutions with cloud backup and disaster recovery as well as providing enhanced
availability and security.
Hybrid infrastructure in management offerings also continue to be important priorities. Windows Server, Azure and
Systems Center are the centerpieces of our hybrid cloud strategy. And together, they enable portability and scalability
of workloads. Using our suite of products, customers get high scale virtualization, built in software-defined networking
and hybrid business continuity that enables their modern datacenters. As CIOs look to cloud computing to reduce costs
and deliver business agility, they are returning to our cloud services. Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online offer
customers the ability to transition easily to the cloud and benefit from enterprise-class features and a familiar user
interface.
Additionally, Windows Azure provides the scalability and flexibility that addresses their evolving infrastructure and
platform needs.
In summary, we had a very good quarter across our consumer and commercial business. We are taking share with many
products and seeing improvements in areas where we needed to be better. As we do this, we continue to prioritize the
deployment of our resources to areas that accelerate innovation and deliver products that our customers love.
With that overview of the quarter, I'll hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come
back and share thoughts on our outlook.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by reporting segment.
We had a successful holiday quarter, and our broad, diversified portfolio helped us deliver record revenue in Q2. Total
revenue was up 11% to $24.5 billion, and without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been higher by
$196 million or one percentage point. Cost of goods sold increased 46%. This increase was primarily due to costs
associated with the new Xbox and Surface products, which launched this quarter, and also growth in cloud
infrastructure, supporting our consumer and commercial offerings.
Even as we invest in our devices and services initiatives, gross margin was flat at $16.2 billion. Operating expenses
grew 3%, which was below our guidance, as we continue to focus on prioritizing spend towards strategic growth
initiatives. Operating income and earnings per share both declined 4% to $8.0 billion and $0.78 respectively. This
quarter we returned $4.3 billion of cash to shareholders in buybacks and dividends, our highest amount in the last 12
quarters.
I'm now going to talk through the performance of each of our reporting segments. In our Devices and Consumer
segment, revenue grew 13%. Within this, the Licensing segment, which primarily includes Windows OEM, Consumer
Office and Windows Phone, declined 6% reflecting the overall PC and device market trends. We continue to see
similar dynamics to the previous quarter, total Windows OEM revenue declined 3%. As Amy described, the 12%
growth in Windows Pro was offset by 20% declines in Windows non-Pro. Excluding the impact to China where we
continue to draw down inventory levels, Windows non-Pro revenue declined 14%.
Office attach, including our cloud offerings, was up again this quarter. Traditional consumer Office licensing revenue
declined 24%. However, we estimate that approximately 16 percentage points of this decline was due to the shift to

Office 365 Home Premium. Excluding this impact, traditional consumer Office outperformed the underlying consumer
PC market.
Next I'll move to our Hardware segment where revenue grew $1.9 billion or 68% driven by a good holiday quarter for
our consumer devices. Xbox One had a record launch and, together with Xbox 360, we shipped 7.4 million consoles.
For Surface, we saw improved sales of Surface RT and also introduced Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 into the market.
Moving to the Devices and Consumer Other segment, as a reminder this segment includes our online marketplaces,
advertising, Xbox Studio, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and services. Revenue in this
segment declined 10% when compared to last year when we launched Halo IV.
Search advertising revenue grew 34% driven by continued revenue per search improvement and query volume growth.
Bing has now grown its share of search queries to 18.2% in the U.S. Office 365 Home Premium adoption continues to
be strong. With this service, customers are always running the most up-to-date version, have content available across
their devices with SkyDrive integration and get free Skype minutes. The overall value proposition is resonating well
with customers, and we now have more than 3.5 million subscribers. For the quarter it accounted for more than 15% of
total consumer Office licenses sold.
Turning now to our Commercial segment, all commercial revenue and gross margin across both on-premise and Cloud
services grew 10%. Commercial licensing, segment which reflects our traditional software licensing, grew 7%, and our
Commercial Other segment, which captures our commercial cloud services as well as our enterprise services business,
grew 28% to $1.8 billion. As economies of scale benefits accrue to these online services, we're seeing gross margin
expansion in our Commercial Other segment. We saw continuing strength across our commercial portfolio.
Server product revenue grew 12%. In the datacenter, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets Tier 1
application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue for Systems Center grew double
digits and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, gained five points of share over the last year. In our data platform
business, SQL Server continued to outpace the market and revenue grew double digits, with SQL Server premium
revenue growing over 25%.
Our commercial Office product also remained strong, growing 10%. Within this, our productivity server offerings:
SharePoint, Exchange and Lync continued to perform well, with Lync growing over 25%. We're excited about the
unified communications opportunity as we combine the enterprise richness of Lync and the global reach of Skype to
transform the communications experience.
We're pleased with our momentum in cloud services. This quarter revenue for commercial cloud services again grew
over 100% as customers of all sizes continued to leverage our cloud services to improve productivity, reduce cost and
leverage a secure and trusted platform. We are seeing broad-based adoption as Office 365 seats, Azure customers and
Dynamics CRM net seat adds all grew over 100%. We now have 70% of the Fortune 500 companies using at least one
of our cloud services.
Having now reviewed our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward-looking
guidance.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Chris.
Before I get into our expectations for the quarter, let me quickly touch on Nokia. We continue to expect that the deal
will close this quarter but are still in the process of securing all regulatory approvals and meeting closing conditions. So
all guidance provided here assumes no impact from Nokia. Assuming the deal closes this quarter, we will include
Nokia in our guidance starting in the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are expecting a similar macroenvironment to what we saw this quarter. As such,
many of the dynamics from the second quarter will likely continue into the third. With that let's get into the outlook,

starting with Devices and Consumer.
In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw
in the second quarter with business PCs growing, strong Pro mix and headwinds in consumer PCs. In hardware, we
expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. This reflects continued post launch momentum with Surface 2, Surface
Pro 2 and Xbox One, with the upcoming launch of the Xbox-exclusive game Titanfall. And in Devices and Consumer
other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion.
Moving on to Commercial, in what is a seasonally slower quarter, we are confident in our abilities to continue to be the
vendor of choice with our productivity and infrastructure offerings. In commercial licensing, we expect revenue to be
$10.4 billion to $10.6 billion. In commercial other, we expect revenue to be about $1.8 billion reflecting continued
momentum in our commercial cloud business. We expect COGS to be $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion next quarter. This
range primarily reflects variability associated with our hardware business.
Moving on to operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 5% to 6% to $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion. We are also
reducing and narrowing the range for our full-year guidance to $31.2 billion to $31.5 billion.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net
cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We still expect our full-year tax rate to be
between 18% and 20%.
We now expect full-year capital expenditures to be about $6 billion, which is down about $500 million from our prior
guidance. This reduction is primarily driven by improved capacity utilization and scale benefits as we converge our
online services infrastructure platforms while continuing to support the strong demand that we see in business.
Adjusting for prior year tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to sequentially decline as it
has in prior years.
So in summary, I feel good about the financial results this quarter. We are executing well across the company as
demonstrated by share gains in our commercial business, and we are also making important inroads with our consumer
offerings. Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about as we continue our transformation around One Microsoft.
With that, I'll turn it back to Chris and we'll take your questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. And with that, we'll move onto Q&A. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. Obviously nice upside on the hardware business with Surface and Xbox, but my
question is on the licensing business, and so bear with me a little bit here. You had both licensing businesses, device
and consumer and commercial licensing, they were both better than expected at least by about $100 million each. At
the same time, deferred revenue was shy by I don't know, something like $250 million, but there's some conflicting
things here. I'm just trying to get my head around this. The contract did not build, Amy. You pointed out it was really
strong. It saw a big jump by somewhere around $2 billion sequentially and you also saw some nice traction to
commercial cloud services. It more than doubled. I'm assuming it's small, but here's my question. With all that
happening is there a shift happening with your on-premise corporate business to more transactional versus ratable
contracts? That would sort of help out to help offset the financial implications of as you shift to sort of cloud services

on the corporate side. Is that what's happening with all these movements?
<A - Amy Hood>: So...
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Sorry about all the detail.
<A - Amy Hood>: I really appreciate the question because it's going to let me expand on a couple dynamics which I
think are at work here. So now I'm going to ask you to bear with me with a little bit of a long answer.
Let me start by your comments I think around the overall commercial licensing bucket, which I'm going to expand to
include, as you did, the overall commercial business, both cloud and licensing. There are a number of metrics that I
tend to look at together as opposed to individually to think about how we did in the quarter. You touched on one,
unearned, which grew 12% this quarter, which is quite good. The second is bookings, which grew 12% in the quarter
which is very good, renewal rates, which were in line across our products, and finally, the CNB balance, the contracted
not billed balance, being up sequentially $2 billion, which, as you point out, is very big.
If you think about those together as a group, those data points are very important because together I would say any – I
think you said a couple hundred short on unearned, with those data points together, I would say there's no shortage in
terms of commercial licensing and commercial other strength all up. As you know, contracted but not billed tends to be
at the end of a quarter, right, we sign a bunch of contracts that we can't bill for until the very beginning of the next.
Think about that as business done in quarter. You'll see that come into the unearned balance, frankly, in Q3 as well as
into adjusted. So that dynamic answers really the first question and a part of the question you asked.
Now that could have – that's sort of a separate piece. Then you said well, some of the dynamic could be explained by
some strong transactional business in the quarter. I would say there's one place and I would actually separate these
things because the first was good and the second was better than we thought. Office non-annuity or transactional did a
little better than we thought in quarter as well. And so that's a good point that we didn't bring out, but that is another
sort of component of the 10% all up commercial growth.
Now, so I guess my answer is, I agree with your transactional comment but I disagree that it's probably the overall – it's
a component of a quote-unquote, "Shortfall in unearned." I would say both are actually quite good.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. That's fairly helpful, but actually just a clarification on the contracted not yet
billed. You said that, and yes, contracts get signed at the end of the quarter, but so you're saying that the big jump
primarily was because they just hadn't been billed yet versus signing, I could see if you were just signing longer term
deals that you're going to bill annually, but that's not what's happening. It's more about just, is that accurate? Either one
could happen.
<A - Amy Hood>: Yeah, that's right. If something was actually billed at the end of the quarter, it goes into unearned.
Contracted but not billed, it's actually that the contract was signed but because the billing won't quite take place until
after the end of the fiscal quarter, it ends up in contracted but not billed as opposed to unearned.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Great. But are we seeing any, like typically your contracts are three years, but are we seeing
any extension on the average contract length?
<A - Amy Hood>: No. No.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Okay.
<A - Amy Hood>: That's not one of the impact. Thanks, John.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford C. Bernstein. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you very much. Two quick questions. The first one is can you give us any sense of
how much of the Office 365 and the Home Premium could be generated by net new users as compared to simply the
move over of existing users? And then I'll ask the second one?
<A - Amy Hood>: Mark, that's actually – here's how I think about the value prop because I can't really say – these are
sales through retail and through OEM generally – whether it's a net new user or not. What I can say is that attach
overall went up in the Office consumer business, which I would say is and could be a sign that some of those are net
new. I would hope that to be the case. The value prop of Office 365 Home Premium really does expand the footprint. It
allows for multiple users. It has cross platform capabilities with Office for Mac. It's got mobile capabilities as well and
allows for easier trial. So it does sort of lower many of the barriers to experience and try the product. So while I can't
point and say there's an exact number that is a new user, I can certainly say with attach going up, that dynamic is
helpful.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: That's excellent. And the second quick question on it, second quick question is, on the
Windows side, any sense whether or not – we've seen obviously an improvement on the numbers on here. Do you
believe that's being driven purely by an improvement going on, on the market? It's the Windows 7 refresh accelerating
as we get closer to the day? Any sense of what the drivers are both on the Consumer and the Enterprise side as to why
we're seeing the pickup?
<A - Amy Hood>: Sure. I covered it a little bit in my comments, but it's probably worth spending a little bit more time.
[Coughing]. I apologize. Let me start with the business market. I think there really are three factors that I would point
to, particularly in the business environment, and the first one may, Mark, also help on the consumer side.
The overall macro spending environment is better. It's a little better than we thought, and in businesses we're seeing it.
You're seeing it in some of the IT spend forecasts you all put out. They're being raised, and I think that has an impact.
The second is I think our partners have done a very good job expanding the types and availability of new and
interesting hardware. That brings people to the store, and I think is an encouraging sign.
And finally, as you asked, is the end of life of XP. That is, that has been an impact. And we expect it to continue to be,
as we said, in Q3. But I wouldn't point to simply one of the factors as being the reason, but it is a combination of those
factors.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Perfect. I do appreciate it.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thank you, Mark.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Mark. We'll move to the next question, please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys and congrats on a great quarter. Just have a question back on that
Windows volume licensing side. You kind of touched on it earlier, but you saw 10% growth year-over-year this quarter
versus 6% last quarter, so you continue to have very healthy growth here. One of the questions I've been getting from
some clients is A, what's driving that and B, when we get, as we get sort of closer and then actually pass the official end
of life of XP, how do you think that's going to affect the growth in Windows licensing sort of beyond that point?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Phil. Let me – I'm going to take the opportunity to make your question two questions. One
is talk about Windows volume licensing overall and secondly allow me to talk a little bit about the places that you
could see the impact of Windows XP in the current quarter, and I think that will help as you think about Q3 going

forward.
In volume licensing you're right, it did grow 10% in Q2, and we do believe we are seeing some of the benefits of that
growth is the end of life of Windows XP. But it's also reflective of the value many of our bigger customers are seeing
in upgrading to the Enterprise version of Windows. The Enterprise SKU includes things like DirectAccess, Windows
To Go, the corporate image, app blocker and those really are differentiating and they really do matter to many CIOs. So
I think specifically on VL, while end of life of XP is one component, it's certainly not the only component.
Now if I expand your question to sort of – and I think in a way John asked about it too – I mean Mark asked about it
too – is the end of life of XP. One place that we've talked about it was Windows and how does it play into the business
PC growth? The second we talked about was volume licensing, and the third, which I actually talked about in John's
question, was Office and some transactional strengths.
Some of the strengths that we saw in Office transactionally really can be linked back to the end of life of XP. As people
refresh a PC and if they're buying Pro, those people often are Office customers. And so if they tend to buy on a
transactional basis, they'd also see some impact through Office. I think you can tie that back to some of the
outperformance we saw in the quarter as well.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Phil. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you. And nice execution in the quarter. Amy, I wanted to ask if you could
share with us how you see the gross margin profile of the company changing as you continue with your journey to be a
devices and services company? And as you look out to when the transition's complete, and I know you probably don't
know when exactly that's going to occur, how do we think about what it will look like?
<A - Amy Hood>: Heather, thanks. This is one of those questions that I think is best taken in a bit of chunks. First of
all, I think if you look at our commercial segment, I'll do it all up because I think it's relatively easy with that
breakdown. In general, and you saw it this quarter, even as we continued to invest in the infrastructure to support our
cloud conversion of our commercial customers to Azure and Office 365 and CRM Online, our actual gross margin
remained flat which means we're increasing our utilization and growing gross margin in the commercial cloud business
as we continue to see traction.
Over time, I continue to believe our commercial business in the absolute moving to the cloud is a net positive, as we
talked about before, to overall profit, including increasing the amount of gross margin we make as a company. So that,
I think, this quarter was 83%-ish. So that I would take as a separate bucket from our devices and consumer business.
And now what's interesting is we have a couple of business models there with different gross margin profiles, and
you're actually seeing the impact of some of that in this quarter.
Xbox, as we know, especially with new consoles, like the One, tends to be gross margin negative on the front. This is a
heavy quarter for that. Over time through the attach, first, second and third party games and other services that margin
profile with any console life changes. But it's never going to be at 83% gross margin. It's just a different business even
for the market leader and even successfully generating cash and returns.
That is different from other businesses we also have in D&C. So I think the important thing that I tend to focus on as I
go through all these businesses is continued margin improvement within the business, continued efficiency within the
business, and continued focus on the absolute profit within each of those areas. And then the mix then becomes more of
a math equation as we continue to grow the overall amount of cash and profits the company generates.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Hi, Amy. Just back on contracted not billed, you had four quarters over $21 billion and then
jumping up obviously north of $23 billion. That jump that happened can you just help us understand what the buckets
that made that jump up this quarter? Is there an easier way to think through where that actually came from?
<A - Amy Hood>: Yes. Yes and no, of course. Brent, let me say, contracted but not billed is related to the number of
expirations we have in the quarter. Chris and I think I both talked about we did have a lot of expirations in the quarter.
When those tend to fall at the end, it can impact the actual magnitude is the absolute number of expirations and then
that timing of when those fall in the quarter can also impact how it's recognized. And that's why I never really look at it
separately from unearned bookings and renewals together. And so because timing is one thing, that's why I tend to put
them in a bucket and say together it's a good and healthy trajectory.
<Q - Brent Thill>: And just real quick on the multiyear agreements you mentioned the healthy renewals. Any color
you can add to the re-up on the size of what you're seeing in general across some of those bigger multiyear agreements?
<A - Amy Hood>: I think in general, it reflects the same trends we've been seeing. It's across our broad portfolio. You
see it across Windows, Office and Server. If you look at our KPIs I think that points out that it's pretty broad based. So
I don't think there's any one particular area I would call out. It's really more about platform health and commitment.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Thanks. A question on the consumer retail side. This is the first year I think you've
had full retail store presence. You also, I believe, had some presence in some of the Best Buys with sort of mini stores
in there. And I'm wondering sort of what your takeaway is from the holiday season and if those efforts you think were
part of the reason why you think you had a successful holiday season especially on the PC side and what that
experience suggests that you should do in future in terms of retail store build out and general investment around retail?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Walter. When we talk about improved retail execution, I really think that's a partnership, as
you said, with retailers, with our OEMs, and with our efforts to really improve both the devices, the assortment and the
experience of buying in the PC aisle. So I do feel good about the investments we've made there. And we've made them,
I think, thoughtfully and continue to keep a focus on cost and expense as we do that. So do I think it had an impact? I
do. But I really think the broader impact was investments and commitments we had with our partners to also improve
the retail buying experience.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you for taking my question and very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into gross
margins in the quarter because by my estimates you guys outperformed the guidance for gross margins that you gave in
the quarter. Despite the fact that you saw significant outperformance in D&C hardware, which as you were saying
especially for something like Xbox One which is just out of the gate, really had expectations of being very low if not
negative gross margins. Can you help us understand a little bit of where that gross margin outperformance came from?
Was any of that in D&C hardware getting better yields or sort of better gross margins on those products than your
expectations? And if not, where did the outperformance come from?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Keith. I'm glad you asked that question. With our outperformance, as you pointed out, in
D&C hardware, we did actually see increased COGS related to that. However, that was offset by some COGS
improvements and savings we saw across other areas as we continue to focus on efficiency and execution, and so
you're right. We did see COGS grow with hardware, but we were able to find savings elsewhere as we focused on
improved execution.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Keith.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Thanks a lot. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Yeah. Thanks. Congratulations on the margins, cost management and execution, and also,
Amy, I think we all appreciate your very substantive answers to the questions. Just a follow up to an earlier question on
the contracted but unbilled, we're seeing with VMware that they had a surge of three year contracts coming out of the
recession, and a lot of those are coming back for renewal now. Is that what you were suggesting is you've got an
unusually large volume of contracts coming up for renewal?
<A - Amy Hood>: Rick, that's a yes. In many ways you've seen this over covering our company for a while.
Expirations can be chunkier. That's not a year statement. This quarter we had a big expiry base. I wouldn't characterize
it as abnormally large, but the timing is a bit related to three years ago and the timing of some of the contracts. So it's
probably a consistent driver.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Okay. And last quarter we talked a bit about, are there any metrics you can help us to
understand better what the effect of your revenues is from the shift to the cloud? I think on Office it's more of a net, a
delta that I think you'd said it hurt you about $150 million in the previous quarter. Is there any way you can give us a
sense or what the net impact is on the business from the shift to the cloud?
<A - Chris Suh>: Hi, Rick. It's Chris. I think I talked about this a little bit. The place where you can see the most direct
impact is in the consumer Office business. We talked about the business on a traditional license basis being down 24
points, but what our estimate is approximately 16 points of that decline is accounted for by the shift to Office 365
Home Premium. So that gives you sort of a good estimation of the impact, the direct impact we're seeing particularly
on the consumer side.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: That implies it would only be down about 8% were it not for the shift to the cloud?
<A - Chris Suh>: That's one way to look at it. Yeah, the net number would be about 8%.

Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Edward Maguire>: Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about Phone because you have not discussed Windows
Phone on the call so far. Just how it's tracking based on your expectations? Whether you are planning on continuing to
invest with non-Nokia OEMs? And also, Amy, whether any of your expectations or investment plans for the integration
with Nokia have changed in any meaningful way since you announced the deal? Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Ed. That's a good point. We didn't have a chance to discuss the Phone results. We did see
growth in Windows Phone both in the licensing and in the mobile phone IP revenues. Both grew this quarter. I think
regarding Nokia, we continue to see the growth in many of the places we've seen it historically, so unsubsidized
markets, as well as with entry level smartphone devices. So I think many of those dynamics haven't really changed.
Do I have any updates how to think about Nokia other than we continue to expect it to close in the quarter? I don't. We
mostly remain focused on working hard to get to the point where we're working together as one team to drive that
business forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much, Amy, and I appreciate the fact that you're trying to improve
the margins in each of the commercial and the consumer businesses, but the margin differential between these two
businesses still is a pretty wide one. It looks like the Consumer business is growing, the two dynamics that I can see of
the Consumer business, the three are, one is the margin differential is still wide. You're trying to improve it. The
margin difference is still wide. The Consumer business trend-wise is growing faster than Commercial. And third is that
you have the shift to the cloud. So unless you do something like an Adobe or Autodesk where you force the transition
to happen very quickly, there's the risk that you get a lot of growth, which is fantastic, there's a lot of progress to share,
but the margin inflection point could be delayed for several years. So I think that was one of the questions that was
spurred behind I think presumably Heather's question. So that's what I'm trying to get at. So how long are you going to
get this shift to result in a way that we may not see the earnings growth rate, but we may have to wait until some point
in time or are you at the point where you can actually force the shift to happen much quicker? Thank you very much.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Kash. I think – the way I think about it is, we are – we have a broad portfolio, and we
address customers of all types. And in many ways, our biggest goal is to meet the needs of our customers, whether they
be CIOs or consumers. And setting our business model to support the products and the adoption curve that we want
needs to be married with the adoption curve and timing of our customers.
I feel like we've done a very good job of balancing the pace of that. I've been encouraged by the pace of adoption of
many of our cloud services. You've heard the Home Premium numbers today as well as talking about the commercial
cloud. And so for me, it's hard to say is there too big of a delta. It's really about managing each of these things toward
absolute growth and absolute improvement and having customer adoption. So I probably just have a different

Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks a lot and my congratulations as well. Amy, you said that Office 365 Home Premium
was more than 15% of total Consumer Office licenses sold. And I wonder as you think about your Commercial
business, and we either think about it as a percentage of total Office 365 or as a percentage of maybe what's
traditionally been transactional, whether you have a similar metric in terms of percentage of total Office licenses sold?
<A - Amy Hood>: Actually, that's a good question. We only recently started selling the Office Client in our volume
licensing agreements through a subscription. So that is actually good feedback for us to think going forward about
talking about the Office-specific business that way. Because in general, we think of Office 365 as being a broad set of
assets including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and Office in the Commercial business, and we haven't really talked
about it given the newness of the model in the Enterprise as being as meaningful as it has been in the Consumer. The
shift's far faster there on the Client.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Yeah, I just think that would be helpful, especially if you think about it with respect to your
traditional Commercial transactional business. Maybe if I could slip in one other one, just to go back on the
contracted-not-billed, I just want to be clear in my own mind because I've heard two things. One thing I heard you say
was we had stronger transactional business late in the quarter, but I also heard you say that there were frankly more
renewals on multi-year that would have resulted in that balance going up, especially if those were late in the quarter. So
am I right to think it's those two factors that are at play here, both stronger transactional and a larger pool, if you will,
of multi-year renewals? And is it relatively evenly balanced between the two? Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks. Actually, Transactional execution in the quarter is recognized all in-quarter. That's not
annuity, it doesn't go to either the unearned balance or the contracted-not-billed balance, so that's not an impact that
results in a change to your unearned or CNB. The latter, which is the absolute size of the expiration base, frankly could
or couldn't impact CNB. It can impact things like unearned growth, but it also can impact CNB depending on if it's
contracted in quarter but not billed until after the end of the quarter.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: That's really helpful.

have the scale to make some money?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Brad. When we launched Surface just a year ago, our goal was really to create a product
that showcased what can happen when you innovate in hardware, in the service and in the software. And as you know
we've learned a lot over the course of this journey, and we have to make more meaningful progress. But I think for us
we've remained focused as we launched the second version of Surface to stay focused on both price point and gross
margin. And I think we've made a big leap from V1 to V2, and I look forward to making leaps as we go forward in our
product roadmap. But I do think it's more to think about it as a goal we absolutely have as we continue to innovate the
line.

<Q - Gregg S. Moskowitz>: Hi. Thank you very much. Amy, despite the healthy gross margins your Xbox platform
revenue grew $1.2 billion year-over-year but your related cost of goods sold went up by $1.6 billion. And I realize
there may be additional costs related to launch, but just wondering if you can talk to expected profitability levels for
Xbox over the balance of fiscal 2014?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks. We'll continue to be in launch mode for Xbox One especially many people are excited
about the launch of Titanfall in March and we'll continue to add and expand markets over the course of the year. So I
would continue to think about our investment in being the leading next generation console is certainly extending.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Brendan J. Barnicle>: Thanks so much. Amy, you mentioned briefly in your comments some of the strength
you'd seen in SQL Server and that seems to be taking market share. You highlighted a couple of the features, but what
do you think's driving that market share gain? And a similar question over on the server side where you seem to have
better server numbers than what we've seen in units. What would be accounting for that additional strength?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thank you. You're right. I only pointed out a few of the value props of SQL Server. And actually
dating back years, the real value prop of SQL has been the breadth of its offerings: analytics, reporting, and core
database functionality. And so over the years I think the balance of those things and continuing to add and innovate at
very good value, has continued to be appealing. As we move forward and add some cloud capabilities into our hybrid
model and continue to add features into the premium levels, when you're the established and I think in many ways, unit
leader, then you can focus on continuing to move up the stack, adding value and increasing your premium mix. And the
team has really done a terrific job of doing that so it's nice to be asked so that I can talk about it.
And I think I mentioned it briefly, but Systems Center is another where we've gained share in virtualization. And I
think we're quite proud of the progress we've made, especially in that area and that's enabled a lot of growth as well. So
