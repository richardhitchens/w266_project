Ajaypal Singh Banga
Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody.
We had a good third quarter. We saw net revenue growth of 13%, along with net income and EPS growth rates of 15%
and 19% respectively. So we delivered another quarter of strong results and we have continued the momentum you've
seen from us over the course of this year, as we are navigating through what I think everybody would agree is a mixed
global economic environment.
So let's take a look at the underlying global economic trends for the quarter, and let's start in the U.S. and there the
recovery continues. Our SpendingPulse data showed sustained growth over the course of 2014. U.S. retail sales,
ex-automobiles, in the third quarter were up 4.2% and that was a higher number than the second quarter growth of
3.8%. However, the monthly growth trend showed some deceleration with several sectors: Lodging, Furniture,
Furnishings, Grocery, experiencing some noticeable slowdowns in September. So these are mixed trends in the U.S.
But overall, the underlying indications appear positive and October's Consumer Confidence Index is up over September
as well. Excluding the impact of the Chase de-conversion in both the second and third quarters our core U.S. GDV
[Gross Dollar Volume] growth rate was roughly the same.
Europe's recovery slowed in the third quarter. Annual PCE growth projections have been revised down from 3.5% to
3.1%, and our SpendingPulse data for the U.K. also showed third quarter retail sales, ex-auto growth, slowed to 2.9%
down from the 4.8% growth that we saw in the second quarter. Consumer confidence, economic sentiment also down
slightly, but unemployment levels continued to show improvement across the region. MasterCard's total European
volume growth for the third quarter was in the low-teens and processed transaction growth in the high-teens, about the
same as the last quarter. And the region's growth was driven been by a number of countries, including Russia, Turkey
and Sweden.
In Latin America, our third quarter SpendingPulse data for Brazil showed retail sales growth of 2.4%, down from 4.1%
in the second quarter. Across the region, annual GDP growth expectations were also revised down from 2.3% to 1.3%.
The primary exception in this whole thing is Mexico, where they continue to benefit from improving exports to the
U.S., and our business in the region remains solid. Third quarter GDV and processed transaction growth is in the
mid-teens, again, about the same as last quarter.
In Asia Pacific, there is a decline in business sentiment in the third quarter, mostly because of everybody being
concerned about the economic slowdown of China. But consumer confidence held steady. And our business in the
region continues to do well. GDV growth in the mid-teens, processed transaction growth in the mid 20's in the third
quarter, down slightly from last quarter.
In summary, the economic environment is mixed. The U.S. is in relatively decent shape. We've got some challenges in
Europe and Brazil that we will keep our eye on, but we're not seeing anything to cause any immediate concern, and you
will hear that from Martina when she updates you on our October trend volumes.
So before we go to our business highlights, a couple of legal and regulatory matters. First of all, nothing to report new
on the European legislation. The Council of Ministers continues their discussions regarding the proposed legislation.
We remain actively engaged with all parties. We still believe that the proposed legislation is most likely to be adopted

sometime in the first half of 2015.
Now, Russia, as you know, there's new amendments to the National Payments law. These have just recently been
signed into law. What those amendments do is principally two things and the first is that the deadline for compliance
has now been extended further to March 31, 2015, and the second is related to local processing.
As you know, the original law required us to find a local processing partner for domestic transactions, and we had
begun to do that through an RFP process. The new amendments clarify that the local processing partner will now be the
central bank's new domestic switch. So we clearly need to work out all the operational details to connect to this new
switch, but nothing else has really changed in terms of being able to issue MasterCard branded cards to use in the
Russian market or, for that matter, the potential financial impact of this new law for us.
If you recall in the last quarter earnings call, we had given some idea of the dimensions of that financial impact, and our
best estimate continues to be something less than $50 million on an annualized basis.
You've probably also seen some recent news stories about the Chinese government announcing that it will allow
qualified domestic and foreign companies to apply for domestic bank card switching in China. This is the first of many
steps. We don't yet know what it will take to become a qualifying institution, nor do we know what the broader
regulatory framework will look like. And of course as of right now, no indication of timing. So while we're awaiting all
these details, the fact is we're pleased with the announcement. We see it as a good step in the right direction. So with
that, let me move on to some of our recent business activity.
You've kind of heard from us during the recent investor days in September and you've had an opportunity to see
firsthand a number of the product and service innovations we're rolling out, so rather than go back over the deals and
the innovations, I'm only going to pick a few items that we may not have talked about in those investor days.
A year ago on this call we talked about tokenization, the development that everybody was focused on in the area of
payment safety and security. We talked about how we were working with a broader group that included technology
companies and merchants and trying to create better consumer and merchant experiences while ensuring safer and more
secure transactions.
And so the recent launch of Apple Pay will only help with the convergence of the physical and digital worlds. And we
are actually pleased to be working in partnership with Apple. They're using our digital technology and our security
protocol to enable MasterCard credit and debit card holders to use Apple Pay. It is the simplicity of Apple Pay that
makes it attractive, the ability to make a payment with as little as your fingerprint. We've worked closely with Apple
over the last two years and helped them deliver a user-friendly, safe payment experience that provided the most secure
combination of payment technologies available, and more issuers continue to sign-up. I think the most current number
is something like 500 and it's growing.
Now of course Apple Pay has garnered a lot of attention. However, there are many other elements of mobile payments
and we're working with all of them. Our strategy has been to work with all players to ensure that we have the
capabilities to meet the needs of different market models and make choices available to consumers.
So as most consumers have a phone, a number of them have PC, a tablet, a game system, a connected appliance and
increasingly, connected cars. So our innovation is using MasterPass, our own design to work across all of those
devices, as many of you saw last month at our investor days. You saw a number of those devices actually in operation.
So remember, the tokenization used by all of these digital payment options is based on an industry open standard that
the networks have developed together.
As a result, others will be able to leverage this technology to enable secure digital transactions across any device. Think
of it like EMV, an open industry standard that allows all issuers to issue cards with chips that conform to that open
industry standard. That's what this tokenization is all about.
Now all of these new mobile payment options are putting more focus on contactless, and we continue to drive
contactless technology which is a key component of our cash displacement efforts. Momentum is building globally.
Old terminals are being replaced with new ones that are contactless enabled while being installed. Australia is leading

in the adoption of contactless payments, more than half of all face-to-face transactions under 100 Australian dollars are
now contactless.
We're also seeing progress in countries such as Canada, in Turkey, in Poland. And just recently in the UK we worked
with Transport for London to expand contactless payments to the Underground, enabling commuters to use their credit,
debit and pre-paid cards across London's entire transit system.
In the first two weeks alone, over 1 million contactless journeys were taken. And this just adds to the list of transit
agencies around the world whom we are collaborating with. We're trying to use our thought leadership in the transit
space to migrate their riders from cash to electronic payments.
Apple Pay and Transport for London are just a couple of the recent examples of how we are creating better shopping
experiences for our card holders using contactless technology. As you know, we just opened our new technology hub in
New York City earlier this month, and we just continue to invest in innovation designed to make payments easier and
safer.
There are a couple of examples that demonstrate how we're creating a better cross-border shopping experience. In this
quarter we announced a partnership with Transforex. This is a company that is working with seven leading tax groups
in China to launch the largest tax refund platform in China. Chinese travelers leave as much as €3 billion worth of tax
refunds unclaimed. The idea is this new platform will make the tax refund process much easier for the Chinese traveler
by enabling them to receive their refund back to their MasterCard and do it all from the comfort of their own home
when they return from their trip.
In South Africa, our prepaid program manager, Access Prepaid Worldwide, is working with the VAT refund
administrator of the South African Revenue Service to migrate their single currency refund card to a full currency
MasterCard prepaid program, allowing tourists to reclaim their VAT as they leave the country. So that's just two
examples in that tax refund space.
Finally, our work with governments continues to grow. We've talked about this a few times in the context of
developing markets and financial inclusion. We actually do a lot of work with governments in the developed markets as
well.
So for example, the UK government has awarded the Royal Bank of Scotland the contract for their e-purchasing card.
Over the next two years, all 17 central government departments, the Ministry of Defense and some regional
governments will migrate their existing government purchasing cards to MasterCard's Purchase and Pay solution; it
kind of combines our Multi Card, Smart Data and InControl technologies.
And of course, we're continuing to add programs focused on financial inclusion in the developing markets, and I'll give
you a couple of examples. In Mexico, BANSEFI is converting their entire 6.5 million social benefits card portfolio to
MasterCard debit, and that's going to be enabled with the EMV chip technology. And in Africa, EcoCash, which is a
mobile money provider in Zimbabwe, launched a MasterCard companion debit card that's linked to their mobile money
wallet, the first in Africa, by the way. The card will be issued to more than three million EcoCash customers, making it
the largest rollout of EMV cards in Zimbabwe to date.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics.
Martina?
Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.
Let me begin on Page three of our slide deck where you see the as reported as well as FX adjusted growth rates. All of
my comments pertain to the FX adjusted figures which are essentially the same as our as-reported numbers.

We are very pleased to deliver strong performance again this quarter. Net revenue growth was 13%. This combined
with operating expense growth of 12% and a lower tax rate resulted in a 15% increase in net income. EPS growth was
19%, and share repurchases contributed $0.04 per share. During the third quarter, we purchased 5.3 million shares at a
cost of approximately $400 million, which reflects the slower pace of buybacks we expected.
Through October 23, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $120 million, and we
now have $310 million remaining under the current authorization. We continue to look to repurchase shares on an
opportunistic basis.
Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid
investments of about $6.3 billion.
So let me turn to page four where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Our worldwide Gross Dollar
Volume, or GDV, was up 12% on a local currency basis, down slightly from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew
7% which was down from last quarter. On the credit side, volume growth was 7%, down from last quarter, primarily
due to the Chase de-conversion. Similar to last quarter, our U.S. debit growth was 8%.
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis and continues to be driven by APMEA.
Cross-border volume grew 15% on a local currency basis, and that's just slightly lower than the 16% we saw in the
second quarter. Growth in Europe and APMEA was in the mid to high teens. Key contributors to this growth included
the U.K., Germany, Italy and Sweden. The deceleration of cross-border volume growth in markets like Canada, China
and Russia continued into the third quarter.
Turning to page five, you see processed transactions grew 10% globally to almost $11 billion. We continued to see
double-digit growth in most regions. Growth was down from the 12% we saw in the second quarter, primarily due to
the U.S. and Latin America. Globally, the number of cards grew 8% with 2.1 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded
cards.
Let's turn to page six for some highlights on a few of our revenue line items. Overall net revenue growth was 13%. In
total, acquisitions contributed 3 PPT [percentage points] to our net revenue growth. Domestic assessments grew 7%
while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 5 PPT gap is primarily due to the lower than average revenue yields in many
markets outside of the U.S., due to market structure, domestic payment schemes, or higher proportional cash volumes.
This is similar to what we've seen in prior quarters.
Cross-border volume fees grew 13%, while cross-border volume grew 15%. The gap between revenue and volume
growth continues to be due, for the most part, to the higher mix of intra-European activity. But the gap is narrower this
quarter versus what we saw in recent quarters due to better mix with an increase in the proportion of Europeans
travelling outside of Europe versus within Europe.
Transaction processing fees grew 13% primary driven by the 10% growth in processed transactions. And other
revenues grew 38%, driven largely by contributions from our Pinpoint acquisition as well as our Advisors business.
Moving on to page seven, you can see that total operating expenses was up 12% in the quarter, in line with our
expectations. Of this growth, 9 PPT was due to expenses related to the acquisitions along with our majority-owned
HomeSend investment and they're primarily in the G&A line.
Now, when looking just at the 14% growth in G&A, our acquisitions contributed 11 PPT to the total growth, and the
balance was driven mainly by the organic investments we're making in strategic initiatives.
And finally, the $19 million increase in D&A versus the same period last year continues to be the result of our growing
level of capital expenditures, principally due to the additional investments in technology to support our strategic
initiatives. But also includes the impact of the amortization of intangible assets related to our recent acquisitions.
Turning to slide eight, let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are up,
compared to the third quarter. All of this has been factored into our full year outlook. The numbers through October 21
are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, up one percentage point from the third

quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 7%. That's very similar to what we saw last quarter.
Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, about 2 PPT higher than the third quarter, primarily due to
improvements that we see in Europe and in Latin America. Part of this is at attributable to one of our deal wins in the
Nordics as well as overall volume increases in both regions.
Globally, processed transaction growth was 11%, one PPT higher than what we saw in the third quarter, also driven by
improvements in Europe and in Latin America. And with respect to cross- border, our volumes grew at 17% globally,
about 2 PPT higher than the third quarter, driven by improvements in Europe. And we saw strong growth across most
major markets, including contributions from online travel programs.
Looking forward, let's start with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period, which remain
unchanged. We continue to believe that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20%
EPS CAGR. We are also committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. Remember, these objectives
are on a constant currency basis and exclude new M&A activities.
Moving on, let me offer some commentary about full year 2014 which is mostly unchanged from my comments last
month at our investor day. Our expectation for full year net revenue growth before any contribution from acquisitions is
now slightly better than the low end of our three-year range we previously thought due to our better than expected third
quarter revenue performance, primarily due to higher underlying volume and transactions.
Additionally, while the pace of the Chase card attrition year-to-date has been essentially in line with our internal
projections, the volume shift has been a bit slower than we initially anticipated. Therefore, we now estimate less than
half of the volume to roll-off this year with the remainder in 2015. We continue to expect about 1 PPT contribution to
our 2014 as reported net revenue growth from our M&A transactions.
Overall, we haven't changed our view about total operating expense growth for full year 2014 from what we said last
month at Investor Day. We expect the as reported growth rate for full year 2014 to be in the low-teens after considering
the impact from M&A activities. And this does include high-teens growth in G&A and D&A growth in the 25% range.
Again, totally in keeping with what we discussed previously. Our view of potential EPS dilution from the five M&A
deals also previously discussed continues to be about $0.05 annually for each of 2014 and 2015.
You should now assume a full year tax rate of slightly below 32%. The change in outlook is primarily due to our third
quarter tax rate coming in lower than we expected, due to some discrete benefits that only became known as we
finalized the quarter. And as I've said before, although the exact timing is uncertain, there may be some potential to
lower our tax rate further as we continue to work on several initiatives geared at better aligning our tax structure with
our non-U.S. business footprint.
Finally, with respect to FX in 2014, if the rates for our functional currencies remain similar to where they are today, so
that's the euro trading at the $1.27 level and the Brazilian real at the R$2.44 level for the rest of the year, the net impact
of the euro and the real would be a slight headwind for the full year.
Further, beyond the functional currency impact of the euro and the real, we have already seen a 1 PPT headwind to net
revenue growth year-to-date from other currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar and the euro. As I have said
before, we carefully manage those exposures, but we have also assumed some impact for the rest of this year which
will likely continue into 2015.
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session.
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks. Good morning. It looks like your revenues for dollar of volume reached an all-time high
this quarter. Can you remind us of how you think about this metric and how sustainable it is at these levels?
And then separately I was hoping that, you know there's been some evidence of competition becoming more intense in
the co-brand base as some contracts have come up for renewal. I was hoping you could just comment on what you're
seeing there. Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: You start.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, so I'm going to take the first question, Bill.
How we look at revenues is not every revenue is driven equally. We have domestic assessment fees which are
predominantly driven by the volumes on the volume growth that we have all around the world. And there you have you
to make significant differentiation between how much is driven domestically versus how much is driven cross-border,
so the mix is very important on that.
Secondly, in a number of countries we're actually processing most of the volume, and that is when we get an additional
transaction processing fee, but there are a number of countries where we are not processing the volume, so that is also
driving the mix in terms of how much we are processing in a country and where you see the growth in that, versus
where we are not processing and where you're seeing the growth in that. That is very much an impact.
Further, on this quarter's numbers, you did also see an impact on the recent – from the recent acquisitions that we did
and you see that in the other revenue line item which increased by 38% and that is mostly driven by the terrific
acquisition down in Australia, the company is called Pinpoint and is a play in the loyalty space.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: This is Ajay. About the co-brand space, actually the co-brand space has been pretty
competitive for quite a while. You've heard us talk about it a number of times in earnings calls about how we're going
about trying to be players there and win there regularly and we've been winning a number of deals.
In fact, I didn't mention it this time because of the investor day period, and then we've talked about this for a little
while. But for example, we won REI over the course of this quarter as another one. Every quarter there are deals that
come and go in the U.S. and overseas and that is a competitive space. There is nothing new in that space.
I think the one development that's interesting in that space that's happened over time is that more and more the
merchant-driven co-brands tend to be driven with an issuer and the network as being separately approached during the
course of the program process. Years ago it used to be that they were done together. That's kind of a trend that's pretty
much changed, particularly in the U.S., not so much overseas.
So it's a competitive space and it's a space that you have to be very careful about both in terms of pricing, but also in
terms of the value-added features that you can bring to the party when you try and go win that co-brand. And you
know, it's kind of, win some, you won't win all of them, so nothing new in that space.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question, please.

<Q - Smitti Srethapramote>: Yes. Thank you. Maybe a follow-up on the other revenue line item. Can you just help us
maybe rank order the various pieces of the businesses that are in there? You know: loyalty, Advisors, data analytics,
prepaid, you know, from maybe largest to smallest?
And also, just wanted to get some, you know, additional perspective on how meaningful data analytics is to the revenue
contribution today, given the progress that you've highlighted at the analyst day on this front.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Look, Smitti, the other revenue line item is driven by a lot of different things. Certainly
some of the items that you have been calling out, i.e. our loyalty business, and it's not just the Pinpoint business, we
have actually a very thriving big loyalty business across the board in a number of our regions, is one of the big drivers
in there. Our Advisors business, which actually consists of three different pieces, quite a few of the revenues that are
related to those pieces both in the consulting side as well as in the data side is actually related to that. And then we have
a number of other businesses, a little bit from the program management that we're doing out of Access Prepaid, et
cetera, that are actually driving that line item and I'm very pleased to say, actually, that all of those businesses are

Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Thank you. Just on the Apple Pay, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of
color on what you've seen from your customers in uploading? And then how do you balance working with Apple Pay
and with your MasterPass product and with other wallets, how – are there conflicts in there that you have, and so that
would be helpful, a little more color on that? Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So, Bob, it's Ajay. The people signing up for Apple Pay is actually pretty good. I'd say
the first few weeks have been very encouraging. If you've been to the Giants game and the Kansas City Royals game in
the San Francisco stadium, which, unfortunately, I didn't go to see even though I was hanging around in San Francisco,
but I've met a number of people who've been there. We were using and demonstrating the work of Apple Pay for
purchasing in the stadium with advertising, with activities and promotions going on in there.
So there's a lot going on in the Apple Pay space right now. I don't know that I would sort of agree that it conflicts with
the stuff that we're doing in anywhere else in mobile. I think you have to think of mobile and digital as a very wide
space.
Look, there are many different aspects to it. One aspect to it is are you going to put your credentials on the phone like
in Apple, or are you going to do it through Host Card Emulation, which is what many others will do, or are you going
to do it through NFC, like Apple, or is it in-app like Apple, or is it browser-based like others? There are so many
elements to mobile and digital commerce that I wouldn't call it conflicts. I'd rather think that there's a lot of opportunity
and a lot of open space.
The objective of MasterPass, MasterPass is not just a wallet, by the way. Please don't think of it like somebody else's
wallet. It's not. MasterPass is a broad set of technologies. It's got wallets, yes, which are both wallet branded as
MasterPass but also a wallet service for our issuers and merchants. We do value-added services in MasterPass; loyalty
programs will be in there. In the future there will be new additive ideas in that, private label cards could be in there,
in-store checkout is coming in there, online is already there with MasterPass. It's got a bunch of things in it. And those
full elements of the MasterPass strategy is what we are rolling out around the world.
We are now in 11 countries, the U.S. plus ten others: Australia, Canada, China, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Africa, yak-yak, U.K., others. We are entering Taiwan soon. So we're in a number of countries with
MasterPass. We're working with different banks of different sizes in these countries, ranging from the Commonwealth
Bank and Westpac in Australia and New Zealand to BMO in Canada, with Citibank and credit unions in the U.S. to
Standard Bank in South Africa.

So it's got all that going on. There's 40,000 plus merchants signed up. I kind of see this as being a series of parallel
activities which are all aimed at providing choices to consumers. And, once you do that, then they're going to vote with
their wallets and their feet on where they go and we want to be able to be the provider of that space. We're not in the
consumer business directly. We are a B2B2C company and therefore we are trying to be that in every piece of work we

Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Thank you. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. Just to start, can you just clarify what the cross-border volume growth
ex-Western Europe would have been, and then can you separately clarify your stance on when you might implement
tokenization pricing? We know that you've got the rate card out there but your biggest competitors obviously said
they're waiving those fees through 2015, so just wondering if the same is true for MasterCard.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, on the latter question, it's exactly the same. And on the first question, from a
cross-border ex-Europe, typically we don't give these numbers, but it's not too different if you're actually excluding
Europe, for the MasterCard volume side.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay. So you're waiving your pricing through 2015 as well?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yeah, that's actually out in the market. We said we'd only put it in there starting at the
end of 2015. We put a rate card that said we'll do it early 2016.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Exactly.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So that's not new news, Jason.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. Just on the cross-border growth rate. I think you mentioned, Martina, earlier,
that the spread had narrowed a bit more because of the mix in terms of intra-Europe versus people from travelling from
Europe elsewhere, so that's good to see. If you could touch on, were there still any lingering additional pricing changes
in that line?
And then maybe if you could just comment on the potential for a merchant assessment change on the horizon as well?
Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah. So first of all, on the pricing side, there is no impact from pricing in that line
item, and, in fact, when you look at our entire revenue growth, there is really no material impact at all from pricing.
As most of you know, our main pricing actions that we took some time ago have been pretty much all lapping with the
second quarter of 2014. So you're just not seeing that in this quarter at this point in time.
In terms of future pricing actions, first of all, we are not going after pricing in order to make our top line, so when you
actually look at the 2013 to 2014, or 2015 long term performance objectives, we have relatively small line pricing
embedded in that, and if there were to be any changes, you know, we'll be talking about it when they were to be evident
in our financials. But we don't really see anything at this point in time.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: You've just got to remember, we've got, tons of lines of pricing in the system. And
there's some pricing work going on in every country while we speak. Pricing is a part of the way we approach the entire
marketplace. But I wouldn't tell you that there's some strategic plan to put in some new price starting on a particular
date next year kind of stuff. That's not currently in our outlook.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, just want to ask on the Chase card transition, are we a quarter of the way through that or
just trying to get a sense of that through the third quarter 2014?
And then, secondly, on FX, Martina, maybe you could just help us to make sure we got it right. Are we looking at two
to three points in the fourth quarter for FX headwind? And then if rates held today, I just want to start to set our models
for next year, is it about a similar two to three point FX headwind for next year as well? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Your first question was?
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Just on Chase migration.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So first of all...
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Just want to make sure where we are so far.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Okay. On the Chase migration, so what we said actually for when you look at all of
2014, we'll probably have less than half of the Chase volume rolling off. So you would still have some impact for 2015.
The way that it has been rolling off, as we said before, we didn't see much in the first and the second quarter. We saw
more in the third quarter. And I think you should see more in the fourth quarter. This is all subject to our own
estimation. We don't really have a schedule from the customer. But this is the best that we can at least get our hands
around it based on what we see today.
From an FX point of view, for the fourth quarter, we are going to see a little bit of an impact on two things, One, from a
functional currency point of view, you're going to see about a two to three PPT impact on all line items. And then from
a local currency point of view, so those are the currency rates other than the euro and the real, so those are all of the
foreign exchange payers that are excluded on that versus the U.S. dollar and versus the euro. We think we're going to
probably see another one PPT impact for the fourth quarter, and that's very similar to what we saw in the first, second
and third quarter.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: And then into the 2015, if rates stayed the same?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, you should expect some headwind, of course, given the strength of the U.S.
dollar versus many currencies in the world.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Thanks. Good morning. You've had quite an impressive success in gaining share in Western
Europe during the past year or two. Is there any way to talk about this in the context of how MasterCard has been
competing against Visa Europe and have they been losing market share to MasterCard? Any color on that would be
helpful. Thanks.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: That's been going on for a few years. I think if you looked at whatever public
information that is available for Visa Europe, and there is some available, you'd find that they themselves talk about
losing share to us in the course of the last couple of years there.
How we're competing, it's not just Visa Europe. We're competing around the world with a series of different things. But
obviously everybody starts with a conversation around what's the financial impact for anyone at the other end of this
deal. So we've tried to talk about all of the things we do with advisors, all of the things we do with data, all the things
that we can do with loyalty and rewards, and now processing. If you look at our strategic plan, it is to add all of those
value-added services so we can be of better service to the issuing community. And Europe is reflective of that very
approach.
And if you look at the acquisitions we are doing, we've had success in acquiring stuff in Europe as well, both in the
prepaid program space as well as in the space of loyalty and rewards and that's what we're up to. It's pretty much the
same around the world.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: All right. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim E. Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Understanding that it's very early days with
respect to China and there's still a lot of details to understand, can you maybe share with us your approach to the overall
Chinese market and how that might differ from other geographies, specifically the existence of UnionPay and new
entrants like Alipay in that market and how you might plan to attack the market generally speaking from a top level
perspective?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Over the last couple of years what we've done there three or four years now is that before
the full announcement, what we were allowed to do was to do no domestic processing but we were clearly the
co-branded card is what you could do with China UnionPay so that when Chinese traveled overseas they could use
their cards. Over the last few years, all the new co-brand cards that were being announced, I think we were the winner
in the overwhelming majority of them, I'm talking 90-plus% of those deals over the last few years. And that's helped us
a great deal in terms of changing our market share on the ground on cards issued in China, where the flow of new cards
issued was all coming our way when they were co-brand.
In the meanwhile, China UnionPay both operates in China and also had begun to strike over the last many years,
bilateral deals for acceptance outside of China. The impact of those depends on the marketplace. Whereas Hong Kong,
they're obviously stronger there, if it's the United States, way weaker.
So in addition to the fact that we have to compete on the ground in China, you have to be thoughtful about what is
going on with these bilateral acceptance deals. And we went and struck partnerships with China UnionPay to help them
with expanding some acceptance in return for expanding our acceptance in China, so when someone like you went
there, your MasterCard, which I hope you carry, issued here, was being used in China in as many places as possible.
That's kind of the way we were working, kind of like a partner but with the clear acknowledgement that they were in a
position that gave them a monopoly benefit inside of China, and yet were an interesting partner to play with. That's the
way we were approaching China. Meanwhile, we were also dealing with the Alibabas and the Alipays and the Tencents
of the world and in fact, we signed – worked with Alibaba and Alipay where we were helping them think about
cross-border acceptance on their websites and helping them tackle fraud and counterfeit goods on their websites and so
on.
Now, what that changes with this announcement, it doesn't change yet. The announcement just indicates the direction is
there. But remember this announcement has been awaited now for quite a few months, ever since the WTO ruling had
its deadline set up. So what's really going to matter is how they propose the regulations, what's called a qualifying

company, would we need to be constructed differently in China to be eligible to be a qualifying company or would we
be allowed to participate there with a domestic processing capability?
I don't know the answers to all that yet. But in general, we've already made a number of steps that I will not
competitively disclose that allow me to be relatively confident that when they make the right moves, we will be able to
respond. That's kind of where we are.
<Q - Jim E. Schneider>: That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: You had a question there about how does that differ from other markets. Well, there isn't
a lot of other examples where a domestically mandated monopolistic switch exists. That's not been our experience. You
could have banks coming together to create domestic debit schemes like Europe used to have in many countries which
SEPA and the Payment Systems Directive (sic) [Payment Services Directive] (46:09) have actually opened that up and
that's one of the ways they're growing in Europe is seeing more and more domestic transactions in the developed
European countries as well.
But – and then there are similar domestically handled domestic debit switches in Australia and Canada. So dealing with
domestic debit switches and domestic debit systems is something we've had experience on for 30 years. It's just that
China was uniquely different because not only did you have a domestic switch for debit, it is for every card being
processed there, issued domestically, was controlled in terms of who could handle that transaction on the ground.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the Asia Pacific market for a second. It looks like the
growth rate there slowed down a little bit, mid-teens on an FX adjusted basis, as slow as it's been, basically, since the
crisis. Is that mostly the Russia impact? I know there's also some macro weakness in that area but fundamentally do
you expect the Asia Pacific market to return to its historical stronger growth rates over the medium term or is that
market sort of structurally getting more – further along the secular shift to electronic payments and there's not as much
secular growth available? That'd be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I think secular growth in Asia is still very much available. The level of cash utilization in
the Asian market is the highest, probably, around the world, other than a few Latin American markets. China and India
are still in the 95 to 99-plus percentage of transactions being in cash. And even Japan, which is a developed country in
that part of the world, has a 75% to 80% cash percentage in its transactions in the country. So I'd be very careful to
think that secular growth in Asia is beginning to slow.
I think the real issue in Asia – by the way, when you start – when you grow at 15%, 20%, you're not growing at 21%,
22%, big deal. And just you should take that in its context. And it's still growing very rapidly. And ASEAN is probably
growing faster than mainland China, just because mainland China is genuinely facing a change, not just in its GDP
growth rate but in the manner of spending on the ground in China with all the different efforts of the leadership of the
Chinese government is putting into place on what's going on the ground.
So there's kind of two or three things going on there in China. India itself, that slowed down over the last few years. It's
actually, with the new government, it's beginning to pick up again so there's movement in economic growth indicators
around there.
There isn't much impact from Russia into Asia. That's not what I would lay as the main cause of what we're discussing.
It's both the macro growth factors of China and then at the lower level of India. ASEAN continuing to doing well.
Australia slowed a little bit over time as the commodity boom has slowed. You know Japan is going through its own
stresses and changes. But don't conclude, at least I wouldn't yet, that the secular growth rate of cash converting to
electronic in Asia is yesterday's story. I think that's tomorrow's story, yet to come.

<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Just on that topic since you mentioned it, I mean, India with its sort of plans to leverage a
national payment scheme like RuPay, and it's not clear at this point how big of a role you guys can play. How should
we be thinking about the opportunity in India? I guess my question was more about the markets like Hong Kong and
Australia that are very highly card penetrated, not thinking about India as a huge opportunity for MasterCard but maybe
that's not the correct way of thinking about it. Is India still a very much a greenfield for MasterCard?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yes.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: And we have some significant growth there, and it's, you know, it's growing actually
by quarter.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: It is. It absolutely is a significant opportunity. I mean, RuPay is not a government
mandated local monopoly, unlike China UnionPay. RuPay is an effort by the government to create a national payment
switch that operates in parallel and competitive with us and Visa and others. And clearly when you have a government
switch, they get certain benefits.
But guess what? As I was saying, we're used to dealing with domestic switches in a number of countries. That's kind of
been true for Europe for the last so many years. It's true for Mexico. It's true for Canada. It used to be the case in a
number of Latin countries. It's around the world. We do that – we can compete on a level playing field because of
technology, superior fraud capability, data analytics, the ability to do things with local banks. We can do that.
So I still consider India to be an enormous growth opportunity. Just as, by the way, I consider China to be an enormous
growth opportunity. And by the way, I consider Australia to be an enormous growth opportunity, even with the relative
penetration of cards, because even now the percentage of retail transactions in Australia that are cash versus electronic
are still in the majority. That's why contactless in Australia has been doing so well for past two years. A large number
of the retail transactions that were cash in Australia were small ticket. And Australia contactless first started doing well
in small ticket and now it's moved up. That's why I was telling you all the way up to Australian $100, more than half of
those transactions in just two years have migrated to contactless. That's almost all of it is fighting what used to be used
for cash.
So it's pretty interesting what's going on in that part of the world, as it is in other parts of the world.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: I risk a rules violation here but since you mentioned it, one more question on that topic.
Australia, is there still a surcharging headwind there or has that abated it somewhat? You know, thinking about the
small ticket transactions, you know, I've seen that 30% potentially 40% of retailers essentially surcharge in Australia. Is
that...
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: No, no, that's not true. You get surcharging in a great deal from online transactions
where people don't have much choice and that's always been an issue. But in the real world out there, yes, surcharging
is, but it's a small number. It changes over the period of quarters and I don't consider that to be an issue.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Excellent. Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: It's not what I would like to see because I believe that consumers should be able to pay
with whatever way they'd like to pay without having to face surcharges, and then by the way, the Australian Central
Bank has come back and put in restrictions on the level of surcharge for that very reason. So there's a lot of stuff going
on in the marketplace down there. And guess what? That's our life. It happens in different countries. I still consider
Australia to be a growth market.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Awesome. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Jared Maurer>: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. Two questions. Considering the slower de-conversion at
Chase, when do you now expect co-brand wins could start to offset that de-conversion?
And additionally, we saw the growth in Maestro cards continue to fall and drop to flat. Should we expect to see that
turn negative in the coming quarters? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: On the first one, Craig, we have always said that our wins in the co-brand space will be
offsetting the Chase de-conversion over time. So that we're not talking quarters, we're talking over a couple of years,
and you will see that coming in from a volume point of view, you're already seeing some of the co-brand wins actually
coming in and you will see that more coming in next year.
In terms of the growth of the Maestro card, look, the Maestro business is very good and very live, but what we are
doing around the globe is that from time to time, we are giving – we're working with our clients in terms of whether the
Maestro product is appropriate or whether they would like to go with MasterCard debit card. And you will see a
number of switches in terms of where portfolios are going simply because of the kind of product construct and services
that our customers are demanding. So that's really what you're seeing going on. That it's more switching from a
Maestro to a MasterCard debit card portfolio.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: And, Craig, I'd like to just make sure that the Chase de-conversion issue doesn't overtake
what everybody is thinking. So just try to think for a second, that co-brand cards have a certain vintage build-up. All
cards have that behavior. Chase cards were already vintage. When they go off, they go off with a certain volume spend
pattern. New cards take some time to build up to that pattern.
You will see in the number of cards being issued that the U.S. is continuing to do well. And frankly, despite losing the
Chase de-conversion of the consumer business that you're seeing, you're seeing that our GDV is still going doing okay,
that's because we're growing with the other cards as well as in the commercial space. So you know, our portfolio is a
healthy mix of many clients across many types of cards. And what we're trying to do as we win and lose clients is still
stay focused on growing the overall business in a tangible way.
That's what you're seeing. We've got 13% revenue growth this quarter. We've had good revenue growth for the past few
quarters through this so-called Chase de-conversion. And meanwhile by the way, Chase is still a very good partner on a
number of other cards they're doing with us, co-brands as well as large corporate.
So kind of life moves on from there and there are other wins that keep coming and going and that's the context in which
you should see our business portfolio. Which I know you understand, because we've traveled a couple of times and
we've talked about this, but I just want to make sure everybody on the call gets that picture.

Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hey. Good morning, guys. I had a question, one quick follow-up question on China UnionPay. I'm
wondering if you are seeing them at all in issuer negotiations outside of China. They've been making some noise,
indirectly verified by us, that they're starting to get some traction signing contracts outside of China. I'll start with that
one.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: First of all, glad to hear a woman's voice on the phone asking me a question. Honestly I
haven't seen what you're seeing. I have heard noise about it in Russia, for sure. When the whole situation with the
sanctions happened, clearly there was noise on the ground of issuers looking at the possibility. And I can understand
that at that time, although that didn't go very far and meanwhile the law changed and has amended and adapted, so I
think it depends where that goes. So I don't know.

My general perspective, bigger perspective on this is given that 85% of the world's retail transactions are still in cash,
I'm a little less fussed about every new effort being put into payments being a direct competitor as against being a part
of the whole ecosystem that must fight cash. I've been talking about this for five years. Cash is the real opportunity for
a company like us. And that's what we're focused on.
It doesn't mean I'm not competitive. Trust me, I'm very competitive on share, and you will see that growing share
quarter by quarter in markets around the world. But I don't really view each entry or exit as a direct competitive issue. I
view that as something you've got to be careful of. But you've got to also realize that a few players that are aiming at
cash is probably a good thing.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Good. And then just a quick follow-up. In the emerging market programs you're doing, like I think
the one thing you mentioned in Nigeria where you're partnering on these mobile prepaid or other types of kind of
migrating the un-banked to banked via some sort of digital prepaid model, can you give us some color on the
economics to MasterCard of those types of programs?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So, Lisa, it's Martina, let me start with that. So first of all, typically in all of these
agreements our normal pricing applies. So if you do auth, clear and settlement, if you just do and see the volume from
an assessment fee point of view, we have fewer price schedules and there are really no changes on that.
What you're going to have to only think about is when we start those kind of undertakings. So for instance, in South
Africa, where we're much further along, we have 10 million cards out there for the social program. People typically
utilize those cards in such a way that they go to the ATM and pull out cash and then they pay at the merchant. That is
typically a lower yielding transaction for us. And then over time as we are actually establishing the acceptance base in
those merchants where they could use the card, and we are have programs in place where people rather than going to
the ATM go directly to the merchant, it's safer for them, they're not carrying cash around, et cetera, et cetera, then
they're starting to go into the higher yielding transactions.
So you have to look at this as an evolution. We first develop the infrastructure. It's first being used in a lower yielding
way. You see that coming through our numbers in a number of ways. And then as we're migrating people to using the
cards at POS, you're going to see the higher yielding transactions coming through. And that is pretty much the
experience that we have had so far on all of these programs.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: The other thing I'd add is they aren't all digital, by the way. You were talking about
digital programs. They're not actually – South Africa and Nigeria are cards with a chip on them and both biometric
enabled. In South Africa it's even voice enabled to be recognized at the back office. But in Nigeria, it's a biometric card
with a chip enabled card, and the other side is the payment card. It is mobile based in some markets, but it's also card
based.
So the World Food Programme example in Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan is also a card. It just depends on
what's going on in that marketplace and its ecosystem. Building a mobile ecosystem for delivery of product to people at
the disadvantaged level, when it's part of remittances, which is what the M-Pesa type of thing is, that's not easy because
if that mobile payment isn't accepted in a shop, it's not a lot of use to the consumer.
So I'd be careful to assume it's all about mobile. I think it's about different ways of reaching these consumers and
getting them into the electronic payment system, and then the revenue dynamics, as Martina said, low in the beginning
because of higher cash use -- you'll see it in our numbers in terms of the cash transactions and lower yield on those --
and then hopefully, hopefully, over time, those people will migrate towards being more in the system and using their
cards at the point of sale. At which point of time you would see a bigger impact in our revenues.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.

<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered, but I was
hoping you could kind of give us a little more detail around the acquisition activity and how that shakes out. I mean,
Martina you had said that at least one of them was already contributing to revenue and that there still would be this EPS
dilution, but can you talk about the kind of revenue path and the earnings path as you go forward?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: We're making acquisitions for a number of reasons. Some of the reasons like the
Pinpoint acquisition as well as Provus, the processing entity that we bought in Turkey, are truly because we're building
and expanding our business, and they will be contributing over time to our top line. And what you should be expecting
from them in terms of how the loyalty space is growing, this is how Pinpoint will be growing. What we're doing in the
processing space in order to take Provus, which are connecting to our processor TREVICA in Poland together, you
should be expecting them to grow based on how the processing space and the expansion grows.
However, we also made a couple of acquisitions which have basically built our skill set, such as a company called
C-SAM where we acquired a terrific workforce, software engineers, mostly based in India, who really have a
significant skill set in the digital and in the mobile space. That did not come with a lot of revenues, but it came with a
capability that we are now using for a number of engagements in the digital and the mobile space. So clearly you will
see more expenses coming through on that and that when you put everything together, as we are in the early stages of
integration, you are seeing that $0.05 dilution in 2014 which we're expecting to be the same number in 2015.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: But some of that would have been money you would have spent any way, wouldn't it?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Exactly, exactly. That's correct.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: So you're kind of penalizing yourself a little bit?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Well, that's a good way to penalize, Martina. I love doing that. [Laughter]
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: All right. Thanks very much.
Ajaypal Singh Banga
All right. And I'll buy you a beer for that one.
So, guys, thank you all for your questions, and Lisa, thank you for yours. So I'll leave with you a few closing thoughts.
Yes, the global economic environment remains mixed, but I think we're demonstrating that we can navigate through
this a pretty well. And to this last question, you will see us continue to invest in our business, on products, on services,
on technologies, that are key to our strategy, not just organically but also through acquisitions. I really appreciate your
continued support of the company. Thank you for being on the call today.
Operator
