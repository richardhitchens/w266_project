Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Before we review this quarter's operating results, I'd like to take a
moment to acknowledge the senseless events that took place in Boston yesterday. We were deeply saddened by this
news, and our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible tragedy.
Now, turning to this quarter's results, we're pleased with our first quarter performance. The great women and men of
The Coca-Cola Company, Coca-Cola system, delivered solid performance results in line with our expectations. And on
a global basis, we once again gained value share. We have now gained global value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages for 23 consecutive quarters. In spite of the challenging global economic times of the last few
years, our people and our system's bottling partners are executing the right strategies to advance us further towards our
2020 Vision.
Since the launch of our 2020 Vision at the beginning of 2010, we've increased daily servings by more than 225 million.
We've lifted global volume and value share to the highest levels since 2003 and more than $48 billion have been added
to The Coca-Cola Company's market capitalization.
Across the system, we're continuing to invest together for a better tomorrow. In fact, we enter 2013 and the fourth year
of our journey to 2020 from a position of real strength, clearly focused and well on track to reach our goals and
objectives. And our global bottling system is healthier than ever before. The strength of our brands and the promise of
sustainable growth are fueling our bottler's efforts to become more efficient, improve capabilities and further strengthen
execution.
We're working closely with our bottling partners around the world to rapidly realize opportunities to execute with
precision and to continue winning at the point-of-sale. We're innovating and investing in the health of our brands, in
our capabilities, and in new opportunities for growth across the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage landscape.
We're leading the industry dialogue around obesity and strengthening the sparkling category by bringing forward new
packaging choices, transparency in labeling and new sweetener solutions, while also championing energy balance and
promoting physical activity. We're working across the golden triangle of government, civil society and business to
create real value and to make a lasting positive difference. And more importantly we continue to generate shareowner
value.
To that end, in the first quarter of 2013, we grew worldwide volume by 4%, cycling 5% from prior year and once again
captured global nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage value share, with volume and value share gains in core sparkling
category. Our global sparkling portfolio grew 3%, led by brand Coca-Cola growth of 3%, while Fanta grew 6% and
Sprite grew 5%. Sparkling brands contributed nearly two-thirds of our global volume growth.
Worldwide still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, with growth across most still beverage categories, including
ready-to-drink tea, juices and juice drinks, as well as packaged water. These gains enabled us to capture global still
beverage volume and value share. And immediate consumption volume also grew 3%, with growth across both
sparkling and still beverages.
As announced during our 2012 year-end earnings call, we implemented a new organizational structure effective
January 1 of this year that includes Coca-Cola Americas, which began 2013 by growing volume 3% and Coca-Cola
International, which grew volume by 5%.
Moving now to operating groups, I will start with North America, where we remain resolutely focused on driving
sustainable growth. We're pleased to report that North America continues to build on three successive years of growth,
with 1% volume growth in the first quarter, resulting in volume and value share gains. We're winning by investing in
our portfolio of preferred brands, by executing with excellence at the point-of-sale and by creating efficiencies and
synergies across our manufacturing sales and distribution networks.
Although sparkling volume was down by 1% in the quarter, we achieved 3% sparkling price mix, reflecting our focus
on value creation. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew this quarter, aided by double digit growth in both mini cans and

in our 1.25 liter package, underscoring the strength of our flagship brands and the success of our occasion-based
package architecture. Coca-Cola also extended its favored brand lead to over two times its closest competitor in North
America.
Sparkling beverages gained volume and value share, as marketing and execution are enabling us to win in the
marketplace. Still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, cycling 6% from prior year. Our portfolio of still beverage
brands has now captured volume and value share for 21 of the past 23 quarters.
Our tea brands grew strong double digits and captured volume and value share of the ready-to-drink tea category.
Growth was driven by Honest Tea at the premium end of the market, the ongoing roll-out of Fuze, which is now
available in 70% of total U.S. supermarkets, and continued Gold Peak growth. As you may know, we've built Gold
Peak from scratch since launching it in 2006. The brand has grown by double digits for 24 consecutive quarters and is
rapidly on its way to becoming a billion dollar brand.
Our juice and juice drink portfolio grew 3% in the quarter, gaining volume and value share. Simply was up 9% thanks
to the addition of new flavors and the growth in Simply single-serve. Our Minute Maid trademark grew 4%, due to the
expansion of Minute Maid Punches and Ades, as well as gains in the light segment of the chilled juice drink category.
North America water business grew 5%, led by growth of DASANI, which continues to maintain a price premium to its
primary competitors. Smartwater maintained its streak, delivering its twentieth consecutive quarter of double digits
growth. And our energy portfolio delivered its eleventh consecutive quarter of volume growth and gained volume and
value share.
As announced earlier today, we're taking a significant step towards our 2020 Vision by commencing the
implementation of a 21st Century beverage partnership model in the United States. The franchise system has always
been the strength of the Coca-Cola business globally, and today, we're accelerating the transformation of our U.S.
system in ways that will establish a clear path to help us achieve our 2020 Vision.
In the coming months, we will be collaborating with five of our bottling partners to implement the plan, which will
include the granting of exclusive territory rights and the sale of distribution assets with cold drink equipment. In the
near-term, production assets will remain with Coca-Cola Refreshments, which will facilitate future implementation of a
national product supply system.
These actions are being taken ahead of our previously-stated timeline. The result will be further progress towards a
more agile, modern customer-focused franchise business model, unique to the United States. We remain confident that
we have the right strategies for North America and we are optimistic about the outlook for this important critical
market, despite the challenging competitive environment and macroeconomic backdrop. As today's results indicate,
The Coca-Cola Company's brand marketing, commercial execution and category leadership efforts are all working
together to enable us to sustainably win at the point-of-sale.
Turning now to Latin America, we're building the business from a position of real strength, having realized solid 4%
volume growth in the quarter, cycling 5%. Sparkling beverages in Latin America grew 2%, with brand Coca-Cola also
up 2%, enabling us to gain both volume and value share. Still beverages across Latin America delivered double digit
growth, gaining volume and value share, thanks to growth across the portfolio, including double digit growth for both
Del Valle juices and juice drinks, as well as POWERADE.
In Mexico, brand Coca-Cola growth, combined with high single digit growth of our still brands, helped drive overall
volume growth of 3% in the quarter, enabling us to capture volume and value share of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverages. In Brazil, where volume also grew 3%, brand Coca-Cola delivered 2% growth, while Fanta grew 8% and
Del Valle delivered 15% growth, enabling us to gain volume and value share in this important market.
The Latin center business unit, which stretches from Ecuador to Belize and encompasses the Caribbean, grew volume
by double digits, and Trademark Coca-Cola expanded its leadership, growing high single digits, through
consumer-relevant propositions that include increasing availability of our 1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and
expanding immediate consumption PET. We continue to see growth opportunities across Latin America, which is the

company's largest operating group in terms of unit case volume and where we have gained value share in 21 of the last
23 quarters.
Moving now to the Pacific Group, we generated 3% overall volume growth, cycling 9% from prior year, led by high
single digit growth in brand Coca-Cola. At a country level, volume in China grew by 1%, cycling strong 9% growth.
Sparkling beverages grew high single digits, while the juice and juice drinks business grew by double digits, following
the introduction of Minute Maid Pulpy Pear and Minute Maid Pulpy Mango. This growth was partially offset by a
decline in water volume, as we cycled strong water growth. Excuse me. These results reflect sequential improvements
and are in line with the expectations we shared during our year-end call. Importantly, we believe that we will continue
to realize sequential improvement through 2013.
At the same time, we also believe that it is going to take a period of time for consumption to return to the growth levels
of previous years. Nevertheless, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our China business and we
remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities to generate robust growth in this region over time.
In Japan, volume growth was 1%, in line with expectations, cycling 3% growth from prior year. Sparkling growth was
up mid-single digits, led by Trademark Coca-Cola and, in particular, Coca-Cola Zero up double digits, driven by the
successful Zero limit national promotion. Ayataka green tea and I LOHAS water, our newest billion dollar brands in
Japan, continued their double digit growth and contributed to solid growth in the important convenience store channel.
Turning to India, which, as a reminder, we're now reporting within the Pacific Group, we delivered high single digit
volume growth, cycling strong double digit growth from last year. And we have gained volume and value share in
sparkling, while also increasing our pricing.
Growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a strong 30% in the quarter, thanks to a strong, robust integrated
marketing and communications campaign and strong in-market execution. In the first quarter alone, we added over
250,000 incremental outlets in India and significantly increased chilled availability for our brands. Our still beverages
in India grew mid-single digits, cycling strong double digit growth, while gaining both volume and value share.
In concluding our update of the Pacific, I'd also like to recognize our continued strong performance in two exciting
markets, Thailand and South Korea. In Thailand, we are maintaining double digit volume growth, while rapidly
investing in additional capacity. We're working in close alignment with our local bottling partners to further expand our
leadership position in this important market. In South Korea, we're generating broad-based growth across a diverse
portfolio of strong brands, with sparkling beverages growing high single digits in the quarter, led by brand Coca-Cola,
up 11%.
Turning now to the Eurasia & Africa Group, we once again delivered double digit volume growth, growing 15%, while
maintaining share. Brand Coca-Cola grew double digits, bolstered by our award-winning Crazy for Good campaign.
Fanta, Sprite, and Coke Zero all generated double digit growth, as well. Our still brands delivered double digit growth,
led by Fuze tea and the acquired volume related to the Aujan partnership.
Russia continued to deliver strong results, outpacing the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry, with high
single digit volume growth. Growth was led by sparkling beverages, where we gained share for the eighth consecutive
quarter, as brand Coca-Cola grew 15%. Our still beverage portfolio gained volume and value share, as Dobry juice
continued its double digit expansion.
One highlight I would like to mention with regard to Russia is our effort to deepen the emotional connection with the
consumers by leveraging the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. Our sponsorship of these games and the torch
relay will combine the passion of the Olympic spirit and Coca-Cola in the minds of millions of Russians, as the torch
will pass through thousands of Russian towns. In fact, our activation of the torch relay is already driving real
connections to our consumers, as evidenced by the more than 77,000 torch-bearing nominations we have received
during our latest consumer promotion.
The Turkey, Caucasus & Central Asia Business Unit also continued its strong performance, delivering double-digit
growth in the quarter.

Prior to concluding my update on Eurasia & Africa, I'd like to note that the Middle East & North Africa Business Unit
was recently awarded the company's Woodruff Cup. This is our most prestigious operating award, honoring the top
performing business unit in our worldwide business system. Among other important accomplishments, the Middle East
& North Africa business unit achieved double-digit volume in operating income growth for 2012.
And we celebrated an important milestone with our partners at Aujan this quarter, as we toasted the billionth can of
Rani juice produced since the start of our share partnership. Rani is the leading juice brand in the Middle East and a
terrific complement to our existing juice business in Eurasia & Africa, including Turkey, which gained volume and
value share for the tenth consecutive quarter.
Turning now to Europe, the economic environment clearly remains uncertain across this region, as persistent high
unemployment, coupled with severe austerity measures, are weighing on consumer sentiment and consumer spending.
In fact, Nielsen's latest Global Survey of Consumer Confidence and Spending Intentions indicate that consumer
confidence fell in 20 of the 29 European markets in the fourth quarter last year.
Nevertheless, our volume was even in the quarter, cycling 1% growth from prior year, which is a significant sequential
improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. And we grew volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages,
both sparkling beverages across the region, including key markets like France, Germany and Great Britain. There were
pockets of volume growth across Europe, with grew Germany growing a healthy 3%, the Nordic countries showing
improvement, and Great Britain returning to growth, while gaining share due to strong integrated marketing campaigns
and solid execution in the marketplace. For the near future, as European consumers remain cautious in their spending,
we will keep investing for the long-term health of our business.
These results from around the world underscore the laser focus of our system – that our system has on our strategic
priorities as we advance further towards our 2020 Vision. Our five core strategic priorities are as follows: first, we must
continue to grow sustainably and provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health and well-being of the
communities we proudly serve; second, we will win with Coca-Cola, while actively promoting the brand and the
category; third, we must absolutely keep winning and executing with excellence at the point-of-sale; fourth, we need to
keep maximizing the value of our global beverage portfolio; and fifth, we will encourage and inspire our system and
associates to deliver our mission.
Looking back at the first quarter of 2013, we were also honored and humbled to receive several recognitions. We were
again ranked number four on Fortune's list of Most Admired Companies and named one of the Most Innovative
Companies in the world by Fast Company. Also, one of the most meaningful recognitions for The Coca-Cola System
came from Catalyst, the leading nonprofit organization with a mission to expand opportunities for women in business.
We were honored to accept the 2013 Catalyst award in recognition of our Global Women's Initiative. This important
initiative is focused on fueling the advancement of women as dynamic leaders and entrepreneurs across the
organization and also in communities throughout the world where we serve our customers and consumers.
Before moving on, I want to revisit a complex societal issue that touches us all, obesity. Beginning last year, The
Coca-Cola Company took new steps to give consumers even more choices in package sizes, sweeteners and beverages,
including more low and no calorie selections, while also providing clear nutritional information and by supporting
fitness programs. Coca-Cola has a rich heritage of being associated with exercise, sports, and active lifestyles. Today,
we're using our marketing expertise and community connections to inform consumers about energy balance and to
inspire more people to get moving. We firmly believe the challenges of obesity are solvable. The Coca-Cola System,
together with industry partners, NGOs, and governments, is committed to being part of the solution.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that our brands are stronger than ever before. We delivered solid performance
results this quarter, in line with our expectations, while continuing to gain global value share. Together with our global
system bottling partners, we are working diligently to unlock value, to execute with precision and to continue gaining
volume and value share.
We're leading the industry dialogue around obesity by bringing forward solutions, adding transparency to the dialogue
around calories, and championing energy balance and physical activity. We're generating value for our shareowners, as

evidenced by the recently announced 10% increase in our annual dividend, which is our 51st consecutive annual
dividend increase. Even so, we remain constructively discontent, as we seek to make the most of the vast growth
opportunities we continue to see around the globe. Please know that we are working each and every day to refresh the

consumers, our customers and in the communities that we proudly serve.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.
Gary P. Fayard
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter, underscoring once again that our
company and global system are well positioned to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.
Achieving such consistent performance during a time of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is a real testament to the
strength of our global system and the investments we continue to make for long-term sustainable growth.
Before we get into the financial details of the quarter, let me remind you that we closed the sale of 51% of our Bottling
business in the Philippines to Coca-Cola FEMSA in January of this year, and therefore, we no longer are consolidating
the Philippines' results.
We anticipate that this transaction, along with the previously announced bottling merger in Brazil, will have a 3%
structural impact on our full-year 2013 net revenues. Likewise, our full-year operating income results should see a 1%
structural impact. However, there should be a corresponding improvement to equity income to account for our share of
the results of these operations moving forward. As I shared in our 2012 year-end call, we do not expect these
transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results.
Moving now to our first quarter results, our comparable earnings per share were $0.46, up 5% versus the prior year
quarter, despite currency headwinds of approximately 4%. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up
5%, despite the impact of two fewer selling days and the impact of certain structural items. And currency was a 3%
headwind on comparable operating income. Comparable currency neutral net revenue grew 1% and grew 2% after
adjusting for the impact of structural items.
After adjusting for the effect of two fewer selling days in the quarter, unit case sales were in line with concentrate sales.
Price mix for the quarter was even, cycling 3% in the prior year quarter. And remember, in the second quarter, we will
also be cycling 3% price mix. However, stated in our last earnings call, we expect to earn low single digit consolidated
price mix for 2013, consistent with our long-term growth model. We continue executing our occasion-based brand
price package and channel strategies with precision around the world.
Our comparable gross margin was 61.5%. This represents a slight improvement compared to the prior year, primarily
due to the impact of geographical mix, the de-consolidation of the Philippines' bottler and the impact of our foreign
currency hedging program. We expect the improvement in our gross margin to moderate over the remainder of the
year, due to a shift in geographic mix.
With regard to operating expense leverage, we achieved three points of favorable operating leverage in the quarter,
despite the impact of two fewer selling days. Again, this was primarily due to the de-consolidation of the Philippines'
bottler, as well as the benefit from a reversal of expenses related to some of our long-term incentive plans. This was
partially offset by sustained strategic investments in our brand building activities around the world.
As we've shared before, we continue to expect operating expense leverage to be even to slightly positive for the full
year. As you model our 2013 operating results and our corresponding expense leverage, let me also remind everyone
that the 2013 calendar will have one less day when compared to 2012. And based on our quarterly closing calendar, as
I've said, we had two less days this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2012 and our fourth quarter of 2013
will have one more day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.

Moving now to net interest income, we came in at $14 million of income this quarter, ahead of our initial forecast. We
now expect net interest will be even to slightly positive for the remainder of the year. Our underlying effective tax rate
is 23.5%. We expect this rate to remain unchanged through 2014.
Cash flow from operations decreased 3%, primarily due to the impact of the two fewer selling days in the period, an
unfavorable impact from currency and an increase in the use of working capital in preparation for the peak season of
our growing global business. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be
more in line with our earnings growth rate.
Turning to share repurchase, our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $1.1 billion. This
places us well on track to achieve the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range for full year 2013 that we communicated during
our last earnings call.
As for currencies, we remain fully hedged on the euro, yen, and sterling for 2013 and into 2014, and we also have
near-term coverage in place across several other currencies. After considering these hedge positions and current spot
rates, we expect currencies to be a 3% headwind for the second quarter and a 2% headwind for the full year. As you've
all seen the movement of the yen in recent months, as mentioned, we've hedged our yen exposure for this year and into
next year, but we do believe that the weaker yen will ultimately be beneficial for the Japanese economy and for our
business.
In closing, and as Muhtar shared earlier, we are delivering on our strategic priorities and achieving real success. We
fully expect operating income to be in line with our long-term growth target for the full year. Our global system is
committed to investing together for a better tomorrow. And our proven ability to achieve consistent quality results
provides us with the confidence that, together as a system, we will successfully crack the code to sustainable growth to
meet our 2020 Vision goals.
Operator, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Faucher.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: John?
Operator
You may continue with your question.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Sorry. There's a lot of static. As you look at the bottler consolidation piece, is Spanish or
Japanese bottler consolidation the beginning of the next wave of, let's say, of bottler driven consolidation? And how
much are you pushing this, as opposed to letting the bottlers lead where the system is going?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Hi, John. Good morning. This is Muhtar. First, I think it's important to realize that there's
not one model for the world. There's many different models for the world. As you can see, what's happening, this has
been an exciting last several months with respect to the evolution – actually continuous evolution of our franchise
system. We manage our business to create sustainable long-term value and the evolution of our franchise system
continues to play an absolutely critical role in that process.
And so what you've seen recently, the Kanto merger in Japan, the Brazil merger of three bottling partners creating a
large Brazilian-led bottling business, the Iberian merger of seven bottling partners in Iberia, the sale of the Philippines
of the majority shares of the Philippines and the control to FEMSA and now the U.S. process, the journey starting in
the United States, are all part of our vision, our plan to ensure that we can continue to deliver on the commitments

we've made for our vision. They use – in some cases they use partially our capital. In some cases, where there's a sale,
obviously, we bring back capital back into The Coca-Cola Company. But all the time ensuring that our bottling
business is fully suited for the needs of the 21st century, delivering what is necessary ahead of consumer expectations,
customer expectations and so not one size fits all.
And in the case of the United States, again, I'm pleased to report – we're pleased to report today that we've reached

Refreshments, I've always said there will be a meaningful role to invite partners back into the business. When I was –
when we were asked about the timing, we've always said around a four to five-year timeframe from the time we've
closed the Coca-Cola Refreshments, was, as you will recall, back in the latter part of 2010, and we are well within that
timeline. And it's a continuous evolution. And sometimes it will necessitate for us to use our own capital, sometimes a
mix, and sometimes no capital and, again, not one size fits all. The U.S. model is very different, but it is, again, a model
that invites partners to serve with us passionately the communities that we operate in.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Great. And if I could just ask a follow-up on at that, which would be as you look at the
different options you gave for the U.S. pieces here in terms of sub-bottler agreements, asset sales, swaps, things like
that, is there some way to think about the financial impact as you do this? I mean, and this is a small piece of it. How
long does this timeframe take out as you sort of push these U.S. pieces out? Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think from – we can't comment on the timing for the end game, but all I can tell
you is that we're intent on creating the evolution necessary for us to be able to serve both our large customers and small
independent customers in the best possible way with our bottling partners. Again, we've always said that, right from the
beginning, and we're consistent to that, that the U.S. will be slightly different. We want to create the best-in-class
production, optimum cost reduction system, coast to coast from the east to the west. That will be nationally managed.
We also want to create a nationally-managed large customer management system that will essentially have the
responsibility to put together 21st century customer plans with our large partners in the United States and all, at the
same time, invite partners to come in and be part of this new evolution in the United States. It will take as long as it is
necessary. And that is not our focus. It's going to be about doing the right thing as quickly as possible, as efficiently as
possible and as effectively as possible. And that's what we are going to be doing.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hi. Good morning. A question for you, Gary, just on the operating leverage in the first quarter
and maybe more specifically the gross margins, if I understood it right, this quarter would have been one of the highest
in terms of the impact from commodity inflation. We also really had no positive benefit from price mix and as we look
out going forward, right, we should get some benefit from price mix later in the year and maybe some relief on
commodity inflation. So why wouldn't there be maybe more leverage going through the year than we originally
expected, given the leverage you had in the first quarter?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, Bryan. Thanks. There are a couple of things to consider. First is, as I mentioned
previously in the prepared remarks that we reversed some compensation accruals in the first quarter, so that gave you
more leverage in the quarter, but you will not see that. That's more of one-time impact, if you will. So there's more
leverage in the quarter. But the other significant piece is you're going – the currencies had an impact as well. And
currencies moderate going out. But the biggest thing will be geographic mix. And we would expect to see geographic
mix changing throughout the year as we go through the years. And as that happens, it'll have an impact on gross margin
and operating leverage.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: So the geographic mix would be more negative going through the back half, the rest of the
year? Is that.

<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yes. That's exactly right. And, in fact, think about North America. Actually, I would expect
North America – actually, in the first quarter of this year, North America's operating income, on a recurring kind of
comparable basis, was down 3%. And it was down 3% primarily because of two fewer selling days. So if you adjust it
for those selling days, it would have been positive. But I'd expect North America to actually improve versus where they
were, the minus 3%, but as they improved because it's a finished product business, it's going to have a negative gross
margin impact and will be reduced leverage.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. So more growth from lower margin geographies going forward and that's what will
affect sort of that margin impact.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yes. Yes. That's what I was trying say more in code in the prepared remarks.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: You normally don't think North America, but that's what it was.

Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: I was hoping to get an update on the competitive environment around the world, both in
China and Western Europe, which have been hot spots recently. And also just your thoughts around how you manage
the pricing environment in the U.S. sparkling business in 2013 and beyond, in light of the moderate commodity
pressure and if that solid 3% sparkling growth we saw in Q1 could continue in the balance of the year.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think, no I think – this is Muhtar. I think from a – we haven't seen anything
markedly different from previous quarters as far as the competitive environment is concerned. China remains a very
competitive environment. Actually, the whole world and, again, this is a competitive environment that is a mix of large
international companies, but also very much local companies, very much local companies in Asia, in parts of Africa, in
the Middle East. We also see a somewhat more rational pricing, particularly in Europe, as well as parts of – other parts
of the world, in Latin America, too.
And I think – so the way we see the environment is it will continue to be challenged from a consumer perspective,
whether you're talking about Asia coming back or whether you're talking about Europe. Consumer sentiment in Europe
will continue to be volatile and mixed at best and therefore, pricing is going to be critical and therefore, also ensuring
leverage and ensuring productivity can be generated out of operations for us to be able to continue to invest is going to
be critical. But we're intent on continuing to invest in this environment. I'll let Steve Cahillane talk a little bit about how
we manage the pricing environment in the United States where we actually achieved a 3% price mix in terms of
leverage in pricing for sparkling beverages in the past quarter.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. We would – we have seen a rational pricing environment in the United
States over the course of a good period of time right now. We would expect that to continue. And I've said many times
that if commodities go down, don't look for us to reinvest that in price. We've worked very hard to earn the price that
we take in the marketplace. We don't have an affordability problem in the United States with our sparkling beverages
and we would look to continue to invest behind our brands. We've got a terrific summer program for the Coca-Cola
brand. We've got an exciting new partnership with Taylor Swift around Diet Coke. We'll invest around activating those
types of programs to continue to focus on one of – our most important objective, which is to continue to support,

Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up on the U.S. bottling announcement. Coke held on to
the production assets for the territories the five bottlers picked up. Do you see these bottlers eventually contributing
their manufacturing assets into a national production company to get at the cost savings opportunity that you've talked
about on the manufacturing side? And also would Coke be willing to let new partners bring in outside capital to help
finance some of the additional territory sales, given the size of the territory that Coke still holds onto in the U.S.?
Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Hi, Bill. This is Muhtar. Good morning.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Hi.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I'd say to you that this is, again, we're at the beginning of this journey. We have reached
agreement in principle with these five U.S. bottling partners. It is very important that we did reach that agreement in
principle and now we can actually ensure that we put all the details into motion and we can implement effectively.
We've always said production in the United States is critical to our success in achieving an optimum cost 21st century
production system, nationally managed coast to coast. That is going to take place. We've also said that managing large
30 or so of our largest customers in the United States is going to be done nationally. That's also going to take place.
In terms of who else would be coming in, we can't comment on that. In terms of what will happen and in what form and
architecture production is going to take place in terms of what our current bottlers own, I can't comment on that. All I
can tell you, and I can assure you, that we are intent on ensuring that we make the necessary changes in the format and
architecture production to achieve what I just said, which is a coast to coast nationally run production system that
generates the efficiencies, synergies, productivities that allow us to continue to win in the marketplace. And again,
there may be a future where our partners in the United States take certain ownership in the national production. I
wouldn't rule that out also, but it will be managed nationally from one point, single point.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on North America. First, in terms of
volume performance, I think the macro data points and consumer data points have been a little bit choppy more
recently, so maybe if you can give us a little bit of color just in terms of category or your performance immediate
consumption versus take-home and sort of the expectation as you get out into the back of the year, lapping of some of
the transitory headwinds, whether it's payroll taxes, or weather-related, if you expect volume performance to improve.
And then, Gary, just on the profitability in North America, I know you talked about this a little bit, but I look at first
quarter, you had 1% volume growth, 2% price mix, and you did say profitability was up a little bit. But just why isn't –
why aren't we seeing the profitability really improve more meaningfully? And what drives the sequential acceleration
in North America profitability going forward?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Okay, Judy. I'll have Steve answer the first part of your question before Gary comes in
and sheds some light on the question on profitability. Steve?

<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yes. Thanks, Judy. First quarter clearly had a lot of noise in it. We expected a benefit from
Easter being in the first quarter. It's never as big a benefit when it comes that early in the year. Easter's always better
when it comes later in April because of the warmer weather. But obviously, you referenced the weather. We saw some
very dramatic changes. Last year, we benefited from one of the hottest summers – or sorry, hottest winters, warmest
winters in the United States and we cycled that with one of the coldest winters in the United States. So clearly, that had
an effect and we saw any benefit from Easter really being washed away, if you like, by the poor weather.
There was clearly an effect in the payroll tax. It's a little bit of art and science trying to pick apart what's weather and
what's payroll tax. We would figure about two-thirds is probably weather-related and one-third of the slowdown is
based on the economy. We are, though, optimistic, guardedly optimistic, that the consumer is coming back, that the
payroll tax and the economy is kind of a short-term need to get used to the discretionary impact that that has had. So we
remain optimistic that we've got the right programs in place, that the economy is on the mend, and we would expect
continued good performance as we go out into the next three quarters. In terms of, I guess, question on profitability, I'll
turn that over to Gary.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah. Judy, I'd say a couple of things on profitability, and it's really kind of repeating what
Steve just said. If you take the first quarter and you throw in lousy weather, payroll tax – actually the price of gasoline,
what that then does to your immediate consumption versus future consumption business, it's going to have an impact on
your profitability. Now, if I go back to the answer I gave to Bryan earlier though, when I was talking about geographic
mix and it's North America, I would expect North America to be improving, actually, from the first quarter and from
where we were. And then North America also has this two fewer days.
Now, I can tell you Steve's got a number from minus 3%, I said it would have been positive. Steve's got a number, but
you can calculate it several different ways as to what would the impact of the two days be. We would all agree, I think,
it's positive. They would have been positive at the operating income line. But you put all that together – the weather, by
the way, as lousy as it's been and the impact on Steve's business has been given a lot of moisture to the mid-west for the
drought for the corn crop, so, but look for commodities and we'll see what happens there. Payroll tax, consumers
hopefully are starting to get used to it. Gasoline prices, looks like they're starting to trend downward somewhat. So I
think there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic. CCR continues to execute with excellence and continue to
improve capability. So I think there are lots of reasons to be optimistic on North America.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay, but from a profitability perspective though the bigger delta is really the mix shifting
towards more immediate consumption as weather normalizes? Or is there a step up in cost savings or timing of
marketing investments that help the profitability?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, Judy, I would actually say the biggest impact on the first quarter for North America was
two less selling days.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And the whole company.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: By far, and the whole company as well, but, by far, the biggest impact was the two selling
days.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Judy, I didn't answer this part. A secondary impact is clearly weather-impacted foodservice in
immediate consumption more than the take-home channel. So we would expect, as weather moderates, those profitable
parts of our business will start to normalize as well. But as Gary said, two less selling days, when you've got the fixed
cost assets that we have in the North American business is really quite significant. Those extra two days are golden
cases that are going out and when you lose those two days it obviously has a big impact.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.
<Q - Caroline Shan Levy>: Good morning, Muhtar, Gary and team. I would like to just understand, Muhtar, your
vision, again, going back to the United States. You talked a little bit about how manufacturing is going to evolve. A
little bit of understanding the benefits of merging the operations of foodservice, your non-carbs and your CSDs into one
production facility. Just can that actually be done and are there synergies there? And then secondly, do you feel
strongly that your own people have to get the product to market from the plant or could use a third-party, such as a
Sysco?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Caroline, I think, first, in terms of our capability in our system in the United States
is, I'd say, the best in the consumer products world in terms of how we go to market and how we can get the product
from production facilities. So I wouldn't like to comment on how we can improve that. If there is a way for us to even
improve and generate more productivity, we'll certainly look at it. I think the most important thing though is that there
is room to generate significant further synergies in production.
I think today, I wouldn't say that the United States production system, after three years of having integrated Coca-Cola
Refreshments, it is where we need it to be. And we need to achieve that – continue on that roadmap to proceed towards
a modern and best-in-class optimum cost production system coast to coast. That will mean obviously a lot of changes.
That will mean building new plants. That will mean combining some facilities. But I would like to also comment in
terms of hot-fill antiseptic versus sparkling beverage plants, we will look at ensuring that we have the most modern,
most productive facilities in place. I don't believe the answer is to combine all under one roof. I think the answer is to
combine many that are scattered across the country, both in terms of still and sparkling separately into some
consolidation process and I can't comment any further.
What I can tell you is that there is room for costs to come down. There is room for efficiencies to increase, and we will
achieve all of those. This is all in line with our 2020 Vision. We laid out a plan when we took over the business of
Coca-Cola Enterprises. We laid out a plan when I took over as the CEO back four and a half years ago and we're
executing it meticulously. And we're doing what we've said we would do and we're doing it ahead of time.
<Q - Caroline Shan Levy>: That's excellent. I was just wondering in terms of getting shelf space. You see a big
opportunity in up and down the street and to get better pricing much as you've done Lat Am. I am often asked how you
compete with all the new things that come in, be it coconut water, energy drinks? I know you have some. But are you
convinced you can keep or improve shelf space for your carbonated soft drinks?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Absolutely. I think we can improve service levels. I think we can improve execution
inside the point-of-sale. I think we can improve availability. I think we can improve availability of cold drink. I think
we can improve how we serve independents. And all of those things are going to be played out as we implement,
execute this new strategy in the United States. And, I don't know, Steve, do you want to comment?
<A - Steve Cahillane>: I agree completely. And part of what we're doing with this new bottler arrangement focuses on
that up and down the street, where bottles and CCR add the most value, which is not only big customer sales, but up
and down the street execution. And we've got also our Venturing and Emerging Brands unit, which you're familiar
with, which brings brands like Zico Coconut Water. It brought Honest Tea. So in that – those spaces that you're talking
about, we are very much innovating. We've got Glacéau Fruitwater, which we just launched a great success a couple of
weeks ago. That's being executed, not only in the large stores, but importantly, in the up and down the street food
service on-premise accounts as well. So we see that as a very important capability. We see ourselves as having a
competitive advantage there when it comes to, not just shelf space, but cold drink space and overall availability.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, and just to finally add on to that point, Caroline, rest assured we are in a mode of
evolution, rapid evolution, not just in the United States, across the whole world, but – and you will see us adapting,
re-inventing how we go to market, how we serve customers and also how we communicate with consumers, very
importantly. Our brands are at an all-time high in terms of health and we will continue again to evolve and bring out the

Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Also a question on the U.S. re-franchising,
Muhtar, Gary, the – you talk about this new beverage agreement being ultimately what's at play here. Could you speak
a little bit to how you're thinking about that and the role of incidents-based pricing in that? Is it right to think that
continues to have prominence in this new agreement? And any distinction you might draw between how stills and
carbonates are treated as you move production more squarely to staying, if you will, at least for a little while, inside
Coca-Cola?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think, Mark, it's – I can't and we can't comment on the details. What we can say
is that it will be a model that will align us fully with our bottling partners to do what is right in the marketplace and to
focus on what is right in the marketplace, full alignment model. And I think I can't just comment any further that that.
But you will see us executing better, serving the customers better, with a better production template, as well as a
customer service template.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Is it fair to think that other markets, there's a sort of a fact pattern and experience set to
draw on as you implement this new form of agreement here in the U.S.?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I think all of that will come into play, best practices everywhere around the world.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Okay.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And I am certain that in four, five years time many people will come into the United
States to see the best practices and as it used to be back in the 1980's, when I used to bring bottlers, new bottlers, from
Eastern Europe to see best practices in the United States at that time.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Fair enough. Thanks, Muhtar.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
In closing, I'd like to thank Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson and to again say that we're pleased with our solid first
quarter. We're working as a system to unlock real value, further strengthen execution and to win at the point-of-sale.
We're confident that a focus, a relentless focus, on growth will enable us to build capable, resilient, optimized
advantaged and sustainable systems that are well positioned to deliver results in 2013 and achieve our 2020 Vision. As
always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
