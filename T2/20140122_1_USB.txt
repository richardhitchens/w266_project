I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of
today's presentation, in our press release and in our Form 10K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now
turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Judy. And good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our call. I'll begin with a few highlights from U.S.
Bank's 2013 full year results on page 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.8 billion for the full year of 2013 or $3 per diluted common share. We
achieved industry leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.65% and return on average common equity
of 15.8% and an efficiency ratio of 52.4%. Total average loans grew by 5.6%, and average deposits grew a strong 6.3%
year-over-year. Credit quality continued to improve with a 30.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 13.2% in decrease in
nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets.
Our capital position ended the year stronger with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9.4%. In total, we returned $4 billion
or 71% of our 2013 earnings to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.
Turning to slide 4, and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bancorp reported net income of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter
of 2013, or $0.76 per diluted common share. Total average loans grew by year-over-year by 5.7% and, as expected,
1.5% or 6% annualized on a linked quarter basis. We experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits of 5.4%
over the prior year and 1.8% or 7.2% annualized on a link quarter basis.
Credit quality remains strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 4.9% from the prior quarter, while total
nonperforming assets declined linked quarter by 7.9%. We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our
common equity Tier 1 ratio, estimated using the final Basel III capital regulations, was 8.8% at December 31. And we
returned 65% of our earnings to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and repurchase of 13 million
shares of common stock.
Slide 5 provides you with a five-quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be ranked among the
best in the industry. Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.62% and return on average common equity
was 15.4%.
Moving over to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.40% as anticipated, a
few basis points lower than the third quarter. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 54.9%, higher than
previous quarters due to the seasonally higher expenses and the impact of accounting presentation changes related to
investments in tax advantage projects.
These changes did not impact net income attributable to U.S. Bank, and Andy will discuss them in more detail in a few
minutes. As we have stated in the past, our goal is to maintain an efficiency ratio in the low 50s% by continuing to
manage expenses in relation to revenue trends, while continuing to invest in and grow our businesses. But we do expect
the efficiency ratio to return to the low 50s% in 2014.
Turning to slide 6. The company reported total net revenue in the fourth quarter of $4.9 billion, a 4.4% decrease from
the prior year and essentially equal to the third quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by
lower mortgage banking revenue, as well as a decrease in net interest income.
Linked quarter, a decrease to noninterest income, driven again by lower mortgage banking revenue, was offset by
seasonally higher revenues in other business lines and an increase in net interest income.
Average loan to deposit growth is summarized on slide 7. Average total loans outstanding increased by over $12 billion
or 5.7% year-over-year and 1.5% on a linked quarter basis. Overall, excluding covered loans of our [indiscernible]
(05:29) portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.3% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter. Once again, the increase in

average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average total commercial loans, which grew by 7.8%
year-over-year and 1.3% over the prior quarter.
Total average commercial real estate also increased over the prior quarters, with an average loan growing by 6.7%
year-over-year and 2.1% linked quarter. Residential real estate loans continued to show strong growth, 17.6%
year-over-year and 3.2% over the prior quarter.
Within the retail loan category, average credit card loans and other loans and leases were both higher year-over-year
and linked quarter, while average home equity lines and loans continued to decline. The rate of decline in this category,
however, has slowed considerably over the past few quarters.
We continue to originate and renew new loans and lines for our customers. New origination, excluding mortgage
production, plus new and renewed commitments, totaled approximately $50 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% linked
quarter. Total average revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a faster rate
than loans, increasing year-over-year by 10.1% and 2.7% on a linked quarter basis. Line utilization edged down slightly
again this quarter to approximately 23%.
Total average deposits increased by over $13 billion or 5.4% over the same quarter of last year, and by $4.5 billion or
7.2% annualized on a linked quarter basis. With growth in low-cost interest checking, money market and savings
deposits, particularly strong on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to slide 8 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter decreased by $16 million or 4.9% from
the third quarter of 2013, while nonperforming assets, excluding covered assets, decreased by $67 million or 3.6%. The
ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding in the fourth quarter declined to 0.53% from 0.57% in the third
quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we released $35 million of reserves, $5 million more than in the previous quarter and $10
million more than in the fourth quarter of 2012. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect total
nonperforming assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2014, but we expect the level of net charge-offs
to increase modestly in the first quarter of 2014 as commercial and commercial real estate recoveries decline relative to
the current quarter. Andy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard. Slide 9 gives you a view of our fourth quarter 2013 results versus comparable time periods. Our
diluted EPS of $0.76 was 5.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 and equal to the prior quarter. The key drivers of
the company's fourth quarter earnings are summarized on slide 10.
The $36 million or 2.5% increase in net income year-over-year was primarily the result of lower provision for credit
losses and well managed expense, partially offset by lower net revenue. The net interest income declined
year-over-year by $50 million or 1.8%, the result of a 2.3% increase in average earning assets, which was more than
offset by a 15 basis point decrease in net interest margin.
The $7.3 billion growth in average earnings assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans and
investment securities. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $5.8 billion reduction in average
loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last year, and a $3.8 billion
reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the de-consolidation of a number of community
development entities in the third quarter of 2013.
The net interest margin of 3.40% was 15 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower rates
on investment securities, as well as growth in the portfolio and lower rates on loans, partially offset by lower rates on
deposits and a reduction in higher cost long-term debt.
Noninterest income declined by $173 million or 7.4% year-over-year, primarily due to mortgage banking revenue,
which reflected lower origination and sales revenue. Lower corporate payments revenue, products revenue, the result of

lower government-related transactions also contributed to the decline. Government spending was down about 18%
year-over-year.
Growth in several fee categories helped to offset these unfavorable variances, including growth in retail payments,
merchant processing, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue and
investment product fees. Noninterest expense declined modestly year-over-year by $4 million or 0.1%. The modest
decrease was primarily the result of lower professional services expenses due to a reduction in mortgage servicing
review-related costs and the positive impact from an $80 million mortgage foreclosure related regulatory settlement
accrual in the fourth quarter of 2012.
These favorable variances were offset by higher benefits expense, primarily pension-related, and higher tax advantaged
project costs, including the accounting presentation changes in the current quarter. In the fourth quarter, we changed the
presentation of some tax credit-related items in our income statement. These changes were not significant and had no
impact on EPS. The impact of the change is shown on the chart on this slide.
These changes, in addition to a favorable conclusion of some state tax matters, reduced the effective tax rate to 23.8%
on a tax equivalent basis in the fourth quarter. This new presentation will continue in future periods. However, in the
first quarter of 2014, we also expect to adopt new accounting guidance recently issued by FASB which will move
noninterest expense on certain tax credit investments to tax expense. Including all of these changes, we expect our tax
rate in 2014 to be about 29% on a tax equivalent basis.
Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $12 million or 0.8%, primarily as a result of seasonally higher
expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income was higher
as the $4.5 billion increase in average earning assets was only partially offset by a modest decline in the net interest
margin.
The increase in average earnings assets was the result of growth in loans and securities, partially offset by a reduction
in average loans held for sale. The net interest margin of 3.40% was three basis points lower than the third quarter,
primarily due to the growth in lower rate investment securities, as well as strong deposit growth, which resulted in
higher cash balances at the Fed.
On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income was lower by $21 million or 1%. Again, this unfavorable variance
primarily reflected the decline in mortgage banking revenue, as well as seasonally lower corporate [indiscernible]
(12:28) revenue.
Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in retail payments, trust and investment
management fees, commercial product revenue and other income. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense was
up $117 million or 4.6%, driven by higher costs related to tax advantaged projects, including the accounting
presentation changes, seasonally higher professional services expense, and the timing of marketing and business
development projects.
Given normal first quarter seasonality [ph] and these new (13:00) accounting guidance related to tax credit investments,
we expect first quarter 2014 expense to be similar to the third quarter of 2013.
Turning to slide 11, our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Based on our assessment of the final rules for
the Basel III standardized approach, we estimate that our common equity tier 1 ratio at December 31 was 8.8% from
8.6% at September 30. At 8.8% we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above our targeted ratio
of 8%.
In our fourth quarter we returned 30% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and 35% through the
repurchase of 13 million shares of stock for a total return of 65%. Our tangible book value per share rose to [ph] $14.41
(13:50) at December 31, representing an 11.9% increase over the same quarter of last year and a 4.3% increase over the
prior quarter.
In early January, we completed and submitted our to 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We are now waiting for
regulatory approval to raise our dividend and continue our stock buyback program in 2014.

Finally, slide 12 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage repurchase related expense and reserve for
expected losses on the repurchases and make-whole payments. Production warrantees repurchase reserve was $83
million at December 31, compared with $176 million at September 30. The decline in the reserve reflected the
December agreement with Freddie Mac that resolves substantially all repurchase obligations related to actual
warranties made on loans sold to Freddie Mac between 2000 and 2008. The $53 million settlement was reflected in net
realized losses for the quarter.
I'll now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy. I'm very proud of our 2013 results. We achieved record earnings while we managed through a
challenging economic environment and a significant pullback in mortgage making activities, as well as an environment
of regulatory and legislative change and uncertainty.
We continued to invest in our businesses throughout 2013, both organically and through acquisitions. For example, we
added a small municipal bond trustee business in March, strengthening our position as the number one provider in
municipal trustee and agency services in the United States.
And in November, we announced the acquisition of Quintillion Limited, an Ireland-based full service hedge fund
administrator, further expanding our alternative investment servicing network in Europe. And we began the new year
with an announcement of the purchase of a Chicago branch franchise owned by RBS Citizens Financial Group. This
investment will nearly double our market share in this great market within our footprint, strengthening our position and
adding products, services and convenience for new and existing customers, as well as value for our shareholders.
These acquisitions, combined with our ongoing investment in innovative product enhancements, services and people,
have enabled us to continue to grow our balance sheet and our fee-based businesses and gain market share. U.S. Bank's
performance metrics continue to be best in class. We are focused on the future, building our company to perform as we
have in the past, producing consistent, predictable, repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees,
our communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from our audience.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first with question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Erica.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: My first question is on the loan demand outlook for this year. Richard, it's clear that
your bank has been a market share taker over the past several years. But as you look out into this year, are we at an
inflection point in terms of loan demand picking up based on what you're hearing from your corporate customers and
the activity level that you may be seeing on the consumer side?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Erika, I believe that's true and I'll tell you why. I think it may be a tale of two halves of the
year. I think 2014 starts while looking a lot like 2013 where people continue – there has been cash and kind of hold off
until they see some of the earlier spring sentiment that comes about and whether or not consumers are going to spend
and, therefore, corporations are going to invest.

I will tell you, as you know, the first trigger in that transaction of people spending is the deposits actually going down.
And our deposit's growing. I'm glad they are to the extent that we're getting more customers. But to the extent that they
use their deposits first, they'll then use their line of credit second, then they'll extend more credits later in the cycle. And
we're not seeing as much of that yet as we'd like to at the early stages. The sentiment, however, is completely different.
The sentiment is stronger that it's been in all these – last January as people are much more willing to talk about future
investment.
I think consumers are starting to think about doing things to add to their house or spend more money for improvements
and maybe some discretionary items they hadn't before. And so my intuition tells me we're on the verge in the advent
of an increasing sentiment for consumer spending. But I think we'll see it second half of the year. And I think this
spring will really tell us the tale. In our company, as you know, in order to offset the expected and predicted reduction
in mortgage refinances, we're continuing to spend energy on becoming a market share leader on purchases, and we're
also, as you know, introduced that we're doubling our indirect lending and leasing program over the next few years, and
even already we're seeing a significant increase in the auto loan volume that we would have otherwise, not even over a
year ago, up over 30% from fourth quarter of 2012.
So, I believe that our ability to offset the mortgage, and predicted mortgage change, keep market share positions there,
and add other consumer products like small business, credit card and indirect, I think we're positioned quite nicely. I
just think it is going to be the second half where you'll see the most likely balance sheet impacts that will follow the
sentiment that we're hearing today.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Got it. And as a follow-up question for Andy. Could you give us a sense of where you
stand in terms of complying with the LCR proposals as they are currently written, and how we should think about
potential balance and margin impacts for the balance of the year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. Thanks, Erika. There are still some questions with regard to the final roles in the
interpretation, but I'll tell you that we increased the securities portfolio to $80 billion in the fourth quarter and we're
expecting to increase it to $85 billion by the end of the first quarter. That will impact margin a few basis points, similar
to what you saw this quarter, and that, again, is our current expectation. We're still working both sides of the balance
sheet, the right, the left hand side and working through the equation. But right now $85 billion in the quarter one.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Erica.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Betsy.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, hi.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes, we can.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: OK, great. So I just wanted to run through the discussion that you had, it was pretty quick, on
the accounting changes. Maybe you could help us understand why you chose to take the accounting changes to this
quarter and then you've got to follow up in first quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So, Betsy, this is Andy. So starting in the fourth quarter, we moved the amortization
of some guaranteed tax credits from tax expense to noninterest expense.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And then we also moved some third-party share of losses. We moved the entire third-party
share of losses on syndicated tax credits to noninterest expense where the related losses are reported. And then finally,
in the first quarter of 2014, we're going to move some low income housing costs from expense to tax. So, the net of all
that is what we talked about on page 10, the impacts we see there, which lower our tax rate and increase our expense.
But you'll see a little bit of a reversal in the first quarter. So when it all said and done, our TEB rate for next year will
be about 29% and our expense in the first quarter, we expect it to be closer to what it was in the third quarter of this
year.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. All right. So, this is really – 4Q is really a transitory towards a new normal, which is
similar to your old normal?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Correct. That's correct, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separately, I had a question on AmEx partnership that you announced
recently. I did want to just understand how you are planning on leveraging that, and can you lift the AmEx partnership,
get to that closed loop for the cards that you would be working with them on, to a greater degree than you even have
today.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. This is Richard. Let me tell you, it's a marketing and sponsorship partnership for our
customers on the high wealth category who have many times said that they have both cards in their wallets. They've got
the U.S. Bank flex card but they also have the AMEX card. We also wanted to recognize that – I'm not trying to get
them into their close loop, so it is not a transaction activity. It's not a system activity for U.S. Bancorp. It's more of a
brand. So we will still have the U.S. Bank brand and AMEX card for our top customers. They will have the ability to
have the very high end treatment that an AMEX customer receives but also be able to be granted U.S. Bank and receive
some of the products and services that they receive now as our top customers. So, it's a little bit more than branding but
it's a lot less than anything more sophisticated than you might think as it relates to kind of work close loop or try to
change tracks, if you will. We're still a Visa, MasterCard originating company. But for these very small core customers,
we actually think sometimes if you can't beat them, join them. And AMEX does a particularly exceptional product, the
very highest in for services even in and above the credit card needs of customers. So, I think it was the right thing to do.
It's not going to move the needle a lot, but we're satisfied with the early stage announcement and I think our customers
are happy with it as well.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just while we're on card, I know that, on your website you're very vocal
about the fact that you are tracking fraud and everything else. But you've also been very vocal as a firm with regard to
taking fraud prevention forward. So, I don't know if you could comment at all on what you're thinking in a post-Target
world around moving toward tokenization or EMV.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I'm a big supporter of progress in all of those protective areas. Also being the chair of
the clearinghouse, we're working on tokenization and cloud use for some of those protections and encryption. I guess
what I would tell you is, it's disappointing that with the retailer fraud that's occurred, it certainly as a burden on the
banks, because we have most of our customers as well that are affected if they use, in this case, some of those
merchants that were affected. And so, we are moving to re-produce all new cards for those customers. They're doing
through a methodical process for those who have fraud, or we know they have fraud or they worry they have fraud,
they're getting card reissues immediately, both credit and debit to the extent that we will eventually track every
customer who would we think could have been affected by that time period. We're reissuing all of those cards. We're
not announcing it as a broad event. We're just indicating to our customers that, as it goes, we want to make sure they're
protected and that their information isn't out in the open say a year from now when people aren't paying attention.
More germane to the issue, Betsy, is one of my concerns that EMV is not necessarily the endpoint, it's just another step
in the journey. And as we get to mobile banking when you look at Cloud and the other encryptions, it'd be interesting to
see whether or not we have to stop now and go back to chip EMV, or if we want to leapfrog that and get to the more, I
think, provocative outcome which is going to be the necessary standard, not many years from now and whether the

marketplace reacts and how they react to the breaches that have occurred in some of the more recent merchants is going
to be yet to be seen. So banks will be out already. It's a bank-merchant partnership. Merchants would have to change
the terminals and their willingness to spend the money that have chip-receiving cards. We have to reissue cards on
chips. Every one of our customers that travel overseas has been getting a chip card for years because it is necessary
over in Europe and some places in Canada.
But I think that's the story we told. The next couple of months, ask me again in April, and we'll just see how it's settled.
But I think there's one of school of thought that says let's spend all of our energy on the more sophisticated endpoint of
mobile banking and Cloud encryption. Others might say we haven't got the time to waste. Let's jump through the chip
step, and we will end up getting to the other point on the layer. We'll be open to either one, because we're an acquirer or
issuer. We're deep in the conversation. There's other alternatives even that I haven't mentioned, but we'll do what's
right, whatever the marketplace want. And as banks have proven with merchants together, we'll get the right answer
because we all want customers to feel safe.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So in terms of timeframe and spent from your perspective, is it something that is
obviously ongoing, people have said that maybe the chip and tokenization would be a three- to five-year timeframe. Do
you feel like that might be a little bit sooner, and would we see any of this in the expense line, or is it too small?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. It should have a deadline of 2015. So if it would be in the next couple of years, it's
more expensive to issue a chip card for sure than a magnetic stripe, but it's not going to break anybody's bank. And the
receipt is probably more of an issue on the merchant's side where they have to reprogram all of their terminals. I'm not
talking small businesses as well as the large merchants where they have to change out terminals. And some merchants
buy those terminals, so that the fixed costs would have to change. Many others will leave those terminals which might
be a bit easier for that transition. Those are the kind of fundamentals that will come through. The economic review of
this. But you and I both know there will be a political and maybe a regulatory view of this that might change those
outcomes and either force one solution or another based on their concerns from politicians and the protection of citizens
or regulators' concerns for or consumer protection. I think there's a lot of studying to be done because the simple
answer isn't just go from one to the other because that is only one step in a longer journey. But I do think in the next 90
days, we'll have a better as this settles. And people decide where the risk is.
I'll close with this, though. To the extent that other information that's not card-related gets taken or the fraudulent
operator has the information to access to things that are more than card-related, we should all be quite concerned,
because at the end of the day, the banks will bear the burden in most cases. And 14 months from now, one of my
customers who's been a victim of some fraud that's been and above data that was taken from a card situation, and all of
a sudden my fraud levels are higher in the second quarter of 2015. I probably will never be able to trace it in any one
circumstance. But it will just be a higher environment for risk, like having more breakage off the shelves. So we all
have to be much smarter and we are spending a lot of time outside of the card area watching for fraud behaviors and
watching and monitoring activities to protect customers.
What that means, Betsy, is more customers are going to have to be tolerant when a really good bank has the protection
of them, first and foremost, and says I just discovered fraud or potential fraud. I disrupted your environment for a
minute because I want to either change your account number or stop a transaction because I feel like you're going to be
a victim if we don't stop it now. I think this recent episode, the last couple of months might help consumers realize that
their protection really is worth a bit of disruption if it protects them in the long-term. So there's some good learning that
will come out of this, and I think thanks to merchants who work together, than we have in the past, probably more in
the future to protect customers and make them feel we all have their best interest at heart. It will be a while.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, great. Thanks for the color on that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Thanks. A question that I had, you talked about – you've been able to improve the capital
position of the company based upon the earnings even though you returned 65% of capital during the full year in 2013.
I mean, how should we think about that? I mean is that – should that number be higher as we go forward, I mean, given
that you've been able to actually do both?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Moshe, it's Richard. I'll start. We've said for as long as actually I can remember that we
would return 30% to 40% of our earnings in the form of dividends and 30% to 40% in the form of buybacks. 2013, the
full year, was 71%. The quarter was 65%. And so we're more in that range. I will also say to you, because the leading
follow-up question is, as it relates to one of those two measures, it's currently limited by the total reserve C-card
process at 30%. And at this point, we're going to continue to abide by those general rules and follow the guidance that
we've been given to stay at that parameter. It will be a time, I hope, that the fed will say certain banks have earned their
permission to go back to allowing the dividends to be what they think is reasonable and supportable. In that case, we
probably would float above that 30% level. But we're not eager to do it at this stage and we have plenty of room and
opportunity on the buyback side to still stay within that range of 60% to 80%. We like the 20% left for ourselves,
because we do expect to be an acquirer. We expect to take opportunities when something comes along, particularly in
trust or payment.
And I'll tell you there's a great deal of innovation and R&D that we're spending money on that much of which will
eventually come to bear fruit. Some of it will prove that we'll learn what doesn't look. But in this environment now,
banks didn't use to be innovators and in this environment, you want us to be. You want us to be the leaders or fast
followers and work with a lot of other companies with expertise that we might not necessarily have ever had in our
legacy. So 60% to 80% is right in the sweet spot. We're at 71%. And I think right now where we are is a good indicator
what we'll be for 2014.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And Moshe, I'd add that we were at 8.6% in the third quarter dropping to 8.8%. A good part
of that increase was a reduction in the pension debit which is a reduction to capital. The pension debit went down
because rates went up. So, that's a one-time phenomenon, and I would expect us in 2014 to sort of be in that 8.5 range
for most of the year.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got you. Just kind of as a follow-up on the idea, Richard, you touched on the idea of
acquisitions and you've actually announced a branch acquisition recently. What's the environment like for those types
of acquisitions?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: They still went up. Went up, mostly. I mean, where we are always interested in deepening
our depth where we have a branch network. So, we like branches, as you know. And we are going to be probably a net
grower, small but net grower over the next year. It might not be exactly the same place. They might be in partnerships
with universities or grocery stores and things. But we like adding branches. And the opportunity to double down, like in
Chicago's worthwhile. And any of our 25 states currently had an opportunity like that, we would be interested. What
you know I'm not interested in is jumping states or getting a handful of branches in a state where you really have no
critical mass or even in a state where you can't build up distinctions to call out market leadership.
I also don't see us doing a full bank transactions, unless the transaction is still attractive because of the risks I talked
about before that aligned with picking up the problems and the legacy issues that you may not ever be able to know at
due diligence and you simply can't price for. So, I think deals like branch-related in-market transactions, and the two
deals we highlighted in our earnings call here today, on services or even European businesses or payments or trusts, are
things you can expect to see more of. And we do have a number of toes in the water in those opportunities but none
will move the needle but over time they add up.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. As you look at the payments business and the fees were up about 3%
year-over-year, obviously the government piece was a drag. But looking towards 2014, it should be much less of a drag
from here. How should we think about the revenue growth in that combined segment? And I'm thinking just the
payment fees overall, not just as the government fees.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. Good question, Matt. So first, this quarter we have a lot of the merchant activities are
measured by same-store sales, and same-store sales were up about 3% domestically and about 4% globally. So Europe
actually outdid the U.S. in that regard. We were way down this year by the government side of the equation. As we said
in the call, government spend was down about 17%, 18% year over year. I think that will begin to stabilize next year.
And I think you should expect the total payments category to get closer to what is our normal long-term growth there.
But not quite to that level until same-store sales start to increase a point or two. So, the anchor that we saw this year on
the corporate payments, I think, will begin to diminish as we get into '14.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And Matt, it's Richard. Just as a reminder, the total payments base for us is about a quarter of
our revenue. Corporate payments is about 20% of that quarter. And government is about 20% of that stake. So, it's not a
big driver, but we like it. We're going to stay with it. I don't believe that we have the same kind of future trajectory, a
negative trajectory that we've seen in the last two years with both the sequester and the ending of the work. So, for us,
we'll be glad we stayed with it. We had it carried across the at random. At the same time, mortgage fees were falling
but I think that they both have some stability going into 2014, and just we'll be glad that we stuck with it. But it's not as
big as it looked. It's more of a headline but at least it's staying with – because I think it starts to turn the corner in 2014.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, the Chicago branch deal. Have you talked about the
potential earnings impact from that, or I'm sure there's still some cost savings and some investments that you might be
making, how all of that nets out?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: For 2014, Matt, it's not material to our number.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Maybe a little branch consolidation, but for that, it's really a opportunity to be more present
in a really big city, and what I'm hoping for is that the synergies to the hundred branches we have will be as powerful as
the ability to incite kind of new growth to the hundred that we're picking up. And then be a more pervasive across
Chicagoland. And it's a great market for us. We've got great leadership there. And we've actually kind of been
managing over our skis a little bit in terms of our exposure, our marketing and our visibility. And I think we've got now
have the chance to catch up to it and if I could grow more there, I would continue to do so.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: But if the infrastructure that you have now and the market that you've been doing – it's all
scalable. There's not going to be an expense, kind of ramp up as you look out?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No. There will not be.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, so as I was trying to say, we pretty much all the fixed costs were already there. We're
just going to add something nice to make it more visible.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Got it. Makes sense. Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Matt.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. Thank you very much. Going back to your loan portfolio, one of the areas that you've
really done a great job is your residential mortgages, and I believe most of them are jumbos. Can you talk a little bit --
and I think they're ARMs, am I correct? How is the general market -because we're hearing that it's very overheated
definitely coming out of the west coast where large banks out there are competing very aggressively in that market?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Paul, actually most of our growth is in a product called smart refinance in a high quality
branch originated refinance product for our core customers. And that is what's driving it. And a lot of that is -- it's not a
30-year product, it's a shorter product. We are seeing a phenomenon occur, just like you're seeing in the total mortgage
business. Refinancing activity is starting to go down. So that line will start to go down. But on the flipside, home equity
line of equity activity is increasing. So those are the trends I think you'll start to see into the next few quarters.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And we are active in the jumbo space. And we have been all along and it's pretty much
started towards our private client-type customer, and many of those are ARMs.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: So, is that mainly coming out of your private client product mix, what I'd guess?
<A - P. W. Parker>: A good chunk of it. Some of it comes out through the branches in states like California where
you have such high home values.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: [indiscernible] (37:45).
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then on your securities portfolio, you talked about that you wanted to grow that to about
$85 billion. What type of duration would a new product with the new stuff coming on are you shooting for?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, we're keeping it pretty short. About half floaters, half fixed. And you can think of it in
the term about 3, 3 1/2 years.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning, Richard, Andy.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Just a question this big picture as far as revenue growth and operating leverage, it's like six of
the deck shows that the year-over-year revenue growth has still been easily negative, largely because of mortgage
comps and the payments. But as we look ahead – Richard to your point about getting the efficiency ratio back down
towards the low 50s%, can you especially help us understand the dynamic. How close are we to a point of getting that
year-over-year comp and revenues back to positive, and then how also do you think expenses can kind of trend along
with that?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. So, we do kind of manage the company, the governor is revenue. And when we put
our profit plan together late last year, we worked from a bottom's up, and we figured out what the revenue growth
would be. And as I've told you before, the plan would be the expenses will be less than that. So I can tell you that our
intent is to have a positive operating leverage. I won't take one quarter at a time because we're fairly heavy second
quarter and third quarter positive, and then without government in the fourth quarter, we have that falloff and quarter
one is a tougher quarter just because of the new year expenses. But we are looking for positive operating leverage, first
and foremost, Ken, in 2014.

Now the other thing I said, the code for that, though, is since we're not expecting revenue growth to be overly robust,
we expect to be at least as good if not more what you've seen in the last year or two. We're going to watch our
expenses, and we have a good run rate of expense to start with. We've been part of some regulatory consent order
through mortgage, which was a fairly expensive task that we've now used some of those moneys and reallocate it to
other compliance activities.
We're not seeing an undue increase in expenses in order to run the company safely. But at the same taken, but for merit
increases and necessary capital expenditures, finishing what we started, this will be a year that we'll lift them off our
investments, following through just on fruition. And we won't start a lot of new banks. That's U.S. Bank's way of
lodging expenses. We don't cut expenses because we'll never get over our fees. We don't go out and create an
environment where we have a consultant come in and give us a new program and start reducing people or our working
force. We typically watch every single 30 days to make sure we don't do something that the revenue won't allow us to.
So, you have to trust us. We're going to continue that, deliver a positive operating leverage, because it's how we grow
the company, it's how you end up making the success that you can count on predictable. But as each month goes, we'll
adjust as we always do. But I think we're expecting revenue to be strong enough to allow for some expense growth. So
we're going to watch our nickels and dimes until this environment is assuredly on its feet and there's a recovery well.
And we don't see that quite yet, so we're just going to watch everything we do. I really appreciated the questions early
on regarding that – of the non-bottom line impact of the accounting changes that we talked about with some of our tax
credits, because we want you all to know it's not a material, if not at all impact to the bottom line. And it's more of a
landscape issue for quarter four. We are committed to staying low in the 50s% in its efficiency, because we're going to
let revenue grow faster than expenses. So, nothing's changed, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.
But except for this a little bit of blip, we're going to continue to deliver for you all. So I'll tell you there wouldn't be a
year, probably not this one, where revenue is going to really take off for a lot of reasons. And while the expenses are a
little higher than they might this year, but they're still well below that. And the way to your heart is to keep efficiency
positive and make sure operating leverage is the way to drive the bottom line, and I'm feeling pretty good about it.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Great. And just a question within the expenses and one little one on the tax thing. You
mentioned, Andy, the benefit in the pension side on the capital side. Are you going to see a pension benefit, and is that
built into your expectation for the first quarter expenses for this year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes and yes.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: I mean, can you help us understand the magnitude of that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, the increase that we saw from 2012 to 2013 is going to almost go back to the level it was
in 2012 in terms of the pension expense. It went up $140 million or so and it will go down about that same range.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then the last thing on the tax thing. So the minority interest piece, I don't think you
talked about that. That kind had been running at a minus 40. So, does that now also continue at the same plus-15 range
given those changes?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. There will be no further change in the minority interest piece.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: So it will kind of stay from here. Okay.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Correct.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And just credit, your comment about first quarter charge-offs being up and reserve releases a
little bigger this quarter, can you just talk to us about how – do you continue to expect any more reserve bleed to go
ahead?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, we had strong improvement in credit in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate we'll
have continued improvement in credit in the first quarter. Losses will be up a little bit, really not because of the
charge-off side, but really because of the wholesale recovery side. We've had some significant wholesale recoveries in

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions, please. The first is your
GAAP assets look like they went up a little less than 1%. But your Basel III risk-weighted assets went up a little over
1.5%. Can you just explain what accounted for the difference?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Commitments, off balance sheet commitments.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. Primarily lending commitments, I'm assuming?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Correct. And as we talked about the fact that our commitment levels are growing more
rapidly than our outstandings, which is a good thing in the long-term, and on a 10% annualized basis, and that's the
principal driver.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thank you. And then you and several other institutions have announced the
discontinuation of deposit advance products. How should we think about the influence of that on either the fee or NII
line items?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: This is Richard. I'll go first. I'll let Andy talk about the financial impact. It's not significant,
first of all. But I'm disappointed that the product is gone because it was probably the most popular customer product I
think I've ever had as a banker. It met a need. It was very transparent, it was very clear, but it simply just didn't meet the
tenets of the regulatory view of total APR and a certain calculation and the general sense that people were otherwise
being harmed. So of course we moved along and followed the guidance and we're now ending the product at the end of
this month and we'll wind it down in the next couple.
What I'm more interested is trying to find a replacement of such product, so that we can find something for those
consumers that will otherwise stay in the protected banking industry where there is oversight and protections, which I
support greatly. And we're working now with the regulators, primarily the OCC, to see if we can develop some kind of
a replacement product.
It's too new to have that, so we haven't got that built into our plan. So as we really expect, it'll be a second half loss and
most of the impact falls to spread income. But I'll leave it to Andy to give a little more dimension.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So as Richard said, we would expect very little impact in the first half of the year
given than we're going to continue with our current customers until midyear. In the second half of the year, the product
earns approximately $50 million a quarter, it goes through loan fees or net interest income. And that would be the
impact if the product in and of itself went away. But as Richard mentioned, we're working on alternatives and we'll
keep you updated on the impacts as we work through those alternatives.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. And just following on – and this is my last question – given the influence of this
change as well as the liquidity guidance that you provided earlier in the call, how should we now be thinking about the
net interest margin over the next several quarters?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, you know the net interest margin, absent the CAA issue that we just talked about and
the securities build, is relatively stable. So the principal change will be the securities build. The securities build impacts
net interest rate margin, the rate. It has no impact on net interest income at all. It comes on at fairly neutral spreads. So

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Good morning. Could you just touch on the strength that you had in the commercial products
this quarter and the sustainability of that?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So it's across many categories. We had a good quarter in high grade underwriting, we had a
good quarter in letter of credit activity, FX. Just across many categories. And I attribute this back to some of the
investments we've made over the years in terms of building those capabilities, both with people, products and services,
and technology. So that is a real positive story for us and I would expect it to continue into 2014.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Keith, it's Richard. Every once in while you get that moment when you can actually prove
something and so here we were three or four years ago talking about taking our wholesale bank and moving it from
regional to national, creating scale, hiring people in New York and Charlotte. And you say, when are you going to see
the benefits? This is a great example, Keith, of where that's starting to show up and coming on a more consistent basis.
We've always been a bank to a large number of large customers, Fortune 100 customers, but we always didn't have all
the products and services. The last few years, we got a chance to become more important to them in their syndicated
line of credit. We moved up in their view of being a trusted partner. And now we get the fee businesses as well more
often than we used to. And that is exactly where this kind of benefit shows up a few years later.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. Thanks. And then could you give us some color on the magnitude of any equity gains
were this quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. It was minimal. So if you look at the other income line, you'll actually see an
improvement. But that was more a function of the third quarter having some negatives. The fourth quarter was
relatively neutral.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly on the repurchase, the reserve and repurchase costs going
forward, how should we think about this "more normal run rate" for that line item?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, so we had the settlement of $53 million with Freddie here in the fourth quarter and
we're down to a level that – we're probably still a little bit higher than where we'd be over the long term, but we're
starting to get to a level that I think is more normal in terms of historic levels. So we're not quite there, but it's not going
to be a material change on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You bet.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Andy, first I got a quick question for you on the expense given the guidance for first
quarter being closer in line with previous third quarter, did that imply that there was a good bit of pull forward of
business development and marketing expenses that occurred this quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No, not necessarily a pull forward. It's just a seasonal impact that we typically see. So if you
look at the expense increase from third quarter to fourth quarter, about half of it was the tax related and then about half
of it was things like legal and professional and marketing expense. And if you look at our history, Chris, you'll see that
the fourth quarter is seasonally higher in those categories and then seasonally it comes down in the first quarter.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. That's fair. Bill, a question for you. Going back to the reserves for a little bit, and I
think I ask this question almost every time I see you, could we see the pace of reserve releases actually pick up from
here? It's been pretty steady around $30 million, $35 million or so. I mean, I had a bank yesterday that released more
reserves in terms of taking the reserve ratio down in one quarter than you guys have done in four quarters. And my
God, BofA now has a lower reserve ratio than you do. So I was kind of wondering, given the continuing improvement
in credit quality, could the pace of the reserve releases pick up in 2014?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, I'll speak for our bank, right? I don't think so. What we're left with is really improvement
in residential mortgage and home equity. Those are really the only two portfolios where there's still work to be done in
terms of the fallout from the recession. So absent that, I would say we're steady as she goes for the moment. But there's
probably not lots of reserve release.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Chris, it's Richard. One of the things I hope you guys like about us is we're not that
interesting and volatile. And it's a great example. We didn't have anywhere near the same credit issue in the first place.
We didn't have to bill the reserves in the first place, and we've been very steady and methodical and thoughtful, all in
line with regulator views and accountant views to make sure that we're not living on and counting on these reserve
releases. And you shouldn't, either, because it's not sustainable. I think you'll see a lot more of what we've done in the
past until we get to the point of stability where all of sudden we're all going to stop having reserve releases. And in a
forward view, there should be a day when banks are growing loans, balance sheets growing, and we're adding to our
reserves at a level equal to and higher than the current day because those are for future loan charge-offs. So I think
we're probably closest to that inflection point. But this year we'll have a little bit more. But we haven't relied on it to get
to this point. We're not counting on it to get through this year or the next one either.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: I tend to agree with you, but it just feel frustrating when I see bank stocks go up on reserve
releases, and you guys are more prudent going for a full cycle and you don't get credit for the quality of earnings. But in
any event ...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I haven't noticed but...
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: If I could just follow up one with Bill. So from your comments, it seems like – then you
believe the reserve-for-loan ratio for your individual bank will be higher than it was previous to the crisis, whether it's
from a re-regulatory process or what have you, so whether it was 1.25% to 1.50% previous to the cycle, we're going to
be somewhat higher than that?
<A - P. W. Parker>: The first thing you have to do is look at the difference in mix, though. And we do have a fairly
large card portfolio relative to the size of our balance sheet relative to our peers. So, that's obviously going to keep our
totals higher and then again, as Richard said, we just didn't go up as much. So, we're just not going to go down as
much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You know, over the course of time, we're at 0.53% charge-off, right, and we think over the
course of time, long time, this bank is a 1% charge-off. And with FAS 114 and other areas, we want to make sure we
stay aligned with that. And for our investors, we think to the extend we can stay within the bounds of all the rules and
not create these volatilities that would occur to give it away too much than deal with that when you don't need it. But
again aligned with rules and regulations, we would love to stay as steady as we can and have the appropriate level. And

that just serves as another form of capital if you have a good reserve portfolio for loans that could go bad. But for
reasons we all know, I don't think any bank isn't under where their long-term run rate will be. And we know in the last
few years that we've been [indiscernible] (53:26) as an industry on loans when we shouldn't have. But it was probably
the record loan position that we're going to start building that back. So don't anyone be disappointed when charge-off
rates start to move up, provision releases stop and provision bill starts, that's actually a pretty good sign that we're all
getting back to doing what we're supposed to do, which is make loans to qualified people and every once in a while one
doesn't get paid back.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Steve.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to circle back to the Chicago branch
acquisition for a moment. I'm just curious as you kind of look at the long-term potential opportunity there, do you see
the greatest potential benefit over the long-term from ramping up loan growth or cross-selling and further penetrating
customer base net market? Just kind of curious how you look at that long-term potential benefit, where is the biggest
source of opportunity for you?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Steve, good question. You know, if we had our druthers, we started from the bottom, we
would always be top one, two, or three in every market in terms of consumer, small business and wealth management.
First of all, because you're pervasive enough to matter, you're in someone's life, at or near their work, near their home,
in between and now on mobile technology, you're pervasive to them. That's our goal. I'm not going to get out of market
where I'm sixth or seventh if we're still good for the shareholders, but I would love to move up in the every market's top
three. Chicago is going to take a while. But we're going to move up to seventh or eighth.
In terms of branch distribution, we might get in the top five, and we can find other deals to cobble together and maybe
grocery partners and things we can get into the top three or four. That's really what we're headed toward. Then scale
matters, right? So every time I run an ad in the Chicago Tribune, we do something on mobile technology or
Chicagoland, we do sponsorship of something and partner with the city or some of the suburbs. It all just goes so much
further and so much deeper and so much better. Employees are more enthused. We get more of kind of a reputation
built, and it's one of the greatest cities in the country. So it is also worth investing there for a long term, because it is a
pretty loyal market.
So for us, it's a step toward getting in the top most pervasive companies and the two or three really, really big
companies, they're our legacy, and we're legacy in a couple of other big markets. And legacy always has to worry that
they're going to get old and become part of kind of an old-fashioned paradigm. And we're going to try to protect
ourselves when we're really big. And when we were not big, we're going to be that really vicious competitor that comes
up and tries to reset the paradigm and get people to pay attention to us. So, this deal was perfect on all accounts.
Financially, it just accrues because of its scale and because it allows us to extend in a market that's going to grow
because Chicago will grow.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: It makes total sense. But I know you said you're more than willing to look at – there are
more of these transactions in other markets. The question I have is, do you think you might get the opportunity? Just
curious what your thoughts might be on that.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: I think we're considered a disciplined buyer, and so the deals you'll never know are the ones
that came and went because we said there is no way we're going to pay that for that. But every once in a while, one
comes along the motivations of the seller and our interest is high, the price is good for both parties, including the
shareholders, and this is one of those that came together. So if those circumstances align again, we'll do more of these
deals because we think that it's the right way to take advantage, especially in that unfinished, kind of unsettled market
where until things are normal again, some people have a need to shed assets, others like us, who'd be interested in
acquiring assets where they make sense and kind of jumpstart the organic trip that otherwise happens at normal times.
So if we're going to do another deal, the financial will be fine that if more come along on these terms, we'll take them.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Mike.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I was trying to gauge your conviction level that loan growth is coming back. On the one
hand, Richard you're expressing optimism that we've heard from several other bank CEOs. On the other hand, what I
think I heard you guys say is that loan utilization declined, now to 23%, that your customers aren't drawing down their
deposits, which is a leading indicator that you don't expect a whole lot of loan growths the next quarter or two, and that
you, yourselves, are still watching your nickels and dimes a lot given some uncertainty. So, I know you've been more
conservative than most over the years and we're all trying to figure out the pace of loan growth, then what sort of
leading indicator is sentiment or is that informal, is this a gut feel? Just any other color on loan growth?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. So Mike, to Erika's question, number one, I think I said it was a tale of two halves, and
I was confessing that it's solely sentiment from my customers and my bankers that tells me that things are better than
they've been. It is not on the balance sheet, it's not evidential at all, which is why we're going to agree with you that
first deposits continues, then lines that are already outstanding get used, and then new lines get created and we haven't
seen any of that. So, it is purely sentiment and perhaps it's a lot of just pent-up long overdue demand to get things
moving. But sentiment is always the leading indicator, right?
And so I think as I said before, spring will tell this story more than most springs, and at the second half will be what the
sentiment yields as low results, or it will be nothing more than a sentiment. And we'll be talking in April and again in
July as saying at least we see at least consistent loan growth in the 6%-plus annualized long growth even doing it
through the whole recession for a reason we can't keep doing it. But at the same time, you've heard us before. We're not
going to compete on term, on structure. We're going to compete on rate. And we can continue to do that if rates are
seeing a little bit of compression. So we'll be thoughtful about it. But you repeated what I said, which is it's simply a
sentiment. I don't have that in evidence yet. And when the evidence starts, the best news I'll have for you is if deposits
are drawing down, lines are getting used and people are starting to show an interest in being involved.
I said before, too, that I do think that perhaps different than almost any other recovery coming from a recession that
there will not be the consumer that blinks first. It will be the businesses, meaning that the consumer is not going to
evidence like it always has. A real strong sense that we're now ready, get ready, we're going to buy. I think the
businesses are going to have to find a way to incentivize that interest and incentivize the product creations, innovation
or pricing and start pulling consumers across to start investing. As long as investing consumers are starting to feel
better and the products are more interesting and the pricing is more attractive. I think that's the magic that will pull this
one out. But for the first time, I think businesses will draw through this recovery, didn't really have a lot to do with their
behaviors in and above whatever sentiment we're hearing from consumers.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And as one follow-up. You talked about the trade-off between price and loan growth and, as a
low cost producer, you can probably afford to charge lower rates on the loans. But you have seen compression across

long as you're growing some NII, it's okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, to focus on the one area of loan
growth, specifically it looked like commercial real estate outstandings were rising at a faster pace in the fourth quarter
than they have on a year-over-year basis. We've heard from a number of competitors, particularly in the southeast that,
that is a growing area of competition. What's your sense in your markets as to the demand for commercial real estate
opportunities and looking into 2014, and how competitive has the pricing gotten?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, I'll start with the demand. I mean, we have seen pretty good demand on the coast and
in the southeast, as you mentioned. The southeast was our fastest growing market in the fourth quarter. And we have
heard from our clients that they are seeing more demand for their product, whether it's storage or build-to-suits and
more than just the multifamily that we've seen in the past several quarters. So, we are seeing a pickup in demand, which
is positive. And then on the pricing, I think to the extent there's been pricing compression, I think that's mostly behind
us. I think the pricing is fairly stable right now. So, we saw a good demand in the fourth quarter and expect it to
continue next year.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And if I can follow up with a question on the Capital Markets side. Rich, you've
obviously been quite correctly optimistic particularly for your own business over the last couple of years. As we head
into a higher rate cycle, there's concerns, I think, across the broader market that demand for fixed income underwriting
may come down a little bit, demand potentially, conversely, for equity underwriting may increase. How are you
looking at that business heading into 2014 in terms of some of the bigger picture trends that are affecting interest rates?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You know, Matt, I think I still see 2014 looking a lot like 2013. You've got leverage lending
and the middle market activity still pretty high. You've got syndicated issuance still getting better over time, primarily
refinancing and that refinancing is opposed to new transactions, creates a bit of a downward pressure on yields. We've
got loan growth looking seasonally best in the western market and particularly seasonally high in food and Ag, some of
the retail groups. As it relates to more traditional lending, that's where we would see – and expected, by the way,
everything is performing as we thought it would just kind of slow annuity-like.
As it relates to the more sophisticated transactions, what we're seeing in the Capital Markets, particularly a deal event,
event action-oriented items where someone who want to buy another company or make a particular transaction in the
market to create some additional financing and we're there now where we didn't used to be, and we can handle those
activities. But kind of following the conversation with Mike, the sentiment isn't necessarily any stronger than it was to
generate a sense that, that's going to be different in 2014. But it's not worse than it was in 2013, it just seems to be kind
of a slow, steady part of the recovery and I think the very high end of the market reflects exactly what the low end is
which is careful, thoughtful, event-driven but taking advantage when the chance comes along, and the whole economy
is still uneven. So there are people who have something they want to get rid of and others who find value in it. And
that's kind of where we are until we do something more predictable. Bill, do you want to add to that?

<A - P. W. Parker>: Well, I think in terms of the Capital Markets activity, I think 2013 was obviously a very good
year for refinancing and higher rates may moderate that a little bit. But there's still a lot of acquisition activity and that
will clearly generate bond activity. So, we anticipate that we'll benefit from that.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hey there. Good morning. As you can imagine, most of the questions have been asked.
But I have two technical questions I wanted to follow up on. You had mentioned in the tax line that there was a state
benefit, I think. But what was the magnitude of that this quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It is. Actually the rate by about 1%, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. And then lastly on the mortgage repurchase reserves, there was a change in reserve
of about $30 million. With that geography on that, if that's a benefit or a reduction of expenses, that's probably in other
expenses, is that correct?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: It's actually an increase in mortgage revenue and it's a reassessment of – we reassess every
certain levels every quarter and adjust to what we think is the appropriate level. And that's reflected in mortgage
revenue.

are. And at the middle market level, if you don't have branches, you have to be valuable to these folks in a different
way because you have to get them up on the cash measurement, treasury management, products and some of the
service, meaning it would be more technical and more mobile. That's how we're having success there.
It's probably 4% to 5% of our total. It's not a very big number. It's not intended to be because I do think you get to a
certain level that you get to the point where you have branches. On the larger end, we can do business in all 50 states,
because the corporate customers, it is not even the first three questions of whether or not you have branches and they're
not looking for that. So, we're a full-on national provider in both corporate and commercial real estate.
But as it relates to middle market, it's probably a 4% to 5% impact on our total, and unless and until we were to find a
very large branch acquisition in an adjacent space, it's going to stay that way, because we're just going to really drill
down where people know us best and have the ability if they want us to use our services on the ground.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous Research.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Brian.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hi, Good morning. Just a couple quick follow-ups. On the commitment growth you saw, I
know every business is different, every line is different, but is there any kind of historical rule of thumb you would look
to for the typical lag between commitments turning into funded balances?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, this is Bill. I would say we sort of exceeded the historical lag. So, normally by this time in
an expansionary period you would be seeing these lines being drawn more than they are today. I mean, some of our
categories are down 10% in terms of normal utilization level. So, I think we're still all anticipating when this
confidence turns into investment.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And I would say that surprisingly they're all down a lot, very much the same. In terms of
traditional history, commercial real estate should be last in, last out in terms of problems and in terms of growth and it's
probably the same in this cycle. But if you get anything from small business to commercial real estate, specialty
products to community banking, they're all down. In fact, even more – Bill, our collective utilization for the wholesale
credits for this company was at 38%, [ph] kind of (01:08:55) more at 23%, and that's on well over $100 billion. So that
in its own right is just a huge place.
Bill said it right, we're in places we've never been. There's nowhere to go but up. But the next month if we go down
again, we'll say it one more time. But I like the fact that it's pent-up opportunity. It's one step better than an unknown
line or loan at this stage, because these are people paying for it. They're paying us to have the privilege to have a line.
They want to have the access to it. The fact that we kept growing lines over 11% last year just as they are planning to
do something, and that kind of feeds my sentiment issue I answered with Mike Mayo, which is actually that number
gets stronger, not weaker. So we've got a lot of canaries in the mine, they're all chirping but nothing is happening yet.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: That's very helpful. And on the commercial products, I guess just as a follow-up or
clarification, when I think I heard you say 2014 should look a lot like 2013, we should be working off the 2013 full
year base, not the run rate from the fourth quarter for that line item, right?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Correct.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: And then lastly on – when you think about capital, and I guess it touches on the question, I
think, Erika asked, RWA growth versus asset growth, I mean, when I look at some of the other super-regionals who are

in that advanced approach bucket, mega-regionals, whatever you want to call them, RWAs have been falling even as
assets have been growing for the past two to three quarters. And I wonder, is that a pent-up opportunity for U.S. Bank
or because some of your peers have more be it punitive, not investment-grade securities and things like that? Are they
just reversing out of capital penalty you never had to begin with?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I can't tell you what others are doing. I will tell you ours is pretty straight forward. First of
all, while we're in an advanced approach purchase bank, the ratio we're giving you is a standardized approach because
that is the constraint. That is the lower ratio. So it's a pretty simple equation, it's basically commitments that are causing
the off balance sheet growth.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Thank you. Appreciate it.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning, guys. Two quick follow-ups. Andy, on net interest income, you
mentioned the net interest margin outlook for the first quarter. Do you hope to grow the net interest income dollars
because the balance sheet is still growing but you might have some seasonality in terms of the account pressure, I
guess? What would be the outlook for the net interest income dollars?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Good question, John. All things being equal, I would expect it to be stable. But the first
quarter has two fewer days than the fourth quarter. And that in and of itself costs us about $30 million to $35 million.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Otherwise you expect it to be flattish?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Pretty close, yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on the expenses, you gave the outlook for the first quarter. Would
you expect the expenses to be declining from the first quarter? In other words, are there seasonal items that inflate the
first quarter expenses as well?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No, I would say the first quarter is sort of a normal quarter in terms of activity. There are
some things that are higher like FICA expense, some things that are lower like legal and professional, but overall it is
relatively representative.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So to the extent the first quarter efficiency ratio is below the year, it's really the
seasonal pressure on some of the fee income lines?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. The first quarter is a seasonally low quarter in terms of fees, particularly in the
payments business, card and merchant. It's the lowest quarter of the year.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: There's no holidays. We got paydowns on the credit cards. So it's always our recovery
quarter. But that's when things pick up in quarters two and three.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Great. Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, John. You bet.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Good morning. Could you talk about the non-QM markets, do you expect to participate
in it? And if so, do you expect it to have an incremental uptick in residential loan growth on your balance sheet?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Well, we are going to participate in the non-QR market, and much of it is very similar to
what we do today. So, again, we do offer today interest only loans to private client-type customers. We do offer lower
loan-to-value loans that might not meet the 43% debt-to-income in the QM. So, on a go-forward basis, it doesn't have a
material impact on the types of loans that we're going to be putting on our balance sheet.
<A>: That's right.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: There's a few unrelated. You'll hear, Kevin, that we really don't have any kind of impact at
all from loan origination.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Would you change anything about the product, whether it's term or rate in order to take
into account the risks associated with non-QM lending?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: No. I mean we recognize the risk and we've mitigated it with either higher down payments,
in general wealthier customers, that type of thing. So, we believe that we have the offset built into the underwriting.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thank you, Kevin.
