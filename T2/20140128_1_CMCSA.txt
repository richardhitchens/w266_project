MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Comcast Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Armstrong. Please go ahead, Mr.
Armstrong.
Jason S. Armstrong
Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here, and I'm really excited to have recently joined
Comcast. Joining me on this morning's call are Brian Roberts, Michael Angelakis, Steve Burke and Neil Smit. As
we've done in the past, Brian and Michael will make formal remarks, and Steve and Neil will be available for Q&A.
I know in my prior role, I would've been tempted to ask the questions about recent press headlines surrounding
consolidation in the cable sector, but our intention here today is to talk about our fourth quarter and 2013 results, and
we have no comment on press speculation or potential industry consolidation. Let me now refer you to slide number 2,
which contains are Safe Harbor disclaimer and remind you that this conference call may include forward-looking
statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, in this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP
financial measures. Please refer to our 8-K for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.
With that, let me turn the call to Brian Roberts for his comments. Brian?

Brian L. Roberts
Thank you, Jason, and let me officially welcome you to Comcast and to this earnings call. We're all delighted to have
you leading Investor Relations.
We just celebrated Comcast 50th anniversary, and it was a wonderful and emotional experience for many of the
employees in the company and a chance to reflect on the past. But I have to say the best part is really thinking about
our future, where the company is headed, and all the opportunities that lay before us. And as we exit 2013, we really
have strong momentum across all our businesses, and we've achieved some fantastic financial milestones in 2013. And
today, we are reporting results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2013, strong results that demonstrate our
confidence and optimism in the future of all our businesses, so we're increasing our dividend 15%, increasing our stock
repurchase program authorization to $7.5 billion, announcing our plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock during 2014.
Combined, this represents an increase in capital returned to shareholders of over 30% from 2013 levels. We remain
committed to returning a significant percentage of our free cash flow to our shareholders every year. Michael will
discuss our results in more detail, but I want to provide a few highlights for both the fourth quarter and the full-year
performance.
So, let me start with Cable, which had a really strong year of revenue and operating cash flow growth. Our focus on
innovation and enhancing the customer experience has driven meaningful improvement in our Triple Play subscriber
trajectory. In fact, our customer metrics across each category of video, data and voice improved in the fourth quarter
and also improved for the full year. In video, we added 43,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, which is really a
remarkable improvement after 26 straight quarters of subscriber losses.
High-speed data continues to lead the way in both revenue and subscriber growth. We added nearly 1.3 million
customers in 2013, which is a 6% increase in the eighth year in a row of more than 1 million customer additions. And
the bundling efforts continue to drive strong uptake of voice, and we added nearly 800,000 voice subscribers in 2013.
And finally, Business Services remains a critical growth driver, adding close to $700 million in very profitable revenue
growth last year.
All in all, it was a fantastic year for Cable, and we ended on a high note with a very strong fourth quarter. The Xfinity
brand is taking hold, and the team is delivering consistent performance quarter after quarter. Neil Smit and all the folks
at Comcast Cable are doing a fabulous job. At NBCUniversal, Steve Burke and his team had a year that was just a
successful. In fact I believe the single most important decision of 2013 was buying in the remaining 49% common
stake from GE. We feel great about the improvements at NBCUniversal, which have significantly exceeded our
expectations. Let me go through some of the highlights.
Our Cable Networks continue to drive NBCUniversal's profitability. USA remains the highest-rated cable
entertainment network for the eighth year in a row, and Bravo continues to rise again, gaining meaningful traction with
its eighth consecutive best year ever. Over at Broadcast, NBC ended this past fall in first place for primetime, and even
without sports, NBC was still tied for first place in the 18 to 49 demo. The turnaround in Broadcast is happening even
faster than we had anticipated. At Theme Parks, we exceeded $1 billion in operating cash flow for the first time. In
2014 and beyond, we believe we will continue to benefit from a range of additional attractions, including Harry Potter
and new hotels. We expect this to continue strong momentum in Parks. And over at Film, we had a record 2013 in
terms of box office, which was the largest in Universal's history. But we were even more focused on profitability,
where operating cash flow was up over $400 million last year alone. In 2014, we turn to ramping production in building
a strong pipeline for 2015. NBCU is a wonderful diversified portfolio of media assets and all four major segments of
the business had strong performance in 2013.
So as we think through the priorities for 2014, we're excited about our businesses and are going to continue to invest to
enhance our differentiation and to drive growth. We're innovating faster than ever before, and our investments are
paying off. We will continue to invest in high-speed data with a focus on delivering the fastest speeds to the home as
well as the fastest speeds within the home, and with only 38% broadband penetration of our homes passed, we believe
there is a significant room for continued growth. We have now increased speeds 12 times in 12 years.

In addition, we currently have wireless gateways installed in over one-third of our high speed data homes and expect
2014 to be another significant year of deployment. Our X1 service is now available on all of our markets, and we will
accelerate our spending around this deployment, intending to reach the majority of our customers in the next few years.
Michael will talk more about this in his remarks, but the initial user feedback and customer metrics are very
encouraging. We will also continue to aggressively extend our reach and capabilities set in the small and mid-size
business segment, were we still see substantial opportunities for profitable growth. So, I think this is truly exciting time
in so many ways for our Cable business.
Turning to NBCUniversal, we enter 2014 with the Olympic Games just a couple of weeks away. Let me spend a few
moments here, because the games are an incredible opportunity to start off the year, and our plan is pretty amazing.
We're going to deliver the most comprehensive Winter Olympics we've ever had. We will have roughly 500 hours of
TV coverage across the NBC broadcast network, NBC Sports, USA, CNBC, MSNBC. As a result, I am pleased to say
that our ad sales are at an all-time record for Winter Games. The games are also a great way to demonstrate the type of
innovation and integration we continue to drive across the entire company. Every event is going to be available live
online for the first time ever in a Winter Games. This will create roughly 1000 hours of live streaming, available at
NBCOlympics.com, at our NBC Sports Live Extra app. Like no other event today, the Olympic Games have been and
continue to be a watershed moment and opportunity for TV Everywhere, helping to drive awareness and usage. So,
authenticated subscribers will be able to consumer content both in and out of the home and on mobile platforms. It
really is a fantastic way to start the year and a great way to showcase the strength and the integration of our wonderful
portfolio of assets.
Let me now turn it over to Michael to cover the results in greater detail.
Michael J. Angelakis
Good morning, and thank you, Brian. 2013 was a strong year of financial and strategic performance for the company.
And we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2013 full-year results, which reflect consistent execution, profitable
growth, and the fundamental strength of our businesses. Based on our confidence in the core strengths of the business
and our positive operational momentum, as Brian just mentioned, we are increasing our total return of capital to
shareholders in 2014 by more than 30%. I will address our 2014 at financial strategy a bit later, but now, let's discuss
our business performance for 2013 in more detail.
Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated financial results on slide 4, for the full year, excluding $1.2 billion
of revenue generated by the London Olympics and $259 million of revenue from the Super Bowl in 2012, consolidated
revenue increased 5.8% to $64.7 billion. On a reported basis, full-year consolidated revenue increased 3.3%. Full-year
2013 again excluding the impact of the Olympics in 2012 and costs associated with the termination of a pension plan
this year, our operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $21.5 billion on a reported basis consolidated operating cash flow
increased 7.3%. Free cash flow for 2013 increased 6.9% to $8.5 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 9.2% to
$3.19 per share. This growth was primarily driven by increases in the consolidated operating cash flow and some
timing benefits in working capital related to the performance of our film slate as well as favorable comparisons to
production spending and the rights for 2012 Olympics. These improvements were partially offset by increased capital
expenditures and cash taxes.
On a reported basis, full-year earnings per share increased 12.3% to $2.56 from $2.28 in 2012. However, excluding
gains on asset sales, favorable tax adjustments, the investment losses and pension termination costs, EPS grew 28% to
$2.47 per share in 2013. Table 4 in our press release provides more detail on EPS. These healthy consolidated results
reflect a strong execution and performance of both our Cable and NBCUniversal businesses.
Now let's review the results of our business units in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on slide 5. In
2013, Cable Communications had another year of strong financial results and improved customer metrics. Cable
Communications revenue increased 5.6% to $41.8 billion for the full year, reflecting solid growth in our residential
businesses and continued strength in Business Services, partially offset by lower political advertising.

In 2012, we generated $240 million of political ad revenue, making our 2013 comparisons challenging. As a result,
cable advertising revenue declined 4.2% for the full year. However, excluding the political ad revenue, core cable
advertising increased 4.8% for the full year. Excluding advertising revenue, the Cable business has generated consistent
results, with the revenue increasing 6.2% for the year, which is consistent with the growth rate in each of the last six
quarters as we've appropriately balanced financial and customer growth.
We continue to experience real strength in our customer metrics and ended the year with improvement across all of our
products. In the fourth quarter, we added 649,000 total video, high-speed Internet, and voice customers, a 29% increase
in net customer additions over last year's fourth quarter. For the year, we added 1.8 million total customers, a 17%
increase in net additions compared to 2012, despite a more competitive environment with an additional 2.3 million
overbuilt homes in our markets this year. These results demonstrate we are competing better and have intensified our
focus on customer retention and the value of our Triple Play strategy. We are growing our customer relationships,
increasing the number of customers receiving higher levels of services, and have an increasing number of customers
taking multiple products. At year end, 79% of our video customers took at least two products, and 44% took all three
services versus 40% in 2012.
As Brian mentioned, we added 43,000 video customers in the fourth quarter. This marks improvement over the 7,000
video subscriber losses in last year's fourth quarter and the first time we've gained video subscribers since 2007. For the
full year, we reduced video losses by nearly 10% compared to 2012, even with an aggressive increase in our overbuilt
service areas. Our X1 platform and industry-leading On Demand service are best in class products, and we're
successfully upgrading non-video customers and improving retention. High-speed Internet also delivered impressive
subscriber performance as we added 379,000 new customers in the fourth quarter, an 11% increase over last year. For
the full year, we added 1.3 million new customers, the eighth year in a row that we added more than one million
high-speed Internet customers, and now have a total of almost 21 million high-speed Internet customers.
Voice also delivered solid growth. We added 227,000 new customers in the quarter, a 35% increase. For the full year,
we added 768,000 new customers for a total of approximately 11 million. This is a 25% increase for the year over
2012's net additions, as we have successfully converted Single and Double Play customers to Triple Play, and acquired
new Triple Play customer relationships. At the end of 2013, our voice penetration was 20% of homes passed.
As we review the individual service categories, reported healthy video revenue growth of 2.3% for the fourth quarter
and 2.9% for the full year, driven by the impact of rate increases and in increasing the number of customers taking
advanced services. We added 658,000 advanced service customers in 2013 and now have 12.4 million high-def and/or
DVR customers, equal to 57% of our video customer base.
High-speed Internet revenue was again the largest contributor to Cable revenue growth as revenue increased 8.7% for
the quarter and 8.3% for the year, reflecting continued growth in our customer base, rate increases, and an increasing
number of customers taking higher-speed services.
At the end of the year, 36% of our residential high-speed customers took at least a 50 megabit speed. Our high-speed
Internet services is clearly capturing market share as we continue to improve and differentiate our product through
service and speed enhancements.
Voice revenue increased 3.7% for the fourth quarter, and 2.8% for the full year, driven by growth in our customer base
as we continue to focus on the value of the Triple Play.
Business Services was the second largest contributor to Cable revenue growth for the quarter and for the year, with
revenue increasing 25.3% in the fourth quarter and 26.4% for the full year as total of 2013 revenue was $3.2 billion.
The small end of the market or businesses with less than 20 employees continues to grow nicely, and we are focused on
executing our market-by-market plan. We're also making progress penetrating mid-sized enterprises and this business
now represents 20% of this group's revenue and is growing at an accelerated rate. Business Services continues to
experience momentum and represents a large and attractive opportunity for the company. With approximately 10% to
15% market share, this is a substantial opportunity for additional growth. When you evaluate our Cable business in
aggregate, our total revenue per video customer reached $164 per month in the fourth quarter, a 6.8% increase over last

year.
Now let's move on the slide 6. In 2013, Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.8% to $17.2 billion,
resulting in stable margins as we effectively managed higher program expenses and absorbed increased expenses to
support new initiatives and the deployments of X1 in wireless gateways across our footprint as well as expansion of
Business Services and Xfinity Home. Program expenses increased 8.6% in 2013, slightly below our original estimates,
but nonetheless reflecting higher rates and step-ups related to certain agreements, and increasing retransmission consent
fees and sports programming costs. As we look to 2014, we expect programming expense growth to accelerate to
approximately 9% to 10% for the year, driven by several factors, including once again meaningful increases in
retransmission consent fees, higher sports programming costs, and step-ups for recently completed long-term
agreements.
In addition, we continue to be very proactive in expanding our On Demand library and expanding our rights to multiple
platforms. We believe we are leading the industry by offering the most robust On Demand and TV Everywhere
services, giving us a meaningful competitive advantage. We once again believe we have appropriately planned for
these programming expense increases and are confident we can effectively offset these costs through modest rate
adjustments, further efficiencies, and improving product mix as well as increasing the number of customers upgrading
to higher tiers of services. As result, we expect to maintain relatively stable margins. We continue to achieve
efficiencies in our operations and improve our customer experience with improved customer service tools and
self-service options.
At year end, more than one-third of our customers are managing their accounts online with 9 million unique visitors, a
42% increase over the prior year. In addition, more customers are electing self-installations, which accounted for 42%
of our total installations in 2013 compared to 30% last year. As a result of these efforts, we reduced our truck rolls by
3.5 million in 2013, and over the last two years, we've reduced our truck rolls by approximately 8 million. We're also
more efficient and specialize in our call centers with incentives of excellence dedicated to sales, billing, service, and
retention.
Just as a reminder, when we report first quarter earnings in April, we'll be changing our disclosure of customer metrics
from an FCC-equivalent, or EBU basis, to a billable units methodology. At the end of the first quarter, we also restate
our customer metrics for 2013, making it easier to compare 2014 metrics as we report them. We believe this change
will reinforce our operational focus on customer relationships and align our customer count methodology with the rest
of the industry.
To wrap up the Cable segment, our Xfinity brand continues to build positive awareness and our performance in 2013
clearly demonstrates that we are executing well and competing effectively with our improved products and services.
We are pleased that the Cable group has delivered strong, consistent results, and in 2014, we remain focused on
sustainable, profitable growth and plan to build on this positive momentum.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results, which are presented on slide 7. Excluding any impact from the Super
Bowl and Olympics in 2012, NBCUniversal's full-year 2013 revenue increased 5.7%, and operating cash flow
increased 18.7%, reflecting strong results across all business segments. For 2013, on a reported basis, NBCUniversal's
revenue decreased 0.7%, and operating cash flow increased 15.2%. Now let's take a closer look at the individual
segments at NBCUniversal. Our Cable Networks generated full-year 2013 revenue of $9.2 billion, an increase of 5.4%,
driven by a 6.5% increase in distribution revenue and a 4.3% increase in advertising as ratings pressure at some of our
Cable Networks was offset by higher pricing.
Cable Networks operating cash flow increased 6% to $3.5 billion in 2013, reflecting improved revenue performance,
partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs as we continue to invest in original programming
and experience higher sports costs, reflecting more NHL games this year versus last year and the launch of the English
Premier League on the NBC Sports Network. In addition, we had higher advertising, marketing and promotion expense
to support the launch of these new shows and events.

With regards to our Broadcast segment, we ended the year on a strong note with fourth quarter revenue increasing
11.5% to $2.2 billion and operating cash flow growing 54.8% to $140 million, driven by higher primetime ratings from
the success of the Voice, the Blacklist, and Sunday Night Football.
Full-year 2013 results were a bit muted due to difficult comparisons to 2012 that included the Super Bowl, Olympics
and higher political advertising. However, excluding the Super Bowl and the Olympics, Broadcast revenue increased
5.4% and operating cash flow increased 45% to $345 million in 2013, reflecting a meaningful progress we've made in
this business in terms of improved ratings, higher advertising revenue, and increased retransmission consent fees.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment, 2013 was a record year for NBCUniversal as it enjoyed the best box office
performance of its history, driven by outstanding success of Despicable Me 2, as well as strong performances of Fast
and Furious 6 and Les Miserables. As result, revenue increased 5.7% to $5.5 billion, and operating cash flow increased
over $400 million to $483 million in 2013.
Switching to our Theme Parks segment, we had another terrific year. Full-year revenue increased 7.2% to $2.2 billion,
and operating cash flow increased 5.3%, reaching $1 billion for the first time, a very exciting milestone for this
business. These strong results were driven by strong attendance and per capita spending at both parks, reflecting the
continued success of Harry Potter in Orlando and the Transformers attraction at both parks. To summarize
NBCUniversal, we are just very pleased with the progress made at NBCUniversal, and since the original
announcement, our operating cash flows has increased approximately 50% on a pro forma basis.
Now let's move to slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. We believe that operational
excellence and strategic differentiation drive shareholder value, so we have an operating strategy that is execution
focused and a financial strategy that is focused on risk-adjusted returns. Our strategy support these goals by investing in
our business with our attractive opportunities, maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing consistent and
sustainable return of capital to shareholders. Our number one priority remains generating strong and sustainable returns
by investing in our businesses. In both Cable and NBCUniversal, we're investing to strengthen our competitive
positions and to support attractive organic growth opportunities.
As we planned, 2013 consolidated capital expenditures were $6.6 billion compared to $5.7 billion in 2012, reflecting
increased investments at both Cable and NBCUniversal. Our Cable Communications, 2013 capital expenditures
increased 9.8% to $5.4 billion, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue. This capital plan primarily reflects higher spending on
CPE, including our new X1 boxes and wireless gateways, our continued investments in network infrastructure to ensure
our leadership in video and high-speed Internet as well as the expansion of new services, such as Business Services and
Xfinity Home.
In 2013, we began the deployment of our X1 service, and we are very pleased with the early customer feedback.
Clearly, this is an improved experience for our customers, making it easier to navigate through the tens of thousands of
content choices we offer. Early results show that X1 customers use our Video On Demand service more, and our VOD
revenue for these customers is higher. In addition, more X1 customers are subscribing to DVR and upgrading to Triple
Play, and we're also seeing reduce churn levels among these X1 customers.
Based on the early positive customer results, and strong double-digit returns of X1, we plan to accelerate the pace of
deployment to reach the majority of our video customers over the next few years. In addition to this X1 acceleration,
we plan to deploy additional wireless gateways to enable our customers to receive the fastest in-home Wi-Fi, increase
network capacity, and continue to invest to fuel the expansion of both Business Services and Xfinity Home. As a result,
our 2014 capital investment plan will increase approximately 100 basis points to approximately 14% of Cable revenue
for approximately 13% in 2013.
At NBCUniversal, in 2013, we had a similar approach. Capital expenditures increased $397 million to $1.2 billion,
primarily driven by increased investments in Theme Parks as we build new attractions, including Transformers and
expansion of Harry Potter in Orlando, and Despicable Me and Harry Potter in Hollywood. In 2014, NBCUniversal's
capital investment plan remained stable at 2013's level as we continue to invest in theme park attractions, including
Harry Potter at both parks. Our Theme Parks OCF has increased from $400 million in 2009 to over $1 billion in 2013

as a result of new investment.
Over the same time, combined attendance of both parks has increased over 40%. We remain excited and optimistic
about the next phase of Harry Potter opening in Orlando this summer and expect this to generate strong returns by
increasing profitability and attendance and continuing the transformation of our parks into must-visit destinations. The
vast majority of both Cable and NBCUniversal's investment plans are growth oriented capital and should yield
attractive IRRs coupled with strong strategic advantages.
Let's move on to slide 9. We continue to have a strong commitment to deliver a consistent and sustainable return of
capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks. In 2013, we returned $4 billion to
shareholders, and with today's announcement, our total return of capital is increasing 32% to $5.2 billion in 2014. This
incorporates a 15% increase in our dividend to $0.90 per share on an annual basis and a plan to repurchase $3 billion of
our stock in 2014, a 50% increase compared to our 2012 buyback. This total return represents a payout of 62% of our
last 12 months' free cash flow and 77% of our last 12 months' net income. In addition, our Board of Directors has
increased our stock repurchase program authorization to $7.5 billion.
We have consistently increased our annual dividend since we instituted it in 2008 at $0.25 per share. Today's newly
announced level of $0.90 per share represents 33% of our last 12 months' net income and raises our current dividend
yield to approximately 1.7%, which is relatively in line with the S&P 500. Since 2008, and through our return of capital
commitments in 2014, we will have returned $24 billion to shareholders, including $9 billion in dividends and
repurchasing $15 billion in shares. By all measures, we believe 2013 was a very successful year. As we begin 2014, we
are positive and feel very good about our financial strength, our operating momentum, and the attractive opportunities
ahead at both Cable Communications and NBCUniversal. We look forward to executing on those opportunities ahead
and continue to achieve profitable growth and build value for our shareholders.
Now let me turn the call back to Jason for Q&A.

Thanks, Michael. Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks. One for NBC and one for Cable, if that's okay. So the NBCU numbers came in
above what I think most of us expect from other media companies, and it looks like you're really hitting your stride at
this point, but there still seems to be a lot of untapped potential at basically every division. So I was just hoping that
Steve could address what you see as the biggest areas of upside as we go forward?
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: Well, Jessica, as Mike said in his introduction, when we looked at the company, before we
ended up doing the deal with GE, cash flow had – since that point, cash flow has increased 50%. And we feel like we
still have a long way to go. And the opportunity exists, I think pretty much across the board. We're investing a lot more
in the Theme Parks, they've gone from $400 million of cash flow to over $1 billion. We think that cash flow in the
Theme Parks can increase significantly with investments like Harry Potter 2, hotels and other investments in the future.
I think Broadcast Television has a long way to go. We now have ratings. First, you got to hit the ratings, then you can
sell the ratings. There's sort of a lag variable. So I think broadcast has real upside. We seem to be hitting our stride and
being a little bit more strategic with our portfolio in Film, and of course, we've got a great group of cable networks. We
do feel there's a monetization gap between how we're doing in terms of ratings and box office and everything else, and

the amount of operating cash flow we're generating, but pretty much everywhere you look, we still think there's a lot of
opportunity, and as you said, we believe we're off to a good start, but there's plenty more to go.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Okay. And then on the Cable side, how much of a factor was X1 in terms of positive video
subs? Is this, I guess, what I really want, is this looking to reverse course on a full-year basis?
<A - Neil Smit>: I think X1 was not a really material part of the fourth quarter positive sub numbers. It's a great
product, we're rolling it out across the country, as of today, we have it across the 100% of the footprint. We are seeing
great results. Customers like the guide more than other guides, video – VOD metrics are up 25% of views and 20%
transactions. Churn is down, I mean, so we're really pleased with the results. I think it's going to take a while before we
go positive for the year, but we're clearly going to be aggressively rolling out X1 based on the strong double-digit
returns we're seeing with it.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question will come from line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. A couple of Cable questions. Mike or Neil, you guys talked
about the advanced product penetration, I think it's well above 50% now. And a lot of the investments you've been
making have taken, it seems like it's taken the customer base to maybe a more premium customer base. I'm wondering
if that's been a strategy of yours, if you could talk about the sort of B1 or low-end of the market that you've got left at
this point? And does this equate to greater pricing power, lower churn over time as you sort of deepen the advanced
products, and as you mentioned before, we haven't even seen sort of the benefits of X1 yet? And then I just had a quick
follow-up on commercial.
<A - Neil Smit>: Well, we are focused our high-value customers, and we do feel that our role is to continue to add
value to our products and suite of services. The X1 platform is a big-step forward, because you can launch other
products off there. For example, we launched EST, electronic sell-through, where you can buy a movie off the
platform, and that was the top-selling Fast and Furious and Despicable Me 2 retail channel for the Thanksgiving
holiday. So it's a very powerful platform. I think going forward, we are very focused on the high-value subs. We set up
a differentiated treatment for those subs in the call centers, and what we did during the quarter is the connect volume
overall was up, but the disconnect volume or its index down, so that's what resulted in the positive subs.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: One thing I'll just chime in on, Ben, is, obviously we're really focused on bundling, and
you can see the percentage of our Triple Play bundle is continuing to increase, we're up about 400 basis points
year-over-year, so that is really adding value to our customer base, and as you move up that bundle from single to
double, triple, obviously you have lower churn, which is certainly helpful. So the whole customer lifetime value
increases on the Triple Play which is something we are very focused on in terms of how you think through advanced
services and returns and those kinds of things.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Right. And then just quickly on the CapEx increase, which looks like about $600 million
or $700 million or so on Cable, you mentioned commercial, Mike, or Neil, either one of you, how much of this is now
sort of penetrating the medium-size? I think you guys have talked a lot about sort of small business being the
predominant source of revenue, but I would imagine it's a little more capital-intensive is as you get into the larger
enterprise area.
<A - Neil Smit>: Well, right now the enterprise, the mid-sized business is about 20% of the overall. That's up from
15% a quarter or two ago. So it is growing at a faster rate than the small-size business. It doesn't require more initial
capital per unit or per building, if you will, but you get stronger returns over time. We're pleased with the product suite.
It's accretive business to us, and the team, Bill Stamper and team have done a great job, just pulling together the

organization on focusing on those opportunities but SME is still the largest percentage of our overall revenue mix there.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: So when we look at capital for 2014, the increase, there is some increase in business
services, which as Neil said is really terrific returns, and we go through them very frequently. And the SME side is
great, and the majority of it is really around the accelerated deployment of X1 which also, as I mentioned, has great
double-digit returns and also has other strategic advantages, which are really important. So commercial services is part
of that increase, and X1 is a larger part.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Got it. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question will come from line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. Michael gave the strong double-digit returns for X1. Neil, are you willing
to walk through the economics of X1 in anymore detail, given the rampant investment this year? And I've got a couple
of follow-ups on that.
<A - Neil Smit>: Sure. Let me run through a few of the stats. One is we've rolled it out across the entire footprint.
We've opened the gates. It used to be just available for Triple Play customers, it's available for some Double-Play
customers as well. So we're rolling it out more aggressively. We've already, as of the end of the month, everyone will
be getting the new, what we code name X2 guide, so it shows you how quickly you can change a software platform –
platform from X1 to X2. It's a better user experience, and I think if you lay that great improved user experience on top
of all the content rights that we have that Michael refer to and our TV Everywhere rights and in and out of home right,
it's a very powerful combination. About 65% of the X1 subs rate the X1 guide is superior to their other guide
experiences. VOD viewing is up 25%. VOD transactions are up 20%. More X1 customers want DVR, so and X1,
there's a larger percentage of X1 customers who are Triple Play customers, so as you think about it, you're getting a
higher ARPU for X1 sub.
The roll out is going well, the platform is stable, and as a – another sign of momentum building around the X1
platform, Cox recently agreed to partner with us to better understand what elements of the X1 platform might be useful
to support their next-gen video services across the various platforms. So we'll be working together to explore the
opportunities – opportunity to identify where X1 might be useful in their business.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Right.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: To add Doug, one more data point is churn is actually down, voluntary churn in our X1
base too. So you plug in all the variables that Neil just mentioned and literally our CLV increases and our IRRs are well
into double digits.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Let me just weigh in also that the – there's some good trends happening as we look at a
multi-year strategy, the cost per home with whole-home DVR, cloud DVR, and second devices, as we've shown, little
smaller boxes that can attach to this platform that then allow in-home experiences as well as second, third devices for
much lower cost than the original X1 box, plus the cost of the box itself, all those things are coming down in price. And
so there is – we think that the ability to get this to many, many people is going to keep getting more and more
economically better, the returns are only going to improve as we go, and so at some point, you cross that line that we
are so excited about the initial feedback that we just began the roll out. And we're pretty excited.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: So I think out of the 20 follow-up potential questions, I'll limit myself to one. Just curious,
Michael, how much has Cable OpEx been impacted in 2014 for the roll out? And is that a potential future tailwind as
the investment spending winds down?

<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: To be honest, in 2013 and 2014, we did absorb OpEx related to X1 in the roll out but,
obviously, we've managed through that. No different than us absorbing OpEx related to Xfinity Home or business
services expansion in SME, so to us, it's part of the business, and we're able to power through that. We've kept margins
stable in 2013 and our expectation is we'll power through that in 2014 and keep margins stable in 2014 as well, so yes,
there is some of that.
<A - Neil Smit>: I'll also add Michael that we've rolled out the DOCSIS 3.0 platform, we've gone all digital, we've
rolled out business services and we've kept margins during that period relatively stable.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's move to the next question.
Operator
Your next question will come from line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. First a bit of a follow up on Doug's question. As you think about the typical
price increases you've quantified after the first quarter each year, can you help us think about what you're planning on
in the first quarter, or what you've already rolled as we think about year-over-year video subs? And then second, Brian,
at the conference a few weeks ago, you outlined 2014 as an investment year in Film. Can you help us think about what
the working capital drag for that business might be as we think about free cash flow? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: So I'll take the rate increases question. We've – our rate increases are going to be similar to previous
years in the 3% range. We're rolling them out across a wider footprint than we did last year in the first quarter, so
there'll be more people affected by rate increases. However, we feel good about the overall environment, and we're
carrying some good momentum from Q4, so we've got our heads down and trying to improve. At the end of the day,
we're trying to improve our results year-over-year, every quarter, and we've done it 11 out of the last 13 quarters.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Well, I think that's the, just to finish that question, I think that's the way to be judging us,
myself, which is over reasonable periods of time, are we making headway year-over-year, not positive, negative than
any one quarter. But it's a great achievement, and thank you, Neil, for the fourth quarter. As I think about 2015, I think
Michael's better to talk about free cash flow. I just think that Jeff Shell is now at Universal, very excited about the new
opportunity and 2015, the slate appears to be fantastically exciting. There's an investment that you can make in the year
before, so it's a little bit of it up-and-down business in terms of the free cash flow way to judge it. We had a nice 2013,
but, Michael, why don't you go through this detail?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Yes. Let me just, you know, 2013, obviously Film had a terrific year in terms of
performance, in terms of operating cash flow. But there was a little bit lighter on the production spend in 2013 for the
2014 slate. As we – and that's obviously a working capital benefit that we've had in 2013 related to free cash flow. As
we enter 2014, we have a great slate for 2015 that we're going to more normalize our spend in 2014, and that's going to
absorb some cash in 2014, which helps build that 2015 slate. So I think that's what Brian meant at the conference, and I
tried to articulate on my prepared remarks.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Excellent.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: So just to put some specificity around 2015, Steve, why don't you just run through a couple
of movies?
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: Well, in 2015, we have Jurassic Park 4, Fast and Furious 7, Minions which is a kind of a
sequel of Despicable Me, the Despicable Me franchise. We have Fifty Shades of Grey. We have a very, very strong
year, potentially Ted 2, so that investment is – we're incurring that investment right now as we gear up to what should
be a very strong year for Universal on 2015.

<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: And, Phil, just to clarify, I really look at this as a little bit of a normalization because
2013 was a little bit lower than one would've expected and I think 2014 is going to be a little bit of a catch up year in
preparation for 2015.

Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with Moffett Research.
<Q - Craig Moffett>: Hi. Thank you. First, congratulations, Jason. I got to say I'm happy not to have to compete with
you anymore. So a question about the enterprise segment. I know you can't talk specifically about what was reported
last night, but I think – I wonder as you think about what you might do down the road in the Large Enterprise segment.
Whether, Neil, maybe you could talk about what is it you need to put in place first? And how do we think about the
timeline over the next few years for you to make a real run at the large enterprise multinational corporation segment?
<A - Neil Smit>: Well, as you know, Craig, we've been focused on small- and mid-size, and we're still only 10% to
15% penetrated there and see a lot of opportunity for growth there. On the enterprise side, we have been, we are aware
of the space, aware of the competition there, I think there will be network implications, there'll be organizational
implications. But right now, we're focused on small and mid for the time being.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: The only thing I would just add is that one of the great things about this business for so many
years as we find new products to sell using our existing base, who would have thought of Wi-Fi being as great and
add-on to your in-home broadband, and if we can get to larger businesses who will think of us very differently than
they would have five years ago, in whatever cooperative manner that we can do that, it should be a business
opportunity down the road. Right now, we've gone from small to medium. It's not an illogical thing to say some day.
But it's not on the focus right this moment.
<Q - Craig Moffett>: And, thank you. And if I could ask a follow-up, you mentioned Wi-Fi. Has your view of Wi-Fi
as a real business separate and apart from this value added to your existing broadband subscribers changed at all in the
last six months or a year?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Well, I think we're paying careful attention to the technological innovation and the potential
opportunities that it creates. We're hopeful that in the government thoughtfulness as to what to do with spectrum
allocation for the country, that Wi-Fi is very much top of mind, because as I just said, who would have placed the tablet
having this kind of explosive growth. Without Wi-Fi, I don't think it would have happened. And so it's hard to
completely predict it, but we are well-positioned, and we've added Wi-Fi, we don't want it to be lost into every modem
that we now put into people's homes, and last year, that was...
<A - Neil Smit>: Seven million.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Seven million times that we've installed this capability into people's house, and we intend to
do that again this year. So that may be in some ways the most important thing we've done. So is it an opportunity
someday to add Wi-Fi to our network outside of the home? Well, we're doing that in some cities, we are testing
different technologies. There are other companies who are also doing that with their own businesses purposes, and we
just, for example, this week announced with the San Francisco 49ers that we're going to do their entire stadium and
have new capabilities that they very well expand into your neighborhood and into your commute patterns and into
restaurants as we've already seen in a lot of cities. It's a very interesting area, and I think it's synergistic for us. And
we're keeping tabs of it.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: I think that we should just add, we have almost one million hot spots right now that
people are utilizing, both in-home and out of home.

Operator
Your next question will come from line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. I have two questions. The first, Michael, you talked about accelerating
programming cost. And I was just wondering how much does your thoughts about sub trends factor in? Meaning that
the better the subscriber trends are, presumably the higher the P&L programming cost will be? That's the first question.
And secondly, just generally thinking about your M&A strategy. One of the questions, I think all of us are getting is
how to think about, would a domestic distribution deal have any impact on your ability to expand internationally,
whether that would be distribution or content? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Okay. On programming cost, listen – number one, that's I think a high-class problem in
terms of subscriber growth, which I think you might mention. We are, I think, pretty diligent in negotiating our
programming contracts, and I think we're somewhat fortunate in 2013 where what we had originally projected as our
increasing programming cost, we came in lower, I don't know, 140 basis points, 150 basis points. Part of this is timing
in terms of when contracts are up. Part of it is retransmission consent. Those I can say somewhat are controllable, but
some not. And then part of it is really in terms of sports and some other areas. So it's a hard question, because our goal
really is to continue to improve on our subscriber trends, and that obviously will have a positive impact in our sort of
per subscriber programming costs, and I think Neil addressed that earlier. On M&A, the view really is on international,
we are a bit underweight. We've mentioned that.
It's really our goal to be very educated on a country-by-country basis and see if there are opportunities for us, whether
it's distribution or content that really makes sense from a shareholder value perspective. So on an M&A overall, we're
going to remain very disciplined. We're going to be, as I mentioned before, we're going to have our strategic filters in
place. We'll have our financial filters in place, and we're really going to evaluate that. So it's all about can we – is it
value enhancing from a shareholder perspective, and we want to be very focused, we want to be very educated, we
want to make sure we look at everything. I think our shareholder base expects us to do that, but if we're to do anything,
it's going to be value creative and that's really the focus right now.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thank you.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question will come from line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: I just had a question for Mr. Roberts. Either organically or via M&A, would you say
it's a strategic priority of the firm to be hedged, if you will, on content cost? Meaning today I think you spend about $2
on content on the Cable side for every dollar you get for content on the NBCU side within cable nets. Is that a priority
or is that sort of the wrong way to think about how you're thinking about the business?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Well, I don't actually think of it that way. I think it happens to be a fact, and I think in
compared to many other companies, that's a good fact if you're a shareholder because no one has a perfect crystal ball,
but the bottom line is we love both businesses. And that's what we said for many, many years. All the way for me
personally back to when I was on Ted Turner's board. They were starting all these cable channels. They looked like
great businesses. That didn't make cable a bad business, it just was here was a new business. And then finally is the
synergy between the two companies, and I think what you'll see during the Olympics, as a for instance, is by
understanding both businesses, we're smarter and maybe just a little better than we would be if we were two separate

companies.
And with the kind of hopefully culture and chemistry in the company and across the company, that's proved itself out,
whether it's electronic sell-through that Neil mentioned or what we're going to do with the Olympics in Sochi both on
the Xfinity side and on the NBCUniversal side. And I think we're creating something very, very special and as an
investor, yes, you get the fact that if programming costs are going up or there is a new type of utilization that causes
that cost to go up, we're on both sides. We're helping to innovate and make that possible, and I like that balance that the
company has.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thank you very much.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Great. Thanks. Three quick ones. First, as it relates to Cable CapEx, I know, Michael,
you don't want to give sort of longer-term guidance, but is that 14% in 2014, should we think of that as sort of a peak
level or could you see it drifting higher than that in 2015? And then given the increased investment you're putting into
the home with the X1 box and the modems, it sounds like you expect that to eventually be a driver of better video
trends going forward with the lower churn. How about pull through effects on the broadband side? Right? You'll be
able to sell more Triple Play, again, better capabilities. Do expect that to improve trends around broadbrand? And then
lastly on the leverage, I guess this is a follow-up to the M&A question, you said 1.5 times to 2 times is your target, but
what – and you guys said that you would be willing to go above that if in fact there is a better, you know, there's some
M&A opportunities that made sense, would you be willing to go above two times? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Okay. On the CapEx side, we said 2014 will come in approximately 14%. You're right,
John, we don't give guidance going forward and the vast majority of our capital is actually growth-oriented capital. So,
I think we really want to take a look as we go through the year on the success of that deployment and that's really part
of the plan. If it's successfully deployed, that's terrific and we'll reevaluate as we enter towards the end of 2014 of what
2015 will look like. So we're hopeful that the deployment will be successful. I don't know what peak in, and I really
don't want to get into that but I just want to make sure that you'll understand that the vast majority of our CapEx is
growth oriented, and we have checkpoints along the way to make sure that the deployment is successful in generating
the financial returns and strategic returns we're intending to. Do you want to take the one on the in-house...?
<A - Neil Smit>: Concerning X1 and its impact on other customers or RGUs, we have seen X1 customers are more
likely to upgrade to the Triple Play. We have seen that they are generally – they request DVRs more, they over-index in
that category. So I think it will have a positive impact on churn because we know Triple Play sub churn at a lower
level, and we think it will have a positive impact on ARPU as well as they buy, upgrade to DVR and buy more VOD.
Generally speaking, the product has been very well received by the field and by the customers and I think it will have a
positive overall effect on the business.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: And, John, I'll go back to the leverage one. So when we closed NBCUniversal, that was
sort of nine, 10 months ago, our leverage popped up to about 2.4 times, and now we ended 2013 at roughly 2.3 times,
so some modest decrease. It's really our goal, more medium-term goal, to bring that leverage down to, as I mentioned,
under 2 times, between 1.5 times and 2 times, but we recognize that's going to take years. And I think that's really all
we can say, that, I think we can do several things at once we can invest for growth, like we're doing it NBC and at
Comcast Cable. We can increase our returns of capital, which obviously, we announced today. I think we will modestly

Our final question will come from line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: Thank you. A couple of questions from me. First is on video subscriber growth during
the quarter. I mean, it's still a video [indiscernible] largely given the state of the housing market even now? In that
sense, given the overbuilt in your footprint, just between your competitors, is it fair to assume that a lot of this is
coming from the satellite operators? And secondly, from a regulatory perspective, there's been obviously a lot of
movement over the quarter in terms of net neutrality as well as Supreme Court taking up the area of ruling and so on.
So it would be great to get your thoughts on that as well, as to whether things like pay for priority services could
become real over time.
<A - Neil Smit>: So I'll take them into chunks. One is the overbuilt and the effect on the business, and then, Brian, I'll
turn it over to you for the regulatory issue. We had about $2.3 million overbuilds, incremental over-builds in the fourth
quarter. The majority of those coming from AT&T. I think we performed well given that. The housing starts, so that
didn't really have a material effect, and I think if we look to get a tailwind from those overtime, that would be positive
for the business. But we feel we're competing well in both the fiber side as well as the satellite side, and I think part of
that is the X1 product is performing well. I think part of it is great execution by Dave Watson and divisional teams, and
I think part of it is we are targeting our marketing a little bit better, our services are getting better, as Michael
mentioned, we have 3.5 million fewer truck rolls, where we have 45% of the installs, are self-installs, 36% of the
people manage their accounts online, so I think we're just executing better on the service front. Brian?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Well, there was obviously the court ruling on the Verizon case, and we do not believe that the
government is going to materially alter the approaches taken for many years that would in some ways hinder our
business objective going forward. We were a supporter of the Internet order when it was originally drafted by the
commission, because it was a nice balance between consumer interest and not interfering with network management
and engineering decisions. And we are confident and hopeful that they're going to continue to strike that balance. And
so we're supportive of working with the Chairman and the Commission on trying to find that balance. As I just sum up
for the year in this quarter, in my opinion, we're also trying to find a balance between really strong operations, I think
both at NBCUniversal and at Cable, we had a really strong year. And in finding opportunity like buying back the 49%
stake for $18 billion in cash while still achieving the leverage targets that Michael just talked about and being able to
increase the dividend and the buyback program. And I think we've done that. We have a great plan for 2014 and thank
you all for your support.

Great. We'll leave it there. Thank you, everyone, for joining us.
