MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, my name is Laura, I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Sprint First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I would like to turn over to Mr. Brad Hampton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Hampton, please
go ahead.
Brad Hampton
Thank you, Laura, good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sprint's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.
On today's call, Dan Hesse will discuss operational performance in the quarter. Steve Elfman will provide update on
Network Vision and Joe Euteneuer will cover financial results. After that, we will open the call up to your questions.
Before we get under way, let me remind you that our release, quarterly investor update and presentation slides that
accompany this call are available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide two is our cautionary statement; I want to point out in our remarks this morning, we will be discussing
forward-looking statement which involves number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from forward-looking statement. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings which I
encourage you to review, including annual report on Form 10-K, and when filed, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q,
for the first quarter of 2013.
Turning to slide three, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics, reconciliations of non-GAAP
performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for first quarter can be found in the attachments

to earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website at
www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on slide four. Basic and diluted net loss per common share for the first quarter were
$0.21 compared to $0.44 in fourth quarter and $0.29 in the year-ago period. The loss per share in the current period
included accelerated depreciation of approximately $360 million or negative $0.12 per share on pre-tax basis, primarily
due to accelerated depreciation expense related to shutdown of the Nextel platform. We continue to expect similar
levels of accelerated depreciation in the second quarter of 2013, as we expect to complete shutdown of the Nextel
platform on June 30.
In the second half, we will still have accelerated depreciation related to legacy CDMA equipment deployed with $100
million of accelerated depreciation in the third quarter and $200 million in fourth quarter. We expect total depreciation
expense for the year to be approximately $5.3 billion, excluding the effects of strategic transactions. Similar to last
year's thinning project when we shut down approximately 9,600 Nextel sites, we're now evaluating expenses related to
the Nextel platform shutdown and expect to recognize costs associated with lease exit charges, backhaul access
contracts, as well as any other costs associated with the platform of between $500 million and $600 million in the
second quarter related to payments beyond June 30, 2013, for which the company will not receive any economic
benefit.
Net tax expense was $38 million in the first quarter. We continue to expect net tax expense for 2013, excluding impact
of pending strategic transactions, to be between $170 million and $220 million.
I will now turn the call over to CEO Dan Hesse.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thanks, Brad.
Good morning. Thank you for joining us, and thank you for your interest.
While the pending and potential strategic transactions make this an exciting time at Sprint, we haven't taken our eye off
of operations. Before I review our results today for our ongoing areas of focus – which are cash, the customer
experience and the Sprint brand – I'll touch on some of the quarter's key highlights.
Turning to slide six, please, our adjusted OIBDA performance of $1.52 billion marks the seventh consecutive quarter
we've exceeded Street expectations, and represents over 25% growth versus the first quarter of 2012, and over 75%
growth sequentially.
Wireless adjusted OIBDA margin also grew in the quarter, up almost 5% from last year and nearly 10% sequentially.
Driven by continued strength in postpaid ARPU, total Q1 operating revenues of $9 billion are up year-over-year for the
11th consecutive quarter.
Q1 represents our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in Sprint platform service revenues and our 13th
consecutive quarter of sequential growth.
We sold nearly 5 million smartphones in the quarter, including over 1.5 million iPhones, with 43% of the iPhones
going to new Sprint customers. Smartphones represented 75% of our retail Sprint platform handset sales and 86% of
our postpaid Sprint platform handset sales in the quarter. We again achieved a balanced sales mix between the two
major OS platforms, and we announced strong additions to our device portfolio that I'll mention later.
We made continued progress with our efforts to shut down the Nextel platform, shrinking the Nextel customer base by
771,000 subscribers in the quarter. Our profitability-focused efforts to recapture Nextel subscribers continues to deliver
better-than-expected results, as we were able to recapture 46% of the postpaid Nextel deactivations in the quarter on the
Sprint platform. We remain on track to shut down the Nextel platform at the end of the second quarter.

Finally, we made solid progress on our Network Vision deployment. We exceeded our 12,000 sites-on-air target for the
end of the first quarter, and to date, we have over 13,500 Network Vision sites on air.
Please turn to slide seven.
As I have explained previously, 2012 and 2013 represent the second phase or the investment phase of our multi-year
turnaround effort. This phase of our turnaround is characterized by heightened capital investment as we upgrade our 3G
platform and deploy 4G LTE, and by operating-expense pressure associated with network deployment, and the
shutdown of the Nextel platform.
I've consistently stated that our primary operating focus during the investment phase is OIBDA performance to ensure
we're maximizing operational cash generation to support these substantial investments. In that regard, it's fortuitous
that, in the first quarter, we delivered our best quarterly adjusted OIBDA performance in almost four years.
Please turn to slide eight.
Regarding cash, Q1 adjusted OIBDA of $1.52 billion is up over $300 million compared to the year-ago period, our
largest year-over-year percentage increase in 6.5 years. The largest driver of this improvement is postpaid ARPU.
This result also exceeded our plan for the first quarter, with the greatest operational execution favorability being driven
by managing upgrades, with upgrades being only 6.9% of our postpaid subscriber base, our lowest percentage on
record. Even so, we now have the highest percentage of our postpaid customers on contract in five and a half years.
We also mitigated higher dilution from the Network Vision program and higher device subsidy rates with cost
improvements across the business, including notable year-over-year reductions in customer-care expense, as calls to
care again achieved best-ever performance levels, and from lower device service and repair costs, and bad debt
expense.
We had solid revenue performance across all three of our Sprint platform wireless businesses, which resulted in
year-over-year service revenue growth of almost 9%. The Q1 Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate of $63.67 is our
highest level ever, up 2% compared to last year and represents our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.
Postpaid wireless service revenue on the Sprint platform increased almost 7% year-over-year. Prepaid wireless service
revenue increased over 17%. And wholesale and other revenue increased 29%.
In our prepaid brands, both Boost and Virgin reached their best ever ARPU levels in the first quarter. Our capital
investment in the quarter was relatively flat sequentially, consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter.
We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $7.8 billion, up from $7.6 billion a
year ago, which includes the benefit of $3.1 billion of cash received from SoftBank in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Turning to slide nine and the customer experience. We continue to set records in customer care. As I mentioned we set
an all-time record for lowest calls to care per customer and expenses associated with customer care credits, which
remain at all-time low levels. Both metrics have improved year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters.
We continue to garner third-party recognition for industry-leading customer experience. J.D. Power and Associates
recognized the Sprint brand in the first quarter as highest in satisfaction with the purchase experience among full
service wireless providers for the fourth time in a row. And our Boost brand was recognized for highest satisfaction
with the purchase experience among noncontract wireless providers. Finally, ATLANTIC-ACM recognized our
excellence in the wholesale arena, granting Sprint the U.S. Long Haul Wholesale Carrier Excellence Awards for
customer service, network performance, brand and voice quality. We believe the improvements in our customer
experience, along with the significant upgrade to network that is underway, will provide a foundation for future churn
improvement. As I indicated on recent calls, we are experiencing pressure on the Sprint platform in the form of
postpaid churn as we progress through Network Vision, pardon our dust impacts from the conversion of our network
infrastructure, the loss of Sprint platform customers when we lose an entire business account due to our Nextel
platform shutdown and pressure in the enterprise account market segment associated with our smaller LTE footprint

relative to our larger competitors. We believe that as we progress with Network Vision, these issues will be rectified
and our churn performance will improve.
In markets where Network Vision deployment is more fully complete, we are seeing much improved network
performance and we are beginning to observe improvements in churn. Although still higher than we'd like to see it, our
Q1 Sprint platform postpaid churn rate of 1.84% is down both year-over-year and sequentially, 16 basis points better
than last year and 14 basis points better than last quarter.
Prepaid churn has improved year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters; prepaid churn set another all-time best record
of 3.26%.
Turning to slide 10 and the Sprint brand; total customers served on the Sprint platform again reached a new record of
just under 54 million. In an important third-party brand study, the Sprint Net Promoter Score showed both sequential
and year-over-year improvement. We estimate that we were able to maintain our share of industry postpaid gross adds
on the Sprint platform in the first quarter. We will remain focused on recapturing as many of the 1.3 million Nextel
subscribers that we know will deact in this quarter.
Our prepaid brands are also performing well in a very competitive industry environment. In the first quarter, we
recorded the best ever number of Boost gross adds on the Sprint platform and the highest Virgin Mobile net adds since
the acquisition of that brand in 2009. Please turn to slide 11. In the first quarter, we launched 10 new devices across our
postpaid and prepaid brands and we announced the upcoming availability of new iconic devices, including the HTC
One, Samsung Galaxy S4, the BlackBerry Q10 and multiple Windows 8 devices. We continue to innovate in service
and product offerings such as the launch of Sprint As You Go, a Sprint-branded noncontract service offering available
in our company-owned retail stores, plus an industry first custom branded device program for wholesale customers.
So, in conclusion, the people of Sprint delivered a strong earnings quarter with adjusted OIBDA up over 25%
year-over-year in spite of higher Network Vision dilution. This performance was driven by record Sprint postpaid
ARPU, record low upgrades, record Virgin and Boost ARPU, record low prepaid churn, record low calls to care and
maintaining record low care credit levels – the last three all coming as a result of 17 consecutive quarters of
year-over-year improvement in each of these three metrics.
The network team and our three network partners delivered a solid Network Vision deployment quarter. We remain on
schedule to close all three of our pending transactions with U.S. Cellular, with Clearwire and with SoftBank by July 1.
We will not discuss these pending or any proposed transactions on today's call. As our announcement on Monday said,
the Sprint Board of Directors has formed a special committee of independent directors to review and carefully evaluate
the proposal received from Dish, with its financial and legal advisors. The special committee plans to evaluate the
proposal and additional information that the committee has requested from Dish and provide its assessment to the full
Board in due course whether the proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior offer as is defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger with SoftBank. In the meantime, rest assured that Sprint management will not take its
eye off of operational performance.
I will now turn the call over to Steve Elfman who will provide you with more detail on our Network Vision progress.
Steven Lawrence Elfman
Thanks, Dan.
I'm pleased to discuss our continued progress on Network Vision during the quarter. Please turn to slide 13.
As Dan mentioned, we continue to make strong progress in the first quarter with the Network Vision pipeline and our
sites on air count grew significantly. While the build in the first quarter was impacted by inclement weather across the
country, we were able to achieve over the 12,000 sites on air by the end of the quarter. We now have zoning complete
on over 32,000 sites and leasing complete on over 31,000 sites. More than 25,000 sites are ready or have already begun
construction.

Our weekly construction starts are now at a level to achieve our goals for the year. There are over 600 cities under
construction and we've now launched 4G LTE in 88 cities with over 170 expected to launch in the months to come. We
are pleased with the momentum of our build as we now have over 13,500 sites on air. Additionally, we are also very
pleased with the performance we are seeing on the Network Vision site we have on air.
We continue to see LTE speeds that are competitive, in the range of 6 to 8 megabytes per second for downlink and two
to three megabytes per second for uplink. And in the markets where we have the majority of the sites complete, we are
seeing significant improvement in blocked and dropped calls. We expect this performance to continue to improve as we
bring full site clusters on air and continue to tune the network. As we said last quarter, we continue to expect to have
LTE coverage for approximately 200 million POPs by the end of 2013, depending on backhaul availability.
Please turn to slide 14. In the first quarter, we continued to make strong progress in winding down the Nextel platform.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 1.3 million subscribers remaining, of which over 1 million were
postpaid. We remain on a track to shut down the Nextel platform by the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, our
operational shutdown plans for the platform will be similar to that of the thinning process we engaged in last year. The
network will be shut down on June 30, at switch locations in rapid succession. Following the shutdown, we will begin
powering down equipment and eliminating T-1s at each cell site which we expect to be substantially complete within
90 to 120 days. We began the deployment of CDMA voice on 800 megahertz in the first quarter and we expect to
deploy LTE on 800 megahertz in the fourth quarter.
Network Vision has reached a good pace and we're pleased with the service improvements we are seeing. We expect
this to be an important year for Sprint with the Nextel network shutting down and the modernization of the network
expected to be substantially complete by the end of the year.
I will now turn it over to Joe Euteneuer to take you through the financials.
Joseph J. Euteneuer
Thank you, Steve. And thanks, everyone, for being here today.
As I've discussed with you in the past, 2013 is a heavy investment year for Sprint, as we aggressively expand our LTE
footprint, enhance our 3G network and shut down the Nextel network as Steve just discussed, all of which is necessary
to drive future growth.
During this investment phase of our turnaround, we remain very focused on profitability and I am particularly pleased
with our adjusted OIBDA result this quarter. We continue to make improvements to the Sprint platform operations as a
result of employing a strategy of disciplined growth. Moving to slide 16, our Sprint platform postpaid business
continued to show growth in both subscribers and revenues during the first quarter. Sprint platform postpaid net adds
were 12,000 in the first quarter, including 264,000 recaptures from the postpaid Nextel platform. While net adds were
positive, Sprint platform postpaid gross adds were down 20% year-over-year as result of our continued focus on Nextel
conversions and slowing industry decisions after an extremely strong fourth quarter.
Even with our focus to balance more costly external acquisition with our Nextel recapture efforts, we are still able to
maintain our share of gross adds. During the last quarter, we continued to make progress on getting subscribers cleared
from the Nextel platform and, as of the end of the first quarter, we had just over 1 million postpaid subscribers
remaining – almost all of which are business customers. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our
postpaid Nextel recapture rate will continue to decline as we approach complete shutdown on June 30 due to the fact
that zero use and negative return on investment customers remain in the base until the end. As a result, we expect
postpaid recapture rate to decline from 46% in the first quarter to 30% to 40% of the remaining postpaid subscribers in
this last quarter of operation.
Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.84% in the first quarter improved 16 basis points year-over-year.

This improvement was driven by involuntary churn returning to more normal levels. Since almost all the subscribers
remaining on the Nextel platform are business customers, we anticipate some pressure in the second quarter to Sprint
platform postpaid churn from business accounts with lines of service on both Sprint and Nextel platforms that decide to
terminate all lines as a result of not continuing service on the Nextel platform. As we have discussed previously, we are
also experiencing some adverse impacts to voluntary churn, which we expect are temporary, related to our Network
Vision deployment and, therefore, we continue to expect elevated churn for the next few quarters before we start to see
gradual improvements from better network performance and expanded LTE coverage.
Moving to the rate component of revenue growth; Sprint platform postpaid ARPU of $63.67 for the first quarter was a
new record as Dan mentioned and grew nearly 2% year-over-year due to continued penetration of our $10 premium
data add-on charge and ongoing initiatives aimed at reducing customer discounts and credits. Sequential growth also
resumed this quarter as the fourth quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by one-time customer credits related to
Hurricane Sandy. With continued smartphone penetration, we continue to expect ARPU on the Sprint platform to grow
throughout 2013, but at slower rates than in 2012.
Moving to slide 17, our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow. We added 568,000 net prepaid
customers in the quarter, including 67,000 recaptured from the Nextel platform, driven by strong performance in our
Virgin Mobile and Boost brands. All three prepaid brands had positive net adds in the first quarter and Sprint platform
Boost net adds have been positive for 13 consecutive quarters. Both brands are also experiencing ARPU growth and
improvements in churn. As I discussed with you last quarter, the regulatory changes in the Lifeline industry have
impacted our Assurance subscribers for the last few quarters and will culminate in the second quarter with an expected
net subscriber loss of approximately 1.3 million to 1.4 million subscribers to our prepaid base. While this subscriber
impact is significant, I want to remind you that the revenue loss is limited as these are among the lowest ARPU
subscribers in our prepaid base. In accordance with our normal prepaid churn rules, we are now working to reengage
the customers who did not recertify as of December 31 on a different offer and billing has been suspended on these
subscribers so the revenue loss is already reflected in the first quarter results and partially explains the sequential
decline in total prepaid ARPU.
Even this lost revenue, Sprint platform prepaid revenue still grew 18% year-over-year. We have also been working on
adapting to this new competitive environment by developing innovative sales tactics that have helped grow Assurance
gross adds sequentially for the last two quarters. The Lifeline regulatory changes have also had some temporary
impacts on our wholesale and affiliate business. As we previously discussed, in the first quarter, we saw net customer
losses of 224,000 primarily due to Lifeline recertification. We expect similar impacts in the second quarter from a
targeted effort by our wholesale customers to eliminate inactive accounts in their base, but we fully expect to return to
positive net adds in the back half of the year. Even with the net subscriber losses in the first quarter, we grew
wholesale, affiliate and other revenue 29% year-over-year.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on slide 18. Total wireless cost of service declined for the sixth
consecutive quarter to $2.17 billion in the first quarter or 30% of wireless service revenues, which was our best level
since the first quarter of 2008. This represents an improvement of nearly 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, even
with the estimated net increase in Network Vision dilution, which primarily impacts cost of service. We also see
benefits in other expense areas such as service and repair, which are down year-over-year primarily due to lower
transaction volumes. In addition, our rent and utility expenses are lower on the Nextel network primarily related to
lease exit charges taken last year associated with the accelerated thinning project.
Moving to subsidy expense; total wireless net subsidy for the first quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease of
$503 million sequentially and $83 million year-over-year. The sequential decrease was primarily due to seasonally
lower upgrade and gross add volumes. While postpaid upgrades in the quarter 6.9% of the base, which is a record low,
we do expect this rate to pick up in the second quarter as we launch more devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S4 and
the HTC One. Additionally, the first customers who upgraded under the 3Q 2011 implementation of our 20-month
policy will start becoming upgrade eligible in the second quarter. This is why we believe upgrades will be heavier in
the coming months and the last half of the year.

Switching to SG&A expense, total first quarter wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.2 billion were
down $81 million year-over-year and $206 million sequentially. While the sequential decline was largely driven by
seasonally lower sales volume, the year-over-year improvement was also impacted by lower volumes as well as lower
bad debt and customer care expense. As I mentioned previously, we are seeing lower involuntary churn and this is
leading to lower bad debt expenses as the bad debt percent of service revenue dropped 74 basis points year-over-year.
Customer care expenses are also down due to lower call volumes as a result of our Simple Rate Plans and increased
customer familiarity with smartphones.
Please turn to slide 19. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA of $1.5 billion was up 77% sequentially and 26% from the
year-ago period, our highest year-over-year percentage increase since 3Q 2006. Wireless adjusted OIBDA of $1.4
billion more than doubled from the last quarter and wireless OIBDA margin of 19.2% was the highest since 2Q 2009.
Our strong focus on efficiency and taking cost out of the operating model has allowed us to achieve this growth while
absorbing the additional impacts from the Network Vision project. Total estimated Network Vision net dilution to
adjusted OIBDA was approximately $145 million during the quarter, compared to approximately $130 million in the
fourth quarter and approximately $100 million in the year-ago period.
The project is really hitting its stride and we continue to expect dilution in the second quarter that could be up to $100
million more sequentially before becoming more neutral in the second half. This increased dilution in addition to the
higher sequential upgrades and the loss of the remaining Nextel customer base that we do not expect to recapture will
likely cause adjusted OIBDA to decline sequentially from our first quarter results. Wireline adjusted OIBDA for the
first quarter of $128 million was down $33 million from the year ago period and $53 million sequentially. Both
declines were impacted by the annual resetting of our intercompany transfer rates to reflect current market prices,
which was approximately $30 million and is neutral to consolidated adjusted OIBDA.
Moving to cash and liquidity on slide 20; we continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this
quarter. We replaced our existing $2.2 billion revolving bank credit facility with a new five-year $2.8 billion facility
which was subsequently increased to $3 billion in April. This new facility is a demonstration of the confidence our
bank group has in Sprint along with a positive market environment. Over the last year, we have managed our debt
portfolio such that we have no significant debt maturities between now and December of 2016. In addition, we ended
the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $7.8 billion.
Switching our discussion to capital expenditures; we spent $1.8 billion in the first quarter, which included $1.4 billion
of Network Vision capital, while total capital expenditures were down slightly from last quarter due to lower legacy
capital spend, Network Vision capital continues to increase as it should and we expect total CapEx to continue at
similar to slightly higher levels throughout 2013. Rebanding expenditures which are not included in capital
expenditures were approximately $45 million for the first quarter. Free cash flow for the first quarter was negative $493
million, compared to negative $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and positive $138 million a year ago. The sequential
increase was primarily impacted by a seasonally low selling quarter while the year-over-year decline was mostly
related to higher CapEx spend from the Network Vision project.
As we are now in the middle of the investment phase of our turnaround, we continue to expect free cash flow to be
negative for the next several quarters. Regarding guidance for 2013, we expect 2013 consolidated adjusted OIBDA to
be closer to the high end of our previous guidance of $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding any impact from our
pending transactions. However, we do not expect to see the same seasonal trend as in recent years, with this year
having a sequential decline in the second quarter as previously discussed, as well as less of a decline from third to
fourth quarter as we begin to see some cost improvements partially offsetting the usually high selling cost of the fourth
quarter.
We expect CapEx to continue at around our current run rate for the remainder of the year. Also as Brad mentioned, we
will have the charges associated with retirement of the Nextel platform leases and access charges coming in the second
quarter.
In closing, I am very pleased with the momentum we are building in our results and the improvement in the pacing of
Network Vision while we move through our investment phase. This quarter, we are focused on the good execution of

the shutdown of the Nextel network, continuing the aggressive expansion of our LTE footprint and maintaining our
discipline of having a balanced approach to customer acquisition and profitability as we go through the Network Vision
build.
Finally, and most importantly, I want to thank our workforce for their continued focus on executing and delivering
quality results during a time of increased potential for distraction given the pending transactions. As Dan mentioned in
his opening remarks, we have not taken our eye off operations and we have our dedicated employees to thank for that
continued focus. I'll now turn the call back over to Brad for Q-and-A.
Brad Hampton
Thank you, Joe.
In just a minute, Laura will instruct our listeners on how to queue up for the question and answer session. I want to
point out that you may access an audio replay or a webcast of our presentation on www.sprint.com/investors.
We will now open the line for your questions. Laura, please instruct our participants.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks, guys. I wonder if you can expand a little bit on the CDMA churn commentary? Can
you help us think about what share of churn right now is being driven by those iDEN account departures? And last
year, we saw a nice decline in CDMA churn from 1Q to 2Q, is that still possible or does that higher level of iDEN
departure offset it? Thanks.
<A - Brad Hampton>: Hey, Phil, it's Brad. We're not pulling out the specific components of the drivers of churn. I
would tell you as we've commented over the last couple of quarters, the most significant issue we face right now is the
temporary network-related pressures associated with our build and being slightly behind on LTE from a coverage
perspective. We expect that to moderate over time as we progress with the build.
In terms of 1Q to 2Q, we're not giving specific guidance, but I would tell you that we will see some pressures that will
likely offset some of the normal seasonal benefits, but we're going to continue to manage that the best we can over
time.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: I guess if I can try another tack maybe. You talked about gross add share, which maintained
pretty well this quarter. At what point do you start reallocating marketing dollars back to CDMA and away from iDEN
retention?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Phil, this is Dan. We'd expect to see that in Q3. Q2 is going to still be very – actually it's a very
large, important recapture quarter. It will be more challenging on the recapture side on the iDEN side, because we have
so many business accounts.
And also another item that will drive churn in the quarter is – we mentioned it briefly on the call – what we called
mixed accounts, where if we lose the iDEN business, we basically lose the entire account, which hits us on CDMA.
So you'll begin to see more of that focus, at least on overall [ph] SOCA (35:54), in Q3.
I think, though, kind of the way we look at it is really that ratio of share of voice to share of gross adds. And in the first
quarter, at least based upon our metrics, our share of gross adds is significantly higher than our share of voice, in terms
of advertising spending.

So it's still pretty effective, but we will have to change tacks – or tactics – in the second half of the year.
And as I've also mentioned on the call, we're on schedule to turn the iDEN network off at the end of the second quarter.
So we will be finished with the recapture process at the end of this quarter.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jennifer Murtaugh Fritzsche>: Thank you for taking my call – question.
Joe, I just wanted to drill down. In the past, you had talked about – I believe about $350 million of quarter in iDEN
savings, with the costs associated with iDEN. To me, that number seems low, as I run it, at about 16% of your cost of
services. Is there any additional savings, you think, that could be seen with that? And is that still the right way to think
about it?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, I mean – go ahead. You want to take it?
<A - Brad Hampton>: So, Jennifer, it's Brad. Part of the $350 million per quarter or so we quoted a few quarters ago
has already been realized from the sites that we thinned out last year. So on a go-forward basis, the quarterly pickup
from the Nextel platform shutdown will be less than that. But that's essentially the main components of the pickup that
we referenced in the script.
As we talked about Network Vision overall becoming relatively neutral in the second half, you'll see a ramp-up in
savings, as we take the write-down in Q2, for at least exit costs and access costs, and begin to see those savings flow
through from an adjusted-OIBDA perspective.
<Q - Jennifer Murtaugh Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you, Brad.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks, guys. Two quick questions, if I may.
So firstly, just a little more color on the EBITDA trends for the rest of the year would be helpful.
My understanding was the – all of the residual iDEN expenses will be reclassified out of adjusted EBITDA following
the shutdown. So I would have expected a fairly significant step-up in EBITDA in 3Q. And then a much-better
year-over-year trend in 4Q, which I would have thought would have put you decently above the EBITDA guidance
range that you put out there, given this quarter's beat.
And secondly, I guess a question for Dan. If you could give us some idea, assuming the Clearwire deal closes on July 1,
how quickly you can get – you can deploy that spectrum into your network and get devices into the base that can utilize
TD-LTE on all that spectrum, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Hey, Jonathan. So let me take them kind of in reverse.
Assuming the transaction with Clearwire closes, we will begin deploying our first devices later this year – probably late
third quarter – that would have TD-LTE capabilities, multi-band capabilities in those devices. And of course, it will
take some time to put a lot of devices in our base, but we would begin that process this year.
With respect to OIBDA and OIBDA guidance, there is a few things to keep in mind. Number one, you clearly have
seasonality, in terms of both upgrades and gross adds. And those expenses will be higher going forward than they were

in the first quarter.
Second, as we indicated, there will be higher dilution from Network Vision in the second quarter than there was in the
first quarter, so that is still ahead of us. And of course, we'll lose the revenues on the Nextel platform – which are still
enough to matter – after the second quarter.
So those are the reasons that the guidance, of course, went up for the year, but perhaps not as up for the year as much as
you might have expected it. There are some differences, if you will, in future quarters than what we experienced in Q1.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks, Dan.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just one follow-up, and sort of another crack at, I
think, Phil's question.
When you think about the Sprint platform subscribers that are attached to mixed-use accounts, is there any way you can
just size that base for us? You talked about elevated 2Q churn, so just wondering if you could frame the risk for us, as
to what is the magnitude of Sprint platform subs attached to this?
And then, Dan, maybe a bigger-picture question, just on upgrades. I think across the industry, we've seen much lower
than expected upgrade activity this quarter. I guess I'm just wondering to what extent is this policy changes, where you
and others have really shifted and termed out a lot of the upgrade eligibility? Or do you think consumers, to some
extent, are just reacting to a – really a slowing in the rate of change in innovation on the handset side? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, Jason, first of all, I kind of wish it were true that the latter – your last comment was the
case.
Actually, there will be pressure in the second half. Part of it has to do with when are the great new iconic devices
launched. And what we have ahead of us is you have the HTC One – if you will, that were not in the first quarter. You
have the Galaxy 4. You have – at least there could be a new iPhone refresh later this year. Those things really do drive
upgrades.
I think the policy shifting is important in the industry because subsidies just keep going up. And I think from the
economic model perspective of the carriers, we just can't afford to upgrade as often. So those upgrade policies, I think,
will help to mitigate that somewhat.
But we're not seeing any evidence yet that customers are interested in upgrading less often. If they see, if you will, less
difference or less improvement year-over-year, in terms of what's going on [ph] in these devices. (42:54) In fact,
perhaps the opposite might be true, which means these policies are really quite important for the industry.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great. And then on the [indiscernible] (43:27)
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Oh, yeah. We haven't provided specific breakdowns of, if you will, accounts and what the
impact is.
Obviously, there is a big postpaid impact on the Nextel side this quarter, with over a million postpaid subs that on the
Nextel brand that we know will be de-acting this quarter. So there is a particularly large impact.
And again, they're largely business accounts, so a lot of these – a higher percentage than normal, if you will, because
they are business accounts versus consumers have. And they tend to be, a lot of times, larger business accounts. They
do have a number of Sprint-branded or CDMA devices.
So it's kind of a one-time hit that we could take on the churn side this quarter, with respect to the Sprint platform, based
upon knowing we have over a million Nextel postpaid customers that have to come off this quarter.

<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question.
If we look across the industry at the postpaid results we saw from all the carriers this quarter – and to the extent we can,
we sort of back out the impact of data devices – it looks like postpaid phone customers industry-wide declined pretty
meaningfully. And this is actually I think the second or third year it's happened. And the losses in the first quarter
continue to get worse.
Just curious why you think that is happening? And the reason I'm asking you guys is because you have a pretty big
prepaid base including some of the more premium prepaid offers. And so are you increasingly seeing that customers
are viewing prepaid as an acceptable substitute for postpaid? And if not, what else do you think is going on?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: This is one of the reasons we, if you will, double-downed on prepaid back in 2009 when we
acquired Virgin.
And as we mentioned, we just recently launched Sprint As You Go, which – we had customers in our stores that were
really interested in Sprint, Sprint brand, that are in a Sprint store, and we didn't have, if you will, a no-contract option.
We are seeing it increasingly, if you will – you used your word acceptable. And really it comes down to – not only
better, increasingly competitive offers in the prepaid space, but more and more high-end devices being offered in
prepaid. The iPhone, you can get that – a lot of high-end smartphones – in prepaid.
So I think what you are seeing is just a stronger, more robust set of prepaid offers that, one might say, does compete
with postpaid to a certain extent. And that's why we continue to believe that having a balanced portfolio between
postpaid and prepaid.
And also why the wholesale business is important to us. Because that is largely driven by prepaid MVNOs that
effectively can market prepaid offers or no-contract offers to specific market segments very effectively, and more
effectively than we can.
So I think what you are seeing is a maturing of the U.S. markets beginning – I think it's still different than most other
international markets. There are unique things about the U.S.
But the U.S. has always been or traditionally been almost exclusively postpaid. And it's beginning to look a little bit
more like other markets that have a higher prepaid mix, in terms of the number of – or percentage of customers.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Great. Thanks for that color.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thanks. Your CapEx guidance implies about a $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion for the year. I guess
my question is why not spend more? Could you spend more – assuming all your deals close in the next couple months
and you have improved liquidity – why wouldn't you try to accelerate even more your LTE rollout?
And I guess the other question is – is CapEx coming in below budget for any reason – i.e., equipment vendor
negotiations or otherwise?

<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: I think, Kevin, you've got to segregate the capital comment before and after a close of
transaction.
Us as a standalone, we'll continue to have that balanced approach. And we believe that the guidance we've given you is
a pretty good standalone view of what one would spend on capital expenditures. We have not provided any guidance of
what we would do operationally post the close of any of the pending transactions.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Got it. But it says in the slide deck that the Q1 run rate will continue for the rest of the year. So
I guess there seems to be new guidance for the second half...
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, but we're giving you guidance so you'd have some idea what we'd spend as a
standalone entity for the full year. It wasn't to imply that we are giving you guidance in regards to a closed transaction.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Understood, understood.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Dan, I know you talked about voluntary churn with the pardon-our-dust
issue. Did you also see some impact from more widespread carrier having availability of the iPhone?
And then secondly, any commentary regarding tablet demand in the quarter would be great. Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yeah, first, I'd say that our being able to roughly maintain our share of gross adds without
significant help from tablets – we did not sell a lot of tablets in the first quarter.
We just began really to carry tablets right at the end of last year, and we're still kind of developing and learning how to
do that effectively, as well as getting the awareness out there in the market that Sprint is a place to go for tablets. So
that has not been significant.
The iPhone – with respect to – I think you're talking about T-Mobile having it – is really more of a Q2 phenomenon.
And we will monitor that obviously very, very closely.
There always is a temporary impact in terms of net ports, when a device as iconic as the iPhone is picked up by a
competitor. So we did see a what we are hoping is a temporary impact of the new iPhone device being carried by
T-Mobile.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Dan, you mentioned briefly about the upgrade policy changes taking place, is there
something that you guys can do there or exploit other carriers' behavior from it?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, we think we have, as you know, it was roughly a year ago, a little more that we actually
extended our upgrade eligibility to 20 months and did away with, if you will, a program that allowed customers to
upgrade more often. We think it's very rational, we like where we are right now. We will evaluate changes to our
upgrade policy over time. As I've said, very much like a lot of things we might be able to do in the market, in terms of
let's say being more profitability focused, it depends upon how quickly and how effectively we continue to roll out
Network Vision and of course this was a good quarter in the first quarter. And – but we right now don't have plans to –
I think your question might be, do we want to really focus on the factor that we have a 20-month upgrade versus let's
say Verizon that might be 24 months, that is not a big piece of our marketing plans right now.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, Dan.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Sure, thanks, Mike.

Our next question comes from David Dixon of FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Thanks very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask a high-level question, first of all, with
respect to SoftBank. The team has spent a lot of time in Japan of late. And I just wondered, Dan, if the team could share
some high-level takeaways from that interaction, some insight perhaps on the network transformation, really
encouraging to see that SoftBank's taken their company from the worst to the best data network in Japan is clearly
something we're trying to do here and it's clearly more than just bringing additional spectrum into the mix.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, David, our conversations with SoftBank are confidential. I think you're right that there
are some things that we can learn from each other in that they do utilize high frequency spectrum effectively in Japan.
We have a lot of meetings and have in terms of where we share best practices in terms of things we're doing here and
things that they are doing in Japan that we can learn from and those discussions continue. But the specific nature of
those discussions are still confidential.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: In general, Dan, would you say that the markets are very different as reasons specific to Japan
that may define how they achieve that or do you think just in general, that there would be some applicability here
without going into specifics?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: There are some areas that are clearly applicable. Now, the differences in geography in that we
have more rural areas and they tend to have more highly concentrated urban areas. But for example, the technical
things or network things that they're doing in the metropolitan areas, there's a lot of applicability or learning with
respect to how those might be applied in our metropolitan areas.
There are some, on the marketing side, there are clearly differences in the customer bases in cultures and what have
you, but if you take a look at things like smartphone penetration and the attractiveness of devices, an awful lot of
similarities. So, it's very much a – there are a lot of things that are similar and there are also things that are differences.
And I think the important thing, David, is understanding when we do talk to them is what are the areas that are similar
that we can learn from and what are things that are different and why something that might work in Japan would not
work in the United States and vice versa.
<A - Brad Hampton>: Operator, we have time for one final question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys, thanks so much for squeezing me in, I appreciate it. Joe, just a question on
CapEx. First, we've heard kind of rising chatter about, or maybe Steve, the notion of a Network Vision 2.0 game plan
to kind of really flesh out the network capabilities. LTE as you pointed out is going to be hugely important
competitively. And as a result, there has been some pretty divergent expectations for standalone CapEx coming out for
the 2014 year. Could you weigh in on what the right thinking is, Joe, for a standalone Sprint CapEx picture in 2014
given how wide the spread is on the Street right now?
And then, second, if I could, maybe Dan. Just kind of trying to synthesize some of the questions that we heard about the
state of the market, T-Mobile with negative net adds and Sprint and even AT&T negative phone subscribers. Verizon's
166,000 phone subscribers probably came from the iDEN network, and without them, they might be negative, too. So,
as you look at wrapping up the iDEN shutdown and focusing back on the gross add market, what is the goal? Is the
goal to really grow and – or is it to hold share and focus on prepaid? What is the go-to-market strategy when the market
really doesn't seem to be growing at this stage of the game? Thanks.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: So, let me take you on your capital question for 2014. I mean, Steve will give you the
specifics of what we've done in regards to the added capital we're spending in 2013, but in regards to the 2014, we
haven't really given any guidance on that, we're still trying to figure out these transactions. We've tried to give you now
full year guidance of what we think we're going to spend as a standalone and I think you've got to wait until later in the

year before we start really discussing 2014. But Steve can give you the specific things that we've accelerated from what
we were going to do into 2013 as result of our plan.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Dave, a couple of things, when we talk about Network Vision 2.0, I think there is
probably a couple things I would think about, number one, we didn't initially contemplate 800 megahertz LTE in the –
when we were initially doing Network Vision and we got the standards – Band 26 into the standards last year, and so
this year, we're going to actually put LTE in the 800 megahertz and help our in-building. So, this is kind of one of the
Network Vision 2.0's. Additionally, to an earlier question about the bands for Band 41 for 2.5 gigahertz and being able
to utilize and work with Clearwire, that was not initially contemplated in the Network Vision 1.0 in this way and we
will be, as Dan said, introducing devices this year that will be able to fall back from 2.5 gigahertz to 800 megahertz to
1.9 gigahertz, and that's required us to put both the new standards in, but also eCSFB, for fall back. So, those are just
two of the things in the Network Vision 2.0, and there are others when I presume you guys come out and visit, we can
get into more detail about the specifics, but that's what 2.0 is all about.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: And, David, this is Dan, on your other question, we still think he wireless industry is a great
industry to be in, but it will evolve and this is why it was important that I mentioned earlier that we invested in prepaid,
why the wholesale business is important, because those are areas of growth. And with respect to postpaid, I think our
focus will be primarily on share, but particularly on profitability. I think in the industry as a whole, it is going to focus
on profitability. So, even though the growth may not go down – or may not be increasing as it has in past years, perhaps
the profitability of the industry could increase because think of usage going up, which is an opportunity for ARPU. If –
the question earlier with respect to how often people can upgrade devices, if upgrades begin to reduce, if you will, the –
if you are eligible for upgrade, it that gets longer, that could improve.
You've seen churn in the industry begin to improve, so less switching between carriers, that improves profitability.
More devices on the account, which is an opportunity for ARPU. So, as you know, churn and ARPU are the two
financial metrics that are the most important to profitability. So, as we look at it, we – that's why it's important for us to
have a, if you will, a broad portfolio of postpaid, prepaid and wholesale and wholesale is not only prepaid, but things
like machine to machine and all sorts of wireless devices. I think there is some good revenue opportunities there.
And I also believe that in the industry as a whole, as churn improves and ARPU improves, the customer lifetime value
of each customer can improve over time because wireless is becoming a more and more important part of everyone's
life and there will be more and more devices connected as well. So, we still are bullish on the potential of the industry,
although the model will change, the economic model will change and, if you will, the postpaid phone will not be as
dominant in terms of what drives success in the wireless industry as it has for the past decade.
