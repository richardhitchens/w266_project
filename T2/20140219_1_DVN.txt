John Richels
Well, thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. 2013 was another year of strong execution and exciting change
for Devon. Our oil-focused drilling programs not only accomplished impressive oil production growth, but also
successfully expanded margins and improved operating cash flow.
Additionally, we've taken some bold steps in a relatively short period of time to high-grade our portfolio and improve
Devon's growth trajectory. We did this through an accretive Eagle Ford Shale acquisition, an innovative midstream
combination, and the initiation of an asset divestiture program.
Now let's briefly recap some of the past year's highlights in a little more detail. In 2013, we had outstanding success
growing U.S. oil production, our highest-margin product. Driven by our development programs in the Permian Basin,
we increased our light sweet crude production in the U.S. to 78,000 barrels per day, up 32% compared to 2012. This
highly profitable U.S. oil production growth is particularly impressive considering the large base of oil production that
we're growing off, a base that ranks Devon as one of the largest independent oil producers in the U.S.
Our pursuit of oil production resulted in higher revenues and improved profitability as well. In 2013, company-wide oil
revenue increased by 23% compared to the previous year and accounted for more than half of our total upstream
revenue. This revenue growth, combined with a strong focus on cost containment, improved our operating cash flow in
2013 by 10% year-over-year, significantly exceeding Wall Street estimates.
Looking beyond our reported results, we also made some exciting portfolio changes at Devon during 2013. In October,
we announced the strategic combination of our U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex to form EnLink Midstream. The
creation of EnLink greatly improves the diversification, capital efficiency and growth trajectory of our midstream
holdings. Additionally, this innovative transaction allowed us to obtain an immediate market-based valuation for the
U.S. portion of our midstream business. At the time of the announcement, Devon contributed assets valued at $4.8
billion. As of yesterday's closing prices, our ownership interest in EnLink was valued at more than $8.3 billion or
roughly a third of Devon's market capitalization. The combination has already resulted in an additional $3.5 billion of
value or the equivalent of more than $8.00 per share, and we expect additional value to accrue as EnLink grows and
develops its assets.
Another significant transaction for us announced in late November was our acquisition of Eagle Ford assets. This
transaction allowed us to secure a world-class light oil acreage position in the very best part of the Eagle Ford, offering
some of the highest rate-of-return drilling opportunities in North America. We were able to acquire these premier assets
in the economic heart of the play at a price well below our current EBITDA multiple. Given the attractive purchase
price, the Eagle Ford acquisition is immediately accretive to Devon's shareholders on virtually every metric including,
most importantly, double-digit growth in cash flow per share adjusted for debt.
In conjunction with our Eagle Ford transaction, we also announced our intent to monetize non-core E&P properties
both in the U.S. and in Canada. This initiative further sharpens Devon's focus on core assets, delivering material growth
rates or substantial free cash flow. This morning, we were pleased to announce the sale of our entire Canadian
conventional business excluding Horn River for approximately C$3.125 billion or, at current exchange rates, US$2.8
billion. This transaction values our natural gas-levered Canadian conventional business at approximately seven times
2013 EBITDA. This is a substantial premium compared to our current trading multiple and is immediately accretive to

Devon shareholders.
Additionally, this was a very tax-efficient transaction for Devon. After adjusting for Canadian taxes and tax on
repatriation of funds to the U.S., we expect net proceeds of approximately US$2.7 billion. We will utilize these net
proceeds to reduce the debt that we're taking on with the Eagle Ford acquisition, and we expect to close this transaction
in the second quarter.
The sale to Canadian Natural is in addition to minor asset sales of other Canadian conventional assets in early 2014 of
about another C$155 million. The attractive monetization of our largest divestiture properties in such a short time
period is a significant step forward in the execution of our overall divestiture process. For our remaining divestiture
assets in the U.S., even before opening our data rooms, we're seeing significant buyer interest. We expect to have all
these asset packages on the market in the second quarter and remain confident that we're on track to finish this
divestiture process by year-end. We will provide additional updates on our progress as we move throughout the year.
So the new Devon has greater focus with our retained asset base in five core development plays, three of which reside
in some of the most attractive oil-prone basins in North America: the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin, and the Canadian
oil sands. Each of these core oil assets represents a low-risk and high-margin production growth opportunity with the
scale to significantly impact the results of a company our size. The retained liquids-rich gas component of the new
Devon is anchored by our Barnett and Anadarko Basin assets. These core areas currently generate large amounts of free
cash flow and provide significant gas optionality. So in aggregate, Devon emerges with a formidable and balanced
portfolio positioned to deliver multi-year same-store sales oil growth of around 20% per year. The new Devon is also
delivering top line production growth in spite of letting gas volumes decline, all while living within operating cash
flow.
With large high-quality acreage positions in each of our core assets, we have no shortage of investment opportunities.
Focusing on our go-forward business, we expect E&P capital spending to range from $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion in
2014, excluding about $250 million of capital associated with the divestiture assets. This spending focused primarily in
low-risk oil development plays is expected to increase average oil production for our go-forward properties to a range
of 198,000 barrels per day to 216,000 barrels per day in 2014.
This represents a company-wide oil growth rate of approximately 35% year-over-year on a reported basis for our
go-forward assets, or about 20% on a same-store sales basis. The majority of our oil production growth in 2014 will
come from aggressive development of the Eagle Ford and Permian, driving our reported light oil production in the U.S.
about 75% higher than 2013 levels.
After taking into account declines in natural gas, we expect the midpoint of our total Boe production on our go-forward
properties to increase by roughly 10% on a reported basis over 2013. This high-margin production mix in 2014 will
lead to further margin expansion and translate into improved cash flow growth for the company. As I already
mentioned, we expect to deliver these attractive results while keeping total capital spending within operating cash flow
for the year.
Looking beyond the attractive growth that the repositioned Devon is going to deliver in 2014, our go-forward portfolio
is also positioned for excellent high-margin growth in 2015. Assuming today's price environment and constant costs,
our organic oil production growth in 2015 is shaping up to exceed 20% while delivering free cash flow. The Eagle Ford
and Permian will once again drive competitive production growth in the U.S., and we should see significant oil growth
out of Canada as our Jackfish 3 project begins to contribute meaningful volumes in 2015.
This increase in Canadian oil volumes coincides with our expectation for improved demand and take-away capacity.
Increased refinery demand and critical new pipeline and rail take-away capacity will allow Canadian crudes
unprecedented access to the U.S. Gulf Coast. This will likely narrow the volatile price differentials we've seen on
Canadian crudes over the past few years providing a catalyst that should further enhance our profitability in 2015 and
beyond.
So in summary, we're very pleased with the way Devon is positioned for the future. As we integrate the recent
acquisitions into our portfolio, maximize divestiture proceeds, and deliver on growth expectations, we're poised to

create value for our shareholders in the upcoming years.
So at this point, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed operations review. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments this morning with a brief review of reserves. Proved
reserves for oil, gas, and NGLs totaled 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end. On the oil side of the portfolio,
reserves increased to a record 837 million barrels. During the year, our oil-focused drilling programs added 112 million
barrels of drill bit oil reserve additions, and by drill bit I am referring to extensions, discoveries and performance
revisions. These drill bit oil additions replaced approximately 180% of the oil we produced in 2013. This was largely
driven by our continued success in the Permian, and is particularly impressive given that 2013 was not a year of
significant heavy oil bookings in Canada.
On the gas and natural gas liquids side of the portfolio, not surprisingly, 2013 was not a big year for reserve additions
given our level of drilling activity. While we did see positive reserve revisions for higher natural gas prices, this was
largely offset by negative revisions mostly attributable to the SEC five-year rule. Given our outlook for gas and NGL
pricing relative to oil in the near- to medium-term, these negative revisions represent a reduction in the lowest-margin
barrels within our portfolio and are of little consequence from a value perspective. In contrast, extensions and
discoveries related to our oil-focused development activity generated $4 billion in future net cash flows year-over-year,
more than offsetting the negative gas revisions and driving our overall PV10 up year-over-year.
All-in, our F&D for the year came in at $22 per Boe. Excluding the negative revisions related to the five-year rule, our
all-in F&D would have been approximately $18 per Boe. Another metric commonly tracked by analysts is proved
developed F&D. This metric measures an E&P company's ability to convert undrilled locations to proved developed
reserves in a cost-effective manner, ultimately translating into earnings and cash flow. In 2013, we did an outstanding
job of this as we focused on converting the highest-margin resources into cash flow. During the year, we added 392
million Boe of proved developed reserve additions. And by this, I am referring to our year-over-year change in proved
developed reserves plus production. These proved developed reserve additions replaced 155% of our 2013 production
and were achieved with development capital of approximately $5 billion, translating into a very competitive proved
developed F&D cost of just under $13 per Boe.
Before I move into a detailed review of our operations, it is important to understand how we are approaching capital
allocation in 2014. With the addition of the Eagle Ford assets and our decision to limit capital spending to our expected
cash flow, we have high-graded activity across our portfolio. This optimization has resulted in a prioritization of our
Eagle Ford and Permian and reduced activity levels across several other areas compared to previous years. In 2014, we
plan to spend approximately $1.5 billion in the Permian; $1.1 billion in Eagle Ford; $1.1 billion on our heavy oil
projects in Canada, that's Thermal and Lloyd; $600 million in the liquids-rich areas of the Barnett Shale and Anadarko
Basin combined; and $600 million in our emerging Rockies and Mississippian-Woodford oil plays. With this context in
mind, let's look at new Devon's key assets in more detail.
Beginning with our core oil areas. Fourth quarter production in the Permian averaged a record 86,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, a 29% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Light oil production
continues to account for roughly 60% of our total Permian production.
In the Delaware Basin, our Bone Springs horizontal program continues to be one of the most significant drivers of our
Permian oil growth. In the fourth quarter, we brought 21 Bone Springs wells online with average 30-day IP rates of 800
barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 70% was light oil. These production results are about 40% better in our
published type well profile. We continue to have considerable success in regenerating our inventory in the Bone
Springs.
Our record recent drilling activity in the third Bone Spring across portions of Southeast Eddy and Southwest Lea
counties has allowed us to add roughly 200 additional risk location to our inventory. This marks the third increase over

the past 12 years to our Bone Springs inventory. We now have roughly 1,600 undrilled Bone Spring locations
identified, and we fully expect that our ongoing drilling and geologic work will lead to further inventory increases in
this top tier light oil play. We currently have 11 operated rigs running in the Bone Spring.
Also in the Delaware Basin, we completed our first horizontal Wolfcamp test in Ward County during the fourth quarter.
The Martinsville 120-4H was brought online with an average 30-day IP rate of 950 barrels of oil equivalent per day
including 800 barrels of oil. This is an encouraging result that has positive implications for our more than 100,000 net
prospective acres in the Delaware Wolfcamp. So in total, across the Delaware Basin, we plan to invest approximately
$900 million of capital and drill approximately 160 wells in 2014. Our Bone Spring program will once again be the
primary focus of our activity in the area where we plan to spend about $600 million of capital and drill roughly 130
wells.
With continued success in the Bone Spring and additional gas take-away capacity anticipated over the next 12 months,
we expect to have the option to increase our pace of development in the Bone Spring in 2015. Although our 2014
program in the Delaware Basin will be almost exclusively focused on our low-risk, high-return Bone Spring oil
development, we do plan to continue appraising our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp acreage this year.
Shifting to the Midland Basin, we continue to see solid results from our oil development program in the Wolfcamp
Shale where we have a joint venture partnership with Sumitomo. During the fourth quarter, we tied in 24 new
horizontal Wolfcamp wells with initial 30-day production rates averaging 410 barrels of oil equivalent per day, right in
line with our type well expectations.
On the drilling front, we set a record in the fourth quarter, taking just four days to drill a well to TD. While not the
average, it does illustrate the success we are having in achieving greater efficiencies and lowering costs. We are
currently drilling or currently running five operated rigs and expect to add a sixth rig in April. In 2014, the partnership
will spend approximately $800 million and drill about 140 wells. After the benefit of our drilling carry, Devon's portion
will be just over $200 million in the play this year.
In summary for the Permian, we expect our $1.5 billion capital program to drive strong oil production growth for the
company in 2014. Our 1.3 million net acres in the Permian represent one of the largest and highest-quality acreage
positions in the industry. We have established thousands of undrilled, low-risk locations in the Permian, and with our
success in areas like the Bone Spring, this inventory continues to grow. In addition, the success of our ongoing efforts
to improve efficiencies and reduce costs is further enhancing the returns in our light oil development plays.
As we announced in November, Devon is acquiring 82,000 net acres in the world-class Eagle Ford oil play. This
acreage is located in DeWitt and Lavaca counties, which has proven to be in the very best part of the Eagle Ford,
capable of delivering outstanding well results that ultimately translate into exceptional rates of return. With the
majority of our acreage de-risked, adding this top tier light oil development opportunity to our portfolio provides
additional low-risk repeatable oil growth for years to come.
Closing of this transaction remains on track for the beginning of March. For those of you modeling Devon, we expect
our net production in the Eagle Ford to average between 70,000 Boe per day and 80,000 Boe per day for the 10 months
that we will own these assets in 2014. Also, assuming a March closing, we expect our capital investment in the Eagle
Ford to be about $1.1 billion in 2014. These forward-looking estimates for production and capital are right in line with
our previously provided 2014 guidance after you adjust for not owning the Eagle Ford assets in January or February.
At our thermal oil projects in Northeast Alberta, fourth quarter gross production from our two Jackfish projects
averaged roughly 58,000 barrels of oil per day or 53,000 barrels per day after royalties. As a reminder, our reported net
thermal oil production can fluctuate due to the sliding royalty scale imposed by the Alberta government on these
projects. The factors that impact the sliding scale include cost recovery, commodity pricing, and the foreign exchange
rate.
At Jackfish 1, gross production averaged 35,000 barrels per day or 31,000 barrels per day net of royalties. At Jackfish
2, fourth quarter gross production continued to ramp-up, averaging an all-time high of 23,000 barrels of oil per day or
21,800 barrels per day net of royalties. Production from our new well pad that began steaming in the third quarter have

Page 6 of 14
been ramping up as expected. This pad at peak gross production is expected to contribute up to 8,000 barrels of oil per
day.
It's worth noting in spite of record low temperatures this winter, our Jackfish 1 and Jackfish 2 facilities have maintained
99% up-time, continuing their trend of excellent reliability and efficiency. Construction of Jackfish 3 is nearly complete
with total capital expenditures for the plant and initial well pads projected to come in on budget at $1.4 billion. Plant
commissioning activities will begin in the second quarter and we expect to begin injecting steam in the third quarter of
this year. Delivery of first oil is scheduled to occur late this year with production ramping up throughout 2015.
As John mentioned, we are excited about the resumption of oil growth out of our Canada assets as our Jackfish 3
project continues to contribute meaningful volumes in 2015. It appears that the timing of our oil growth and Canadian
oil volumes will coincide nicely with the improved demand and take-away capacity expected in the market. The
continued ramp-up of heavy throughput at BP's Whiting refinery, the addition of new rail facilities that can add up
more than 500,000 barrels a day of capacity, and the new 600,000 barrel per day Flanagan South Pipeline in the U.S.
Gulf Coast are all expected later this year. These factors should have a narrowing impact on differentials and reduce the
overall pricing volatility we have seen on Canadian crudes over the past few years. Ultimately, we expect these factors
to further enhance our profitability in 2015 and beyond.
At Pike, our thermal oil sands joint venture with BP, we expect to make a decision on the first phase of pipe
development and receive regulatory approval later this year. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development project will have
ultimate gross production capacity of 105,000 barrels of oil per day. Devon operates Pike with a 50% working interest.
Shifting now to our two core liquids-rich areas, the Barnett and Anadarko Basin, with decreased growth capital
allocated to these areas, our focus remains managing base production. Between the Barnett and Anadarko Basin, we
plan to invest about $600 million and plan to drill approximately 200 wells in only the most economic portions of these
plays. In aggregate, we expect these properties to generate about $1 billion of free cash flow in 2014. These areas also
represent significant gas optionality for our portfolio should the economic environment improve for gas.
And finally on the emerging play front, we continue to evaluate the potential across our Mississippian-Woodford Trend
position in North Central Oklahoma. December production for the play averaged 16,000 Boe per day, representing a
47% increase from the September average, and exceeded our target exit rate of 15,000 Boe per day. For the fourth
quarter, total production averaged 14,000 Boe per day. This solid production was driven by 66 wells tied in on our joint
venture acreage with average 30-day IP rates of about 300 Boe per day, right in line with our type curve expectations.
As I mentioned earlier, we anticipated in addition of the Eagle Ford assets to our opportunity set and our decision to
live within operating cash flow has resulted in high-grading across our portfolio. And the Mississippian-Woodford is
no exception. In 2014, we expect to maintain positive momentum in this play, focusing our activity on our joint venture
acreage where we have the benefit of the JV carry. The partnership will spend approximately $860 million to run an
eight-rig program and drill more than 200 wells. After the benefit of Devon's drilling carry, Devon's portion will be
about $200 million in the play this year.
So in summary, we had strong execution in 2013 and we are poised to deliver another year of robust growth in 2014.
With that, I'll turn the call back to John for the financial review and outlook. John?
John Richels
Thanks, David. Our new Chief Financial Officer, Tom Mitchell, joined us on Monday of this week and, of course, a lot
of you know Tom and I'd just like to take this opportunity to welcome Tom to the Devon senior leadership team. For
those who don't know Tom, I'm sure you'll have the opportunity, or many opportunities, to get to know him over the
next while. Since Tom has only been here for a couple of days, I'm going to cover the financial review today, but you
can expect to hear from Tom in future quarters.

So let me start with a brief review of the financial and operating results for 2013 as well as a bit of a commentary on
our outlook for 2014. For those of you modeling Devon, we will file a Form 8-K after the call today that contains
detailed first quarter and full-year estimates for both our go-forward assets and the divestiture assets; estimates for our
divestiture assets assumes a full-year of results. As we close on these divestiture packages throughout the year, we'll
provide updated guidance.
So let's start with production. Our top line production in the fourth quarter averaged 696,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day, which was well above the midpoint of our previous forecast. Looking specifically at the oil side of our
business, we again delivered excellent volume growth. Fourth quarter oil production averaged 177,000 barrels per day,
setting a new quarterly record and exceeding the top end of our guidance range by about 2,000 barrels per day. Our
most significant growth came from the U.S. where high-margin light oil production increased 32% year-over-year.
Looking forward to the first quarter, and assuming one month of contribution from the Eagle Ford properties, we
expect our average daily oil production from our go-forward properties to range between 172,000 barrels per day and
180,000 barrels per day, which excludes about 14,000 barrels per day that are associated with the divestiture assets.
This implies a first quarter year-over-year growth rate of around 20% for our go-forward properties on a reported basis.
Driving this first quarter growth is a 50% increase in high-margin oil production from our go-forward U.S. operations.
Combining this meaningful oil growth with our projected growth in NGLs and the declines we expect in natural gas
production, we expect our first quarter production to range between 556,000 Boes per day and 579,000 Boes per day
for our go-forward properties. Now that excludes roughly 130 Boes per day that's attributable to the divestiture assets.
This represents a top line growth rate in the mid- to high-single-digits for our go-forward properties on a reported basis
compared to the same period a year-ago. We'll post a historical reconciliation of retained and non-core asset production
on our website later today.
Moving to price realizations. In the fourth quarter, our regional pricing by product was generally in line with
expectations. One notable exception was wider-than-expected differentials on Canadian oil production. For the fourth
quarter, Devon's realized Canadian oil price before hedges averaged 50% of the WTI benchmark price, or about $48.50
per barrel. However, we did mitigate the impact on realizations with the cash settlements on our Western Canadian
Select basis swaps. The basis swaps enhanced our overall oil price in Canada for the quarter by more than $4.00 per
barrel or nearly 10%.
As many of you know by now, the fourth quarter weakness in Canadian oil pricing resulted from high levels of refinery
downtime and restricted flow rates on key export pipelines. The good news is that these temporary bottlenecks have
gradually improved, narrowing differentials in the first quarter. As a result, we now expect our Canadian oil price
realizations in the first quarter to be approximately 60% of WTI.
Turning now to our midstream business, our marketing and midstream operating profit reached $513 million in 2013.
This result came in at the top half of our guidance range and represents a 25% increase compared to 2012. The increase
in operating profit was attributable to improved natural gas prices during the year and also strong cost control. Moving
to 2014, we expect our first quarter midstream operating profit to range between $125 million and $155 million. This
forecast assumes the transfer of most of our midstream business to EnLink Midstream during March, which will have
only a minor impact on first quarter reporting. After accounting for the inclusion of EnLink, our full-year 2014
midstream operating profit is expected to range from $685 million to $755 million, which is a 40% increase compared
to 2013.
Beyond the first quarter, the EnLink transaction will have more significant implications on our go-forward financial
reporting. Because we're the majority owner of EnLink's general partnership at 70% and the MLP at 53%, accounting
guidelines require that 100% of EnLink's revenues, expenses, debt, and capital be consolidated within our financial
statements. The minority ownership interest from the financial line items that we do not own will be netted together and
deducted on a line item in our financials entitled Non-Controlling Interest. We expect our non-controlling interest
cutback for the full-year 2014 to be less than $50 million.

It's worth noting that the economic reality of the EnLink transaction is very different from the accounting presentation.
Devon in fact does not own EnLink's assets or revenues, we are not obligated for EnLink's expenses or indebtedness,
and EnLink's capital expenditures do not come from our cash balances. The economic reality is that we own a large
portion of the entities that make up EnLink and receive a large chunk of EnLink's cash distributions. Assuming that we
had closed the transaction on January 1 of this year, our share of distributions would have been expected to be
approximately $270 million for 2014. And as EnLink executes its growth plans and increase its payout, our
distributions are expected to grow.
Moving now to expenses, we did a good job controlling costs across our portfolio throughout 2013. In the fourth
quarter, our total pre-tax cash costs came in at $15.05 per Boe, that's about a 1% decline compared to the year-ago
quarter. Overall, our cost structure remains one of the best in the industry, even as we transition our portfolio to
higher-margin but higher-cost oil production. Looking at cost trends in 2014, the 100% consolidation of EnLink
Midstream will place upward pressure on a few expense line items, but the net effect of EnLink is positive to our
earnings and cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, our 8-K filing that will be available after the call today contains
detailed first quarter and full year estimates.
Now before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. In
the fourth quarter, our operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion, a 26% increase compared to the year-ago period. When
you include the $419 million of cash payments received from asset sales during the year, Devon generated total cash
inflows of $5.9 billion in 2013.
From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we remain exceptionally strong, with investment grade credit rating and
cash balances totaling $6.1 billion. In December, we repatriated another $2.3 billion of foreign cash back to the U.S.
You may recall we repatriated about $2 billion of foreign cash balances earlier in 2013. So in total, we were able to
successfully repatriate $4.3 billion of foreign cash back to the U.S. in 2013 at an estimated tax rate of only 4%.
To provide some perspective on the significance of this, you might recall after divesting our international assets in 2010
and 2011, we guided towards a tax rate of about 20%. The lower tax rate on the amount repatriated to the U.S. resulted
in an incremental $700 million benefit to Devon's shareholders or nearly $2 per share. In the fourth quarter, we also
issued $2.25 billion of senior notes through a combination of two-, three- and five-year offerings and entered into an
undrawn $2 billion senior term loan facility. Proceeds from the senior notes, the term loan facility, and cash on hand
will fund our previously announce Eagle Ford acquisition. As a result of these debt offerings, at December 31st, our net
debt was $6 billion.
Our year-end capital structure pro forma for the closing of the Eagle Ford, EnLink, and Canadian conventional
transactions increases our net debt balances to just over $10 billion, of which roughly $1 billion is attributable to
believe the EnLink consolidation.
So even before any proceeds from our U.S. divestiture process that would further reduce debt, Devon is very well
positioned financially with solid investment grade credit rating.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: [indiscernible]
<A - Vincent W. White>: Brian, we just heard the tail end of that. Could you...?
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: All right, all right. Well, this is better. I'll move on here. Can you put your E&P budget in
context versus 2013? $250 million moves out for the Canadian sale, then we had $1.1 billion for the Eagle Ford but can
you talk more specifically about where you're seeing the high-grading with the total change in carry is and whether
capitalized interest is included in your $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion?
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi, Brian, this is Dave Hager. I'll take a stab at that. First off, capitalized interest in G&A is
not included in the $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. When you look at where we've high-graded a program, I'd say roughly
the Permian activity is about the same. We've obviously added $1.1 billion in Eagle Ford. The overall capital is slightly
lower than we had last year probably a couple hundred million or so. So there's a little bit of reduction. The biggest
reduction will be in our Barnett and Cana areas where we are drilling less of the liquids-rich opportunities. And we're
also spending less money in the Canadian conventional as well. And then finally, we have a little bit smaller land
budget this year compared to last year. So if you look at our key development areas, of the Permian, it's essentially flat,
key oil development areas is essentially flat, the heavy oil essentially flat, the addition of an oil or condensate area in
the Eagle Ford and cutting back on liquids-rich drilling land and the Canadian conventional.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Brian, I might just to close a loop on that, let you know that capitalized G&A and interest
are about $400 million and that those are included in the total capital when we say we intend to live within cash flow in
2014.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thanks. And is there a major change in the carry? You didn't mention what your
after-carry numbers would be in a couple of the areas, but do you expect a major change in the carried interest benefits?
<A - David A. Hager>: No, it should – it's essentially flat.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Okay, thanks. And then in the Permian, can you talk more specifically regarding the Bone
Spring wells that are trending well above your type curve? Whether this is something that's regionally concentrated or
specifically area-concentrated, or whether that broader take-away is across your Delaware position?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, I would say it's, we're hopeful and optimistic that it is broader takeaways across the
entire Bone Springs position. What we've done, Brian, is we've – or we have moved our activity from the northwestern
portion of our acreage position in Lea and Eddy counties, expanding that to the south and southeast in the same
counties to where we have additional acreage. We are starting to appraise those areas, and what we're finding is that
we're getting as good a well results if not better in the south and southeast area as we had in the northwest portion of
our acreage position. Now we don't have as many wells there yet and – but so far, the results are very encouraging. So
that's why we're optimistic this inventory is going to continue to grow, and frankly we haven't booked hardly any
PUDs, just being a little bit conservative there. We haven't booked hardly any PUDs on the basis of all of the results
we've had there as well. So we're very optimistic that the results are going to continue and that we are actually going to
be able to continue to grow the inventory as well.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, we're ready for the next question.

Your next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me now?
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yes. Thank you.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Oh, good. I don't know what happened there. So the first question is a follow up on the Permian,
largely a flat CapEx guide there. But could you provide rig and well count assumptions there? And then also, a very
strong horizontal Delaware Wolfcamp well in Ward County, just any other additional color around the well costs,
lateral length, and whether you're targeting any other shallower zones here in 2014 or just going after the deeper
formation? Thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, and we're going to – again as I said, our activity level is essentially flat this year at
around $1.5 billion. Total, we're going to be drilling somewhere on the order of 350 wells across the entire Permian
position while utilizing 22 to 23 rigs. It'll vary a little bit during the year but somewhere on that order. As I said during
the call, about $900 million of that is going to be spent in the Delaware Basin primarily drilling Bone Springs wells,
about 130 Bone Springs wells, but 160 overall wells. We'll have 11 to 12 rigs working on that play this year. I also
mentioned the Midland Wolfcamp where we're going to spend about $200 million in that area and plan to drill about
150 wells – 140 wells or so in the Midland Wolfcamp Shale and maybe about 10 or so in the Cline. We'll also spend
about $200 million in the Wolfberry, drilling about 40 wells using a couple rigs there. In the Central Basin Platform,
we'll have about 10 wells using a couple of rigs, and then we'll spend about $150 million additionally for leasing
facilities, OBO, and other type projects. So there's I think a pretty comprehensive breakdown of our $1.5 billion.
<Q - Evan Calio>: That's great. And any other, in terms of the...
<A - David A. Hager>: Oh, I'm sorry, on the Delaware Wolfcamp.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we're very excited about it. And so we think there is potential. We have a significant
acreage position not only on the Texas side, but as you move up into New Mexico we have some geological modeling
and thoughts, I would say, about where we think are the most prospective areas. I obviously don't want to get into a lot
of details around that, but we're encouraged by what we see. We're going to continue to drill a handful of wells this
year to evaluate portions of our acreage position and see if we can get some additional opportunities captured.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. And then just secondly if I could on the CapEx, I don't know if you gave the midstream
component, if that was within the guide, if that was flat year-on-year. And I mean, how do you think about midstream
capital spend when living within cash flow, meaning should that be included now that there's a strong inventory of
assets that can be tax-efficiently monetized into EnLink post deal close?
<A - Vincent W. White>: Yeah, when you look at pre-consolidation numbers for Devon, so excluding EnLink, any
capital expenditures that we'll undertake are included in our statement that we intend to live within cash flow. And
obviously a lot of the capital expenditures on a consolidated basis will really be EnLink's capital.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Right. But that ultimately could be monetized through the MLP as you think about it going
forward. Is that fair?
<A - Vincent W. White>: That is fair. And we're spending about $400 million on completion of the expansion of the
Access Pipeline, and that's clearly a potential drop-down item.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Good morning.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Morning, Arun.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: I have a quick question just kind of clarifying the oil guidance for 2014. Is it 198,000 Boe per
day to 216,000 Boe per day just on oil, excluding Canada?
<A - John Richels>: That's oil including Canada, Arun.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: That's including or excluding Canada? Just wanted to clarify that.
<A - John Richels>: It's including Canada but exclusive of the barrels we're selling.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Selling, exactly that's what I wanted to clarify. [ph] I'm sorry (50:07).
<A - John Richels>: Yeah, there's some minor oil properties in the Canadian asset package. And that number we gave
you excludes those barrels.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Exactly.
<A - David A. Hager>: Excludes about 15,000 barrels that we're selling.
<A - Vincent W. White>: So that is the go-forward company.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: That's – thanks for clarifying that. And then, John, you mentioned 20% growth on top of that
for 2015 would be your expectation as we stand here today?
<A - John Richels>: Yes.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. Just wanted to clarify that.
<A - John Richels>: Yeah, thank you, Arun.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: The second point I just wanted to comment, John, you talked about obviously a lower CapEx
number for 2014 and you expect to see kind of 20% oil growth going forward. Do you expect to be able to do that
within cash flows on a go-forward basis?
<A - John Richels>: Yeah, absolutely. The position we put ourselves into, Arun, is with these steps that we've taken
over the past while is we've got a company now that we can grow or we can grow oil on a multi-year basis at about
20% even after we let gas decline because we're not investing in gas properties, or dry gas properties at this time, we'll
still see top line growth in the mid-single-digits on a six-to-one basis, probably around close to 10% on a 20-to-one
basis if you want to look at it more on an economic equivalency basis, and we can do that while living within cash
flow. So it really reflects the big step-up in margin that we've been able to accomplish. And the much more prospective
and efficient asset base that we have today going forward.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: That's helpful. And my last question is just – I don't know if Darryl Smette is on the line – I
know Flanagan South is expected to come online about the middle part of the year, just wondered if Darryl could
comment on expectations on heavy oil differentials going forward after Flanagan South comes online.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Certainly, Arun. I'd be happy to. As Dave mentioned in his comments and John also
mentioned it in his comments, over the last two and a half or three years we've had supply and demand be fairly well
balanced for oil coming out of Canada. When I use the term demand, I'm talking about refining capacity, rail capacity,
pipeline capacity. We are starting to see now a separation between that supply and demand as new refineries come
online or have debottlenecked and added more heavy oil to that. And we're also seeing increase in pipeline exports
coming out of Canada to the United States. One of those, as you mentioned, is Flanagan South. And Flanagan is just
outside of Chicago for those of you that don't know. It's a pipeline that will move about 600,000 barrels a day from
Chicago down to Cushing where it will interconnect with a couple of other pipelines and take oil to the Gulf Coast.

The reason that is very important for us is about 9 million barrels of refining capacity exists in the Gulf Coast, about
35% of that is for heavy oil. So it provides a excellent opportunity to move more heavy oil to the Gulf Coast market
and, therefore, we think as we go through the last part of this year, we actually think Flanagan South's going be on into
the third quarter, early fourth quarter, that we will start to see differentials become less volatile than they have been and
that those differentials will continue to narrow.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Hi. This is Vince. I want to correct something I said earlier. I said that we were going to
spend about $400 million in 2014 on the expansion of the Access Pipeline. That's actually our total Devon portion of
midstream expenditures and about three-fourths of that is the Access Pipeline.

Your next question comes from the line of Hsulin Peng from Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Good morning, everyone. So the first question is also a clarification question. I'm sorry if I missed
it but did you give out the production associated with the U.S. non-core asset sale that you are expecting this year in
your guidance numbers?
<A - John Richels>: It'll be in our detailed guidance and we did provide the production associated with the Canadian
reserves in a previously provided – oh, okay.
<A - David A. Hager>: I've got it here. So the production – I'll give you fourth quarter 2013 production. First, on the
Canadian conventional that we just divested, it was a total of 88,000 Boe per day consisting of 412 million cubic feet of
gas a day, 9,000 barrels of NGL a day and 10,000 barrels of oil a day. The remaining assets that we're looking at
divesting in the U.S., and again this could vary a little bit depending on what we actual sell, but our anticipated asset
sales would have production of around 57,000 Boe per day of which a little over 250 million or so would be gas, about
9,000 barrels of NGL a day and 4,000 barrels of oil a day.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay, got it.
<A - David A. Hager>: Did that get what you want?
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Yeah, that does, because that number is excluded from your going-forward, Devon going-forward
number, right?
<A - David A. Hager>: That's not in the new Devon or in the retained assets. When we talk about new Devon or
retained assets, that does not include that number.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay, got it. And in terms of the basis and also potential, can you just give us the – maybe the tax
basis for the assets in the U.S., just so, trying to understand the tax implication there potentially?
<A - John Richels>: In the U.S., our tax basis is fairly low. As you can see, that wasn't the case in Canada. We had a
very high basis and we were able to take advantage of several other opportunities to keep our taxes down to a very low
number coming out of Canada. Now, even though we have a low basis in the United States, these properties would be
available for a 1031 like-kind exchange if that's something that made any sense at the time.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay, yeah, no, that would be good. And then my two other questions, the first one is regarding
the Jackfish 3. So I think you mentioned that the first oil is expected in late 2014 so is it fair to assume – I guess I'm
trying to understand the ramp to the 35,000 barrels per day in 2015? How is that ramp shaped? Is it gradual, step
function? How should we think about it?
<A - John Richels>: The way that these heavy oil projects work, we're going to start steaming later on this year or in
the third quarter and it takes about a period of something like 16 months, 14 to 16 months to ramp-up, to get enough

heat in the ground, enough steam in the ground to really get that working. So – and that's a typical ramp-up, and so
when we talk about that ramp-up in oil production, anticipate starting to steam this fall. You start to see an increase, a
slight increase in oil production and then it continues to ramp-up all the way through 2015. And then from 2015
onward, it's pretty much running flat at 35,000 barrels a day.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay. [indiscernible] (57:57).
<A - David A. Hager>: Think of it as a steady ramp-up, not a step function.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay. But the full – the peak production is not expected until 2016?
<A - David A. Hager>: Probably late 2015 or early 2016, somewhere in there.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay, got it. And then in Miss-Woodford area, I thought the production growth was pretty good
quarter-over-quarter this quarter and you also mentioned that you exceeded your exit rate; I was wondering if you have
a new exit rate for 2014 [indiscernible] (58:29).
<A - David A. Hager>: We didn't catch the area. Was that the Miss you're talking about, Hsulin?
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Right. Miss-Woodford area.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, we had an exit rate around 16,000 Boe per day in December, averaged about 14,000
Boe per day for the quarter and exceeded our expectations of 15,000 Boe per day. We don't have an absolute exit rate
for 2014. We are optimistic it's going be somewhere, 20,000 barrels a day, 25,000 barrels a day. We're still doing a lot
of the appraisal work out there and so there's going be variability to the results, but probably somewhere in that order of
magnitude.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Okay. We've got a lot of questions, Hsulin.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Sorry.
<A - Vincent W. White>: We're going to move on with that to the last caller. No problem. Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Yes. Thanks for getting me in here guys. One quick question, I'm sorry to belabor this
guidance point but, John, you said that top line was going to be – I believe you said top line was going be 10% Boe
growth in 2014 and that you were going to update guidance over the year as you sold some of those U.S. assets. Did I
get that right?
<A - John Richels>: I think what we said is on a going-forward basis, multi-year basis, we grow the oil at somewhere
around 20% and top line on a 20-to-one basis somewhere around 10%.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Got it, got it. Okay. And then switching to your Eagle Ford, can you talk a bit about – I
know you haven't closed on the acquisition yet, but have you been able to engage with your partner there at all? And do
you have any kind of thoughts about how you might try to perhaps change how operations have been run there in the
last year?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, this is Dave. Yeah, we've been able to engage with BHP quite a bit. Of course, we
haven't closed on the transaction yet but we have had numerous meetings with them talking about how everything is
going and how we might be able to help out with the partnership. I think the one thing in particular that we're going to

really bring to the table is our ability to execute what you might want to call the machine, the ability to manage a large
number of rigs and then actually bring those wells on production in a very timely manner.
That's something we're very good at. We had 35 plus rigs running in Barnett at one point and we've been very active in
these unconventional plays for a long time. It's a core skill set and I think that's something that we're really going to
bring to the table. We're very impressed with the technical work they're doing. I'll tell you that. So we think we're going

Well, folks, like I'm showing we're a little past the top of the hour. But just before signing off, let me leave you with a
few key takeaways. First, we've taken bold steps in a relatively short period of time to high-grade our portfolio and
improve the growth trajectory of our go-forward business with our acquisition of the Eagle Ford, creation of EnLink,
and the divestiture of a Canadian conventional business as we've talked a lot about today. Devon emerges with a
formidable and balanced portfolio positioned to deliver oil production growth of around 35% in 2014 led by a 75%
increase in U.S. oil production. We're going to achieve this attractive growth while spending within operating cash
flow. And lastly, while there are many exciting changes occurring at Devon, our approach to business remains the
same. We will continue to pursue our top strategic objective and that is to maximize long-term growth in cash flow per
share after adjusting for debt.
So look forward to talking with you again at the next call, and thank you very much for joining us today.
