MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please
go ahead, sir.
Charles Triano
Thank you, operator.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2014 performance. I'm joined today in
New York by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide
Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer; Geno Germano, President
of Global Innovative Pharma; and John Young, President of Established Pharma; and Doug Lankler, General Counsel.

Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include
forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 annual report on Form
10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today.
We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. As we expect there will
be questions related to our proposal to AstraZeneca, and I would also note that there are limitations placed on our
responses by the U.K. takeover code, and as such, there will be some questions we are not in a position to answer at
this time.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone.
During my remarks this morning, we will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some observations
on how our strategy is progressing. Before discussing the quarter, I'll begin with a few words about the proposal we
made to AstraZeneca to combine our two companies and the rejection of our proposal by AstraZeneca's board.
The proposal we announced publicly last Friday represented a substantial premium of 32% for AstraZeneca
shareholders based on AstraZeneca's closing price of £37.82 on the day before speculation began regarding a potential
proposal, a 39% premium to the closing price of £35.86 on the day before our January proposal, and a 22% premium to
the unaffected all-time high closing price since the formation of the company in 1999.
This is an opportunity for AstraZeneca's shareholders to realize near-term value creation well in excess of its
standalone prospects as well as the opportunity to effectively trade up their AstraZeneca position for equity in a new
combined company with far greater potential for value creation.
Up to this point, we've only had access to publicly available information on AstraZeneca. Based on what we have
learned through that information, we believe our revised proposal is compelling and responds to what we've heard from
their shareholders. We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to engage in conversations and believe it is in the
best interests of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that we pursue a friendly negotiated
transaction that can be recommended by both our boards. We would like to engage with AstraZeneca to gain a better
understanding of their business and prospects. We believe they're an excellent strategic fit for Pfizer and they have a
strong and complementary alignment across and within our product portfolio research platform.
That said, we remain very confident in our go-forward strategy regardless of a combination. We see this as further
enhancing our strategy and consistent with creating shareholder value. Regardless of whether we complete this
transaction, the main pillars of our strategy remain in place, namely: focusing on innovation and advancing our
pipeline, maximizing the productivity and returns generated within our commercial businesses, and remaining good
stewards of our shareholders' capital. We believe that our formal proposal merits serious consideration. Given our
position of strength, we will remain disciplined as we move through this process.
Turning to our performance for the quarter, overall we continue to perform well in a challenging operating
environment. Our financial performance was in line with our expectations. Revenues for the quarter reflected the
continuing impact of product loss of exclusivity and the expiration of near or near-term termination of some
collaborations. A disproportionate amount of about one-third of the anticipated full-year impact was recorded in the
first quarter. If you exclude that impact, we had 1% operational growth. We saw growth from many of our key revenue

drivers including: Lyrica, Xalcori, Inlyta globally; Enbrel outside of the U.S. and Canada; recently launched products
Eliquis and Xeljanz in the U.S.; and from our collaboration with Mylan to market generic drugs in Japan.
I would point out that our business has historically demonstrated seasonality of revenues, and this quarter was no
different. In terms of product developments, we reported positive results from Prevnar 13 CAPiTA study in older
adults, and announced FDA approvals including supplementary new drug applications for Xeljanz to include
radiographic data in the label and for Eliquis for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, as well as FDA approval of
Nexium 24-hour for over-the-counter use for the treatment of frequent heart burn in adults 18 and over.
And there were several positive developments in our pipeline, including positive results from a randomized Phase II
study of palbociclib in combination with letrozole in first-line treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced
breast cancer; positive results from a randomized a Phase II study of bococizumab in a reduction of LDL cholesterol;
and a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for our meningitis B vaccine for the prevention of invasive
meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults.
For the full year revenue outlook, we anticipate key products will continue exhibiting growth and that operational
growth in emerging markets will be in the mid-single-digit range rather than in the 3% range we saw in this quarter.
Typically, our sequential annual product revenue pattern exhibits relative strength in the late quarters compared to our
first quarter. For the balance of 2014, we anticipate incremental revenue contributions from Eliquis, Xeljanz, Prevnar
13 Adult, Duavee and the expected launch of over the counter Nexium.
As you know, at the beginning of this year, we implemented the new commercial operating structure to position the
company for the future and to focus on maximizing growth. We have three global operating segments: Global
Innovative Pharma; Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare; and Global Established Product Pharma.
These segments are fully functioning and are increasing the focus of management and providing greater transparency to
shareholders, enhancing our ability to drive the business.
As we previously committed to you in today's earnings announcement, we provided the revenues and costs associated
with each of these operating segments. In a few minutes, the leaders of each segments, Geno Germano, Albert Bourla
and John Young, will provide you with additional context regarding the performance for their particular segment.
While we have moved to this new operating structure, our overall focus and priorities have not changed. We remain
focused on driving future value creation for shareholders by delivering innovative new products, maximizing the
potential of our existing products, remaining diligent in terms of capital allocation, and driving a culture that continues
to foster a strong ownership environment.
Reflecting on the state of our business, I am pleased with our pipeline progress. We are continuing to see the benefit of
decisions we took over three years ago when we decided to focus our research and development in the areas where we
have the most expertise and where the greatest unmet medical need exists.
Looking at the compounds we have across all stages of our pipeline, I can confidently say this part of our strategy is on
track and gaining momentum. Similarly, our past and current steadfast focus on the prudent management of our capital
is enhancing the overall competitiveness of our businesses. This quarter once again we operationally reduced our
adjusted costs of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expense in total.
We will continue to build on our solid track record of realizing benefits from cost reductions and productivity
initiatives, and as we have done in the past, we will use business development opportunities as an enabler of strategies
for creating shareholder value.
Overall, I believe we are performing well in a challenging operating environment. Our pipeline is advancing. We have
a strong track record when it comes to using capital to generate value, and we have an engaged and motivated work
force that has embraced the culture of ownership. Collectively these are the elements of strategy that are helping to
drive our overall business results.
Throughout this year you will see us taking action to execute on our plans to advance new therapies to patients,
strengthen our commercial businesses, manage our cost structure, and deploy our capital in ways that yield the greatest

value to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts we are reviewing today are included in our webcast. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone
that at the beginning of this year, we began operating under our new commercial structure consisting of three operating
segments: Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals, Global Vaccines Oncology and Consumer Healthcare, and Global
Established Pharmaceuticals. Consequently we are now reporting our quarterly and annual P&L in accordance with the
structure for all periods presented.
I also want to remind everyone that as a result of the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of
the animal health business are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of income from the
first quarter 2013.
Now let's move on to the financials. First quarter 2014 revenues of approximately $11.4 billion decreased 9%
year-over-year reflecting a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 6%,
driven mainly by the expiration on October 31, 2013, of the co-promotion term of the collaboration agreements for
Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, continued
erosion from branded Lipitor in the U.S. and most other developed markets, the loss of exclusivity and subsequent
multi-source generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S. and other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets.
These were partially offset by the strong operational growth of Lyrica, Xalcori and Inlyta globally, Enbrel outside of
the U.S. and Canada, Eliquis and Xeljanz, primarily in the U.S., the contribution from the collaboration to market
generic medicines in Japan with Mylan. In addition, reported revenues included $57 million from transitional
manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57 increased 12% primarily due to an aggregate operational decrease of 3% and adjusted
cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses primarily resulting from cost reduction and
productivity initiatives, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to our
ongoing share repurchase program and the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer.
Reported diluted EPS of $0.36 compared with $0.38 in the year-ago quarter was positively impacted by the
above-mentioned items and lower restructuring and asset impairment charges compared to the year-ago quarter.
Reported results were negatively impacted by the previously mentioned year-over-year decrease in revenues and the
non-recurrence of income from discontinued operations associated with our animal health business and the gain
associated with the transfer of certain product rights to Pfizer's JV with Hisun in China in the year-ago quarter. And
finally, higher legal charges compared with the year-ago quarter.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter revenues by 3% or $364 million and had a net positive impact of
$195 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses. As a
result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to the
year ago quarter.
Now moving on to our 2014 financial guidance, historically our business has demonstrated seasonality of revenues, and
this quarter is no different. That said, we are confirming all components of our adjusted 2014 financial guidance ranges,
and as such continue to expect our adjusted revenue to be in the range of $49.2 to $51.2 billion.
We expect that the continued momentum from our new products including Prevnar 13 adult, Xeljanz, Eliquis, Inlyta,
and Xalcori, the expected launch of over the counter Nexium, and the accelerating operational growth in emerging
markets will help to mitigate the impact of product LOEs and losses of alliance revenue.

It's important to note that our adjusted financial guidance continues to reflect a full-year contribution from Celebrex in
the U.S. If necessary, we will update our financial guidance when we are in a better position to make an informed
judgment about the market exclusivity of Celebrex in the U.S. from May 30th through the end of this year.
With respect to reported diluted EPS, due to the applicability of the U.K. takeover code to our proposed combination
with AstraZeneca, we are not currently permitted to confirm or update our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance, which
is our customary quarterly practice. Preparation of certain reports by our reporting accountants and financial advisors in
accordance with the U.K. takeover code are currently underway.
Because Pfizer recorded a number of charges during the first quarter 2014 relating primarily to the resolution of
litigation related matters, Pfizer's previously issued 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance is no longer valid. Updated
reported diluted EPS guidance will be provided as soon as practical.
As required by the U.K. takeover code, the Pfizer responsible officers including Ian, Doug Lankler, our General
Counselor and me, confirm that the adjusted financial guidance provided has been properly compiled based on the
same assumptions set out in the adjusted financial guidance issued on January 28, 2014, and prepared in accordance
with the accounting policies of Pfizer.
Now I'll turn it over to the business leads, Geno Germano, Albert Bourla and John Young for their respective
commentary on the results for the Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals, Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer
Healthcare, and Global Established Pharmaceuticals. Geno?
Geno J. Germano
Thanks, Frank. Hello, everyone.
The Global Innovative Pharma is our research driven biopharmaceutical business focused on developing and
commercializing innovative new medicines. Our current portfolio consists of newly launched products including
Eliquis and Xeljanz, key inline brands including Lyrica outside of Europe, and Enbrel outside of the United States and
Canada in addition to other products that we generally anticipate will maintain market exclusivity beyond 2015.
Our strategy involves making targeted investments to help grow our recently launched brands and other leading
medicines in order to generate sustainable revenue growth over time as well as making investments in R&D to support
our next wave of innovative products. So some of these near term investment objectives include: continuing to build on
our momentum with Eliquis among cardiologists focusing on its differentiated clinical profile; building on the efficacy
provide of Xeljanz in the United States through promotion of the data regarding inhibition of structural damage that's
now included in our labeling, and also our monotherapy indication; leveraging our strong presence in the women's
health category to launch Duavee in the United States as a potential new standard of care for moderate to severe
vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis; continuing
investment in direct-to-consumer advertising for Lyrica, Chantix and Viagra in the United States, plus investments in
growth markets such as Japan; and supporting ongoing Phase III clinical studies for bococizumab, ertuglaflozin and
Xeljanz.
Now moving to the first quarter results for the Global Innovative Pharma segment, in the first quarter, revenue declined
4% operationally versus first quarter 2013, and this was largely due to the expiration of the Enbrel co-promotion term
in the United States and Canada. Revenues were also negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in
Canada in February 2013 as well as some other smaller LOEs from prior periods. If we exclude the impact of Enbrel
and these LOEs, our underlying operational revenue growth was 10% driven primarily by continued growth of Xeljanz,
Eliquis, Enbrel outside of the United States and Canada and Lyrica outside of Europe.
Now I'd like to review selected financial highlights for the Global Innovative Pharma segment. As a reminder the
revenues and expenses presented are those that were directly attributable to the GIP segment. First quarter 2014 income
before taxes declined 5% operationally to $1.8 billion versus first quarter 2013. IBT as a percent of revenues on an
operational basis declined modestly to 57.4%. Increased investment in recently launched brands and key inline

products partially offset by benefits from cost reduction and productivity initiatives resulted in a 12% operational
increase in SI&A expenses compared to prior-year quarter.
Our first quarter 2014 R&D expense grew 29% operationally compared to last year as we initiated Phase III programs
for bococizumab and ertuglaflozin and continued investment in our extensive clinical development program for
potential new Xeljanz indications.
Additionally, IBT in the first quarter 2014 benefited from a significant increase in other income, primarily due to
trailing royalties earned on sales of Enbrel in the United States and Canada after October 31, 2013. On that date, the
co-promotion term of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in the United States and Canada expired, and we became
entitled to royalties for a 36-month period.
In conclusion, we're excited about the GIP portfolio and our pipeline. We believe our focused investment strategy this
year will drive sustained future revenue growth.
And now I'd like to turn it over to Albert Bourla to discuss the Global Vaccines, Oncology, and Consumer Healthcare
segment.
Albert Bourla
Thank you very much, Geno, and hello, everybody. VOC is comprised of three separate distinct businesses, Vaccines,
Oncology, and Consumer Healthcare, each poised for organic growth over time. We've had an eventful year so far, and
have achieved several significant milestones. First with vaccines, we presented positive results from Prevnar 13's
CAPiTA trial at a major conference, which clearly demonstrated that Prevnar 13 can prevent a significant portion of
pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia in adults aged 65 and older. Evidence from this study is important for
the population in which age-related decline of the immune system makes it difficult to prevent disease.
Hospitalizations due to pneumococcal pneumonia in adults represent a growing burden to public health systems. For
example, the annual cost of adult hospitalization in the U.S. alone is estimated at $8 billion. We look forward to further
discussing this data with regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees to help inform decisions regarding
Prevnar 13 label and recommendation updates.
Regarding ACIP, we have had productive interim discussions with the pneumococcal watching group. We are prepared
for a more formal ACIP presentation in June should the CDC confirm that topic in their agenda.
Second, in Vaccines again, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation of our vaccine for meningitis B, a
disease that is characterized by rapid onset with high rates of fatality. We intend to file a BLA with the FDA by
mid-2014.
Moving to Oncology, we presented positive results from palbociclib's PALOMA-1 trial at a major conference. We are
very pleased with the results, which highlight the potential for palbociclib to become a new standard of care for women
with ER-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. This is encouraging information for these women who
represent approximately 60% of the advanced breast cancer population.
We continue to have productive and ongoing discussions with the FDA about this data as well as the other necessary
supporting data for a new drug application. We continue to envision this potential pathway to filing an MDA based on
the PALOMA-1 data although no decision has been made. Once one has been made, we will communicate it publicly.
We also began dosing patients in two additional Phase III trials: one in recurrent advanced breast cancer and one in
early breast cancer and next we reported positive results for Xalcori compared to chemotherapy in the first-line setting
for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer.
Finally, with Consumer Healthcare, we received FDA approval for Nexium 24-hour for over-the-counter use. This
approval represents the first significant milestone in executing our Rx to OTC strategy. The U.S. launch is set for May
27.

We also continued to advance promising candidates to position the next wave of potential innovative launches,
including the C difficile and Staph Aureus vaccines as well as our SMO inhibitor for hematologic cancers.
Now let's go to the VOC first quarter results. For this quarter, VOC segment delivered revenues of $2.2 billion, which
represents an increase of 1% operationally versus Q1 2013. Please note that the revenues and expenses presented are
those that were directly attributable to the VOC segment.
Revenues for vaccines increased 2% operationally driven by the U.S., primarily reflecting government purchasing
patterns. Internationally, revenues were flat operationally with emerging markets growing at 14% rate driven primarily
by China and government purchases, but essentially offset by declines in the U.K. and Canada.
Oncology revenues increased 10% operationally due to growth from new products Xalcori and Inlyta, partially offset
primarily by changes in Sutent buying patterns in certain markets.
Consumer Healthcare revenues declined 3% operationally due to a soft cough/cold/flu season in the U.S. and Canada in
comparison with the same period last year, extreme winter weather negatively impacting retail traffic in the U.S. and
increased competition for Advil with the return of certain brands to the market.
However, it is important to note that as the year progresses we anticipate revenues to be positively impacted as more
healthcare providers appreciate the value of the Prevnar 13 adult indication. Of course, the full potential will depend
upon updated labels and recommendation decisions.
Additionally, we expect the revenues to be positively impacted by the launch of Nexium 24-hour and other consumer
products, the timing of certain national immunization programs and continued uptake of recently launched products in
Oncology, among other factors.
I would like now to walk you through a few additional highlights from the VOC segment finances, specifically
regarding our income and our direct [ph] managed (27:19) expenses. VOC segment income before taxes was $1.1
billion or 48.6% of our revenues. This represents an improvement of 2.8 percentage points operationally. Our gross
margin was $1.8 billion or 81.2% of revenue, an improvement of 0.8 percentage points compared to the year-ago
quarter due to a greater portion of this year coming from our Oncology and Vaccines businesses as well as further cost
efficiencies in manufacturing.
SI&A expenses were $531 million. This represents a 2% increase operationally, primarily due to pre-launch expenses
for Nexium. However, as a percentage of revenues, our asset SI&A spend has remained consistent year-over-year.
The VOC R&D expenses were $184 million, which represents an 18% decrease due to the completion of certain Phase
III trials which more than offset incremental costs related to the expansion of the palbociclib clinical development
program.
Thank you. And I will now hand it over to John Young, Group President of the Global Established Pharmaceutical
segment.
John Young
Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone.
Global Established Pharma, GEP, is a large and highly diverse business with unique opportunities across portfolios and
geographies. It's a significant cash generator and it's Pfizer's largest business.
For the first quarter of 2014, the GEP business accounted for just over half of Pfizer's total revenue, and about
two-thirds of Pfizer's total revenue from the emerging markets comes from GEP. Notably during the first quarter,
emerging markets comprised nearly 30% of GEP segment revenues.

Contrary to some perceptions of this business, traditional commodity generic products in developed markets are
actually a very small part of the GEP portfolio and account for only about 5% of GEP revenues.
We see our GEP strategic priorities as two-fold. One is to optimize the financial performance of the declining
components in the developed markets; and two, focus on the current and future areas of growth aimed at reversing the
decline trend of not optimizing the business margins over the mid to longer term.
Before I get into the details of the GEP performance at quarter one, I'd like to get a quick overview of the business and
how it's structured. GEP is comprised of three components that have different market dynamics. Two of these
components are in the developed markets. Firstly, Peri-LOE includes major brands that have recently lost or are
approaching the loss of exclusivity, such as Celebrex, Lyrica in Europe, Zyvox, PRISTIQ, and Detrol.
Secondly, legacy established products includes mature off-patent products such as Lipitor and Norvasc, and we also
have targeted opportunities that exist in this product grouping. We expect to see a decline in both of these areas due to
intense erosion from generic competition. However, we will continue to focus on growing the patented brands prior to
the loss of market exclusivity as well as to optimize the transition of brands to the off-patent stage and extend their life
beyond LOE.
A third component is the emerging markets including the BRIC MT markets. This includes all GEP products sold in
emerging countries and growth opportunities in emerging markets including the BRIC MTs. This component is
expected to grow steadily, driven by favorable macroeconomic and improving socioeconomic conditions in these
countries.
Growth opportunities represents a fourth dynamic of the GEP business and includes organic and inorganic initiatives
such as partnerships, product enhancements, and our biosimilars portfolio spanning both developed and emerging
markets. We anticipate these opportunities will drive revenue growth in our legacy EP, developed and emerging
markets portfolios over time.
Now let's go to the GEP first quarter results. For this quarter, GEP delivered revenues of $6 billion, which represented
10% decline operationally. The Peri-LOE products in developed markets experienced an overall decline of 17%
operationally due to the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-sourced generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S.
and for Viagra in most European markets as well as the termination of the co-promotion agreement for Aricept in Japan
and the decline in our share of revenues resulting from the wind down and termination of the Spiriva co-promotion
agreement for certain markets. However, it's important to note that certain patent protected products have shown
positive operational growth, including Lyrica in Europe, PRISTIQ in the U.S., and developed international markets as
well as Inspra in developed international markets.
Our legacy established products in developed markets experienced a 10% operational decline primarily due to the
continued share erosion by generic versions of Lipitor in the U.S. and most developed international markets.
The legacy emerging markets increased 1% operationally. Growth was negatively impacted by certain one-time issues,
and removing these, operational growth would have been 4% driven by higher BRIC MT markets.
The growth opportunities increased 10% operationally, driven primarily by contributions from the collaboration with
Mylan to market generic drugs in Japan and Quillivant XR sales in the U.S. This growth opportunities performance is
reflected in the previously mentioned operational results of the Legacy Established Products and emerging markets
components.
To provide one final metric for how we measure GEP's underlying performance, excluding aligned products, LOEs and
Lipitor in developed markets, the operational revenue decline in the first quarter 2014 for the remaining 92% of GEP's
portfolio was 2% as opposed to 10% for the segment overall.
I'll now walk you through a few additional highlights from GEP financials and will explain what is driving some of the
ratios and how I see them evolving. In terms of the ratios, I'll be speaking to our direct managed expenses relative to
our revenues. Income before taxes that is directly attributable to GEP was $4 billion in the first quarter 2014, or almost
68% of GEP's revenue. This represents an improvement of 1.7 percentage points on an operational basis. Our gross

margin was $5 billion or 83% of revenue. This is representative of the portfolio profile of the GEP business that is
mainly composed of post-LOE and peri-LOE brands with a smaller contribution from generics. As large brands lose
market exclusivity, this gross margin will come under pressure.
GEP SI&A expenses were $837 million in the quarter. This represents a 20% operational decrease and is primarily
driven by decreased sales force expenses in both developed and emerging markets as well as resource allocation
favoring higher growth opportunities within the emerging markets. This 20% reduction also reflects a favorable
one-time item this quarter related to administrative expenses. We will continue to make SI&A expense discipline a
focus of the management of our business.
The GEP R&D expenses for the quarter are 2.3% of revenue and represented a 23% operational decline. This is the
result of focused reductions in operational expenses, partially offset by higher spending for clinical trials associated
with the development of our biosimilars portfolio. Moving forward, we expect to increase investment in those assets
that have entered and will enter Phase III.
In summary, while GEP is expected to go through a period of revenue decline over the next few years, primarily due to
the LOEs of major brands in developed markets, we are focused on building our revenue base and stabilizing margins
over the mid to longer term. And following the period of anticipated LOEs, we expect revenue growth to return as our
growth opportunities become a more substantial piece of the GEP business in the future.
Thank you. And I'd now like to hand it back to Frank.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, John.
Now moving on to key takeaways. Our first quarter 2014 results were in line with our expectations that reflect the loss
of exclusivity of certain products, the expiration and near-term termination of certain collaboration agreements and a
continued challenging operating environment. We confirmed all components of our 2014 adjusted financial guidance,
which continues to reflect the full-year contribution of Celebrex in the U.S. We're now operating under our new
commercial structure and the presentation of our financial results for the new structure provides transparency into each
of our global segments.
With respect to our late-stage R&D pipeline, we achieved a statistically significant primary endpoint result in our
PALOMA-1 Phase II breast cancer study of palbociclib and began dosing patients for two Phase III breast cancer trials.
And we presented positive results of our CAPiTA trial which demonstrated that Prevnar 13 prevented a first episode of
vaccine type community acquired pneumonia in adults 65 years or older.
We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To date in 2014, we've repurchased $1.7
billion or approximately 54.3 million shares, and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock
this year. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.
Charles Triano
Thanks, Frank, and I want to thank the audience for listening. I know the prepared remarks were longer than typical,
but given it was the first quarter with the new financials for the segments, we wanted to give our business leaders some
time to walk through their segments in the financials.
We'll get ready for the Q&A session, and I think I would just reiterate once more, related to questions regarding
AstraZeneca, we will have the limitations placed on our responses by the U.K. takeover code.
With that, operator, if we could please poll for questions. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Good morning, Frank. Thanks for taking the question. If I can just throw one at you,
I'm sure you've gotten this in all kinds of one-on-one meetings, but it might be good to just address it again. The big
concern I guess about the AZ deal or proposed deal is that you guys obviously think there's something wrong with
Pfizer, if Pfizer wasn't able to acquire AstraZeneca, so I was just wondering Ian or Frank, if I could just get a general
reaction to that.
And number two, The Street as I understand it is currently modeling pretty dramatic revenue decreases for GEP as well
as more modest decreases for GIP over the long term. And I heard in the prepared remarks you talk about a return to
growth in GEP and I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit and help us out. I know you did a little
bit but I'd appreciate some more color if possibility.
And finally, an easy one for Frank, since you have 2013 segment information at least for the 1Q of 2013 in the press
release, is there any chance that those numbers could be audited such that that would be become year one? Thank you
very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mark, for your one question. I think we've gone out of our way to say that this – I see
this AZ deal as a way of accelerating an already good strategy. I think we have gone at pains in this release to point out
the exciting developments in our pipeline, the evolution of fixing any core, the way we have returned value to
shareholders. And so I definitely feel that we did this out of a position of strength.
In fact, we having approached AZ in December and having received a negative from them in confidential
conversations, decided to wait until we had results of palbociclib [palbo] and adult vaccine so that if we came back in
the market, it would be seen as we're coming back from a position of strength. So, you know, we will continue to
operate our business and continue to drive shareholder value and feel very confident about our stand-alone strategies.
I'll ask John to talk a little bit about GEP and I believe, as interesting enough in GIP, when you took out the loss of
exclusivity, loss of the deal with Amgen, and other smaller LOEs, it was 10% growth, which is a really good growth in
that area, solid in that area. John, with GEP?
<A - John Young>: Okay. So thanks for your question, Mark. So I think we have certainly in my prepared remarks
and in the meetings we've had with the analyst community, one of the things we've been very clear on is that we knew
in the short to medium term we will see pressure on revenues as we experienced losses of exclusivity from some of the
major brands in our portfolio that are either already post-LOE and are still coming under pressure so brands would
include Lipitor falling into that bucket or some of the major brands that we have in our portfolio that have yet to lose
exclusivity but will do so over the coming few months and years, so brands like Lyrica in EU, like Celebrex in the
U.S., like Zyvox, and so on. So to be clear, we certainly know that this is a business portfolio which will come under
revenue pressure in the short to medium term.
But in the medium to longer term, we certainly see our revenues plateauing and having the opportunity to return to
growth, and the underlying drivers for that opportunity that we see in the medium term would include our biosimilars
portfolio. We believe we're going to have a strong biosimilars portfolio of, we hope, ultimately five biosimilars that we
will aim to bring to market. Clearly the landscape for that type of portfolio and the regulatory environment is still
evolving, but where we have regulators that have clarified the regulatory pathway, we actually believe that is a very
positive opportunity for growth.

Additionally we see the opportunities for growth with this portfolio in some of the emerging markets including China
as an example, but not limited to China, remain very positive. Our China business continues to perform well, and
additionally, we see additional opportunities for growth with certain key partnerships such as Hisun in China and our
[ph] Toyota (42:58) partnership.
So when we put all of those things together, whilst in the short to medium term we certainly will see continued pressure
on revenues, in the medium to long term, we do believe that this business does have a number of underlying factors
which will enable us to return to growth in the medium to longer term. So hopefully that answers your question, Mark.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And, Mark, no change from what I said previously. 2014 year one, three years' prospective
audited financials, and I think the key here is to remember audited financials require more than an income statement.
They require a balance sheet, a cash flow statement, and other comprehensive income statement, and a shareholders'
equity statement. So no change from what I've said previously.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Frank. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
A – [05K22Q-E Frank D'Amelio]>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. Good morning, Ian and Frank and the rest of the team. I just had two
questions. First, with respect to Xeljanz, obviously the competitive landscape will evolve down the line but you've
talked about, driving greater uptake. Could you just comment on why you wouldn't consider discounting more to drive
greater share? Obviously the plans are using safety concerns to limit formulary adoption in an attractive Tier 2 status
position. But really, the plans obviously get tremendous rebates on Humira and Enbrel. I guess I'm just wondering how
we should think about the pricing strategy for Xeljanz and if pricing can be a greater lever to drive greater uptake?
And I guess just a follow-on to that is, since you've asked for just one question, can you just update us on the
once-a-day formulation development and filing timing? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, David. Geno, can you take those questions?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Obviously, Dave, we're keenly aware of the pricing and access and reimbursement
environment for Xeljanz and frankly in the whole class of biologics for RA, and have run all the scenarios. And frankly
at this point in time, we think the best thing to do is to continue to build on the positive profile that we're seeing with
Xeljanz, the data from our Phase III studies, from our long-term extension, now we have the structure data in our label,
we had positive outcomes from patient reported outcomes analyses, and we think that that will give us the strength that
we need, with physicians and with payers to continue to grow the business. We saw a nice increase from fourth quarter
of 2013 to the first quarter of this year with the 16% uptick in prescriptions, and we continue to gather momentum. So
we're feeling pretty good about that.
With regard to the once a day, we are putting the data together, and I believe we're planning to file next year.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.

understand the company here. So two questions, the first was if you actually split your business into three stand-alone

entities, can you quantify how much more operating expense or dis-synergies the company would incur? I think it
would just be a helpful data point as the Street looks to value your various business units.
My second question was just on managing the company in this business unit structure as it's been about four months
and maybe the business unit leaders could just talk about what they're finding in terms of the strategy and expense
structure of the business. I guess my question is should we think about either incremental cost cutting or updated
strategic priorities for one or more of these units over time as the new management teams kind of further review their
franchises, or is everybody pretty comfortable in terms of how the businesses are positioned today and how they're
being managed? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So, Chris, on this idea of three segments, I think I would sort of draw the market to the view that
there are actually two major segments inside the company. There is an innovative core, and there is an established
products and as we look to the future optionality, I would be more focused on that than looking at multiple, multiple
businesses with multiple dis-synergies.
So we don't really think there's any material dis-synergies if these businesses were to be stand alone or these two
segments, in fact we think that management focus overcomes those type of dis-synergies.
And on the – so getting at this stage, given we've taken so long with prepared remarks, I'm really just going to say I
think we feel that we have laid out to you by our opening comments the major strategies of these businesses and during
the year will be ample time, I think, for the business unit leaders to have conversations with you.
Frank do you want to add something to that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, just a couple of quick things on the first point, Ian, on the stand alone to respond to
Chris. Chris, we gave you all the detail we could relative to kind of the direct managed and then the allocated piece
with the big chunks of the allocated piece being research and development through POC [Proof of Concept], medical
and then corporate centers. So finance, IT, those kinds of functions.
In terms of hypothetically if they were separate companies, there'd be some incremental cost, right? There's one CFO in
the company today. They'd each need their own CFO and each need their own general counsel, so it'd be those kinds of
incremental costs. And then we didn't assign any of the interest expense or the interest income to the businesses either.
We left that out of the allocation. So there's some items clearly that would be incremental if they were to be standalone.
But to Ian's point, I don't think there is anything that would be really material to those being standalone.
<A - Charles Triano>: Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just a couple. On Prevnar 13, you had mentioned that the next ACIP meeting is in
June. What are the potential outcomes of that meeting? I would assume that the most realistic outcome given the results
of CAPiTA would be that the Prevnar 13 would be included in the 65 and older mandated vaccination schedule, if you
can confirm that?
And then just one other question or rather two other questions on the new business structure, Ian, how does the business
development process work in the context of the new structure? So if VOC wants to make an acquisition or GIP or GEP,
I may have gotten those wrong, wanted to make acquisitions, are they competing with each other for capital? How do
you assess which of the three groups, you know, get capital to make acquisitions?
And just finally, Frank, I noticed when you broke down the three businesses that there is a very large R&D expense,
$896 million, allocated under Other. How do we think about that Other business, and how do we allocate that across
the three businesses? Thank you.

<A - Ian C. Read>: So, Jami, thanks for the questions. I'm going to just answer the Prevnar 13 because I think we're –
as I say, we took a long time with our prepared remarks. They will consider in June. Normally the usual practice is for
ACIP to have two meetings, one to debate and then the second meeting they would vote on, they may decide to short
step that in June and both discuss and vote, but the normal pattern would be a discussion in June and then a vote in
October.
Albert, do you want to add anything to that? Is that fine?
<A - Albert Bourla>: That's fine. Just it's not unprecedented that they have done it.
<A - Ian C. Read>: It's not unprecedented and we'll know – we're working with them. The data was really good but
we're working with the agencies as hard as we can to get to them to see and get them excited about this data.
On BD, how it works is that there is a corporate cost of capital, and BD is run corporately. There's – in essence, each
business unit will have projects that they bring forward to the corporation. Competition for capital is not necessarily –
we're not necessarily limited in capital. There's competition for good ideas and best returns, and I think the most
important thing of this structure is that it puts the business leaders on the accountability side of the projects they want to
get funding for.
So I think it clears up and makes it very, very – it's good governance that inside the company now, a BU leader says, I
want to do this project, I stand by it and I'm a champion by it, and the accountability attaches, which I think brings a
great judgment and a great discipline to capital allocation.
Frank, you want to add anything to that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: No. I was going to answer Jami's third question on the – I don't have anything to add on the
Bus Dev line. Jami, I think the way – the best way for me to explain this is to point you to the certain pages of the
release and just quickly walk you through it if that's okay.
So if you go to chart number 18, you'll see up on the top, quarter ended March 30, 2014, and there's a column called
Other, and in that column called Other, there's an R&D expense line which amounts to $896 million, which is the
number you quoted. If you go to the next page and you go to the tables on the bottom, the one higher up on page 19,
you'll see the $896 million off to the right, the far right column, and then you'll see the breakdown of that between the
different organizations.
And then if you go to the next page, and you go to the table again but the bottom three numbers, you'll see in the last
number there, Research and Development Expenses and you see how we give percentage ranges to drive each of the
BUs.
So we try to provide drill down for you all so that you could see how we take the numbers and then how we drill them
down, and we gave you ranges of allocation to enable you to do that by business unit.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks. Very helpful, Frank. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I don't know what extent you'll be able to answer this
to, but obviously AstraZeneca in terms of its statements has pushed back around valuation, the mix of cash and equity
and also execution risks. Would you characterize conversations you've had with shareholders voicing similar concerns?
Or perhaps there's a slightly different reception as you go around asking about that.
And just another side question, just on GEP, I wonder if you can just break down the current R&D spend in terms of
what would be on newer projects such as biosimilars and what might be associated with sort of older base business
products? Thank you.

<A - Ian C. Read>: So on ANZ (sic) [AZN] (53:56) we listened to the shareholders, and we made what we thought
was a compelling offer, so – which fully valued AZ, and we're awaiting commentary back or further commentary back
from AZ.
On the R&D, we've given you quite a lot of statistics in the backup pages for you to allocate R&D. Perhaps, John, you
want give a couple comments on the main sort of R&D spending in GEP.
<A - John Young>: Yeah, well, we're obviously, as the precedent, we don't sort of go into detail on the sort of
breakdown of R&D expenses overall. I think what I mentioned, Jeff, in my sort of opening comments is that that
obviously includes operational expenses for the business unit as a whole and also includes the expenses for the
development of the biosimilars portfolio. And I think, you know, at this point, that's probably as much detail as I can
give.

Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much for the question. So first question for Frank, and then the second
question is actually on Prevnar 13.
Frank, can you talk about your cash and borrowing capacity and remind us what your current rating is and what the
difference in the borrowing costs might be from the current rating to a single step down in the rating?
And then separately, as we think about Prevnar 13 and the adult indication, obviously there's been quite a bit of
impressive data already accrued in terms of the herd immunity that we've already seen presented to the ACIP. And I'm
just wondering if you can help us understand that in terms of the evaluation of Prevnar 13, particularly in international
markets and the willingness for a national immunization programs to pay for the adult indication.
And then just a last question on Prevnar 13. The ACIP also reviewed a possibility of a three-dose schedule for Prevnar
13. Can you just update us quickly on how a three-dose schedule might actually evolve or if that's a very unlikely
situation or if the product is already being used mostly at a three-dose schedule? Thanks so much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So I'll ask Frank to answer the cash and borrowing and costs, and then we'll ask Albert to
take the Prevnar adult and the ACIP three-dose question.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Seamus, let me start with on the current ratings. With S&P – I'll do long-term ratings
first -- S&P, we're at AA; Moody's, we're A1; Fitch we're an A+. On the short-term ratings with S&P, we're at A1+;
with Moody's, we're a P1; with Fitch, we're an F1.
In terms of cash and borrowing capacity, at the end of last [audio gap] (56:51-57:03) dollars. Obviously, given that,
given our ratings, we have a significant amount of borrowing capacity.
And in terms of a change in rating, what would that do to our borrowing costs? Obviously you got to make assumptions
about notches, but I don't think there would be any material notch change. So whatever changes there were would not
be material. And quite frankly, if you look at the capital markets these days and investment grade paper, it's a very
favorable market.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Albert?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes. Let me start first with the herd effect and then I will speak about the dosing schedule.
While Prevnar 13 has led to substantial reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal disease, the residual disease burden
in the U.S. and globally is still significant. Even if it decayed after the introduction in the infant program, in the U.S.
alone there are 440,000 cases of non-bacterium pneumococcal pneumonia. They account for 300,000 hospitalizations,

100,000 emergency room visits and unfortunately 90,000 deaths. And globally, WHO has also similar estimations:
600,000 to 800,000 adult annual deaths due to streptococcal pneumonia, which is the leading cause of CAP
[Community Acquired Pneumonia]. And we need to understand that the scientific community and us of course do not
regard the herd effect as an alternative to direct vaccination. So in summary, we believe that free vaccination with
Prevnar 13 represents a compelling value proposition for healthcare systems around the world.
Moving now on the dosing schedule, first of all, we support the continued scientific exchange on the topic, but having
said that, we have a vaccine schedule in the U.S. that has demonstrated success, and we believe that this
clinically-proven, FDA-approved, CDC-recommended four-dose schedule is the optimal way to protect the U.S. infants
and young children from pneumococcal disease, and also we believe there are no data in the U.S. populations to make
decision to diverse from this four-dose schedule, that it is proven to be so successful.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert. And from my point of view and I think from society's point of view, the
Prevnar 13 vaccination schedule delivers considerable value, and we see that value to society in the overall treatment,
and don't necessarily really look at it as a per dose cost. It's more an overall value delivered by the protection.
Mikael, do you want to add a little bit about herd effect?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Sure. Albert has covered very well and I could just comment kind of one clinical aspect with
regard to Netherlands is that when we typed the serotypes from the pneumonia and IP cases which was possible by a
proprietary assay that we have developed, it was nicely shown that a significant fraction, about a quarter of the cases
refers to serotypes in the original Prevnar, the seven-valent, which clearly shows that although there has been
immunization, there is a residual serotypes remaining in the population and herd effect is not sufficient to protect.
And finally, I just want to add a medical aspect that with increasing age, you're more susceptible to severe outcomes
and increased fatalities caused by age underlining the importance that Albert alluded to get the campaign rather earlier
than later in adults for protection.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the question. Just first question is for Frank. When we look retrospectively at
the last big breakup that we had which was Abbott spinning off AbbVie, when we look back at that transaction, there
was some dilution that was associated with it. By our math the breakup of the two companies was about 15% dilutive in
retrospect to what the separate companies would have earned if they'd stayed as one. In this instance, you're breaking
up into three. What is the potential dilutive effect operationally and potentially from any tax leakage by breaking the
entity up into three different businesses?
Second question just for Ian, you indicated in your opening comments that once you had the palbo data and the Prevnar
data, that that positioned you at least from a position of strength to be able to go back to AZN. Is your assumption then
on palbo that you'll be able to file in 2014 and then launch in 2015? And are you assuming you're going to get a
universal vaccination recommendation on Prevnar going forward? And is that the position of strength that you're
coming at this from? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. On this whole issue of Abbott and AbbVie, we really can't comment on how they went
about restructuring, what expenses they incurred and what dilution they incurred. I do believe, though, just from
memory that I think if you took their value of the two separate companies after they did this and you stripped out
general market movement, they still created many billions of dollars of value. So I think that's a more important issue
than the dilution or the small incremental costs of the separate companies.
And by the way, you know, as I try to reemphasize, John, we're not talking about, you know – there's no decision been
taken regardless of separating these companies, and certainly, you know, we're not talking about a three or four-way

split. We're talking about two major segments just to emphasize that.
And on this question of yours on position of strength, I was not trying to assume any action on the part of the FDA or
the ACIP panel. I was just talking about the strength of the data and the data is compelling, and one would expect the
marketplace to follow the data. So thank you for the question.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. We'll move to the next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A couple of questions that are both merger related. What things do you
think that a merged Pfizer and Astra can do better than Astra alone? In other words, what do you see as potential
weaknesses of Astra stand-alone business either in terms of product mix or R&D abilities or geographic positioning or
anything else?
And then I want to go back to a question I asked on the call you guys did last week just to confirm or reconfirm Pfizer's
intentions assuming it acquires Astra. Is it again most likely that you would take the post-merger entity and eventually
split it up completely into separate publicly traded companies, because it's kind of a different story if the answer to that
is no. So I guess I'm just looking for some continued assurance here, not promises but rather what's most likely, or is
there something about inversion and redomiciling in the U.K. that would make a full split-up like that more difficult?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, so I think if you look from our point of view, if you look at AZ, and it's my view, not their
view, so I'm talking my view of their strategy, not their view of their strategy, that they have had a strategy of –
confronted with massive LOEs. They have gone out and they have licensed in and brought in lots of products from
other companies. In fact, most of their pipeline is licensed in-products with very few developed nationally. But, so we
look at that and we look at the fit with our portfolio, especially in the immuno-oncology area, where they have assets,
which standalone are probably coming late to the market. But if they were combined with our portfolio, I think it
strengthens their portfolio substantially.
And then when you look at their products, they fit into our categories. So we believe that with our marketing presence
and our ability in those categories, we can make more out of those products than they can standalone.
But the power of this deal for us is these three components. It's the fit on the portfolio, it's the nice fit with the early
pipeline, but it's not a pipeline story per se. It's also a removing of overlaps and making the organization more efficient.
And I do believe you will continue to see a trend in the industry towards as governments pressurize on access and
pricing, they're really telling the industry you need to get more efficient. You need to bring to market higher value
products at a lower cost. And there are ways – different ways of doing that. There's internal improvements in your
efficiencies, which Pfizer has done and been very effective at. There is assets swaps as you saw going on between GSK
and Novartis, which also gets to getting companies to remove overlaps. Or there is industry consolidation, which this
would be an example of that.
And then the third component of value here which is really important for Pfizer is this ability to free the balance sheet
up and get our tax rate down, which would enable a lot of different strategies and so all three of these elements are
important. You know, I've been asked, would you do it if you didn't have this part or you didn't have that part? I think
the answer is I'm doing it because I have all three parts. And it strengthens our strategy right now and creates, I believe,
compelling shareholder value.
I would say on your other question that we are interested in preserving optionality that we have set up. We would see
the integration of AstraZeneca with Pfizer along the way that we are organized. We would preserve that optionality.
We would focus on managing those businesses as efficiently as possible, and no decision has been taken about the
future as there's been no decision taken about our businesses at this moment in time. But we would conserve that
optionality.

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. A couple things. First, you mentioned last time on the call about palbo that you were
going to be meeting with the FDA. I just want know if that meeting actually had taken place if you have it scheduled
yet. I was a little unclear about your comments on palbo there.
Second, the meningitis B vaccine, when will we see the data?
And then, three, on biosimilars, can you just remind us of when will we start to see data from the studies there, these
pivotal Phase IIIs and filings start to occur? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Thank you. On palbo, it is scheduled. It is extremely imminent, and once we have had that
meeting and once we have any confirmation from the FDA, we will let you know. We're still in discussions with the
FDA.
On mening B, I don't know who is the best – Mikael, do you have the data? Or does...
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, I can just mention that we are in the process of sharing data at conferences. It includes
the experiences from our Phase I, Phase II and dosing schedules and also very encouraging data, strong data, on
combining mening B with vaccines that are used in these age groups, such as Gardasil or the typical adolescent
vaccines, different schedules in Europe and U.S. Hence, we will present soon as the European Society for Pediatric
Infectious Disease and later in the fall at corresponding U.S. presentations, too.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. John, biosimilars?
<A - John Young>: So I'll get back to you with some specifics on our plans for presentation of the data. I mean, just to
remind you, we have two of our portfolio, which are in Phase III. We have rituximab, which initiated Phase III or
initiates Phase III in the second half of this year. We have trastuzumab where Phase III has already been initiated. So
rituximab will go into Phase III in second half of the year; trastuzumab is already there. There will be some time before
we see the readout of those studies, but we'll get back to you separately in regard to your question about when we have
any plans to present any other of our Phase I data.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, thank you. And I would say internally, that Mikael is very satisfied with the profile that
we're exhibiting and the ability to say that it is biosimilar and we're very pleased with the science we've had and the
capabilities around this development area.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks. Can we move to the next question?

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you. I have three brief ones. First, why is early-stage R&D such a high percent of the
total? 56% of R&D is unallocated to any division, which seems high versus your peers.
Second, why is there still uncertainty around Celebrex U.S. sales from May 30 to the end of the year given the
settlement?
And then lastly, Ian, are you willing to give any assurances of limited R&D cuts in U.S. like you did in the U.K.?
Thank you.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Could we do – first of all, the – yeah, Frank, the early-stage and the allocation
algorithm there? And then Doug, will you answer the uncertainty?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So I think the best way to answer this, Steve, is the way we manage the organization,
which is all of the post-POC R&D spend is in the business units, the new operating segments. The pre-POC R&D
spend, so all the discovery, the research up and through inclusive of POC is in Mikael Dolsten's organization, WRD.
That's what you're seeing in the other column. That's really what's driving that. So that's why you get the split that we
currently have.
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: Yep, so on Celebrex, both Mylan and Actavis have sued the FDA having concluded that
FDA will give Teva 180 days exclusivity. They believe that unless the courts overseeing those suits rule in Mylan and
Actavis' favor and change FDA's ruling, that Teva is going to have exclusivity. We previously settled with Teva, and as
part of that settlement, the earliest date Teva can launch is December 2014, and their exclusivity would begin then.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Frank, do you want to add to that...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Just – and I should have mentioned partner lines, too: regulatory, toxicology, all those
kinds of things, Pharm/Sci are all in that other column as well.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So on your question about the integration of the two companies, I think we've made some public
commitments to the combined companies' presence in the U.K. and we clearly will stay with a massive presence in the
U.S. as a combined company.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. On the VOC unit, Albert you mentioned how these are
really three different businesses kind of blended into one. Can you just talk about that one specifically in terms of
synergies and overlaps you see that make it worthwhile to keep them all as one unit as opposed to being structured
maybe differently?
And then second, just all is on the Consumer side, you obviously highlighted the news around Nexium 24-hour. We
saw some disappointing news for Singulair potentially being an OTC product. Just given you've been generally bullish
on the Rx-to-OTC switch opportunity, how important do you see is to have a Consumer business internally to be able
to profit from that opportunity as opposed to maybe being able to do alliances with other companies that might have
consumer if you didn't have one yourself? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Vamil, thank you for the questions. The first question, remind me again, was on...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: The three separate units...
<A - Ian C. Read>: Oh, well, yeah, look, these units are independent global units that are run basically separately. I
think any type of – and Albert is a very experienced business leader and has three division heads reporting to him. Any
type of synergies between those businesses are more of the nature of managerial talent and leveraging strategies across
great leaders and not really addressed towards synergizing the operational infrastructure of those businesses. As they
are distinct, they are global, and they have their own culture and their own focus, which is part of the reason why we've
made them global businesses.
And on the other side, from the point of view of the corporation [indiscernible] (1:14:12) an important thing
[indiscernible] (1:14:14) we see as a great store of value. We've made acquisitions in that business, and the OTC
strategy is a component of the value. But, you know, we're not just managing that business only because we have an
OTC strategy. We see acquisitions as part of that strategy and switches and organic growth and the freshness index in

Your final question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Ian, at what point would you consider
going directly to AstraZeneca shareholders? You mentioned the premium that you're offering implies a disappointment
by the company's lack of engagement. And then on the pipeline and approaching AstraZeneca from a position of
strength, other than palbo and Prevnar 13 in adults, what are the other key assets that you believe may not be
adequately appreciated by the Street? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So we've made public our offer to the board. We are – remain considering all our options on how
we progress these discussions.
And, you know, I think on our – you're talking about our pipeline? I mean, I think you've got PCSK9 which is we will
arrive at the market, we expect, roughly the same time as the other major competitors in that with outcomes data. We
have palbo. We have all the trials around palbo, Prevnar 13 adult, we've got the meningitis B, we've got the SGLT2,
ertuglaflozin with Merck. We have the Xeljanz license extensions around that. Continuing growth in Eliquis,
continuing growth in Xeljanz, continuing growth in our Oncology portfolio and Inlyta and Xalcori, you know, some
very good fast following products in Oncology that can come to market given we think they are very differentiated.
So frankly, our opportunities abound inside our company both from the inline portfolio, the emerging markets
opportunities, the pipeline, recent launches, and to be launched and then if you look at the sort of – across both
Vaccines, Oncology, and GIP, a very nice portfolio of unique opportunities. So as I say, this is – we're doing this
because we see an opportunity to create additional value from this acquisition or combination, not because we feel any
negativity towards our present strategy, which we feel is very strong.
