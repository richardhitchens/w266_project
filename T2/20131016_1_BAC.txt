MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Bank of America Third Quarter Earnings Announcement. [Operator Instructions] Please
be advised today's program may be recorded.
It is now my pleasure to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. You may begin.
Lee McEntire
Good morning to those on the phone and joining us by webcast. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin
their comments, let me remind you that this presentation which is available on bankofamerica.com does contain some
forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results and that these statements
involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. Please see
our press release and SEC documents for further information.
So with that, let me turn it over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thanks, Lee. Good morning, everyone. I'll cover a few points and then I'll turn it over to Bruce to go through the details
of the quarter as we have done in another quarters. Consistent with prior quarters, our company continues to show
progress on the areas we've been focused upon; capital generation, managing risk, achieving cost savings, addressing
legacy issues, and driving our core growth strategies in our core lines of business.

On the capital front, this quarter we generated $3 billion plus of Basel 1 Tier 1 Common Capital. Our Basel 3 ratio has
now approached 10% on a fully phased-in basis. That capital and liquidity in the balance sheet optimization has been
going on for the last several quarters, puts us in good shape with regards to the regulatory suggested or proposed
requirements that we see on the horizon. The strength in capital is allowing us to return capital to shareholders. In the
past six months, we've repurchased 140 million shares, equaling about $2 billion of our $5 billion authorization.
Turning to the revenue side, we've experienced relative stability this quarter, but of course we felt the impacts of the
industry-wide headwinds on the slower refi business in mortgage and slowdown in the capital markets from a typical
summer slowdown as well as the investor concerns of a political and monetary uncertainty.
On expenses, this quarter we incurred additional litigation costs. Outside of that we continue to make progress on our
expense initiatives, remaining on track to deliver the cost savings that we told you about two years ago in New BAC
and also reducing the cost in our legacy assets and servicing area.
In the credit area, we continue to see asset quality improve and our net loss rates are at levels not seen since 2005. As
the macro environment slowly improves, we experienced a 20% drop in net charge-offs and decline in delinquencies
from the second quarter.
Our 248,000 teammates have been fully engaged with our customers and clients to drive activity. We're pleased to see
another quarter of solid loan growth in our commercial businesses, while we continue to see the consumer lending
activities stabilize in our card balances and modest growth elsewhere, which has offset the runoff in our non-core
portfolios.
As a company, we reached record deposit levels this quarter, more than $1.1 trillion in deposits. Our client balance
flows and our wealth management clients helped us maintain our industry leading positions. And you've seen the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch assume prominent roles in the marquee investment banking deals that have gone on this
quarter. We've also seen a nice trend of progress absent some seasonality of results in our equity trading business. It has
been gaining market share and continuing to improve.
So to sum it up, it's another solid quarter of progress in our core businesses, and I'm going to turn it over to Bruce to
cover in detail the presentation. Bruce?
Bruce R. Thompson
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my presentation on slide 5. During the quarter, we
earned $2.5 billion or $0.20 per diluted share. Before I address the core business trends, let me mention a few
noteworthy items from our results that we've disclosed to you previously. First, we sold our remaining stake in CCB,
recording a pre-tax gain of $753 million, which was partially offset by a $443 million, negative impact of FBO and
DVA as our credit spreads continued to tighten during the quarter. The net of these items benefited EPS by $0.02 in the
quarter. We also recorded a $1.1 billion charge to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax asset given the 3% decline in the tax
rate, which reduced EPS by $0.10 a share. The net of these is obviously a reduction of $0.08.
Moving to the core business, total revenues in the quarter on an FTE basis were solid at $21.7 billion or $22.2 billion if
we exclude the FBO and DVA charges. We compare this to the second quarter, revenues declined on lower mortgage
banking revenue as well as mostly seasonal declines within our sales and trading area. Total non-interest expense of
$16.4 billion included $1.1 billion in litigation costs, a $600 million increase in litigation costs from second quarter
levels. The increase in these costs was partially offset by the improvement in both our legacy assets and servicing costs
as well as the benefits of our New BAC initiatives. Asset quality improved significantly, with net charge-offs
improving 20% from the second quarter of 2013 to $1.7 billion. And with the reserve reductions we took in the quarter,
we recorded provision expense of just under $300 million in the quarter.
On slide 6, you can see that our period-end balance sheet remained relatively stable versus the prior quarter at about
$2.13 billion. Customer activity remains solid with loans largely led by commercial loans up $12.8 billion. Consumer
lending activity in the quarter improved as we saw increased loan generation in our Dealer Financial Services area and

our continued stabilization of card balances, which was partially offset by the runoff within our home equity portfolio.
Period-end deposits were up over $29 billion or 2.7% led by commercial client activity and solid flows from our wealth
management clients. If we move down the page, tangible book value per share improved to $13.62, and our tangible
common equity ratio increased above 7%.
A couple of other things that I'd like to mention during the quarter, we repurchased 60 million shares for roughly $900
million during the quarter, OCI increased by about $900 million during the quarter, and our preferred stock includes the
completion of our previously announced preferred stock redemption for just under $1 billion.
On slide 7, you can see our Basel 1 Tier 1 common ratio of 11.08% increased 25 basis points from the second quarter
of 2013. Under Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis, under the advanced approach, Tier 1 common capital increased by
approximately $6 billion to an estimated $131.8 billion. Our Tier 1 common ratio is 9.94% showing a 34 basis point
improvement from the second quarter of 2013. In our estimate of the Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio on a fully phased-in
basis under the standardized approach would be just over 9% above our proposed 8.5% 2019 minimum requirement.
If we move to the supplemental leverage ratio based on the proposed U.S. requirements that don't take effect until
2018. At the end of the third quarter, our Bank Holding Company leverage ratio improved to above the proposed
minimum of 5% and our two primary banking subsidiaries, BANA and FIA continue to be in excess of the 6%
proposed minimum. So to reiterate what Brian mentioned, there are a lot of new capital regulations proposed or
finalized, and we already exceed the requirements for the various known rules on Basel 3 capital and the supplementary
leverage ratio.
On slide 8, funding and liquidity, you can see our long-term debt ended the quarter $7 billion lower as the maturities
and the completion of our $5 billion tender offer outpaced issuances. We have $40 billion of parent company maturities
through 2014, and as we look forward, we expect issuances to be materially below that number as we continue to
reduce and smooth the maturity profile of our debt footprint.
Global excess liquidity sources of $359 billion increased from $342 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2013 and
parent company liquidity remains strong at $95 billion. That translates into a time to require funding of 35 months well
above our two-year coverage that we target. I would also like to highlight that on October 1st of this year we've
completed the legal entity merger of the Merrill Lynch holding company into Bank of America Corporation as part of
our continued efforts to both simplify the company and reduce cost.
We turn to slide 9, net interest income. Net interest income on a reported basis was $10.5 billion, down from the second
quarter of $13 billion as the improvement in our core net interest income was more than offset by negative impact from
market-related impacts. If we exclude those market-related impacts, net interest income built off of Q2 2013's $10.4
billion to be just north of $10.5 billion. During the quarter, we benefited from higher rates in our discretionary book,
lower long-term debt levels, higher commercial loans and lower rates paid on deposits. These positives were partially
mitigated by lower loan yields and lower trading-related NII.
As you'll note on the slide, the net interest yield excluding market-related impacts improved from 2.36% to 2.44%
driven by the lower balance sheet levels as well as our lower funding costs. And consistent with what we mentioned
last quarter, we expect to realize the benefit of higher long-term rates as we reinvest but note that some of those
benefits will occur through time.
On slide 10, we'll spend a few minutes on expenses. Total expenses for the quarter were $16.4 billion, a $1.1 billion
improvement from the year-ago quarter but up $371 million from the second quarter of this year.
I want to be clear as you look at expenses and see that the uptick in the linked-quarter expense, we continue to deliver
on our non-litigation expense reductions in our legacy assets and servicing area as well as the ongoing benefits from
our New BAC initiatives in the balance of the company. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, progress on LAS and
New BAC in addition to lower revenue related incentive compensation was more than offset by increased costs of
litigation as well as some marketing initiatives that were accelerated from the fourth quarter of 2013. Our litigation
expenses did increase as the continued evaluation of legacy exposures led to an addition to reserves. Our LAS expenses

ex-litigation, which are shown on the gray bar on slide 10, of $2.2 billion, declined $110 million from the second
quarter of 2013, and we continue to expect our fourth quarter LAS expenses ex-litigation to be below $2 billion as we
continue to make very good progress on reducing the number of 60-plus day delinquents that we have in that business.
Our New BAC savings in the third quarter were approximately $100 million and are included in All Other, the red bar.
We also remain on track to achieve the expected $1.5 billion of New BAC quarterly cost benefits by the end of 2013
and ultimately the $2 billion quarterly benefit upon completion of the project.
From an employees staffing perspective, our number of FTEs ended the quarter at 248,000, a decline of more than
9,000 or 3.6% from the second quarter of 2013. And that was driven by staff reductions within our legacy assets and
servicing area, declines in home loans given the slowdown in mortgage production as well as the continued
optimization of our branch network.
And while we were down by 3.6% from the end of the second quarter to the end of the third quarter, the average FTEs
only declined 2.3%. So, we'll get some additional benefits during the fourth quarter relative to the third from those
reductions.
We touched on asset quality, slide 11. You can see that credit quality once again improved significantly. Net
charge-offs declined to $1.7 billion, a 20% improvement on a linked-quarter basis. As Brian referenced, our third
quarter of 2013 loss rate of 73 basis points declined 21 basis points from the second quarter and is now at 2005 levels.
Delinquencies, a leading indicator of charge-offs, again declined nicely. During the quarter, we did reduce reserves by
$1.4 billion on the back of steadily improving consumer data, which resulted in a provision expense of just under $300
million.
Given what we see from the improving delinquencies, as well as the current HPI trends, absent any unexpected changes
in the economy, we expect net charge-offs to decline again in the fourth quarter and stabilize sometime in 2014 at
approximately $1.5 billion per quarter.
Let's move into the individual lines of business on slide 12. Our Consumer and Business Banking segment, we were
very pleased with the results during the third quarter as we delivered improved earnings with revenues growing
modestly and expenses declining from both the previous quarter as well as the year-ago quarter. This, coupled with
lower credit costs within the segment, resulted in net income of approximately $1.8 billion during the quarter, a 28%
improvement over the previous quarter and a 32% improvement over last year. That was achieved as we continue to do
more business with our core customers. Our average deposits were stable as our organic customer growth was offset by
some small branch divestitures as well as migrations to our Global Wealth and Investment Management area. Our
brokerage assets are at record levels within this business, up 6% from the second quarter and up 18% over the
prior-year's quarter.
Average loans, as I mentioned, reflect stability in card balances as well as growth within our Dealer Financial Services
area. Card issuance during the quarter remained strong. We issued more than 1 million new cards in the third quarter,
which is at the highest level going back to 2008. Consistent with our relationship strategy, 63% of this issuance was to
people that we have existing relationships with. And credit quality continues to be strong as delinquencies and net
losses continued to improve during the quarter. Reduced expense levels in the segment reflect the benefits of our
network optimization partially offset by investments we continue to make as we build out our specialist sales force in
this area.
On slide 13, commercial real estate services where we operate the production, origination, and servicing of consumer
real estate loans. In our supplemental information, we report the two separate components of this segment, one focused
on loan origination and the other focused on servicing and legacy issues.
On originations this quarter, first mortgage retail originations were $22.6 billion, which was down 11% from the prior
quarter and up 11% compared with originations in the year-ago period. We believe that the current period decline in
production is less than our industry peers as we have been working through our existing pipeline. Our current pipeline
at the end of the third quarter is, however, down approximately 60% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2013,
which reflects the significant reduction in market demand particularly in the refinancing space.

Since our production revenue is booked at the point in which you lock a loan as opposed to funding, I should point out
that our lock volume was down 23% from the second quarter of 2013. In addition to those lower lock volumes, we saw
gain on sale margins decline compared to the second quarter of 2013. Our reduction was about 60 basis points during
the quarter. As a result of all these factors, core production revenue was down 46% to $465 million from the second
quarter of 2013.
From a staffing point of view just on the origination side, as we saw demand slow, we reduced head count by more than
1,000 employees towards the end of the quarter. We will continue to reduce these staffing levels to be consistent with
the lower volumes that we've seen. The other primary component in this segment, servicing revenue declined
approximately $100 million versus the second quarter as our servicing portfolio declined as we continue to complete
certain servicing transfers.
The other item that I want to highlight on this slide that's particularly important is the servicing cost that we see within
the legacy assets and servicing area. We've spoken a lot about reducing the number of 60-plus day delinquencies in this
portfolio, and we had a lot of success during the quarter as the number of 60-plus day delinquent loans dropped below
400,000 units at the end of September, nearly 100,000 units lower than what we had at the end of June. Roughly half of
the decline was driven by the transfers of servicing that I referenced in conjunction with the MSR sales agreements that
we announced in the first quarter of 2013. And once again, as a result of this work, we continue to believe that our LAS
expenses ex-litigation will be below $2 billion during the fourth quarter of 2013.
On slide 14, our Global Wealth and Investment Management area had another strong quarter, generating solid earnings
and solid returns. Within this segment both Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust maintain their leadership positions with a
total of $2.3 trillion of client balances. Revenue remains near record highs at $4.4 billion, up 8% over the third quarter
of 2012.
Relative to the third quarter of 2012, net income improved 26% and was the third consecutive quarter in which our
pre-tax margin was above 25%. Asset-management fees achieved the new record during the quarter while our
brokerage income did decline from the second quarter due to reduced market activity. Client engagement remains quite
strong, long-term AUM flows were $10.3 billion, near doubling last year's production. Ending deposits were up $6.5
billion or roughly 3% from the prior quarter and our ending client loan balances of $117.2 billion reached record levels
and are up 2% from the second quarter of 2013 and 11% over the third quarter of a year ago as we continue to provide
more banking products to both our Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust clients.
On slide 15, you can see Global Banking earnings were stable relative to the year-ago period. Revenue compared to
year-ago includes the benefit of strong loan growth and stable investment banking fees. Expenses this quarter include
very good cost controls, offset slightly by elevated litigation expense. Global fee pools did decline, but we maintained
our strong second place ranking of global net investment banking fees, recording $1.3 billion of fees and improving our
market share to 7.7%. In addition, if you look at fees within the Americas, we ranked number one with an 11% market
share.
During 2013, we have advised on seven of the top 15 announced M&A deals. As we head into the last quarter of the
year, the pipeline looks quite strong, but I do want to highlight that during the fourth quarter of last year, we did see
record levels of debt issuance during that period. If we look at the balance sheet, average loans increased $4.4 billion
from the second quarter with more than half of that growth driven by commercial real estate lending with the balance
by C&I lending particularly with our large corporate clients. Average deposits increased $12.2 billion from the second
quarter of 2013, above our expectations given certain timing considerations as well as customer liquidity that's been
built around fiscal cliff concerns.
We move to slide 16, Global Markets. We earned $531 million during the quarter after excluding the $1.1 billion U.K.
tax charge as well as DVA losses of $291 million. On a comparable basis, this is a decrease of $341 million compared
to the third quarter of 2012, and down $403 million from the second quarter of 2013 due to lower sales and trading
revenue as well as higher expense from litigation. Sales and trading revenue ex-DVA was $3 billion during the quarter
and 8% decline from the comparable year-ago period.

FICC sales and trading revenue was down 20% versus the year-ago period, once again impacted by concerns regarding
the Fed's position on its stimulus program as well as political uncertainty both domestically and abroad. Our equity
sales in trading area had another very strong quarter with revenues ex-DVA of 36% over the year-ago period as we
experienced higher market volumes and continue to benefit from the repositioning of this business that's happened over
the last 18 months. We're gaining market share and we're improving our performance in each of the product lines.
Expenses in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2012 concluded higher litigation costs that were partially offset
by a reduction in operating expenses. Average trading-related assets were down 4% from a year-ago period while our
VaR was effectively flat.
On slide 17, we show you the results of All Other. Gains on the sale of debt securities were $347 million in the third
quarter, down $105 million from the second quarter of 2013. You can also see the breakout of $1.1 billion of equity
investment income, which reflects the CCB gains that I mentioned earlier as well as an additional $368 million of
gains. The FBO that I mentioned earlier is also recorded in this segment. Expenses include roughly $350 million during
this quarter for litigation. That compares to $100 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $950 million in the third
quarter of 2012.
As we close on All Other, I would note that the effective tax rate for the quarter ex the impact of the U.K. tax reduction
charge was 25%. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect the effective rate to be in the high
20%s.
Before we take questions, I'd like to leave you with several thoughts about our results. Capital and liquidity both
strengthened during the quarter. We had encouraging business results as we saw improvement in both activity and
profitability within Consumer and Business Banking. We saw continued strength in Global Wealth and Management.
We maintained our top position in investment banking and had another quarter of strong growth in our equity sales and
trading business. Credit continued to improve. Our cost initiative work remains on track. And to the extent that the
steepened yield curve environment stays with us, it should allow us to move NII upward as we move forward. We will
continue to execute on our strategy and continue to deliver on the earnings power of the company.
And with that, we will go ahead and open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. In addition, the slides have got a good breakdown of the, you know, the
rep and warrant reserving. Could you talk a little bit above the litigation? And how to think about the litigation costs as
we go forward, because that's obviously still volatile? Maybe discuss what's still remaining that that could get, you
know, kind of roped into that as we go forward?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think, Moshe, what I'd say is that if you look as we referenced it was roughly $1.6 billion
a year ago. It was $500 million in the second quarter, and it was roughly $1 billion this quarter. I go back to and I think
we've been pretty consistent, if you go back to 2010 and look at the build over the course of four years from both the
litigation and rep and warrant perspective, I think you can see that that we've had more of that over the course of a
3.5-year period than anyone else out there. And as we look at the remaining pipeline, we put it in really four different
buckets. The first is the GSE bucket for rep and warrant, which with one exception we've got global settlements from
the end of 2008 back with Freddie and Fannie. So as we look at that bucket, we feel very good about that. We then go
to the second bucket, which is monolines. We've got global settlements with three of the five monolines, and we've
established the reserves for the remaining two based on that history of the three.
We then go to the rep and warrant with respect to the private-label securities, the $8.5 billion Gibbs & Bruns case,
which represents half of the exposure, continues to go through the core process and they'll be back in court on that I

believe in November. And obviously we set up reserves at that point based on the Gibbs & Bruns history. And as we've
said before, for that which we didn't have the basis to establish a reserve, we put out our range of possible loss for rep
and warrant that continues to be up to $4 billion.
And then you move into the other pieces that we have, that's the RMBS securities litigation. During the quarter the
Luther Maine settlement received preliminary approval during the quarter. And we'll look to get final approval by that
sometime during the fourth quarter. And we obviously set up a reserve, and that settlement was for $500 million, which
represents in the ZIP Code of 65% to 70% of the company-wide exposure that we had for RMBS litigation.
And then the other two pieces that we continue to work through in that bucket are the FHFA litigation on behalf of
Freddie and Fannie as well as AIG, and there's really nothing to report new on either of those fronts. And what you
saw, you know, during the quarter as we said was really an adjustment to the reserves based on as we get more
information and to the extent that there are additional discussions with some of the people that were in a party with
those discussions still.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: I guess just a follow up on that, because JPMorgan had indicated that they had expenses
in this quarter that were substantially higher than what they would have anticipated as possible even three months ago
because of the change in the regulatory environment. Do you feel like you've taken that fully into account?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think, let me be a little bit more specific when we go back to because I think the
one thing that's been overlooked a little bit, and this is not a number we're particularly pleased with, but if you go back
to the beginning of 2010 and look at the combined litigation and rep and warrant expense that we've had in this
company, it's been over $40 billion which I think is quite a bit higher than the number that they quoted. Obviously
those numbers are particular to each institution, but I think as you look at what we've tried to do, that those numbers
have been significant and I think at this point relative to our peers, we've tried to be out front and get through some of
the larger settlements that we have, and we think that $40 billion plus number reflects that.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: And just shifting gears on the mortgage business, you had a decline in rate locks that you
identified but the pipeline actually is down substantially more. Just talk a little bit about how you see the fourth quarter
and into 2014 because you've got both the potential for obviously a further decline as that pipeline kind of moves
through but then again you also had a fairly high rep and warrant in the quarter, like how should we think about that
from a revenue perspective?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Let's talk about the production first. You remember that we had a lot of HAMP going on
and that's been dropping each quarter as we sort of get through the volumes of that and that had a pretty good impact. I
think it was down roughly $3.5 billion or so linked-quarter. The rest of the production continues to move forward but if
you look at what's really going on as we speak because during the third quarter, you had significant changes in July,
August, as we ran through the pipeline, et cetera. The current pipeline stands at a level 30,000 odd. The current
application volumes today are 1,000 plus, around 1,000. The purchase fee for that is rate maintained relatively constant,
300-ish day. So if you think about that, we have sort of a month and a half pipeline, and that's been pretty consistent as
we got into September and to October. So, if you kind of extrapolate that out, you should see production levels that will
be down again in the fourth quarter but will start to mitigate.
The issue on the revenues; the spreads have come in and the refinancing volume is at a higher profit margin because the
work is not as much, and so we expect to see a lot like we're seeing now, spreads and they have come in a couple
hundred basis points or so, and we expect that to hold and the volumes have come down, and so I think the number will
continue to work in that direction.
What you do mention is the other side which is there's a sort of rep and warrant exposure and stuff that goes through
there and stuff that changes, and Bruce can touch on that but in terms of overall volumes, we'll start taking the people
down to match the volumes. You remember we have a lot of work to do here, and if you look at our non-HAMP
production, it's continued to grow each quarter. Our home equity loan production has doubled in the last few quarters,
and we'll continue to drive that forward. As we've told you many times, it will never be a huge business for this
company because it's a business, which is very competitive out there, and the profit margins will always be thin but we

need to do it for our customers and clients.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: And on the rep and warrant front, you're right. The rep and warrant expense was just over
$300 million a quarter, and we clearly would expect that the run rate of that expense is going to be much more in the
$150 million a quarter type run rate as opposed to the $300 plus.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. And the very last one from me is, you'd mentioned expected improvement in
charge-offs, the provision obviously was substantially low. How should we think about the provision relative to those
charge-offs in Q4 and into 2014?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I think, once again our comments will be assuming that we don't see any slippage in
the economy. During the quarter if you look at the reserve release, roughly 250 million of it was from purchased
credit-impaired and roughly $1.150 billion from the core. As we go forward, I would think about the provision – excuse
me – think about the reserve release much more consistent with what you saw in the first and second quarters of this
year over the next couple quarters and then ultimately as we get into the latter part of 2014 and beyond, you'd expect
most of that to go away, but I do think that there are probably another couple quarters where it could be in line with
what we saw in the first and second quarter. Clearly not at the third quarter of this year given the sharp improvement in
credit we saw.

We'll now go to the site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Morning, Betsy.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Just one follow up on the conversation that we just had regarding the reps and warranties and
litigation. So, I heard you that the monoline three out of five are done. You established reserves for the other two based
on the three out of five. Is that part of the rep and warranty this quarter, establishing reserves for the other two based on
the three out of five done?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, it is not.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then on the litigation reserve, I mean we've seen obviously a long list of stuff in
your queue, so is it fair to say that litigation reserve was just all of the above of that long list or was there, you know,
something specific that you saw in the quarter that drove the higher number? I'm just wondering, do we do the $1
billion quarterly in our model going forward or is it going to be more episodic than that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we've said, that number tends to be lumpy, and I wouldn't say that there was any
one specific item during the quarter that you could point to. It was really just a continued evaluation of the reserves as
well as reflective of any current discussions that we're having with the different parties that we're trying to work
through this with.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then on the LAS expenses, you indicated that next quarter sub-$2 billion.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And so you highlighted that your delinquents are down half from the asset sales and
half from your own actions?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So is it fair to say that the reduction of roughly $300 million or so, well $200 million to $300
million or so, that you're calling out for next quarter is also equally half and half? And part of the question is trying to
understand, you know the run rate of how those expenses are coming out associated with the asset sale, and I'm
wondering, is that front-end loaded in 4Q? Is that going to be 4Q through 2Q next year? And are the organic actions
you're taking likely to be equal in size in terms of the decline in the LAS expenses?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I think and I would say a couple things on that, Betsy, that once again we told you at
the end of the second quarter that we would get the number of 60-plus day units down below 375,000 units by the end
of the year, and you can see during the third quarter alone, we got them down below 400,000. So we feel particularly
good with that guidance. There's a lot of work that goes on in the quarter to move out and to get these servicing
transfers done as it relates to both our own teammates as well as people that we use to help us with that. So that's why
you saw some of the numbers Q2 to Q3 a little bit sticky.
But the point that you raise, I think is the right one which is now that you've got the loans out, you have the ability to
take the expense out and that's why we'd expect the expense reduction in the fourth quarter to be greater than what
we've seen in the third quarter. And I think as you look out at and as you look through 2014, the guidance that we've
given is very – really remains the same and you can feel more comfortable with given the delinquencies that as you go
through 2014 you should see that expense number go from below $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 to below $1
billion by the end of 2014. And it always can be a little bit lumpy but you should see that occur generally consistently
throughout the year.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Thanks. And then lastly on page 7 you highlight the regulatory capital. Obviously it
seems like you set yourself up well for a bigger ask in CCAR from a buyback perspective. Is that a fair assumption to
make? And could you highlight how SLR factors into that? And are your SLR numbers that you present fully loaded in
3Q or is it on a phased-in approach?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yep. Our SLR numbers are fully loaded at both the bank holding company as well at the
subs. And as we look at CCAR, what I would say is I think we've been consistent on this that we've done it and done
everything we can both in the way intrinsically, the way we run the company, which in many respects is not
inconsistent with what you get tested in CCAR net. We built our Basel 1.5 ratio up significantly from last year. The
Basel 3 ratios across the board are up. As you look at both credit risk and market risk, those have obviously gotten
better. And we've continued to put the legacy issues behind us. So as we look at, we obviously, we're able to return $5
billion to the common shareholders during this year as part of the CCAR process. And we'll look to move forward from
that, realizing that until we see the exact case that we're running and what the test is, I think it's probably premature to
say anything more than that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

And will next go to the site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Bruce, I was just wondering on the net interest income side,
do you think that the core NII should kind of grind higher, at a similar pace that we saw this quarter? It looks like it was
up $100 million assuming no big change in rates?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that's fair, John. And there is – you are always a little bit subject to mix loan
pricing as well as rate environment, but that's clearly the trajectory that we're on. So, the answer would be yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And how should we think about the market-sensitive component? Do you still have
the NII hedges on? Or is it really the FAS 91 that adds volatility from here?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think it's important, and the one thing that doesn't come out when you look at this
slide is, it's not that we saw much variability in either FAS 91 or hedging effectiveness during the third quarter. It was

that we had some benefits in the second quarter when you had the sharp increase in rates. So as long as you're within a
reasonable range where rates aren't bouncing around, you shouldn't see much of that. But keep in mind that what you
saw on the first and second quarters was because of the largely unprecedented movement up in rates that we saw that
gave us the FAS 91 benefit.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And over time does that FAS 91 effect dissipate over time? Or is that always going to
be with you?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It gets reset so that you don't have any aberration from quarter-to-quarter. And the only
time you have an aberration on a run rate basis is when the underlying rates move.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay and then any update on your rate sensitivity relative to where you stood at the
end of last quarter for 100 basis point move in [ph] loan (45:17) rates?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think, I want to think we're in the same ZIP code both on a 100 basis points
steepening as well as 100 basis points parallel shift. And the guidance that we've given once, it takes us about three
years to earn back any impact in OCI. And we're a touch better than that this quarter. And if you look at the
supplemental, you'll see that the level of debt securities is down modestly, as we're very sensitive to managing that OCI
risk.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just a follow up on litigation expense, back in July you were thinking
perhaps $500 million per quarter and clearly it came in much higher than at this quarter. I recognize things are fluid
here, but should we be thinking of litigation expense more like this quarter or more like last? Are you able to say?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, John, that's really difficult to say. I think that the punch line is, is that it can be
lumpy. And we obviously do and work hard each quarter to the extent that we can get things put behind us at
reasonable levels for the shareholders. We do that. It is an evolving process, and it's something that we're working hard
on. At the same time there's no question that the expense was elevated this quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay and then one more clarification on the core expenses, how much did the
expenses come down for mortgage so far? And what you see left on that? And then just any comment on the IB comp
ratio, and how we should think about that going forward?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I'm not sure I understand your question on the mortgage expense...
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah, any capacity reduction that you're doing as originations come down, have you
gotten the benefit from that? And how much might we expect for you to do that going forward?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So, as we referenced on the front end, so on the legacy piece, we talked about the $2.3
billion going to $2.2 billion and how we'll have that below $2 billion. As we talked about, we needed to get through the
pipeline on the front-end during the third quarter, which we did. The 1,000 people that we referenced on the front-end
happened late in the quarter. And as I mentioned, we're going to continue to reduce that to, to size that for the volumes
that we're seeing now, but we've not put out a specific number on that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and in terms of IB comp, what we saw this quarter and how we should think
about that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, we typically – if you look at combined investment banking in sales and trading, you
tend to be in the mid-to-high 30s. And I don't think you're going to see any significant variations in that Q3 to Q4.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, one thing on both in the mortgage and otherwise, as Bruce talked about, the actions
that we've taken during the quarter to reduce head count overall in the company, a lot of it is in the second half of the
quarter, so you always get a continuing on effect of that and by the way next quarter as we reduce further LAS and
mortgage, you'll see it go in the first quarter. So, it does lag, and it's just the nature of the severance accruals you take at
the time plus as we move the head count out, sort of paying them on as you go on the severance also in certain cases.

And we'll next go to the site of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: A question on FICC. I think the explanation on the down 20% is fair enough and a lot of
macro and political reasons which I get. Just curious on if you had any early comments on swaps execution and
clearing impact in the quarter, and what you see going forward as clients migrate?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I think I wouldn't really note any specific change there, Glenn. It's something that
we continue to look at. The one thing I'd say that, that we are working hard on and this really flips more to some of the
capital in central clearing type things that as we continue to have more and more of that migrated that is going to
benefit certainly the capital ratios as we look at counterparty. So, I think that the ongoing – if there's, to the extent that
there's an economic negative going forward, we're obviously continuing to spend a lot of time with that. But the one
piece that is a little bit more tangible that we worked through is that there will be some decent benefits over the course
of 12 to 18 months as more and more of that gets migrated.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's okay. As you think about the markets business, one of the things that Tom and the
team have done is got the – we've talked about various quarters, he's kept the breakeven point relatively low. So, in a
quarter, which the equities business was very good for us comparatively, but the Fixed Income business which is a lot
bigger than the equity business was obviously down, we still made a $0.5 billion and so the goal here is to be able to
serve our clients and customers while keep the balance sheet in good shape and also keep the expense base so that
when we get $2.5 billion to $3 billion, we start making some decent money and then in the good quarters, we'll make a
good of amount of money and Tom and the team have done a good job to keep that expense base in line. And mostly
expense increase is with litigation and things that were non- fundamental to show up in this line of business related to
the broader question.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I appreciate that. I might be putting words in your mouth, but it sounds like there's pretty good
operating leverage built in on the upside then. In other words, it doesn't necessary scale up and down with revenues to
the same degree.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, if you just look across the last four quarters, you'll see it, but the key was going
from 2011 to 2012. We moved the fundamental levels so there's good operating leverage to get another billion in
revenues, a lot of it comes through net of an incremental compensation here.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. One other question just on cards, it looks like issuance and balances have been grown
good. I'm just curious how much of that is you turning up the heat on marketing, selling through the branches and how
you feel about the outlook because it's been a while since we saw the industry in general have decent balance growth.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I think a couple things in there, it just kind of reiterate a little bit we touched on is
that we've made over the course of the last 12 to 18 months the investments of having more bankers in the branches and
trying to do more things with our customers. And the two things that we feel best about as you look at that growth in
cards to over 1 million cards in the quarter is that the first is that 63% of those people once again we already have an
existing relationship with and obviously know something about and are trying to do more with.
And the second thing I'd say is that as you look at the overall FICO and credit quality of those borrowers, they tend to
be in the mid-700s on average. So, it's the right customer. It's sold the right way and it's part of an overall deepening

strategy. And now that we're starting to see some of the balances creep up, it's reflective of that activity, which I think
quite frankly was overshadowed a little bit as we cleaned out some of the affinity and other programs that the new stuff
that you saw got overshadowed by things that were legally in the books but now that we're largely through that, what
we're doing on the front-end is starting to come out.

And we will next go to the site of Derek De Vries with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Great. I just have a detailed question on the OCI. There was $1.4 billion gain I think from
pension – changes in pension. Can you just explain what that was about?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. What happens is that typically you mark your pension OCI once a year as you
update the asset values and assumptions at year-end. You typically do that on an annual basis. Because we merged
several pension plans at the end of August, we were required to remeasure those assets as of the end of August and that
$1.4 billion reflects the change in value from January 1 to August 31, and then obviously we'll remeasure those again at
year-end.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: That's great. Thanks. And then just talking more generally, I mean you obviously have a lot
of corporate relationships, and I guess there's some unease about what's going on in Washington, but assuming we can
get through that, do you get the sense of the corporate you're looking to kind of move from margin preservation to
investment? Or are they just really worried about the macro environment? I'm trying to get a sense of loan growth
going forward.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you look at our client base which ranges from small businesses through the
largest companies in the world, I'd say all of them feel very good about their operating position or making money, have
done a tremendous job of keeping the cost structure in line. I had an example of a company that had 200 employees
whose sales are going to grow by 25% and they said, we're only going to add five employees. So, the American
business has gotten very efficient but when you put on top of them the uncertainties because we're all engaged in global
commerce, the macro uncertainties at the world level, the U.S. level, I think there has been an uncertainty in the whole
back here that will come through as more and more clarity both in economy, i.e., final demand for the products and the
macro situation comes clearer.
And so is a sprint out of the blocks? No, they're running forward and it would probably be a speed up of the process
and you saw some of that this summer with some of the M&A activity and stuff in the larger companies has
strengthened and you're seeing it go on. So, I think there's a demand in the system so to speak. There's money on the
sidelines from the investor side and the more clarity, you'll see better activity. Meanwhile, underneath it, you see the
core economy continue to push forward even with all the things going on around the world.

$100 million on the comp line but head count's down 25,000 employees, capital markets revenues are down. Why are
we seeing that still elevated and how do we see that go down more significantly going forward?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. We have a couple things going on. The first thing I'd say is that the expense number
during the third quarter of last year, and I'm going to speak to it if you flip to slide 10 for a moment, that if you look at

that comp or the All Other bucket which is I think what you're referring to, that $13 billion in the third quarter last year
was particularly low. If you look at where it was in the fourth quarter, it was at $13.4 billion. So that can bounce around
by a couple hundred million dollars. So realized, it was off a low base. You did see a couple of things though in the
third quarter of this year that you wouldn't have had.
The first is that the Wealth Management revenues, which there's a fair bit of formulaic compensation, are running at as
I mentioned at higher levels in 2013 than 2012. So, you have some compensation there. The second thing that you had
this quarter as Brian referenced is we took down head count. We had roughly $100 million of severance that came
through the P&L during the quarter. The third thing that you had during the quarter as I referenced is you had some
elevated marketing expense that will go down in the fourth quarter that you also didn't have in the third quarter. So, a
combination of a variety of items, but I think what we'd say is that as you look to go forward, you should see that red
bar come down based on our overall expense initiatives as well as New BAC.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And remember also that when we give you these reduction numbers, we're not giving you
a reduction and saying, but then we're going elsewhere. This is the net number that you pointed out. So all the
investments we're making in the third quarter last year with third quarter of this year, you'll see the mortgage
production cost go up, which will come back down. But all the investment we made in, sales people that do the cards
that we've talked about earlier, small business lending, investment services that you can see at the branch level, you can
see the numbers growing there.
All those are in those numbers, so all those investments are more commercial bankers that are helping our commercial
loan growth, and yet we're overcoming them. And then you have the natural salary increases and stuff like that are all
absorbed in that and you have to nominal numbers are flat and frankly if you back out a couple things that Bruce just
mentioned are down, and so we're comfortable on course for New BAC. But remember these numbers are absorbing all
the usual cost that we do plus the investments in business, which we're making strong investments in the areas we've
growth opportunity.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Now that's helpful on the severance and I guess I would assume that we would see some
less of that going forward given the significant reductions in mortgage this quarter right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Matt, how are you?
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Just as we think about the overall size of the balance sheet, you mentioned managing the
securities book with OCI risk in mind and obviously the securities that come down as you mentioned this quarter while
the loans are growing. How do we think about the net impact of those two, I guess, looking out the next several
quarters?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: As far as just notional side of the balance sheet?
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Yeah, and I'm really focused on the loans plus the securities because obviously liquidity
levels can vary quarter-to-quarter and the trading book can vary quarter-to-quarter so just I mean loans are growing
nicely but is being offset by securities coming down, so I'm really just focused on those two components.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think at this point, what I would expect is that generally speaking, the securities
book should remain relatively consistent with where it is and then if you look at the loan book, I would say that you're
going to see that the loan book as well as the shrinkage of the debt footprint will be absorbed through deposit growth as
well as a reduction to some extent in our parent company liquidity as we're carrying an elevated level of parent
company liquidity to address the significant debt maturities in 2014. And the net of those which I thought you're getting
to initially is that you should continue to see this balance sheet in the 2.125 to 2.15-type area but as we go forward, we
should continue to get it to be more and more efficient.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I think one thing that we haven't – we don't – haven't talked about in a while is we
still have significant run off portfolios that we're replacing – we still have – which gives us the ability to grow the core
business without growing the balance sheet footings, and I think that's something will help us in our capital levels that
are already very strong today going forward because effectively we don't need the incremental capital to grow the
balance sheet even to have commercial loan growth and other types of growth that you're talking about.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Great. So flattish balance sheet, but optimizing the capital usage and then obviously the
NIM probably benefiting from the remix there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, and by the way everything that's on the NIM is still – the short rate move drives a lot
of profit, because the deposit franchise is an advantage to have funding source as you well know.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And then just separately, circling back on the kind of core expenses of $13.1 billion, I guess
its $13 billion ex the severance, and there is some of the mortgage staff reductions, still some New BAC coming in and
then maybe some investments. I mean, where is that on the revenue base that you have right now, where is that $13.1
billion go to if you just fully loaded all the stuff that you can see?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the best guidance that we give at this point is we've got roughly $600 million a
quarter in New BAC to get done over the next 5 to 6 quarters.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And that's a net number. So to think about it 12.4, 12.5?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, but then you've got to remember, you've got to add back some of the LAS costs [ph]
and subtract in (62:19) there, but there is always – LAS is a servicing business, always will have some costs
[indiscernible] (62:25).
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Yeah, I guess I was just breaking the – you've got the litigation which is the moving target.
You've got the LAS, which you've been pretty explicit and then everything else is the 13.1 that...
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, that – sometimes people take that lower number and multiply it times 4, but you've
got to remember those – parts of those others costs will also be in there.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I just wanted to clarify the New BAC benefits. So how much of New BAC have you
achieved?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Roughly $1.4 billion a quarter, Mike, relative $2 billion a quarter that we have previously
announced.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And originally I thought you're looking for mid-2015, so when you say $600 million more that's
what you mean when you say over six or so quarters?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And just to clarify the last answer, so you expect all that to hit the bottom line or some of that
will be offset by investments in salespeople and other investments?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think what we said was at the current run rate level you should be expecting that to hit
the bottom line.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Switching back to the legal questions, you said you had taken over $40 billion of charges.
What is your legal reserve as of the end of the third quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We do not put out a litigation reserve on a stand-alone basis. The number that we do put
out is where we are, in rep and warrant, and that was just over $14 billion at the end of the third quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: $14 billion rep and warranty?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct. $14.1 billion.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And would that include anything other than the $8.5 billion settlement?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, it includes another $5.5 billion for a variety of matters.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So for the Gibbs & Bruns settlement, you have an $8.5 billion reserve for that settlement? I
think I asked this on some other earnings calls, but if that agreement was not approved by the judge, what's the
potential range for that $8.5 billion reserve?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As we've said before, we would need to look at that based on the circumstances that come
out at the time, and I don't think it's a foregone conclusion it goes one way or the other.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Switching gears, in terms of loan growth, what's the loan utilization level? And what are
you seeing as far as acceleration or deceleration in loan growth?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would say that we really haven't, and one of the things that we've tried to do and will
continue to optimize particularly the way that the Basel 3 standardized ratio works that focus more and more in for
those places where we make credit commitments to have the loans be funded as opposed to unfunded given the capital
treatment that's out there. So, I would say generally as you look at line utilizations, there hasn't been much that's
changed at all – where you're seeing the loan growth has been more funded type loan growth, in many cases for large
high-quality companies that are making acquisitions, a couple that we would've seen this quarter would've been
Verizon Wireless as well as Amgen.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Mike, overall, Mike, the loan utilization rates, they haven't moved around a lot, but they
are at low levels historically across the board whether it's our business banking segment, the middle-market segment,
and the large corporates not – don't really use their lines other than, as Bruce described, when they're doing something
inorganic. But they're very low which gives you two things. One it indicates that they've got lots of cash and have lots
of room for investments but secondly, as the economy picks up, moving back the 1,000 basis points or so we are from,
sort of, more normal levels, for lack of a better term, is a lot of loan growth within – without new customer
relationships or any more work.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I understand you're picking and choosing your spots more. So would you say that demand really
hasn't changed a whole lot over the past year or two? Or is it picking up in certain areas?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think demand has picked up over the last couple of years. I think that the company had a
line of credit in their dynamics, they're using it at a lower level than they did, not necessarily two years ago, but during
the normal economic times and that's the second point. But demand has been picking up across, consumer demand and
things like that, but it's still not as strong as it would be because it's a 2% growth rate economy out there.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Thank you.

And we will take our final questions from the site of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. I just have a few cleanup sort of questions. With respect to the long-term
debt footprint then, have you talked about how much of the $40 billion that is coming due that you would expect to refi
or are you going to let it all just go?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It won't all just go, but I think it's safe to assume that less than half of it will be
refinanced.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. On the last question you were asked about the litigation
reserve, which understandably you don't want to go there, but do you have an estimate of what your reasonable and
possible beyond the litigation reserve will be this quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I believe, Guy, that at the end of the second quarter, I believe that we'd said that the
range of possible loss with respect to litigation was in the high 2s, and we'll obviously need to freshen that up as we get
the third quarter Q out, but I wouldn't expect to see anything significant one way or the other.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And the $1.1 billion litigation expense and I guess reserve billed this quarter, can you
give us a sense of how it breaks down by business unit? Because it didn't seem like it all goes to All Other?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, if you look at by business unit, I referenced that as you flow through that you had,
and you can see it in the commercial real estate service area, it was over $300 million of it there. There was roughly
$300 million of it between banking and markets, and then the majority – the rest of it was in All Other.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. That's helpful. And you mentioned that you had accelerated some marketing
initiatives from the fourth quarter to the third. And I was just wondering if you could give us a little color on
specifically what they were, since everybody is looking for growth?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I think the only two things is that you've obviously seen a little bit more brand that's
out there. And then with CCB, there was the acceleration of what we do from a charitable perspective from the fourth
to the third. Those were the two items.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And then the very final question is you had a meaningful improvement in your Basel
3 capital above and beyond the earnings, and it looks like it's a pretty meaningful reduction in the threshold and other
deductions. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more granularity on what's going on there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, it's a great question, and really two things going on. Keep in mind, as we've said
because we have a decent chunk of disallowed DTA from a Basel perspective, that ballpark we will accrete capital on a
pre-tax basis generally speaking as opposed to a post-tax basis for a decent number of quarters going forward. So, when
you look at that, I think pre-tax not so much post- tax. And then the second benefit that you had, which was an earlier
question, was the benefit of OCI during the quarter of roughly $1 billion after-tax or $1.5 billion pre-tax, and that was

the combination of the pension to the positive and then to the negative CCB coming out as well as some of the debt
securities gains.
