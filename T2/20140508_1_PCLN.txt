Okay. Thank you very much. Welcome to The Priceline Group's first quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us
before the market opens this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline's Group CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $12.3 billion, up 34%
year-over-year or about 35% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $416 million, up 40%
year-over-year, and earnings per share was $7.81, up 36% versus prior year, surpassing consensus estimates at $6.93
per share and our guidance for the quarter. Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 83.4 million room
nights in the quarter, up 32% year-over-year.
Booking.com continues to extend its lead as the world's largest brand for booking accommodations and continues to
increase its year-over-year share of rooms booked in every region it operates in. Booking.com's platform now has over
455,000 hotels and other accommodations in 200 countries, up 54% over last year. This reflects not only our continued
aggressive push in directly bookable non-hotel accommodations, but also the still attractive worldwide opportunity to
acquire traditional hotel properties.
Agoda.com delivered strong transactional growth in the quarter, and we are confident that both the agoda.com and
Booking.com are gaining share across the Asia-Pacific region. High growth rates in these new markets continued to
contribute to higher overall Group growth as they become an increasing share of our worldwide business.
Priceline.com posted solid 20% growth in gross bookings with strong results in both air and rental cars. priceline.com's
hotel results when combined with Booking.com's success in North America reflect hotel market share gains. The
priceline.com team also made good progress reworking much of the plumbing that will allow it to improve all aspects
of the site with real-time experimentation and to test taking its strong brand and hotel offering abroad with
multi-currency capabilities.
Rentalcars.com's year is off to a good start with its transition from a completely semi-opaque offering to a mixed retail
offering behind it. rentalcars.com customers will now see reviews and have more transparency on the quality of the
services they are booking. Results were strong as the team continues to build share in international markets and
successfully executes its mobile strategy.
KAYAK delivered impressive profitability in the quarter and early indications from its targeted expansion in Europe
are encouraging. I am really pleased with Steve's teams on-boarding into the Group and the methodical work they do
every day to build a wonderful customer experience and sustainable business model for the future.
Mobile continues to be a key focus for all the Group companies as we continue to see mobile bookings growth far
exceed our desktop growth for all of our brands. Mobile transactions are of course important, but the emerging mobile
and multiscreen lifestyle is also transforming our customers' experience with our companies, offering us opportunities
to engage with them throughout their travel. This is, of course, driving more bookings and new booking patterns, but
more importantly, deeper engagement with our company's brands.
The Group performed well in the first quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Operating leverage stemmed from the
beneficial impact of the KAYAK acquisition. Our outlook calls for pressure on operating margins in Q2 as we'll
anniversary that acquisition later this month. We'll continue Booking.com's successful foray into offline advertising in
certain international markets and invest aggressively in online variable channels to profitability build our book of
business for the third quarter.
We remain committed to making the smart investments in people, infrastructure, marketing, supply and innovation that
will allow us to pursue possible long-term growth from a position of strength and extend our lead as the world's leading
online travel business. I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering
a strong start to the year for their brands and for the Group.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review.

Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide
guidance for the second quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year
comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom line perspective. Room nights booked grew by 32% in the first quarter,
decelerating compared with the unit growth rate of 37% achieved in Q4. Growth rates were solid across all our key
regions and we believe that we again grew our market share in Q1. Average daily rates, or ADRs, for Q1 2014 were up
on a local currency basis by about 3% for the consolidated Group.
Rental car days booked were up by 25% for Q1, decelerating compared to 32% growth in Q4. The growth is a blend of
strong performance for retail reservations for rentalcars.com and priceline.com, partly offset by a decrease in Name
Your Own Price rental car days for priceline.com.
For the first quarter compared to the prior year, the FX rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar was favorable by about 4%.
However, the dollar strengthened significantly against many other currencies including those of Australia, Brazil,
Turkey, Thailand, Argentina, and Indonesia. As a result, currency exchange rates had an overall slightly negative
impact on our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars.
Our Q1 gross bookings grew by 34% compared to prior year. Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 37% in
U.S. dollars and by about 38% on a local currency basis. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the
U.S. grew by 20%. Performance was strong across retail air, rental car and hotel verticals, including the benefit from
increased advertising placements within KAYAK.
Hotel Express Deals also performed well, but our Name Your Own Price hotel, air and car services were all down
year-over-year due to limited availability of discounted rates and share shift to Express Deals. I remind you that Name
Your Own Price impacts merchant gross bookings and disproportionately impacts merchant revenues since we record
Name Your Own Price revenues on a gross basis, while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 37% as compared to prior year. The inclusion of KAYAK in our
results contributed about seven percentage points of inorganic gross profit growth for the quarter. KAYAK revenue
amounted to $69 million in Q1, net of intra-company activity.
Our International operations generated gross profit of $1.21 billion, which constituted an increase of 35% as compared
to the prior year and 37% on a local currency basis. Gross profit for our U.S. business, including KAYAK, amounted to
$201 million, which represented 50% growth versus prior year, excluding the impact of travel transaction tax charges
recorded in Q1 2013 that we discussed last year.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 35.6% of gross profit for Q1, which was 50 bps better than last year.
Operating margins were impacted by 111 bps of deleverage in offline advertising, mainly related to our Booking.com
TV campaigns and the inclusion of KAYAK offline advertising. Other OpEx also reflects some deleverage as we
continue to invest in people, offices and IT-related expenses to support our business growth.
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit was 200 bps better than prior year. The year-over-year
improvement in this metric included the inclusion of KAYAK, because KAYAK spends relatively less on online
advertising as a percentage of gross profit and spending by our other brands for ad placements on KAYAK is
eliminated from our consolidated results. We expect KAYAK to benefit our consolidated online ad efficiency until we
anniversary the acquisition on May 21.
Operating margins came in 340 bps better than assumed in our guidance forecast due to gross profit over-performance,
better than assumed ad efficiency, and lower than forecasted other operating expenses. The favorable ad efficiency
results from better than forecasted online ad ROIs, favorable mix of direct business, and shifting some offline
advertising spend to Q2 and beyond. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $513 million, which exceeded the top end
of our guidance range of $450 million and represents 39% growth versus prior year.
KAYAK had a nicely profitable quarter and contributed to our bottom line beat. Since KAYAK earns much of its
revenues as clicks are generated, rather than travel consumed, Q1 is a relatively more profitable quarter from a seasonal

perspective for KAYAK than it is for our overall business. KAYAK's contribution to our gross profit and EBITDA
growth rate will be less impactful after we lap the acquisition in May.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 40% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 36%, reflecting the impact of a higher fully diluted
share count. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $177 million of cash from operations during first
quarter 2014, which was about 3% lower than last year. We prepaid income taxes of $346 million in the quarter for
Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount. We made a similar prepayment last year in the amount of
$224 million. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year, and so subsequent quarters of the
year will have a lower payment burden as a result. We spent about $30 million on CapEx, and we repaid about $58
million of our 2015 convertible notes upon early conversion by their holders. We also returned $97 million to
shareholders through purchases of our common stock. Our cash and investments totaled about $6.7 billion at
quarter-end, are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt
repayment.
Now for second quarter 2014 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 22% to 32% in U.S. dollars
and by 20% to 30% on a local currency basis. With U.S. gross bookings growing by 15% to 20%, we expect
international gross bookings to grow by 24% to 34% in U.S. dollars and by 21% to 31% on a local currency basis. Our
Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated Group will be up by about 1% compared to the
prior-year period. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.39 per euro and $1.70 per
British pound at yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be stronger by
about 6% for the euro and about 10% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. We expect the overall impact
of currency fluctuations to be favorable to our growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars.
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any
fluctuation in euro or the pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedgings do not
offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our
earnings beyond the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year over year by approximately 19% to 29% and
gross profit dollars to grow by 24% to 34%. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price services will impact
revenue growth rates in Q2. We expect about 300 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of
gross profit compared to prior year driven by lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising
expense.
Our approach to online and offline advertising is consistent with past practice. We use a disciplined approach to invest
in advertising that builds our brands while delivering demand at an acceptable ROI. Our ROI targets are fluid based
upon competitive and marketplace conditions and are set to achieve the right balance between top-line growth and
bottom-line profitability. We are investing more heavily in online advertising thus far in Q2 and assume this strategy
will be maintained for the remainder of the quarter. Q2 year-over-year online advertising efficiency benefits from the
inclusion of KAYAK in our consolidated results, but to a lesser extent than Q1, because we lap the acquisition on May
21. Q2 also reflects some offline spend that was shifted from Q1 into Q2, as I mentioned a moment ago.
For full-year 2014, we continue to estimate that the Group will spend between $220 million and $240 million for
offline advertising. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $725 million and $775 million, which at the
mid-point, represents 21% growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income
tax rate of approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income
taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $11.22 to $12.02 per share, which at
the midpoint represents 20% growth over prior-year. And our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share
count of 53.3 million shares based upon yesterday's closing stock price of $1,131.74. We forecast GAAP EPS between
$9.67 and $10.47 per share for Q2. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP
investments that are detailed in our earnings release.
We're pleased that the hard work and talents of our brand teams delivered great results in Q1 and a strong forecast for
Q2. Our guidance reflects our actual results to date and our expectation that such a large business comparing against
high transaction growth rates will experience a pattern of sequential deceleration. Our forecast does not assume any

material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. Darren, when you look out sort of across the landscape of travel, what are you
seeing in terms of the willingness of hotels to begin to work with additional platforms, particularly some of the smaller
hotels that have long been almost sort of de facto exclusive to Priceline, including your own other platforms like
KAYAK? And then maybe even more and more broadly just the level of sophistication that you're seeing in hotels and
particularly the larger chains, the franchisees of those hotels in engaging more directly with online?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. I would say – thanks, Heath. I would say generally speaking of course
everyone's advancing in the way that they think about the role of technology in how they run their operations. A few
years ago, you'd be going out and you'd have to be teaching people how to use a PC. That obviously isn't the case
anymore and I was just in Bucharest in Romania this weekend and they've got fiber optics in Romania. I mean who
would have thought? And obviously people need to adjust their models.
But the Internet is also changing very fast. And it's not only a world of just PCs. It's now a world of tablets and phones
and there's so many options open to hotels that the degree to which they're are catching up technologically, they're even
becoming more confused at all the different ways that they could be spending their money. And they, of course, are
always looking for the best and lowest cost options to generate demand. And I strongly believe we still offer that to
them. I mean, given the fact that everything's changed, even advertise on Google or TripAdvisor ads, they actually pay
money for that just to play. And a lot of them rely on us to be that provider of demand, not just from local demand, but
demand from all different parts of the world. And for any single hotel, or even for some of the chains, it's difficult for
them to get the scale they need to be able to attract customers from every corner of the world even as much of the
technologies advance.
So generally speaking, it is a very dynamic environment. Many hotels have channel managers, which allows them to
plug into Booking as well as Agoda. They can try things on KAYAK. They can work with other vendors. They can put
them on these demand systems. But net-net most of the hotels I speak with have a hard time finding the kind of ROI by
doing it on their own. And they would much rather prefer to focus on just running a great hotel. The real secret to
success for hotels in this new world is just run a great product, have a very differentiated thing, and we can help bring
the entire world to find them. And I think many of them are recognizing that that's the case.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Actually you mentioned ROI. Obviously you picked up some lines earlier this month with
some comments that you made about the limitations that you found in the social media platforms and the ROI there.
Maybe to go beyond the headline, is that something that you feel is sort of an innate limitation of those platforms Or is
that something that Priceline views as an opportunity to exploit down the road is either those platforms or customers
get more sophisticated around using them for travel purposes?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Thanks. To be clear, we do spend money on Facebook and Twitter and many other
platforms. And we really very deeply understand their offerings. And they also work closely with us to try and make
this work. But it's still a small fraction of our spend. And I think that it's important to differentiate between primary
brand advertisers, the Coca-Colas and the GMs of the world. And advertisers like us, which are really direct response
advertisers. And for direct response advertisers, there are these large sources of audiences in the world that just haven't
figured out how to translate that audience into a transaction. Whereas Google, of course, is extremely good at this as
are many of the metas. And my comments there are more wanting to move bigger and faster. And I'm sure, to be

honest, I think Facebook, for instance, is making a lot of progress and we would love to have some of these big
audience pools to be able to find business in the meta at an ROI like we find in other channels. And that's really my
comment. And if anything, I would call it general encouragement to continue to not lose faith that they'll be able to
figure this out. I think many of these large audience platforms, companies like Priceline, are the key I think to them
breaking the back of this issue of how do they build a profitable advertising business.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks, Darren. That's really helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. Can you comment a little bit about the positive ROI you're seeing in 1Q and then why
you guided a little bit for deleverage in 2Q? And I think that also is related to shifting out spend to 2Q. Maybe talk a
little bit about why you did that? And are you spending more now because you anticipate healthy activity in 3Q? Thank
you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Hey, Justin. So, to be clear we didn't have positive ROIs in Q1. We still had ROI pressure.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: We had positive ROIs, but we didn't have year-over-year, yes.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Right. Year over year, slightly negative, not to the extent that we have seen thus far in Q2
and we're were forecasting. We had a significant beneficial impact from the inclusion of KAYAK in Q1, and that was
built into our forecast. We knew that that was going to be there. KAYAK also had a better quarter than we had
forecasted, so that contributed. We get less of a benefit as we move into Q2 from the inclusion of KAYAK because we
lap the acquisition, and we've made the conscious decision that we're going to invest to an aggressive degree in variable
channels, and that's in our actual results to date and in our forecast for the rest of the quarter for the online advertising.
For offline advertising, if you look at the markets we're investing in with Booking.com and KAYAK and Priceline for
that matter in the U.S., U.K. for Booking.com and Canada, there was pretty bad weather in those markets. Polar vortex
in Canada and the U.S. and a lot of snow, flight disruptions, and you had flooding in the U.K., and so we decided to
step off the gas and not spend as much for offline advertising there and instead defer it to Q2 where there's still a huge
amount of travel booking going on for spring breaks and for summer vacations. And so that's why we pushed back on
that.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: I'd also note that, Justin, that Q2 is a really key period in the online travel space,
certainly in the northern hemisphere, and we're wanting to make sure that in the channels that we really understand
well, the variable channels, that we're getting at least, if not more than our fair share of those channels. Others may be
using a lot of couponing and discounting, and that's not traditionally been a way that we build business. We're wanting
to make sure that the channels warm up, and the snow leaves, and crises get less, we want to be in the market executing
because that's when you really build demand for the summer and we want to make sure that our forecast reflects that.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. And maybe one follow-up, as we think about 3Q, the KAYAK acquisition will be lapped.
What would be advice as we start to model 3Q without KAYAK in there?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: We won't give any guidance beyond Q2, as is our normal practice, Justin. But we will
definitely get less benefit in the online ad efficiency from the KAYAK acquisition as we've lapped it. So I would just
assume that there's no built-in efficiency from that and then you've got to come up with your own estimation as to what
you think will happen with just the online ROIs and in the marketplace in general. That's such a big number in our P&L
that it can be very volatile and can have positive or negative impact on operating leverage.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you and nice quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to stick with the KAYAK theme here.
But just coming up on the anniversary in a couple weeks, if you could just talk about how you're thinking about the
benefit so far of KAYAK versus a standalone business? And then also how it's driving broader Group and how that's
gone over the last year relative to what you're thinking when you acquired it? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. I'll take that one, Doug. Thanks for your question. I would say, generally
speaking, we've seen that meta is becoming a more important channel for all of the OTA brands in the Group. And I
think being and owning a meta has taught us a lot about what does that mean. What does it mean to be on the other side
for somebody selling advertising, for those buying advertising?
And we certainly did a lot across the Group to share best practice. I would say in particular in the area of the mobile,
KAYAK has been a tremendous addition into the conversation of the Group because we try to feel our way through
how we can drive success in the mobile space. It also has had a pretty nice impact on Priceline's air business, which is
another area I would flag as a positive.
Now the way we run the Group is the brands run very independently. We do share across the groups. We have sessions
around social and mobile and other topics, but it really it's up to Steve and his team to drive the results. And knowing
Steve and his folks, I think they get energized being around a group of other really high performing companies and
thinking about how they're going to take their product and lead to their vision of being a world-leading meta.
And know I'm excited that they've settled in with the Group. They're driving some really good results, and now the next
stage for them is to go from being what I would call primarily a U.S. business to becoming very global. And they've
begun a number of experiments to that degree that we're feeling really good about and are quite promising.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. I just had two questions back to the ROI discussion. So if you strip out the
impact from KAYAK, we're probably seven quarters into the period where you started to call out ROI pressure. So the
year-over-year decline in ROI ex-KAYAK a function of the geographic mix shift, which is natural in the business? Or
if we look at it on a same geo basis, is the ROI declining there as well? And do you envision a time where booking will
have a base of organic traffic that could potentially offset these ROI pressures or not?
And then the second question is one that you've gotten in the past. But TripAdvisor announced this week that they're
going to launch assisted book for all channels, smartphone, mobile and tablet – sorry, smartphone, desktop and tablet.
How do you view these assisted book channels? And if we were to see Google implement assisted book, do you have
any sense of how that could impact your unit economics in hotel? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Dan, why don't you take the first one and I'll take the second one.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yes. Hey, Ross. So on the first one on the ROIs, you're right. We've had pressure now for
seven quarters to varying degrees. We saw the back-half of 2013 less pressured as we were comping against the periods
where the pressure first started and so the comps got a little bit easier. I'd argue that as you go into the back half of this

year and maybe, therefore, the comps are a little bit tougher, but we're not going to give a forecast. And it's very
difficult to predict even if we wanted to give one exactly how the market's going to play out that far into the future. In
terms of geographic shift, we won't give you any details of our marketing or ROIs by market, but this is too significant
of an impact in the consolidated results to not be more across the board.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: And then I'll take it on the TripAssist. So I'll probably start off by just saying that
TripAdvisor is a really good partner of ours and we have a very healthy relationship, and I'd say it's gotten even
stronger over time and it feels quite data-driven and quite symbiotic. And we're finding ways together to drive a lot
more business in our sort of core product. And when it comes generally to the introduction of new products like
TripAssist, the way we think about it is we're always judging them both on the ROI as well as their strategic value.
When I talk about strategic value, it's just a good experience as a customer. Is it clear to the customer who they've
booked with? Does it help us build customers for the future or is it just about a single transaction?
And if the strategic value of a particular product is high, for instance, Google PTCs over the years, but then we lean in,
then we invest, then we spend more money on it. We focus our people on innovating against it. We actually even
co-create products in those scenarios. If the strategic value is low, obviously, we don't spend heavily. We lean back.
We go for really high ROIs. We don't invest. We might even just partially put product in it, or even not participate at
all. So that's always a trade off we're going through. And I think in the case of TripAssist, we understand the product
really well. The TripAdvisor team has made a lot of changes to try to address some of our strategic concerns. But, at
least, on the launch we decided not to participate at this time, but it's not that we won't in the future.
And the dialog is very constructive. And I think in the case of TripAdvisor or Google or anyone who introduces a new
product, we're very involved in the discussion and ultimately they're going to make their decision and we're going to
make our decision. And that's how these things work. So I do feel very comfortable that we are building a bigger and
stronger direct business over time. We're not so reliant on any partner that we're not afraid to make really difficult
decisions because we do that every day. And overtime, it's smart and it's built us a better business.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: I wanted to ask a broad question about alternative accommodations. You've given the
disclosure that's become a larger part of your base. Could you talk about the impact of that to the business in terms of –
maybe just in terms of consumers? Do you find that this is bringing a broader range of consumers? Are you able to
increase match rates? What this does to your overall economics? Does it help with geographic expansion? Does it just
give you greater depth in each existing market? What's the impact of the build out of alternative accommodations on
your business? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yes. Thanks, Mark. I'd say generally speaking it's been very positive because if you
think about it, when people come to a city, they're just looking for a place to stay. So the scenarios under which you
arrive even with the same person might be with their family and kids, another one might be a business trip, maybe
you're backpacking or you're on a golf trip with friends. And in a way, hotels can satisfy many of those needs. But
there's other types of accommodations that might better satisfy it.
For instance, I was talking to some folks about hostel booking. And they were telling us, you guys know you're the
number one way that people book our hostel. It's hard to imagine three years ago that we were like huge in the hostel
world. The hostel world brings us a younger consumer, it's a low ticket, or it brings us a family that's on a very low
budget. It also, when you look at Paris, it allows you to find a place you can book for €30, but we also have the [ph]
Georges (34:27) and you could stay for €1,000 if you want. So it's that breadth of assortment that really allows us to
treat different consumer scenarios with product that matches the needs of the consumer.

You know specifically vacation rentals, which is kind of the latest in the long tail are self-catered products, is becoming
a really big deal, because vacation rentals are very difficult to book. You go through an e-mail, phone dance with the
user, people don't feel secure about it. For many families a vacation rental is an upgrade if they're on vacation in the
south of Spain or in Ibiza or in Tuscany. So our role of going down the path of accommodations, getting them wired
up, making them directly bookable, making them instantly comparable is good work to do, and by increasing that
assortment it gives us further strength in Booking.com or other brands as products that consumers will want to go to
first to really find the accommodation that matches them.
So I'd say it's really hard work, by the way, because as you go down the long tail, you're getting to really small places,
you're getting to cities without name, you're getting to families and all this. But it's great work in a sense that it's really
reinventing the product that we bring to consumers, and it's really going extremely well.
And the other thing I would say is more people are looking for products like apartments and self-catered products
around the world, and even hotels are adjusting. You'll find many hotels in Europe that in the front they're a hotel, but
in the back they've got an apartment block that they're using for families; it's better. So we're also seeing this that the
product even within a single hotel can have many variants depending on the user needs that they're trying to address.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Millman of Millman Research. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Michael Millman>: Thank you. Could you talk about what impact you're seeing from trivago on KAYAK in the
U.S.? And also on the Rentalcars, can you talk about what you're seeing in pricing in Europe and the U.S.? And what
you're seeing in fleet availability in Europe and the U.S.? Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Okay. I'll let Dan take the second one on Rentalcars. So with regard to trivago and
KAYAK, I mean both of them are – this is not from the OTA side – both [ph] fleets (36:57) are great sources of
demand. Trivago in the United States has grown significantly, but off of a very low base, and we're participating in that
with trivago, and we do the same with KAYAK. We try to treat our sources of demand very independently, regardless
of the fact that Expedia is the majority owner of trivago and we own KAYAK. We try to keep a Chinese Wall between
those, and I know Expedia does the same. And we're getting a lot of growth out of both of those sources of bookings
today.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: And in terms of Rentalcar business, Michael, pricing is up low-single digits in the
U.S. and down low-single digits for our European business. Availability for summer is always a challenge, but the team
at Rentalcars.com does a great job of working closely with the suppliers to make sure we get our fair share of the
availability. So that's an ongoing task to make sure we're in the right position.
In the U.S. as far as it relates to our Name Your Own Price business, it's been more challenged. Each of the big players,
the big three, have partnered with their own lower-price alternatives where they can move some excess inventory on
weekends or what have you that in the past, might have more typically gone through our Name Your Own Price
channel. So this is really nothing new. It's always a challenge for the Priceline team to get at that excess inventory.
We'll have quarters where we get better results because we're more successful and quarters like Q1 and what we're
projecting for Q2 where it looks like it's going to be more challenging. The market's healthy and there's just not that
many excess cars to move through Name Your Own Price.

<A - Darren Richard Huston>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dean Prissman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Thanks for taking my questions. So as you look at the continued growth of your business,
say, room night growth of 32%, I'm guessing it's a combination of both new users and greater wallet share with existing
customers? Can you qualitatively discuss the relative importance of each lever? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yes. I would say we have a healthy balance of both new usage as well as repeats.
We're always looking to get both levers. In a way, I don't feel it's that healthy to have too much of your business direct
because you've got to keep casting the fishing net to bring more customers basically into the franchise. So we have a
healthy balance of both. More of our business, as Dan mentioned, is coming direct, which I think is healthy and that
includes new customers. But I don't really want to talk too much about wallet share and other topics which would be
confidential.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: All right. Thanks. And then given the size of the outbound China travel market and even
greater potential, beyond the Ctrip relationship, can you update us on your strategy with Booking.com, particularly as
one considers the tour group oriented nature of international travel originating from the country? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. That's a great question, Dean. Yeah, we feel very positive about our outbound
business from China. It's one of our fastest growing businesses in the world. We did find just for color that the
Malaysian Air tragedy where everyone had a bit of a short-term impact. But we are seeing Chinese in droves right now
traveling to North Asia, Southeast Asia, even to Oceania, Europe, U.S. And I think part of this is all nationalities are
becoming more comfortable with its travel or traveling in a do-it-yourself way instead of package travel; that's a
general trend. We certainly see that with Chinese as well. And you can come to Amsterdam, I took a KLM flight the
other day to Shanghai and it's full of people with Louis Vuitton bags and Chanel bags and they were definitely
traveling on their own. It wasn't group travel.
And I think you're going to continue to see that trend. The Internet in some ways makes it more comfortable for even
cautious travelers to go out as a couple or as a family versus having to travel as groups. By the way, I had to spend
three years as Head of Microsoft in Japan and even back then, Japanese only traveled in groups. But you definitely see
a massive change in that, where young Japanese are traveling alone or with very small groups of friends doing their
do-it-yourself travel versus the kind of standard packages. By the way, it doesn't mean packages are going away
anytime soon, and it's just that the general trend is for more and more independent travel, including among North Asian
folks.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Thanks, Darren.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore Partners. Your line is now opened.
<A - Ken Sena>: Thanks. Does growth in Facebook and some of the newer channels pose any sort of change to how
you think about rate parity over the next few years given that it's a logged-in experience? And maybe as you look out
over the next few years, how should we think about rate parity and what effect that could have on the competitive
landscape? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I think it's a good chance to touch on this topic. I'd say first you
need to start with the consumer. And if anything, things are getting more confusing for consumers. If you go on to most
meta channels, despite all the great work that has been done, most rates are not real deals. There's tax issues, exchange
rate issues, a lot of wholesale inventory is being laundered as retail inventory. Sometimes you'll click on a rate and it
goes to a blank website and they try to sell you something else. So the whole area of rates in hotels and
accommodations, I would say unfortunately, it's like backsliding. There's just a lot of noise in the market. And that's a
very important thing that needs to get addressed by a combination of OTAs and metas and the world just needs more

transparency as it relates to rates.
I guess the second point I'd make is that, we'll never let our customers get charged more. It's a basic principle of the
company. We will not let them get charged more. It's why we have a best price guarantee. It's why we push for
transparency in pricing and clarity, and we'll go to the ends of the earth to make sure they don't. So, to some degree we
need more data on this. We need to better understand if a property is like selling a product less than some surgical
social channel, but we understand those opportunities, whether it's social, Google, et cetera, and all of the new ways to
market as well as anyone does, and we're monitoring this and creating the investment in big data, et cetera to really
understand in depth to basically deliver on that basic principle that we will never let our customers get charged more.
And that also, by the way, includes collecting deals that are better than anywhere they'll find in the Internet. I mean, we
have thousands and thousands of rates on our sites that if you log in or you're a loyal user, that hotel is providing to you
to get your business. So we're in our own massive marketing channel for hotels to take a customer that might have
shown somebody else to come to their hotel, and I think that's going to continue going forward. But I actually relish the
opportunity to continue to address this, and I think we are in a pretty unique position to help bring some sanity to the
world of pricing, both because of KAYAK but also because of our position in the marketplace as the world's leading
player in this space.
<A - Ken Sena>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Tom White>: Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to reconcile some of your comments around
meta-search becoming a more important channel for the OTAs, but I'm also hearing some comments about sort of
better direct navigation business in the quarter. I mean, if we look at sort of your markets on a geographic unique basis,
is the percentage of traffic you're getting from meta-search increasing or decreasing? And then also just on mobile, I
was wondering maybe if you could provide a bit more color around some of the non-transaction engagement you
referenced in your prepared remarks? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. I can take the – let me take the first comment. Meta-search is an important
channel for us, but it's not as big as you might think it is. It's been growing as a percentage of our source of demand, but
we have many other sources of demand. Of course, there's Google, there's many other search engines that we buy
demand from globally, but we also have a very long tail of affiliates from easyJet to Ryanair and all the way down the
line – many, many airlines and railroads, et cetera. So if you look at all sources of paid demand, our direct demand is
outgrowing our source of paid demand, but within paid demand, meta continues to grow quite well and take some X
proportion, but it's not so dramatic that it's completely shifting our overall landscape.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And on the direct business, we mentioned that for Q1 it was a positive factor in terms of
our advertising efficiency. It's a trend we've seen for some time now. Nice growth in our direct booking business, nice
growth in repeat bookers. Darren said when he talked about our advertising philosophy to try and focus our dollars in
areas that we think are strategically valuable, and we'll build a customer that recognized our brand and is loyal to it
based upon the service we can provide them over the long run.
<Q - Tom White>: Great. Thanks. And then just on mobile, you talked about your non-transaction engagement, I was
just wondering if there's any more color there? And if you ever thought that that might be sort of a monetizable
opportunity for you somewhere down the line, maybe advertising revenues or something like that? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. I think on that we – the way we think about it is and sometimes it's hard to
connect all the pieces, but the user will pick one of the screens to ultimately book on. But we want to give credit to the
experience to all the screens that they ultimately use and multiscreen attribution is not simple. But we think we have a
fairly strong bead on it now in terms of where users are entering the system and what devices they're using to ultimately
complete their journey. And if anything, what we're learning is, they're using more and more and more screens along

the journey. It's amazing how many screens people touch on the same booking.
I think what that's helping us do is it's changing us from being just a booking engine to something that improves the
entire trip from easy check-in to easy WiFi to even considering things like guides to the city and other elements of
innovation. In some ways, it's almost like the move to increase the number of screens and move to mobile has increased
the palettes that we're painting on. Before it was just the desktop and it was a single experience and people would print
off their paper-based confirmation, and that would be it in terms of their digital connection with us. But now everything
stays digital. Many never print the confirmation. They want, actually go on the confirmation when they're standing at
the Brussels train station and say take me to my hotel, which you can now do on Booking.com. It will literally give you
walking directions or driving directions to your hotel. It will help you find things around your hotel. So it's interesting.
I'd say, despite all of the growth of screens, it's still early days. But I think we're getting a lot smarter about thinking of
a consumer as holding many screens and then deciding how we interact with that. I wouldn't say it's a big advertising
thing necessarily. That's not how we're thinking about it. It's much more about how do we become more meaningful in
the booking experience, rather than just being a great place to do transactions.
<Q - Tom White>: Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: Morning. So for Booking.com in the U.S., where would you say we are on the spectrum of
growth trajectory? Was there some low hanging fruit in terms of market share gains in the first few quarters of entering
the market with the new brand and a big ad campaign, and now it becomes more challenging to gain incremental share?
Or is it the opposite, that now with the brand further permeated in the market it should be easier to leverage the work
you've done in building Booking.com in that market?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, thanks, Mike. I would say that generally speaking, it's still early days. We
recently passed 40,000 properties in the United States, and to build out a property count like that, it takes many years.
We've got now pretty much all the chains on board. Now we're building out the independent hotels. We haven't really
gotten into long-tail accommodations. I was talking to the team in Boston the other day about Maine and all the B&Bs
and things that they have yet to put on the platform. So we're seeing continued growth. There's some markets that are
very retail oriented, places like Miami, where we're really big, or San Diego and other markets that are more wholesale
oriented, the Orlandos of the world, places like that that we need to continue to triple-A at, but in the way that we grew
the rest of our business, it doesn't all come in one pop. It's like a continuous methodical breaking down walls, moving
forward, and I feel really good about what our teams are doing in the United States. And we're going to continue to
expand the number of offices, the amount of engagement we do with hotels, and we're still, as Booking.com, highly
under-indexed in the United States relative to Europe. And the degree to which we can continue this hard work, there's
a lot of growth still ahead of us in that market.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: Okay. And then following on an earlier question, could you talk about where you are on number
of vacation rental properties now on Booking.com, and will you kind of focus on primarily adding portfolios of
properties from managers or also individual property owners?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: I think the count today is, we may have it right at the bottom – it changes [indiscernible]
(51:27) vacation rentals at the bottom. It changes, I think it's 145,000 approximately, vacation rentals. We define those
as self-catered products that includes holiday homes, and yeah, 144,702. By the way, all of our data on the website is
real and it's constantly updating if I look. But what we're trying to do is build out those properties that you can truly
confirm that you know you're going to be able to stay there, that have electronic calendars that are secure. And we
started by working with property managers because that was easy in a sense because it's like working with hotel
owners. It's got thousands of rooms, that the rooms in fact are vacation rentals themselves. And slowly we're building

out other tools, simple extranet, other products that'll ultimately allow us to work with individual vacation homeowners
as well. That's our goal. There's a lot of work to do to get there.
But you'll continue to see this number go up over time because we're just going to methodically break down the walls
and bring the product on board. We're really happy with our production. If you talk to any of the players who work
with us, I think they'll highlight to you that Booking.com produces extremely well for them. And we hope to bring that
production to a broader number of accommodations over time. I would say we're more European slanted today because
it was the natural place to start. We do have vacation rentals in other parts of the world, but slowly that count outside of
Europe is also building as well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Thanks, guys. A couple of quick ones, maybe a quick follow-up on mobile. Anything to
call out in terms of engagement as differentiated across your brands or geographies? And then on booking, user reviews
are up 44% by our estimates year-over-year, 10% in the quarter, how do you think about how you drive review growth
there and the efficacy of the reviews, making them more valuable to the traveler? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Maybe let me start with reviews?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Okay.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: I'll start with the review question and then go backwards. So on reviews, the thing I
would flag to people is our reviews are all from verified guests and we still have the rule that once your review is 14
months old, it comes off the site. So it makes the comps a little bit weird at times because of seasonality. So important
when you look at that number, you always take that into account. And the second thing is, obviously our ability to
attract people to do reviews changes over time. Right now I'm feeling very good that, if anything, engagement is
increasing despite the fact that often when you check out of the hotel, you get a message from us, from the hotel,
maybe somebody else. And people are engaging very deeply in our reviews and our review response rates are very
high, in keeping our reviews a very high quality. And we're proud of that and we feel like we have the largest number
of verified reviews for accommodations in the world. Of course, others have many more reviews, but they're not
necessarily verified. They're much more open-ended in terms of anyone being able to leave a review. I think your other
question was on mobile. Correct?
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Yeah.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: By brand?
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Yeah.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: So we've said in the past, the brands are at different stages of maturity in terms of mobile
apps and mobile websites. Booking.com, KAYAK and priceline.com are pretty far advanced. All of our brands are
getting significant and growing levels of traffic coming to us through mobile devices. And we're doing a nice job in
growing our mobile bookings at very high rates as well. So from us mobile engagement, a typical level, when the
customer comes is looking to make a booking, we want the engagement to be as little as possible and make the process
very easy and intuitive so that they can make the booking that they want as quickly as they can and then Darren talked
about some of the initiatives that we are looking to do to engage post booking and we'll just give a better service to our
customers and differentiate ourselves by staying with them and helping them as they continue to do their traveling.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Great. Thanks Darren and thanks Dan.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. Darren, maybe just a bigger picture question on mobile. So
the way in which you think about allocating your spend to different channels in mobile and how you think longer term
mobile develops in terms of generating leads, whether it's better spend to try to drive downloads of your app itself and
control the customer or thinking about mobile web or even some of the newer developments around deep app linking
and how you think about what kind of spend might be used for something like that as potential for ROI? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Thanks. This is an evolving science I should always say, and maybe even more
of an art because everyone's trying to figure out this exact question. I think for the Group versus others, we very heavily
weighted on mobile web. We think that's where you're going to pick up brand new transactional customers. Somebody
standing in an airport saying, I need a hotel tonight and they often they're not on a web-based, downloads your app to
necessarily make that. We think of app customers as more of our loyal bookers. We don't necessarily try to chase them
down to do their very first booking ever on a mobile app. We are happy with that, but that's not – so that has been our
general way of generating demand towards mobile. And we also believe that mobile downloads for sure don't lead to
engaged booking desks. And there's a lot of charlatans out there that will sell you all sorts of tools. They got lots of
downloads, but it doesn't necessarily ultimately make it a good ROI investment.
And we've had similar views in the past on things like Facebook Likes. It's nice to have it, but if it's not ultimately
leading to a good result, then we definitely shy away from it. We also don't believe strongly in overly interrupting the
experience that when you get on mobile web that we immediately tell you, well download the app without letting you
get through to the experience. That's something that differentiates our approach. I think they were much more about
what's the consumer experience and quickly getting them into the booking path and learning about what they're going
to do next. But, again, it's an evolving – there's lots of companies that are trying to influence this space. We're building
out our own tooling. We have a lot of smart people looking at it. I feel very good about our results. But it would be
wrong for me to say that we've got everything figured out. We're just trying to be as smart as we can and be ROI
focused as much as we can on this space.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Hi. Thanks a lot. On KAYAK you said it delivered impressive profitability. Can you give
us any sense of how it compares to overall Group margins? And also can you discuss any Easter timing impact for Q1?
And to what extent that will offset the partial anniversary of KAYAK in Q2? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yep. So the KAYAK profitability, the KAYAK business is nicely profitable. Some of
the competitors talk about the growth rates of their businesses, but the profit is more in question. Steve and his team
have chosen to strike the right balance I think between what they spend to drive top-line growth while still delivering
very healthy margins. So [audio gap] (59:40 – 59:55) earnings based upon checkout. They're delivering a higher
relative percentage of their annual profit in Q1 and so they're really positive to our margins for Q1.
In terms of Easter timing, that is a benefit to Q2 and a detriment to Q1. So last year we had some of the Easter
checkouts take place in Q1 and this year they will all be in Q2. That's reflected in our forecast. So Q2 looks better – as
when Q2 looks worse as a result of that shift in terms of profitability and gross profit growth.

<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Okay. Thanks. And then a follow-up on vacation rentals, we know it's a large percentage
of the properties, but can you give us any sense of how big a factor it is on bookings or room night spreads? Is that a
meaningful addition to growth yet?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. I think as we disclosed, vacation rentals are on average not as big as
non-vacation rentals, but I will also flag that within vacation rentals we have a number of properties that we call a one
but they have many rooms to be booked. So it's not all as clean as they are all like one room only and everything else is
multiroom. It's actually a bit of a mix, but the vacation rental category generally has fewer rooms than non-vacation
rental. We recently made a decision to put up part hotels into vacation rentals which might have adjusted the mix of the
numbers. But these are truly hotels, but they are self-catered products and if you have never stayed in a part hotel, I
want to educate you on this call that just let's call it a self-catered hotel with lots of apartments. And there's actually
quite a few of those, and it's a growing category, particularly in Europe, but also in other parts of the world.
So, yeah, we feel like the production in the vacation rental space is very strong. But always, if you look at the growth of
our property count, it's always going to overemphasize the amount of room supplies because the supplies we disclosed
many times is getting less rooms per property. It's not that there's no hotels to acquire. We're acquiring many, many
hotels. It's just over time the long tail just per property brings on less rooms.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Thanks so much.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.
Darren Richard Huston
No, I want to thank everyone again. Is this our first conference call from Amsterdam? It's our first conference call for
Europe. Hopefully that's a signal that we are a global company. But I apologize everyone having to get up before the
market, but I do really appreciate the interest and the engagement. And we're looking forward to a great Q2.
Operator
