And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.
Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good morning and welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2013. As you can see, FedEx made significant progress on several fronts in fiscal 2013. Our results
improved in the fourth quarter with an operating margin of 9.6% and $1.1 billion in operating income on an adjusted
basis.
FedEx Ground posted another strong year and e-commerce boosted our volumes. These positive developments in
quarter four however did not fully offset sluggish economic growth and customers' preference for International
Economy services. However, as noted, we are taking actions to better align our global networks with demand. We're
confident our business strategy is correct and we believe we're positioning FedEx for profitable long-term growth.
Before I turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his thoughts on the economy and Alan Graf for elaboration on financial
results, I'd like to note that FedEx is revising its practices on earnings guidance beginning this quarter. We will provide
full-year projections with quarterly updates. We will no longer provide quarterly earnings per share guidance.
For fiscal 2014, the company projects earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% from fiscal 2013 adjusted results. There
are three primary reasons that we decided to change the format for issuing guidance. One, volatile short-term shifts in
macroeconomic trends and global markets are making quarterly earnings guidance increasingly less precise. Two, this
move will allow us to focus on more productive activities and better manage our business. And three, it is consistent
with industry peer practices. Of course, we remain committed to candor full transparency and sound corporate

governance.
Now, Mike Glenn.
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred. I'm going to provide a brief overview of our economic outlook as well as some commentary on
package and freight yields. We continue to see modest growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is
2% for calendar year 2013 and 2.5% for calendar year 2014. For industrial production, we expect growth of 2.8% in
calendar 2013 and 3.5% in calendar 2014. The outlook remains highly uncertain with the eurozone in recession and
policy risk still high. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.3% for calendar 2013 and 3% for calendar 2014.
Turning to yields, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield increased 2.4%. The
increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements followed by weight per package. In the Ground
segment yield per package increased 2.3% excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was driven by rate
and discount improvement and an increase in extra services charges.
Excluding fuel, international export Express package yield decreased 1.7% year-over-year driven by rate, discount and
exchange rate. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight in the FedEx Freight segment
increased 1.7% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount changes followed by weight per
shipment.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf for financial commentary.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In FY 2013, Ground posted another stellar year with industry-leading
margins. Acquisitions in Poland, France, Brazil and Mexico are on course to enhance profit at Express. Freight made
solid progress following its return to profit last year and we signed a new $10.5 billion seven-year contract with U.S.
Postal Service, a testament to the quality of service and the strong relationship we've built over the past decade.
For the fourth quarter, as adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.13, excluding business realignment and
charges to retire some aircraft and related engines at Express. Regarding our aircraft retirements, this Friday at the
Memphis Airport, we will be honoring our last 727 revenue flight.
As Fred mentioned, adjusted operating margin increased to 9.6% for the quarter versus an adjusted 9% last year on 4%
higher revenue of $11.4 billion. Now let's take a look at the segments.
At Express, revenue grew from this year's business acquisitions and from the growth of FedEx Trade Networks in the
quarter. Margins grew year-over-year, up 50 basis points to 6.6% excluding charges due to a net benefit from fuel
surcharge timing lag versus the prior year, capacity reductions and other cost reductions. Margins grew at Express
despite the continued shift toward lower yielding international services.
At Ground, adjusted operating profit – adjusted operating margin slightly exceeded last year's spectacular 20% in Q4.
Ground's average daily volume grew 10% for the quarter with growth in both FedEx home delivery and
business-to-business services. Average daily volume for SmartPost soared 25%, primarily due to growth in
e-commerce. I should note that Ground has gained revenue share for 54 consecutive quarters.
On the Saturday before Mother's Day, home delivery set a new non-peak record of 1.7 million package deliveries,
equivalent to a peak Saturday during the winter holiday season.
At Freight, ongoing profit improvement initiatives enabled us to maintain adjusted margins of 5.8% year-over-year,
despite 3% fewer shipments. During the quarter, shipment volume was impacted in part by the transition of Freight to
the FedEx enterprise automation platform, as some customers encountered difficulties in the process of improving our

automation and technology.
As to outlook, based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about and Fred's discussion of the changes to our
guidance framework, we project earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% from the FY 2013 adjusted results. Our
outlook depends on our GDP assumptions and a stable pricing environment for fuel, since fuel price volatility impacts
our fuel surcharge levels and fuel expense as well as demand for our services. In addition, to continued profit
improvements in the base businesses at Ground and Freight, our profit improvement programs announced in FY 2013
are targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion at Express by the end of FY 2016 from the full-year FY
2013 adjusted operating income level.
Collectively, these initiatives are expected to increase margins, improve cash flows and increase our competitiveness.
However, the amount of benefit ultimately realized will be dependent upon future customer demand, particularly for
premium international services. We expect to begin realizing a portion of the benefits from the profit improvement
program gradually in FY 2014. However, the majority of the benefits, including those from our voluntary buyout
program will not occur until FY 2015 and 2016.
Looking at the Express outlook, revenue and earnings are expected to increase at Express in FY 2014. Revenue growth
is expected as we reap the benefits of our FTN expansion, our international domestic services and our European
organic growth program. Earnings are expected to benefit from ongoing cost initiatives, capacity reductions and
revenue growth. As we expect continued pressure on international yields, we are continuing to evaluate further actions
within the Express network to better match cost with yield and will eliminate another Asia to U.S. frequency in July.
The USPS agreement is extremely valuable to the company, but we will see some rate reductions starting in Q2 of FY
2014.
We accelerated the retirement of certain aircraft and related engines due to the planned acquisition of more efficient
and reliable new aircraft and projected slower economic growth than previously forecast. The accelerated aircraft
retirements will add $74 million in year-over-year depreciation expense. The aircraft that were retired at the end of FY
2013 were parked throughout the year and parking them provided a maintenance benefit in FY 2013.
The Ground outlook is good as revenues are expected to continue to grow in FY 2014 led by volume growth across all
our major services due to continued e-commerce growth and market share gains as well as anticipated yield growth
from our yield management programs. As a result of this anticipated volume and yield growth, we expect continued
growth in Ground's operating income for FY 2014. We do expect capital spending at Ground to increase in FY 2014
and for the next several years at a very high ROIC as we expand our capacity to meet growing demand.
At Freight, modest revenue growth is expected for FY 2014 as demand in the LTL market remains weak and we
continue to focus on our yield and shipment initiatives in our differentiated LTL services. Freight operating income and
operating margin are expected to increase modestly, driven by increases in yields in shipments as well as the continued
improvements in productivity and efficiency across our integrated network, including an increased use of rail for
Economy shipments.
Overall, we expect earnings growth for Q1 2014 to be solid but challenged as we expect headwinds year-over-year
from fuel surcharge timing lag, one less operating day and continued pressure on international yields and Freight
volumes. Also the benefits of the voluntary buyout program will ramp out throughout the year with the majority of
those expense reductions occurring after the first quarter. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and seasonal
fluctuations will affect volumes, revenues and earnings.
Other factors, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 36.5% and 37% for FY 2014 depending on the amount
and source of operating income. Our U.S. pension plans have ample funds to meet expected benefits. Retirement plan
costs for FY 2014 will decline by nearly $200 million due to strong investment returns on plan assets and a slightly
higher discount rate at our May 31 measurement date.
Our FY 2014 capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately $4 billion due to increased spending on
facilities and aircraft. Approximately half of the 2014 capital expenditures will be designated for growth with the other
half dedicated to maintain our existing operations, most notably, continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express. We

And now let's take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes. Good morning. Let's see. I wanted to focus on, I guess, the restructuring and kind
of how you see the pace of that activity playing out. You indicated you expect I think a stronger pace of margin
improvement in fiscal 2015 and then maybe a build in fiscal 2014, but are there any numbers that you can give us or
kind of a range of numbers in terms of how much actual restructuring cost savings would be in that fiscal 2014? Is that
$200 million or $300 million? And what you think that number might build to in terms of the restructuring driven
operating income improvement in fiscal 2015? Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hi, Tom. This is Alan. Thanks for the question. I think I'll answer two of the three parts, if that's
okay. As we noted, we only had about 40% of the people leave on May 31 as we determine how many folks we needed
to keep for a longer period of time to continue our high service levels for both internal and external customers. So, I
don't know what everybody has in their models that is in the first call, but I suspect that there were people who were
expecting to see a higher FY 2014 benefit than what I'm currently looking at, which is the right thing for the company
to do.
I will tell you this that we expect the ongoing savings when we are on an outgoing rate in FY 2016 to be well in excess
of $600 million. The cash charges or the business realignment charges from an accounting standpoint, as we said, were
$560 million in 2013. The cash outflows actually are spread out as people leave. We expect about a 21-month payback
on this program, so we're thrilled with where we are and think we've got it right in the sweet spot, but less benefit in
2014 and much greater in 2015 and 2016.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Tom, this is Dave Bronczek. I'll add to what Alan said. We talked about it at the Analyst
Meeting; the FY 2016 target of our $1.6 billion profit improvement is still on target. 75% of that accrues by FY 2015
and we're right on track to hit those goals.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Taylor Mulherin>: Hi, guys. This is Taylor Mulherin on for Justin this morning. I'm hoping to get your thoughts
on Trans-Pacific Express capacity in the trade down going forward. It's looking like Express continues to be impacted
by both demand headwinds and the trade down to the lower yielding services. So can you talk a little bit more about
your cost-cutting efforts for the line-haul network and your shift toward using more third-party resources?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave Bronczek again. We announced last quarter that we're reducing some of our
network capacity and we announced it again today for July. You saw in our numbers for the last several quarters
International Economy has been growing at double-digit rates, 11% and 12%. International Priority has been slightly
behind growth plans that we had put forward. So we've moved some of the traffic that's more lower-yielding economy
into our FTN network, pulling down our network capacity, pulling down flight hours, pulling down some fuel and
overall balancing our network and we'll continue to do that going forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow-up on that, Dave, talking about
the FedEx Trade Network, as you continue to build that, how is your pricing negotiations going with the other
third-party vendors in terms of whether we can see some more yield improvement there as we gain a little bit more
scale through that? And just if you could touch on that little bit.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, the capacity build-out is going extremely well. We're in 140 locations now in 27
countries and we continue to have great progress and great results there. We are bundling with our customers of course
the right products and the right network. So we're actually more internally focused with our customers in how we price
the products going forward. So, we're actually in very good shape there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - David Ross>: Yes, good morning, everyone. This may be a question for Chris. The new legislation passed in
New Jersey that says truck drivers must be employees. Does the multi work area contractor model or the ISP model
you switched to become impacted if that's signed into law? And are there other states that are doing anything similar or
threatening to the Ground model right now?
<A - Christine P. Richards>: This is Chris Richards. The bill as it was passed by the legislature unfairly targets
independent contractors in the transportation industry who've chosen to operate through their own small businesses. As
you know, we have only incorporated independent contractors and they all have their own employees and this law will
discourage small businesses and hamper the state's ability to maintain employment in a time when the economy is
challenging employment. So, we are confident that the administration in New Jersey is not going to be interested and
will not want to enact a law that harms small businesses at this juncture and we are working in that direction. Now, we
fully expect that there may be some other folks who might want to follow in proposing legislation in other states, but I
want to make it very clear, we are absolutely confident that these kinds of laws interfere with interstate commerce and
we will aggressively challenge any situation where such law is enacted.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Hartford with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning. Dave, I was wondering if you could provide any context or
perspective to underlying air freight trends? We know the divergence between IE and IP trends but underlying air
freight trends generally in your outlook for the second half of the year, it sounds as though tech-related customers are
slightly more confident as it relates to the back half of the year and as it relates to Asian outbound air freight. So,
wondering if you have any perspective as it relates to that?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. Let me make a couple of comments. World air cargo traffic has shown
consistent growth historically, but we've certainly seen a slowing of that in the last five years. In fact, we've seen a
decline in four of the last five years in overall traffic levels in the air cargo segment. And there are really four issues
that are driving that. One is global GDP has been growing at a slower pace. Global trade drives air cargo and has
traditionally grown faster than global GDP, but that's not been the case recently. As I mentioned, we've seen a decline
in global air cargo markets four out of the last five years and certainly higher energy prices are having an impact on
that. So, the global air cargo market has been under pressure for four out of the last five years and obviously we are
taking actions to manage our way through that, which Dave has pointed out.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah, hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Alan, can I ask you to comment
a little bit further on some of the CapEx plans? You talked about some of the growth in Ground of course, we've got
some good ROICs there, but I was a little surprised to see it up almost 18% relative to the last fiscal year. Can you talk
a little bit about the ability to sort of move that around over the course of the year, is this a hard and fast number or
maybe some insights as to why it kind of went up so much?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, the largest increase is going to be at Ground. We have to take the next – start building for
the future and we're going to develop new properties and facilities and I'll let Henry add some color to this that we've
got to start investing in now, so we can be ready for what traffic we're expecting in FY 2016 and I think it's a good
thing. These are high ROIC investments and we're happy to put it in. There is a slight increase at Express but again,
that's part of our fleet modernization and that's – those got particularly the 757s and 767s have good, good ROIC. So let
me turn it over to Henry on the Ground aspect because he's the biggest increase.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, thanks for the question. Majority of our capital is for capacity growth to support our
growth or for revenue equipment replacement, you need to know we're very disciplined about any decision we make
about capital and we're going to be very disciplined going forward.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Good morning. Yes, maybe a question just about the pace of kind of underlying business
trends within Express. You guys have announced I guess now two Trans-Pacific frequency cuts, which will at least
have partial benefit in fiscal 2014 and probably – I think you said you get some benefit of the employee separation in
the second half of the year. I guess I'm just trying to make sure I understand kind of what the pace of maybe core
profitability growth or deterioration in the Express business in fiscal 2014 or as how you guys see it in fiscal 2014 just
kind of given the guidance and some of the cost issues that you've mentioned, it feels like it's a little bit on the
conservative side, just curious your kind of thoughts there.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, Alan said it – this is Dave Bronczek. Alan mentioned it before; our operating profits
and margins are up in FY 2014 in part due to all of the issues you mentioned and then all of the other things we're
working on in our five-point profit plan, our U.S. domestic reshaping, the international profitability, our harvesting the
international acquisitions we've made and so forth. So, in Alan's guidance is an improvement at Express in both profits
and margins.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I think as far as trends go, we are not any better than anybody else at predicting the volatility of
fuel and it can have a major swing in an individual year at Express, so we're expecting that to be a headwind for
Express in FY 2014. If it goes the other way, then it is conservative, but it could also be a bigger headwind than what
we have in our plan. So, that's really the one uncontrollable factor that we are facing, but the reduced capacity will
obviously lower our exposure to that some.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me make a comment here to try to put some of this into
perspective. Seven or eight years ago, the FedEx Express segment was competing in a marketplace that today is worth
about $40 billion, just the Express segment, the very high priority, door-to-door sector. Because of the build-out of
FedEx Trade Networks that Dave Bronczek mentioned to you, we're now competing in an air cargo market in its
entirety that's somewhere around $98 billion. So, I think there's this implicit belief in the questioning that the growth of
the economy sector for FedEx is a bad thing.
In actual fact, as you saw in the numbers, the economy traffic grew 11% in the quarter; the priority traffic grew 2%. So
our issue was simply that we had too much of the priority capacity up and we needed to be more aggressive in the
economy sector and that's what Dave has done. So I think at the end of the day, that these trends are not necessarily a
bad thing, we just have to make sure, as Dave mentioned, that we've got the right traffic in the right network. It's very

similar to the Ground and Express situation.
If the item can go in the Ground system, the customer is probably going to choose that as very high ROIC, very
high-margin situation and we think over time the same will be true in the Express segment, and I think it's important
that you look at it as a segment and not just the Express business, which is the majority of the Express segment, but the
broader base business is increasing at a rapid rate again as Dave mentioned to you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I hear that you're affirming the $1.6 billion profit
improvement target, but also hearing that maybe some of the trade down issues are continuing or worse than you
thought. So I'm wondering if there's anything within that $1.6 billion that is doing better than you thought to offset the
trade down. And then just directionally, do you have views on when this trade down issue is going to stop or any signs
of it getting better or worse?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith, again. Obviously, I didn't make my point there. The Economy
business is up 11%. The Priority business is down, Mike Glenn mentioned to me, 1%. That's not necessarily a bad thing
and it doesn't necessarily mean that Express can't make more money on the Economy business, and implicit in your
question was that assumption. And I think if you go down that road you are making an erroneous assumption. So, it's
very important that you recognize that.
There's a tremendous amount of capacity in the international marketplace in these long-range, twin-engine airplanes,
particularly the 777, and if you're watching the Paris Air Show there's going to be a lot more of it with the A350 and the
777, 778 and 779. So, our FTN capabilities allow us to participate now in both of those sectors. The priority sectors
where we can have a competitive advantage with our own equipment and the broader economy sector. So, I had to
jump in here because it seemed to me like you – I didn't get my point across in my comments before.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: And this is Dave again. Let me add to what Fred said. On the cost side, we're actually doing
very well. We actually are exceeding some of our own projections on the cost side. To Fred's point, on the International
Economy the goal for us and the issue for us is to make that Economy product grow more and make more money on it
in the right network and that is absolutely what we're doing.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: This is Alan. From a strategic standpoint, you have to remember, where we built the international
aviation network expecting significantly higher growth in IP. And as we've mentioned to you several times now, that
has slowed. We still have an awful lot of IP and an awful lot of opportunity to continue to grow IP, but IE is going to
grow faster for the foreseeable future and that's what we're talking about. And as we adjust these networks, it's not a
switch. These are complicated changes. I mean it sounds easy to take down one flight. It is not. There are all kinds of
changes that go through the entire network when you do that, as well it takes FTN a while to build up its capacity to do
that. So we're doing that during 2014 and expect to really start seeing those benefits post 2014.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. When you think about the guidance, Alan, are these the mix of
cost-cutting, the 3,600 employees, was that larger than you expected to offset some of the trade downs in other areas?
Are the buckets the same? Maybe can you kind of delve into how you're viewing the cost-cutting program so far?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Okay, Ken. Well, the voluntary buyout was one piece and we had told you in October that we
thought we'd get $500 million; we're well over $600 million. We saw significantly higher tenured people take the
package, which is fine, but that also means we're going to get a lot higher returns on that. The cost trimming is beyond

just that, however, I mean there is significant going on in Express, and I'm going to turn it over to Dave to let him tell
you what he's been doing there in terms of hours and station management, et cetera. So, I feel very comfortable about
the cost piece of what we laid out for you in October and I'm very confident we're going to beat it. The issue that we've
had since October is the one we've been talking about is the less than expected IP growth and we got to adjust for that
and we will.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, just on a very high level, we're in good shape on U.S. productivity. The hours are
coming down. We're consolidating facilities, the flight hours, the fuel burn, the network capacity, so across-the-board,
it actually all adds up to improving our cost structure going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I guess I want to follow
up on maybe some of the confusion with the trade down and even get back to Bill Greene's question on CapEx. Alan,
you talk about high hurdle rates on your capital projects but I guess with where you see the market going, it sounds like
an asset-light model is the better way to serve that International Economy product. So I think part of the disconnect
here might be that we continue to put – or it looks like we're continuing to put a lot of CapEx into the Express segment.
So, how do we balance what your target ROIC rate might be for the Express segment versus putting more assets into it
relative to an asset-light model going forward that's needed for that economy package.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me say one thing before Alan makes his comment. We are
not buying any airplane capacity for growth. The airplanes that we are buying are for replacement. We're replacing the
727s and, as Alan mentioned, the last one flies Friday, with 757s, ditto the A310s. The 767s start coming in, in
September and those are very high ROIC activities with the existing volumes. It's not growth at all, and the 777s are
replacing the MD-11s over the next 10 years and I think we've got 18 more of them on order over the 10 years. So,
there is no capital in airplanes. We're not putting capital in the business for growth. We're simply replacing the assets
that we have.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I certainly understand the concern, but we have a long-term objective is to retire all of our
tri-motors. As Fred said, we found that twins are much more efficient and reliable and the numbers are very strong
there. But when you're calculating ROIC, it certainly increases the denominator when you add a brand new airplane
and you take out a fully depreciated one. We understand that. So it's not a short-term ROIC decision; it's a longer-term
ROIC decision. I would also add that just please remember that we not only retired a bunch of airplanes at the end of
last year and at the end of this year, we've also accelerated retirements of the bunch of other ones that we have. So our
capacity isn't going up any and, in fact, it may come down.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes, that's right. This is Dave again. And in that $1.6 billion number that you all saw in
October, one of the five points in the five point profit improvement, of course, is the fleet modernization and it's worth
hundreds of millions of dollars to the bottom line for profits. And to Alan's last point, the 76 planes that we've
accelerated the depreciation in the 287 engines and so forth, it's the continuing push to modernize our fleet to become
more profitable.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Hatfield with Raymond James.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Morning, everyone. Sorry to go back to the trade down issue, but as you look at that and as
you manage through that, can you talk a little bit about if there are any costs and what the dollar benefits are as you
take down one aircraft in services you talk about in July? And additionally, as you go forward is this kind of – whether
or not this accelerates or whatnot, if you continue to see this trend developing, is there something that you could or

would do from a more meaningful, say, restructuring standpoint similar to what you announced last fall and do
something like that in the international business?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. I think the problem we have is trying to answer
questions like you just asked us. We've given you the basic overall trends. The international air cargo business is not
going to go away. It's a $98 billion business. We've given you a forecast of 7% to 13% of EPS guidance and you'll just
have to trust us to know how to manage the business. So, it's getting down into that level of detail is just something
we're not prepared to do.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Art, I would add from a strategic standpoint, the trade down is more forward-looking. We had flat
IP growth year-over-year. The growth was all in IE and, frankly, since October that surprised us a bit and so we have to
adjust for that. But we still have a strong IP business but the future growth at least for the next couple of years is going
to be much higher in IE than it's going to be in IP, so that's sort of the trade down. It's not that we're losing IP packages.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: And finally, Art, this is Mike Glenn. I would just add that I think it's important to separate
how we manage our network and the concept of growth. FedEx continues to pursue a growth strategy although coming
from different segments of the market, so how we elect to move that in our network, obviously we're going to look for
the most efficient way to do that, but I think it's important not to confuse the two, how we manage the network and our
efforts to grow the business are separate issues.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Thanks. If I could just switch gears and talk about Ground where you're just doing a tremendous job
gaining share. My first question is related to the sustainability of this trend and I'm wondering how far can you push the
envelope before you see a more significant competitive response. I guess kind of more specifically, I'm wondering
about the pricing risk? And then kind of related to the pricing side, with shippers increasingly focused on containing
their own costs, I'm wondering to what extent are you seeing some resistance in rates. Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Tom, thanks for the question. Our strong results are a reflection of the structure and culture
of our operations, the speed and reliability of our service and our yield management discipline. We have a sales force
out there that does a terrific job getting every package in the right network and our customers are increasingly voting
with their dollars.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to go back to the guidance, but just wanted to get
a sense in terms of conservatism. Obviously, fiscal 2013 was tougher than expected, so how much of this guidance is
you guys setting the bar to a very achievable level and then kind of potentially seeing upside or how much really is due
to what you're not quite sure about on the fuel side of things? Is there anything that you could do to maybe more
quickly get to the higher end of the guidance?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I promise you, we don't play games like that. This is our best 50/50 shot. I will tell you that no
CFO worth his or her salt will give you the entire bell curve of potential outcomes, but this our best shot at what we see
today based on all the factors that we've talked about and we are certainly not trying to play any games here.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. Let me go back to the question regarding Ground opportunities, as
Henry pointed out, we have a very unique value proposition that is delivering industry-leading service levels and our
sales team is doing a phenomenal job of positioning that in the context of the broader portfolio of services that we offer.
I do think it's important to point out that we still have plenty of runway for growth in an overall market where we only

have, including SmartPost, about 30% market share, so there's plenty of runway there. On top of that, we do not have
our fair share in the smaller customer segment in the Ground market so there's plenty of opportunity there to grow the
business at higher-than-average yield. So, we're excited about the opportunities, we have a phenomenal service that
Ground has provided our sales and marketing team to sell and we think there's plenty of opportunity going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. Staying on Ground, could you elaborate a little bit on – or
compare and contrast B2C margins and B2B margins? And then a very impressive margin in the quarter, any
consideration for how high that can go? And then sneaking one more in, an update on Delivery Manager please. Thank
you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I would say that we have a revenue management committee. We look at every account that sales
presents to us in terms of how it fits in our network and what it means to the business, so we have a very disciplined
approach to determining an acquisition strategy in the marketplace. We at Ground are exceedingly disciplined around
yield management. It's just part of our culture and I would say that we're extremely confident that we can continue this
going forward. I think it's important when you talk about margins to understand the portfolio that we offer in the
Ground network. We have a commercial portfolio, we have a home delivery portfolio and we have SmartPost. So
SmartPost plays a very important role in dealing with those lighter weight B2C package – excuse me, residential
delivery packages and that is a key element of our value proposition that allows us to ensure that we're delivering the
right returns in the Ground segment. So, as Henry mentioned, we're very disciplined in terms of how we approach a
customer and the value proposition that we have with that in mind.
Turning to Delivery Manager, it's a major new offering for FedEx and it has the potential to change the expectations
that recipients have in the parcel delivery segment and is in the sweet spot of e-commerce. Since it was launched a few
weeks ago, using Delivery Manager over a 0.25 million packages were delivered involving the input from the recipient,
helping them get their package in their hands, when they want it, where they want it. Our large e-commerce shippers
are responding very favorably to the convenience, the visibility, the flexibility and the options that we offer through
Delivery Manager and it's allowing us to provide an improved customer experience, while certainly having a benefit on
our cost structure as well, so we're very excited about the rollout of Delivery Manager.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.
<Q - Connor Hustava>: Yeah, hi, guys. This is actually Connor Hustava on for Jack today. We've seen a few
announcements recently regarding growth in your distribution business. Can you maybe give us a sense for the scope of
your current contract logistics and distribution product offering and maybe where you think you'd like to see that go in
the future? Thanks.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. This is Dave, again. FTN is I think the group that you're referring to and
SupplyChain, two of our components inside of FedEx Express and both units are growing and both are profitable and
they're a nice bundle to the business. We can go to bigger accounts, which we've been saying all along this morning and
move the traffic into the right networks then depending on whether it's in the ocean with FTN, in the SupplyChain, in
any region of the world quite frankly that we have SupplyChain set up. So we have seen growth and we've seen it
profitably for us in both of those segments and we think that continues going forward.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah, just for those of you who are not aware of it, I mentioned this earlier. The
FedEx SupplyChain and the FedEx Trade Networks operating companies are part of the Express segment as it's
reported. But they are individual companies with their own CEOs that report back in to Dave and the reason we are

organized that way is because we have one worldwide global management team and it coordinates our customer
activities much better than if we had them in a different segment.
So sometimes that's lost and that was one of the points I was making a little bit earlier, when you talk about Express,
you've got to look at the Express segment because it has the very large Express business, but it also has and reported in
that segment is FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx SupplyChain. And FedEx SupplyChain has some very terrific
services that we rolled out in the last couple of years and it's really getting up ahead of steam. We're very excited about
it.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: And going back to the point I made, they toggle back-and-forth and they contribute back
and forth between Express and SupplyChain and FTN, and so really that's the point I'm trying to make is they bundle it
all together for the betterment of the company, so that's where we're going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Are there aspects of the new USPS airlift award other than
rates that differ from the prior agreement? For example, with the slight increase to the full share does this new
arrangement drive even greater utilization?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Yes. I'll comment on that. We're very pleased with our long-term relationship with the USPS,
obviously the service and the value we provided to them. We are the sole awardee to their entire air transport business
and we're very pleased about that. Obviously, there's more business that they had in play than just what we had to begin
with. So going forward, I think we have an opportunity to build on that relationship and build on the business that we
have with them, and as Alan pointed out, it's a seven-year agreement now going forward.

<A - Alan B. Graf>: Yes.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: So, Alan, I'm hoping you can just help us bridge the fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014. You've
mentioned some of the big pieces. You've got $200 million of help from pension, and pick a number, maybe it's a
couple hundred million help from the head count reductions. You've got $70 million negative from accelerated
depreciation. It sounds like fuel was a negative. I'm interested to know how much you're allowing from a profit
standpoint for the ongoing shift to lower yielding packages and if there's any other big pieces that I'm missing on the
walk from 2013 to 2014.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Appreciate the question. Earnings guidance is 7% to 13% of EPS off FY 2013 adjusted and that's
all we're going to talk about.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Good morning, everyone. Since everyone wants to beat the trade down question to
death, let's look at this from a different angle. I'm noticing something very interesting. Normally when you see trade
down, you see people take higher weight packages out of the system. First, because those are more expensive, you guys
obviously charge per pound for Express, yet we've seen something very interesting happening. The weight per package

has been going up, we're running at, what, 10.4 for the quarter. That's 18% higher than last year. If there's so much
trade down, why are people increasing the size, the weight of their packages? What's happening there?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, we have a lot of business that's in our numbers, Donald, in our acquisitions so there's
more weight per package in a lot of our acquisitions around the world and that may be part of what you're seeing.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the
balance of B2B versus B2C growth in both the domestic Express segment and the Ground, excluding SmartPost part of
the business?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, clearly e-commerce is a major driver of the parcel segment in the U.S., although I
would say that our growth that we've seen in the Express segment has been fairly well-balanced, and is a result of a
very targeted program where our sales and marketing team have worked very closely with the Express team to ensure
that we're getting the right kind of growth in the networks and we're very pleased with that. But there is no question that
e-commerce is continuing to be a larger and larger driver with e-commerce sales now representing a little over 10% of
total retail sales, and on top of that, e-commerce sales have a slightly higher returns rate, which also impact the
business. So, there's no question that e-commerce is a driver, but having said that, we've seen strong growth in all of
our sectors in the Ground business and home delivery and we're quite pleased with that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies.
<Q - Peter Nesvold>: Good morning. I think this was asked earlier but I don't think it was answered. You've made it
very clear that you're more or less agnostic to IP versus IE so long as the freight matches the network, but when you
look at that mix shift towards IE for the next several years, do you see that as something that's sort of semi-permanent?
Is this similar to what happened 10 years ago with domestic Air Express going to domestic Ground parcel? Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave Bronczek. Let me answer that question. I think that we do see that trend
continuing very much like the United States and the great news there is that as that IE continues to grow and we
unleash more capacity that makes us money on those products like FTN, we actually can uncap what we've been
capping because it's been sitting in our planes kind of capped before. So that trend of increasing International Economy
can continue. I think Mike Glenn mentioned it before, as a growth opportunity for us that actually makes more money
for us.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. I've mentioned this on the call before but a year ago
May, in May of 2012, I gave a speech at the Wings Club, which is an annual talk, and it's then published in a little
booklet, and it's on our investor website and I would urge you if you're interested in this to go read that speech because
it represents our view about the international cargo business. And the reality is that the last several years have seen a
sea change in international trade and in international transportation, and it has been caused by, number one, the
increased price of fuel. I mean, we are sitting around with low growth economies and the price of Brent is still north of
$100 a barrel. And people forget that 10, 11 years ago, it was a $0.60, $0.70 per gallon versus $3 and some odd cents
per gallon now. That's had enormous effects on people's thoughts about transportation alternatives, and it does make
people willing to trade-off rate for speed.
And secondly, you have policy choices that have been made in China, in the United States, and in Europe that have had
big effects on the growth in world trade. As Mike Glenn mentioned, for the first time really in modern history, you've
seen in the last couple of years, worldwide GDP grow faster than worldwide trade. And a few years ago, worldwide
trade was growing 2, 2.5 times the growth of world GDP. Now those still are huge markets as I mentioned, the world

cargo, air cargo market is a $98 billion market; the sea freight market is well north of $100 billion. So these are very
large markets. They're not going to go away, but these policy choices and fuel have had very big effects on these
markets. So, our job as managers is to change our systems to meet those and that's what we've been trying to describe
to you we've done. I'd say the one thing that we're a bit disappointed on, we probably should have moved a bit faster on
some of our capacity because we thought that the mix would be a little bit different than it ended up, but it's like
Ground and Express, we're happy to get either one and we just have to manage properly within those segment demands
from the customers.
By the way, I got a question on the Internet. Do you think that traditional aircraft product cycles are getting shorter? It
seems that the high cost of fuel is shortening the useful age of a new aircraft from 30 years to around 20 years. I think
that the answer to that question is, yes. You're seeing that with the turnover of these narrow bodies into the new
generation Airbus A320 Neos and the 737 Max and you're seeing Boeing coming out with the 777-8 and 777-9 at a
period which is much shorter against the 777-300ER than would've been the case in the past and it is driven, just as you
surmised, by the cost of fuel.
Now what it means for us is obviously we are re-fleeting, as Alan mentioned, with these more efficient twin jets
because of the utilization that we have I don't think that the twin jets are, that we're talking about, will be obsoleted by
technology in any of the foreseeable future and the 767/757 are terrific for us and the good news is also part of the
question is yes indeed we can use 767s in addition to the new ones because they're essentially the same and a lot of
767s are going to be coming out of the fleet as the 787s and A350s come into place and we do anticipate that we will
use – acquire some used airplanes which will help the capital returns in the Express business.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'll turn the conference back over to Mickey
Foster for any additional or closing remarks.

Before closing, I'd like to mention we are changing the date of our next Investors and Lenders meeting to late
September or early October of 2014 here in Memphis. Our last two meetings were two years apart, in 2010 and 2012
and this timing will allow us to continue on that schedule. We will update you on our progress through other
