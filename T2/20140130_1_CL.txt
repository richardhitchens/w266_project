MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2013
earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgatepalmolive.com. Just
a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.
And at this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor
Relations, Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.
Delia H. Thompson
Thank you, Vicki. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With me this
morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President, and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller; and
Elaine Paik, Treasurer.

This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views
and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ
materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors
should consult our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statements
on Forward-Looking Statements.
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions,
and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A as a percent to sales, operating profit,
operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the impact of certain items
described in the press release. A full reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press
release and is posted in the For Investors section of our website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
We're very pleased with our strong finish to a strong year. We exited 2013 with the strongest quarterly organic sales
growth for the year, at the high end of our targeted range of 5% to 7%. We enjoyed good gross margin growth, and this
combined with a reduction in our fixed expenses as a percent to sales allowed to increase advertising absolutely and as
a percent to sales while increasing our operating profit as well. This is, of course, a simple financial strategy that has
served us so well over many years. Cash generation was strong and our balance sheet is solid.
Our savings programs continued to deliver. Our ongoing funding-the-growth contributed significant savings. And in
addition, our global growth and efficiency program is on track both from a cost and savings perspective. For full year
2013, we realized savings of $40 million after tax, and expect that number for 2014 to be between $90 million and
$100 million after tax, or about twice as much. And we've made progress in all three areas of the program, expanding
commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions, and optimizing global supply
chain and facilities.
Market shares are strong and growing. We've maintained our leadership share of the toothpaste category, with strong
market share performance virtually everywhere in the world. Our global manual toothbrush share is up 40 basis points
to almost 33% on a year-to-date basis. And our global mouthwash share is now at 17%, up 130 basis points on a
year-to-date basis. Our relentless focus on innovation has paid off, and we have more in the pipeline for this year and
beyond.
So let's turn first to North America. We're pleased with our 3% organic sales growth in the quarter, even given the
sluggish macroeconomic environment, which resulted in slower category growth as well as the continued promotional
and highly competitive environment. As referenced in the press release, our shares are strong in a number of categories.
Good cost control and gross margin increases have allowed us to continue to increase advertising support behind both
existing and new products. Our innovation pipeline remains very full, and we have some exciting activities this quarter.
Our progress in manual toothbrushes and mouthwash in the U.S. has been excellent. We have already told you about
our record manual toothbrush share of over 38%. In mouthwash, both Colgate Optic White and Colgate Total
mouthwashes, launched within the last year and a half, have delivered a full-year combined share of 5.6%, with the
most recent read at 7%. Retail support behind Colgate Total Advanced Mouthwash has been at record levels. The
growth in the category has been totally driven by this new product and added nicely to retail sales. Over half of the
mouthwash buyers are either new to the category or trading up, which drives incrementality. And in addition, trial and
repeat rates are above previous competitive launches.
As you know, our Colgate Optic White products have been very successful, particularly as we've been able to drive the
regimen approach to toothpaste, toothbrush, and mouthwash. New to the franchise this quarter is the Colgate Optic
White Manual Toothbrush and built-in whitening pen. This product delivers all the benefits important to a whitening
enthusiast. It's effective, affordable, and convenient. The toothbrush combines stain removing and polishing bristles;
while the pen, which fits in the handle of the brush, uses a breakthrough formula with proprietary silicon adhesives.
Together, they deliver whiter teeth in two days. The super-premium pricing creates a growth opportunity for retailers
while still providing affordable whitening for the consumer.

In the Personal Care category, this quarter we are launching Speed Stick Gear antiperspirant and deodorant sticks, gels,
and body sprays. This whole line of underarm protection is targeted towards the millennial male. It comes from
distinctive premium packaging with preferred masculine fragrances and unique clinically superior technologies. The
Speed Stick Gear antiperspirants contain DryCore technology, which absorbs better for 48-hour protection. Speed Stick
Gear has been formulated to have excellent adhesion to skin and utilizes a highly effective active ingredient. As you
would expect with such an exciting new product, the launch will be supported with a full integrated marketing
campaign, including traditional media, digital, and other consumer engagement activities.
Also in the Personal Care category, we're launching SoftSoap Décor Collection liquid hand soaps. This new product
appeals to a shopper who is looking for offerings found at upscale specialty
stores at an affordable price more typical of mass retail. The Décor packaging and exquisite fragrances are inspired to a
specialty and ,while more affordable, are still premium priced to our base liquid soap lines, which drives trade-up and
incremental dollars for the retailer. Initial trade acceptance has been excellent, with full distribution at a majority of
accounts.
Turning to Europe-South Pacific, the macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging across most of Europe.
Slowdown in the Euro area has continued. While Germany and France reported a positive GDP growth, Spain, Italy,
and Greece once again reported sharper decreases. The unemployment rate remains high at 12.1% in November 2013,
even though it has been stable since April. Despite this, consumer confidence in the Euro area shows nascent signs of
recovery since the second quarter, which is a modest positive as we enter 2014. So against this backdrop, we're quite
pleased with our fourth quarter performance in this region, with positive organic volume growth of 3% and solid gross
margin and operating margin growth. In addition, as you know, many of our global growth and efficiency program
initiatives have been focused in this part of the world and are already manifesting themselves in a reduction of
overhead expenses.
Market shares year-to-date are up in toothpaste, manual and power toothbrushes, mouthwash, deodorants, and fabric
softeners. Our innovation programs throughout 2013 have been critical for our good market share performance, and we
expect this to continue into 2014 across all our categories.
In Oral Care, we will be launching Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer in select countries
this quarter. As you know, this superior anti-cavity toothpaste was first introduced in Turkey last fall and launched in
Brazil late in the fourth quarter. This leading technology is incorporated in the first and only toothpaste that directly
fights sugar acids in plaque, which are the number one cause of cavities. The patented formula helps deactivate sugar
acids before they can harm teeth, while strengthening and restoring the enamel that helps prevent cavity formation. The
initial introductions in the Nordic group of countries, Spain, and Portugal will, of course, be supported by a full
integrated marketing campaign, including a public health campaign.
In Europe, as in other parts of the world, the Whitening category is large and growing. This dynamic segment requires
continuous innovation. And so we are launching Colgate MaxWhite One Optic premium toothpaste in high impact
packaging that offers an instantly visible whitening effect. To complement the toothpaste, we are also relaunching our
Colgate MaxWhite One mouthwash, which contains an advanced stain prevention system to seal out stains and seal in
natural whiteness.
We're very pleased with the progress our Sanex business continues to make. Year-to-date market shares are up in both
shower gel and deodorant. And to help continue this momentum, we're continuing the rollout of our new Sanex Dermo
shower gels with the DermoActive 3 complex, as well as launching a new antiperspirant and a new deodorant. The first
is Sanex Dermo No Perfume, designed for consumers with very sensitive skin. The product contains no perfume, is
hypoallergenic, and delivers 24-hour protection. The second is Sanex NaturProtect Extra Efficacité, containing natural
mineral alum and anti-wetness agents which provide protection for 48 hours.
I mentioned earlier the increase in our fabric conditioner shares, up 30 basis points year over year to almost 25%. This
quarter we are rolling out in Europe a premium innovation which has met with success in France, Soupline Perfect
Glide, which has a unique formula with a polymer that allows for a perfect glide and an innovative aroma technology

that makes ironing more pleasant, even though ironing is important, but most consumers view it as a chore they don't
enjoy.
Turning to Latin America, this region exited 2013 with excellent momentum, delivering the strongest quarterly organic
sales growth of the year at 12.5%. Our leadership continues in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes, and our mouthwash
share is closely approaching the leading competitor. Our year-to-date toothpaste market share in Brazil is at a record
level of 71.5%. As you know, we launched Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar in the fourth quarter.
Early reads show a share of over 3%, which has added incremental share to our overall business. And in addition, both
Colgate Luminous White and Colgate Total toothpaste, premium priced offerings, are gaining share.
Our year-to-date toothpaste share in Mexico remains over 80% despite continued competitive promotional activity.
And our business in the traditional trade remains strong, and we are building distribution and share in the growing
pharmacy channel. Our year-to-date manual toothbrush share is up 1.5 points across the region, with every subsidiary
delivering market leadership share gains and holding the number one position. Both Brazil and Mexico achieved record
shares as we continue to offer the consumer a wide range of offerings at all price points.
Across Latin America in mouthwash, we've closed the share gap from over 20 points in 2009 to just over three points
year-to-date. Innovation has helped these results, as well as strong sampling plans across countries to maximize
category growth and increase consumption. Year-to-date our share increased over 50 basis points to 36.4%.
In Personal Care, our year-to-date market share increased in both bar soaps and deodorants, and we now lead the bar
soap market with a 29.4% share, with 29.7% in the most recent period. New products in both these categories should
help us to continue to deliver strong results.
And as elsewhere, innovation continues in the first quarter. We will, of course, continue the roll out of Colgate
Maximum Cavity Protection plus Neutrazucar toothpaste and expect to build on the success and learnings from our
Brazilian launch. In addition, we're beginning a comprehensive marketing campaign behind Colgate Total Professional
Whitening toothpaste, which promises up to 95% stain removal in two weeks. A new offering in our Palmolive body
cleansing business is Palmolive Naturals Royal Jelly and Yogurt. This new line of bar soap, shower gel, and liquid
hand soap contains ingredients well known for body cleaning solutions. Royal jelly is known to nourish the skin while
yogurt is known for its properties to soften the skin.
In underarm products, this quarter we are launching Men's Speed Stick and Lady Speed Stick Stress Defense
deodorants. Stress related sweat is produced by a different set of glands that are primarily concentrated in the underarm
area. Unlike regular or thermal sweat that is used by the body as a temperature control mechanism, stress related sweat
comes from unexpected situations. Lady Speed Stick and Men's Speed Stick Stress Defense formulas activate in those
specific sweat moments, offering effective sweat protection.
Turning to Asia, this region delivered another strong quarter of organic sales growth. And of particular note, both
China and India grew organic sales double digit despite concerns regarding slowing growth in those regions. Across the
region, our year-to-date toothpaste share increased 20 basis points. In India, our share was up 70 basis points to 54.1%,
and the strong performance was across all price points.
In China, our share increased 30 basis points to almost 34%. In this market, premium brands have performed
particularly well, our Colgate Optic White as well as some of the Darlie products, for example. Our year-to-date
manual toothbrush share increased in seven of ten countries. Our targeted efforts to increase share in India has paid off,
with our share now at almost 42%, up 240 basis points on a year-to-date basis.
Our regional mouthwash share continues to increase, up 60 basis points year-to-date to 20.1%, breaking the 20%
barrier. Our most recent share was 23.5%. China has been a particularly successful market for us. Innovation in both
the Colgate and Darlie entities has helped us achieve almost a 35% share of the market, up 260 basis points
year-to-date.
As you would expect, we have a robust lineup of new products for this quarter as well. Our on-the-ground consumer
innovation center has identified some important consumer preferences and beliefs from which they have developed two

relevant and exciting bundles. In China for instance, charcoal has long been believed to have powerful antibacterial
properties. Accordingly, last year we launched Colgate SlimSoft Charcoal toothbrushes, which has been well received.
This quarter we're launching Colgate 360 Charcoal Deep Clean toothpaste along with Colgate 360 Charcoal toothbrush.
The toothpaste addresses the consumer's concern that dirt can be left in between teeth even after brushing, by reducing
bacteria buildup by 99%, even in between teeth. The companion toothbrush offers charcoal bristles that are slimmer for
a better clean.
In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea, developed for the consumer who wants to use
mouthwash to help keep their breath fresh but who doesn't like a strong and burning mouth feel. This mouthwash
contains jasmine and tea extracts, which provide fresh breath without the burning sensation.
Africa-Eurasia, our winning on-the-ground strategies in this part of the world are resulting in strong performance as
well. Innovation has played a key role in good market share progress. While our regional toothpaste market share is up
20 basis points on a year-to-date basis, it has increased 50 basis points in Russia to almost 33%, 170 basis points in
Turkey to almost 29%, and 300 basis points in South Africa to 50%. As you know, Turkey was our lead country for our
Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer bundle. And while it is early days, initial shares are
already at 2%. In mouthwash, our regional share is at almost 20%, and is now the number two brand. More innovation
is planned for this quarter. Colgate Total Pro Interdental toothpaste, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash, and Colgate
SlimSoft Charcoal toothbrush, just to name a few.
In the Personal Care category, an interesting new product developed for the African market is Protex African Therapy.
As you know, Protex is a premium brand sold in many developing markets with an antibacterial positioning. This new
mini-line contains a unique combination of some of Africa's greatest skin secrets. It helps protect natural healthy
looking skin and comes in two variants: glycerin & African herbs and cocoa butter & lemon.
Hill's, we're very pleased with Hill's continued solid performance. This marks the third quarter of volume growth and
the strongest organic sales growth in five years. Also, while gross margin, as expected was down year over year, it
increased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and we expect that trend to continue in 2014.
Our launch of Hill's Ideal Balance continues to meet with success. Early trial and repeat results are very promising.
Now that the product is in the natural section of the large-format retailers, cannibalization of other Hill's brands is at an
all-time low, and sales of Ideal Balance are growing strong double digits. Healthy support behind the product will
continue in the first half of this year, including nutritional consultants at superstores and eye-catching pallet displays.
Our Prescription Diet business remains strong and growing. We've told you on previous calls about Prescription Diet
Metabolic. This breakthrough weight management diet is now sold in over 50 countries and sales are growing at a
healthy double-digit rate, driving our global share of the weight category up by almost two points year-to-date.
This quarter we will be launching another new Prescription Diet product, c/d Multicare Stress, for the nutritional
management of urinary tract health in cats. Stress is an important contributing factor for some urinary conditions in
cats. Prescription Diet c/d Multicare Stress has been clinically tested to reduce the recurrence of feline idiopathic
cystitis, which can arise from stress. The Q1 launch will be supported by a comprehensive in-clinic communication
plan and sampling program with veterinary professionals and their clients. The feline urinary category is the largest
feline therapeutic nutrition category globally.
So in summary, we're extremely pleased with the way that we finished the year 2013. Our organic sales growth was
strong around the world. Our gross profit margin increased, and our market shares are healthy. Colgate people around
the world are all focused on our strategies and priorities, thereby delivering these consistent strong results. Our global
growth and efficiency program is on track, as are our ongoing funding-the-growth initiatives. Our innovation pipeline is
full, and we're excited about the many new product initiatives we've just told you about. So we expect this momentum
to continue in 2014 and look forward to sharing our progress with you as we go throughout the year.
That's the end of my prepared remarks, Vicki, and now we can turn it over to questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Wendy Nicholson with Citi
Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, good morning. My first question has to do with currency. In 2012, if currency was a
400 basis point headline pressure on top line, can you tell us what it would have been roughly on EBIT and earnings?
And to the extent currency rates remain where they are now, what are you modeling for 2014; again, both on the top
and the bottom line? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Wendy. And thanks for the question. I would though, before answering it, just like to
reaffirm how we're thinking about the year 2014. As we have said before, we have been deploying the strategy that
Bina mentioned for some eight years now. And we think focusing on that, which you can say is focusing on the
fundamentals, is serving us well.
So as we look at 2014, we're thinking and planning for top line growth to continue in that 5% to 7% organic growth
range. We are looking for our gross margin to expand between 75 and 125 basis points. And that traces to a slightly
more benign commodity environment, the continued strength of our funding-the-growth program beyond plan tracking
over our global growth and efficiency program, which will also lower our overheads, allowing us to continue in 2014,
as we did in 2013, to increase our advertising absolutely and as a percentage to sales behind the rich and broad range of
new products worldwide that Bina mentioned.
Foreign exchange, as we have said before, from a top line point of view has a lower impact to the profitability point of
view. So the top line impact in 2014 we have, based on the release we sent out, a hit of 3%. And when you look at the
operating impact of that, it is near 4% to 5% on the bottom line. And I think we fairly consistently said the bottom line
impact is greater than the top line impact, and that ratio has historically been roughly the same. I would add that with
the confirmation of our comfort with the consensus of external analyst estimates, and many of them as we saw this
morning have that spot on, you're looking at dollar EPS increase around 9%, and I would say that's around 13% on a
currency-neutral basis.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And just...
<A - Ian M. Cook>: That's the way we're thinking about the...
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Just as a follow-up to that, obviously, your savings are accelerating. So in theory,
hypothetically suppose that FX impact worsened. How do you think about the tradeoffs between taking some of that
$100 million of savings and dropping it to the bottom line, or do you think if FX worsens, then the reported earnings
growth would slow?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think, Wendy, in the world we're in, we'll respond to that when the time comes. We said in our
release that the emerging news from Venezuela, while not yet clear enough to take a view, is not factored in nor any
other macroeconomic impacts which we cannot yet foresee. What I would say is that I think as we have shown in the
past, our response and communication on the view we take would be timely and comprehensive.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Terrific, thank you so much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks.

And we'll now go to the next question, which comes from Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ. Please go ahead.

<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Hi, yes. Just on the commodities, again, I think you did again repeat that you're expecting a
more benign environment this year. But we have been hearing I think from some other companies that it's becoming a
little bit more of a headwind, so maybe a little bit of color there. And maybe it's a good opportunity to give some of the
drivers of the gross margin for the fourth quarter and maybe how you're thinking about what the individual components
will be for 2014. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay, Ian. Let me start first by doing our now customary walk-through of the fourth quarter and
take that as a jumping off point. So if you take the fourth quarter of 2012, the start point is 58.6%. And if you then
work your way through, pricing gave us nothing. Restructuring gave us 10 basis points; funding-the-growth, strong at
the end of the year as it customarily is, 290 basis points. Material prices, a headwind of 260 basis points; that's a
combination of cost and transaction. A little bit of all other 10 basis points, which gets you to the 59.1% or the increase
of 50 basis points.
Now as we look at 2014, I said benign. Benign for us is around about a 1% increase in raw and packing material costs.
And the way we have thought about oil as an input is around $110, and I would say it is in that zone today. The one
thing I would stress is that, of course, with the recent foreign exchange impacts we have seen, there will be a related
increase in transaction costs, which we are of course absorbing in the plan that we have for 2014, which is going to see
our pricing at the higher end of our 1% to 2% pricing target for the year. Hello?
<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: You're welcome.
Operator
Okay, we will now go to Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer & Company.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess since we just mentioned pricing, I'll start there. In terms
of the pricing in the quarter, it looked like it was flat overall. How much of the pricing, is it easy to tell? How much of
the pricing that you took in this quarter – or the promotions in the quarter was to benefit new product launches, and
how much of that was in response to competitive activity?
And then secondly, just to follow up on Hill's, it looked like another very good quarter in the fourth quarter. Have we
turned the corner there on profitability? And should we see a return to more 2012 levels in terms of margins and EBIT
there? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay. Thanks, Joe. For us, the mix effect, we had dollar-weighted volume, so mix effect is in the
volume growth. So when you think about pricing, for us what you see across the divisions is pricing up in the emerging
markets, obviously beginning to address the transaction impact, and pricing in Europe and North America beginning to
react to the promotional environment we are in correspondingly negative. I think the good news is that the organic was
still 6.5% and that volume is very strong at 6.5%. And I think very importantly, as we think about our marketing mix
modeling, notwithstanding that position in the fourth quarter, our gross margin was still up 50 basis points, right in the
middle of the guidance we gave there.
So as we think forward and as we have said many, many times, our innovation seeks to deliver premiumization and
therefore be accretive to gross margin by developing ideas that consumers believe they get good value for the premium
they pay. On the other hand, from a promotional point of view, we don't seek to chase what we think are unsustainable
promotional efforts that simply load pantry that won't take growth out of future quarters, although we will selectively
adjust to defend our market share where we feel we need to.
And Hill's, we are very pleased with the consecutive quarterly performance on Hill's. We think it traces, as we have
said before, to a growing portfolio of very competitive innovation in the early periods catch-up. But I think as Bina
went through both on the last call and this call, you're now beginning to see, I think, some innovative market-leading
innovation on the Hill's business. And as we said on the last call, we expect that innovation profile to continue on Hill's.

Gross margin is a rebuild on Hill's, and we increased gross margin third quarter to fourth. And again, as Bina said
earlier, we expect that to continue into 2014. So we're pleased with the pace, and we plan to continue that momentum
in 2014.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: That's helpful. Thanks again.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Sure.

We'll go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi, just one point of clarification. The comment about the sequential improvement in
Hill's margins versus Q4's level, is that as you move throughout the year in 2014, or is that more just looking at Q1
versus Q4?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It's looking at the Q1 versus Q4.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And then I was hoping you could walk us through what you're seeing from a macro
perspective as you look across the various emerging markets geographies; any changes in consumer spending or impact
on your categories? And some of the volatility in January, are you seeing any fallout from that? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The data we have from the category is fourth quarter data. It seems to be the topic du jour, the
emerging markets. And as we look around our world, and we have had several of our executives traveling the world, I
would say we are seeing consistently what we said on the third quarter call, which if you go around the world is
basically to say that our categories, and I stress we're talking our categories, not the macros or general industry basket,
our categories continue to grow mid to high single digits in those emerging markets, which is pleasing. In the North
American environment, our categories are growing around low single digits, around 2%. And as Bina said, in the fourth
quarter we saw that slow a little bit.
And as we have said before, and it's a view we continue to take on Europe, notwithstanding a certain amount of
growing enthusiasm for a macro turnaround, the overall category growth in Europe is essentially flat, with some
categories modestly up and other categories down. And we continue to expect that to be the case for the next several
years, which was why when we embarked upon our global growth and efficiency program, we said and you've already
seen some of it announced, that the impact would be disproportionate to Europe because we wanted to right-size our
cost structure against likely more muted category growth in the medium term, and that's exactly what we're doing. So I
would say the world continues in our businesses to be pretty much the way we saw it in the third quarter, and current
data shows no overall change to that.

<Q - William B. Chappell>: Ian, I just want to make sure. On the Max Cavity with Sugar Acid, I think the comment
was you're moving into Spain, Portugal, and the Nordic countries this quarter. I was just trying to understand. I was
under the impression you were looking more at developing regions for that first before you moved into developed. So is
that a change? And maybe give me an update of what countries you do plan to go into this quarter. I think Bina

<A - Ian M. Cook>: The answer to that, Bill, is we're doing a few things. I have said before, we have said before that
we do think the biggest opportunity is in the emerging markets. Clearly, we're using Turkey and Brazil to see the pace
of growth we can get there. The European entrance is really to see in a fairly simple regulatory environment what
marketplace potential that product may have. As the year unfolds, you will continue to see more of a focus on the
emerging markets. And the only reason we didn't mention it is that we didn't want reveal, and still don't, when and
where those entries would be.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Okay. And then just to make sure I understand, you go in. Is the entry margin accretive?
Is this a higher margin product than what you're replacing?

We'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks, good morning. Earlier on the call, you batted down some concerns with respect to growth
and trade-up opportunity in China and India, which was helpful. But are there other markets where you are seeing some
pushback? It certainly sounds like growth in Brazil is balanced with growth in the anti-cavity and Neutrazucar as well
as Luminous in total, but what about Mexico and other key countries?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, I think, I guess there are two factors here. Consumers, and I think this is the duty of a
consumer marketing company, are prepared to buy things that work and deliver a benefit that they see a value in, and
we don't believe that that is limited to certain countries. We believe that one can develop products that deliver those
benefits and that consumers are prepared to pay for. And I would say without being too cliché, that's a global statement.
So premium innovation can work anywhere, and I think it's our duty and our challenge to keep finding ways to make it
work.
In certain parts of the world, you see promotional activity stepped up, as perhaps some people chase market share. And
the view we have taken on these things is that all you are really doing is advancing purchases, that that is not a
sustainable position to take. Now as we manage our business planning, we obviously manage a repertoire of activities
that includes the premiumization, that includes an intelligent response to the marketplace environment we have. And
very much in those emerging markets where the down-trade consumer struggles with cash, we put enormous focus on
sizing and the pricing that goes with that sizing in order to provide an affordable entry point to those consumers. But
even if on a per meal basis they're actually paying more for the product, you are meeting their cash outlay needs, so it
can be accretive from a margin point of view and address the consumer. So all those three things are in play as we think
about our business plans market by market.

<Q - Chris Ferrara>: I was hoping I could get your perspective on Latin American pricing. I guess so the gap between
price and FX, where there's usually some relationship, I guess is almost as wide as it's been ever in the last 20 years.
And each time it's been this wide, it's gone the other way; it's bounced back, right? So you go back to 2002, 1995,
you've basically taken pricing to cover the currency later. So I was just wondering if you can give a little insight into
whether there's any difference in the relationship between those two things today relative to those historical periods that
would make us think it wouldn't bounce in the future? And I know Venezuela's a piece of it, maybe some price is –
actually looks more like mix or volume today. But I was wondering if you could just comment on that?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, it's a difficult question to answer crisply. But you would have to say that Venezuela is
definitely a piece of it because that is a constraining factor on pricing given the regulations that are in place today. And
equally, one has to say Argentina, while intelligent movement can be made, it has not been with the freedom that
maybe history would have allowed.
And the second point to make is there is always a lead/lag to your ability to take pricing. And frankly, in today's world
you see such a rapid shift in foreign exchange as opposed to a steady erosion that can be reacted to in a timely fashion
that I think yes, one will see a catch-up. But there is a lag to the catch-up, and Venezuela and Argentina are outliers in
that regard from a Latin American point of view. So I hope that was clear.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Yeah, that helps. And I guess just a quick follow-up on Venezuela. The news you're talking
about, just to make sure I have it right, is this basically the announcement that the SICAD rate could be at 11.3 bolivars
per dollar instead of the 6.3 bolivars per dollar that we've seen?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It is. It is, Chris. And the fact of the matter is, there is not enough clarity yet to make a definitive –
or come to a definitive conclusion as to how that is going to affect the business because you've got translation, you've
got historical costs like inventory, and you've got the costs to bring in raw materials and finished goods. And there is
not yet enough definition around all of those things to take a view. But it is indeed that news that we are referring to.
And as we said in our release, we're still reviewing and assessing to take a position there.

<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yes, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Nik.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: If you could just talk – hey, how are you? If you could talk about any early insights from some of
the Turkey test market or from Brazil on the anti-cavity product in terms of what's going on with category growth? Is it
trade-up? Any perspective you can share on just the dynamics around that product launch?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: First I have to say it is very, very early days, and I think getting too excited is never a good thing
ever, in my view. But I would tell you that from a distribution point of view, I would tell you from a build-of-market
share point of view, and the early trial curve, they have been very good in both countries. We have not yet seen the full
impact of the marketing plans. We have not yet felt the benefit of the sorts of public health programs we're putting in
place, nor do we have a repeat number. But early indications are growing category, growing share, and certainly a
premiumization in that segment. So we'll keep you posted on how things unfold.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Great, thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up, unrelatedly, just from a competitive
intensity standpoint, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier; I had to hop off for a second. But as you look across all of your
very heavy share markets, when you're 70% to 80% share, are you seeing some of the competitive intensity settle out or

stabilize? I'm just trying to get an understanding of what some of the competitive behavior has looked like recently.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, I guess I would say as a general view, there seems to be more promotional activity in the
developed world, and maybe that is people chasing a greater share of a pie that is not growing so fast or, in the
European case, not growing at all. I would say overall in the emerging markets, nothing that we would point to, to say a
dramatic difference in competitive activity, some country-to-country changes that we have observed, not enough to
conclude a trend. And I think we're meeting that hopefully intelligently and well. We're seeing our share in Brazil up.
We're seeing our share in Mexico hold over 80%. We're seeing our share in Russia over 33%. We're seeing our share in
China up to 35% and our share in India over 54%. So I think we're balancing meeting the activity and yet bringing the
innovation that provides true growth, both from a category point of view and a market share point of view. But the big
picture answer would be nothing to say there has been a noticeable trend change.

And we'll go to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Alice.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Hi, couple of follow-up questions on pricing. Overall it was flat this quarter and yet you're
projecting I think 2% for next year. So could you specify more where that acceleration is coming? And also, this is
about 2014, North America, your organic sales growth was 3%. Is that something that's reasonable to expect for next
year? And in answering that, can you talk about whether you think you'll start gaining share in toothpaste? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, okay, Alice. Well, the pricing that we will recover in 2014 will, of course, be global
pricing. But I think it would be fair to say, given the transaction impact, the bias for that pricing would be more in the
emerging markets. We are pleased with our North American organic growth prospects. The U.S. market share is one of
many market shares that we have around the world. And as we said on the last call, there has been a, shall we say,
slightly elevated promotional environment, some of which we are choosing to respond to, and some of which we have
not and will not because we don't think it's reasonable. I do think we will see market share improve over the balance of
this year.
But I would make the comment when you're thinking about a global business, you're going to have situations from time
to time where certain geographies face short-term pressures. But if you take the long-term view in terms of our share,
whether it's North America or the world, you see pretty strong progress. And you raised toothpaste. As Bina mentioned,
we're up to 7% now in mouth rinse and we're fully global in that business, a 7% share in the U.S. And of course, our
toothbrush leadership share is now over 38%. So we will do what is right by the business, and we believe that will lead
to share growth. But we're not going abandon sensible business principles just to chase market share.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Ian, are you going be more second half weighted for EPS growth this year?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I wouldn't comment on that, Alice. I wouldn't comment on that.

<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, so just a first clarification. Moving from 6% EPS growth you delivered in 2013 to the 9% in
2014, I think from your mosaic of your commentary, it sounds like it's more really gross margin driven, particularly
cost cutting and FX, so just a clarification there.
And then what I've noticed is that a lot of the questions have to do with this volume/price differential. I know you guys
have resisted breaking out volume between true volume and mix. But given that there are just so many new products
coming out, it's actually pretty tough for us to figure out what actually is going on in your top line. So can you give us a
sense of quantifying maybe how much of that 10.5% in the emerging markets is your overall volume number,
quote/unquote, is mix versus true volume, or how much premiumization you get when you on average put out a new
product, or just something of that nature, and why it's tough for you guys as opposed to every other company to split
out that volume and mix within that number?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: To come back to your point of clarification, yes, I would say the bold headline is that is a fair
conclusion. We will see improvement in our gross margin. We will see improvement in our overhead, driven by the
global growth and efficiency program, allowing us to increase absolutely and as a percent to sales our advertising. And
as I said, although it's 9% from a dollar point of view, it's 13% from a local currency point of view.
And as far as we're concerned, Ali, the way we have for many, many years explained the top line growth of our
company is we think translatable. You see what the organic is. You know what the pure [ph] SBI (53:48) is, and
organic is organic. So it's in the numbers. And we think an ability to deliver 5% to 7% organic growth consistently and
by expanding our gross margin, delivering healthy bottom line growth is a reasonable and sensible model.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So I think the direction is clear on it in terms of the growth. It's just difficult to know how much is
actually volume growth versus premiumization because one could argue one has a different longevity than the other.
But okay, so anyway I'm not going to win that battle today.
To switch on Hill's, can you give us a sense of what's going on, particularly in Japan? And also just back to this margin
question, there was a time when the belief was that these margins can go back to historical levels. I just want to
double-check that and make sure you still feel that. And in that answer, if you could, the margin degradation we've
seen, how much of that is promotional spend, so that could go away, versus how much is the ingredient cost on Ideal
Balance is very different, and that will remain for a while? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Ali. I think first let's take the Hill's business overall and then the Hill's business gross
margin in Japan. I have to say we are pleased with the Hill's progress in a relatively short period of time. Remember,
the U.S. is the largest part of that business by a long way. And we believe that we have the portfolio now and the
innovation stream to remain competitive not just in the U.S., but in other parts of the world going forward. We have
said clearly and the plan we have built was to return the Hill's gross profit over the coming years to historical levels,
and that remains the plan. We have seen the quarter-on-quarter increase third to fourth. We talked that that would
continue into 2014 starting with the first quarter, and therefore that will continue out in time. And of course, the
innovation we are bringing gives us the opportunity to use the mix to further increase the gross margin. So the answer
on that question is yes. It is our plan to get back to historical levels, and we're on plan, and we feel good about that.
In Japan, which is not an enormous part of the Hill's business, we have had some market issues from a distribution and
a portfolio competitiveness point of view. And the innovation work that we have done, driven by the U.S., is being
deployed in Japan in 2014 along with some go-to-market changes. And we believe that that will correct the business in
Japan over the coming little while.

<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi, Ian. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey. I don't know if this is purposeful or not, but it seems like regionally, when one region
starts to show accelerated margins, others fall. So the North America margins, for instance, now they're hovering above
30%. But there has been obviously a fallback in Latin America and some other regions. So is that part of the broader
strategy that we're going to focus on North America from a cost perspective, from a mix perspective? When that runs
its course, we're going to move to the next one, or is this the natural progression of things?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I would say, Bill, it's the natural progression of things. We don't rotate businesses across divisions
in such a manner. No is the answer to your question.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay. So the operating margin North America at 30%, is that hitting against the natural
resistance level of how high margins can go, or do you think there still is more room there to get it up? And then I
guess conversely, obviously, the African business is still very much in investment growth phase because it's much
earlier on in the consumption curve. But could that be the big upside maybe if that 30% starts stabilizing?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: As you know, we don't tend to get into discussions on EBIT because it depends where the timing
of innovation by geography. So I would simply bring you back to the gross margin. And there, our objective is to grow
gross margins in all divisions year upon year. And you know that our gross margin in the emerging markets is higher
than the developed. So that will continue to be our plan. And then depending on the timing of events, the EBIT margin
will be what the EBIT margin will be. And we don't tend to think or talk about lines of resistance on the gross margin.
When we get to 65%, we'll have another discussion.

And we'll go to Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone; first a clarification.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Javier.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: How are you? What is your current exposure to Venezuela as of the fourth quarter in terms of
profit? My real question has to do again with this pricing topic that has been going on throughout the conference call. It
has to do with, it seems from the outside that you're being conservative in Latin America in terms of pricing. And at the
same time, it looks as if, when we look at Europe, very negative pricing. We don't know whether these are real price
cuts or these are increases in trade spending. But help us understand why you seem to be investing in terms of pricing
in a region like Europe that has very little to offer going forward in terms of growth, and at the same time you seem to
be leaving pricing on the table in Latin America. At least this is the way that I see it from the outside. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, well, Javier, let's start with the exposure. I think from a Venezuela point of view, we have
been very clear in our 10-Qs as to the exposure that Venezuela represents from a total point of view. And from an
operating margin point of view, it's 3%. And so that's what Venezuela represents. I think in response to an earlier
question, the question mark around pricing conservatism in Latin America, as I said earlier, Venezuela regulations
currently don't permit across-the-board pricing. So we take what we can when we can. And the same is the case for
Argentina. And then you have the customary lead/lag between the deterioration of exchange rates and your ability to
price to offset the transaction costs.
In Europe, it's just a practical reality, Javier. The environment in Europe is basically no growth. And that brings
pressure from retailers and competitors perhaps who have more of a footprint in Europe than we who want to wrest

market share. And so we deploy the same strategies that we deploy, and we have seen terrific progress on gross margin
from a European point of view. And therefore, as we think about marketing mix, we will do more at the store level in
Europe than in other parts of the world. And that comes in the pricing line and not in the advertising and promotion
line.
And if you look at our market share performance in Europe, we think we've got the balance relatively right. And that is
why – because our market shares have been going up in Europe from an Oral Care point of view particularly, and that
is why our focus in Europe is on structural costs so that we can right-size the structure to reflect the top line as reality
will have it be and not go chase that top line, but rather grow more aggressively from an organic point, as you have
seen in the emerging markets, where we're growing double digit. So it's a case of balancing against the market realities,
and I guess that's the answer.

We'll go to Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Michael, your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. Sorry, I was on mute. Good morning, Ian. My question relates to geographic mix
and what you're factoring in for 2014 really in your outlook. Given that you have some very high margin businesses in
Latin America and in parts of Asia where currencies have been most under pressure, I was just wondering how you're
looking at the impact of the geographic mix for 2014.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Michael, actually we're quite pleased as a matter of strategy with our geographic mix. We still
believe that having 53% of our business in the emerging world pays us a dividend from a growth point of view with
categories growing in the mid to high single digits compared to low single digits in North America and essentially flat
in Europe. So we like that. And when we released our earnings, and indeed I've said earlier on this call, we're happy
with the focus on our current strategy. We think it has served us well for the last eight years.
So with the geographic mix we have, we are looking to continue a top line growth rate of between 5% and 7%, which
obviously will be more accelerated in the emerging markets than it will be in the developed markets, just as we have
seen this year. And with our funding-the-growth program and the global growth and efficiency program, be able to
provide the funds to invest in advertising, absorb the transaction impacts of the foreign exchange changes so far
announced and which many of you have already captured, and still deliver a 9% EPS growth or 13% on a
currency-neutral basis. So that's how we think about our split in the world.

and you will see a multiyear plan unfold in the United States. And of course, the objective is to get the market share up.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Great. Okay, thank you. And just completely unrelated, I just wanted to make sure I
read the statement in the press release correctly about currency. Your current outlook has taken into account some of
the dramatic moves that we've seen in emerging market currencies in the last 10 days or so, excluding Venezuela. But
all the other craziness out there you have factored into your outlook?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The craziness so far, yes. And you captured it perfectly in your note. Yes, you read it right.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah.

And we'll go to Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. Just two questions, one is a follow-up on FX. If we exclude...
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I lost you, Connie.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: That better?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It is now. But whatever you said after, if we conclude, I didn't get.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. So if we exclude the special cases that are Venezuela and Argentina from FX,
there is so much fear these days of a contagion of all the currencies falling. Do you think that's realistic, or does your
experience, since there was the Asian contagion, tell you differently about the current environment?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: To be candid, Connie, I think you're asking the wrong person. The notion of contagion of
emerging market currencies is not an area of expertise that I would have, so I wouldn't care to forecast.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: And are the people that you consult about this – I'm just wondering if this is a media
construct or if it's something you're seriously dealing with.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think my experience over the last five years with foreign exchange is that everybody knows after
the fact. And but coming into any year, projections, which usually have a broad array of differing opinions, are usually
wrong. So we have taken multiple opinions, and you can get the answer to the question that you want and we would
rather react. Obviously, one plans. It's not that one doesn't plan, but people coming into the year predicting Turkey,
predicting Ukraine, events in Thailand, as we have said multiple times in prior years, so many of the things that happen
in our world these days, even some of the best minds don't know about it until after they have what happened. So we do
run models and we do have discussions and we do take points of view. But it's something that we wouldn't care to
predict.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay, that's helpful. And just one entirely different question, what does your market
research tell you the appeal is of highly flavored toothpaste, such as mint chocolate and vanilla mint, that are coming on
the market next month? And would you be playing in those categories?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, I haven't tried – I like mint and I like chocolate mint in ice cream. I must say I have not
tried the product I think you're referring to Connie. We have seen in different parts of the world attempts to come with,
shall we say, very differentiated non-traditional toothpaste flavors, whether they be fruits or other things. And so we
will be monitoring, as we have done in other cases, with interest the performance. But I guess rather like our view on
foreign exchange, we have no definitive answer to that question either.

And we'll now go to Caroline Levy with CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Good morning, Ian and Bina. Actually, it's good afternoon I guess.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It is, yes.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Just a couple of things. Again on the North American margin, which is the highest in the
world, which is a little different from some multinationals, and you said the gross margin is higher outside. But do you
see upside to your North American EBIT margin over time? Do you see steady growth there?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Again, Caroline, you may have missed my prior answer. We don't comment on EBIT projections
for the company. You can rest assured that our focus continues to be to get the gross margin up, as you said, and with
the global growth and efficiency program to lower our overheads. That therefore provides one the opportunity to invest
some of those funds and bring other of those funds freed up to the bottom line. And we will make those choices as we
go forward.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Got it. And then in funding-the-growth, is there any geographic skew to that to where those
savings happen?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It depends from year to year, Caroline. Generally, they're pretty broad based both by geography
and by category. Some years you may have a particular initiative that is powerful in one particular category or for one
particular geography, but usually they're pretty broad based.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Great. And my final question would just be on GDP growth and demand for toothpaste. It
would be intuitive that you'd be less sensitive to swings in demand in other categories. But if China's GDP growth goes
from 9% to 5%, God forbid, but if it is 5%, would you expect that you would still be growing your business just
because of the lack of penetration of toothpaste usage?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, Caroline, it's interesting. I would say, over many years we have not seen a very strong
correlation between modest slowdowns in GDP and the purchasing of our products. If we look, as I said earlier, at the
emerging markets, even in Brazil with the GDP slowdown, our categories are still growing mid to high single digits.
And I think that's a combination of the still emerging middle class, our ability to increase penetration, our ability to
educate to increase usage, and our ability to trade up intelligently consumers in the business. So whilst one can't say
they're completely decoupled, there's no empirical evidence, at least on our data, that it directly affects our categories.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Thank you so much. That's very helpful.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thank you.

And we'll go to John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. I'll try to keep this quick. The 13% currency-neutral earnings guidance is very
impressive, particularly given the difficulties out there. Was that in line with what you were thinking before in October
when you guys first gave guidance, or have things changed to maybe try to offset some of the incremental impact?
Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It was entirely driven, John, by the foreign exchange slide that started in the middle of January.
So when we were looking at the world in the fourth quarter, we genuinely were thinking and planning for double-digit
in dollar terms. And as I said earlier, and many people externally, to your point, in the notes we have seen already,

reflected those exchange movements, excluding Venezuela, as we discussed earlier. And so therefore, that change came
subsequent to the way we were thinking about the year and indeed talking about the year when we last spoke in
October.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Well, Ian, that's great. Ian, I guess my question was, was 13% always the number on a
currency-neutral basis, or did that actually move up a little bit?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It probably moved up slightly, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, thank you.

We'll now go to Jon Andersen with William Blair.
<Q - Jon R. Andersen>: I guess most of the questions that could have been asked have already been asked, but I'll
focus on online shopping. I wanted to know how meaningful that channel is for you today. Is it growing faster than
other parts of the business? And I guess the second part would be, what's your strategy and approach to the online
channel? Are there advantages there that you're looking to take advantage of, lower costs, better margins, better
targeting with consumers? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Jon, obviously, it's much in the press area. We are today delivering our toothpaste using drones to
people in Manhattan. That was a joke, Jon, or an attempt at a joke. It is a high-growth area, but it is still an extremely
small part of our business today. We participate with all of the major online shopping portals, whether they be linked to
a brick-and-mortar retailer or whether they be standalone, both here, Europe, and in China. For some businesses, we
see the potential as greater. Take Hill's, where you have fairly large bags of Pet Nutrition product in an urban area in
Europe, we see greater potential for online. So we have a multi-point strategy, but there's an awful lot of we call them
tests-and-learns to see how we can engage and connect with the consumer. So we're experimenting broadly, but it is
still not a meaningful part of our business, albeit with some potential on Hill's in Europe.
<Q - Jon R. Andersen>: Thanks again. I'll wait for the drones.
Operator
And we'll take our last question today from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. So I had a question on pricing. No, I was just kidding. I
think we've beaten that horse enough. Actually, most of the questions have been asked. So I just want to turn to the
balance sheet really quickly. Your leverage ratio is incredibly low. What prevents you from taking on more leverage,
whether it be to buy growth, invest in growth, or return some cash to shareholders?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think, Jason, it's funny. I think about the year leading into the subprime, and the questions were
remarkably similar. Why don't you leverage up and do something? Our general thinking on this space is that you've
seen our debt move up a little bit, although it's still very low, 7.5% of our market capital, and our ratio is in a good
place. I guess the view we tend to take is that we like to keep our powder dry should an acquisition candidate present
itself.
As we think about 2014, obviously, we have not yet taken a decision. Our board has not yet taken a decision on our
dividend. We do that a little bit later in this year, but you can imagine that our dividends would grow in line with
earnings this year. Our share buyback was around $1.5 billion, and we're thinking in the same range for 2014 unless

that appropriate acquisition candidate presents itself. And that's rather if we were to prioritize where beyond dividend
we would see the money going on the sense that it is strategically of value to the company. The problem is, as you
know, that an M&A strategy or execution of an M&A opportunity is often a long and arduous and very unpredictable
process, so they cannot be done at will. And of course, during the years of the restructuring program, we have seen our
CapEx increase as we are putting in place some significant projects for the future. And bluntly, that's the protocol we'd
like to keep and plan to keep going forward.
<Q - Jason M. English>: So are you activity pursuing M&A, or are those comments just meant to reflect your
willingness were the right asset to come to market?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: It depends what you mean by pursue, Jason. I don't think you would have to do an awful lot of
detailed work to know the kinds of companies, businesses that are attractive to people in the consumer products space.
GABA was a multiyear journey. So I think the most appropriate way to answer the question is to say that were the right
opportunity to present itself, we would actively consider it, obviously, at the right valuation.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Great, thanks a lot, guys.
