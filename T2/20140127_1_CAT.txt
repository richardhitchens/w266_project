MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar Full-Year and Q4 2013 Results Conference Call.
At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and
comments following the presentation.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael L. DeWalt
Thank you very much and good morning, everyone and welcome to our year-end earnings call. This is Mike DeWalt,
Caterpillar's Vice President of Strategic Services. On the call today, I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug
Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. And this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., any use,
recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly
prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor Section of our
Caterpillar.com website in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that
could cause our actual results to differ material from the forward-looking information, and the discussion of some of
those factors that individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can
be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February of
2013 and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release. Now, in addition to that, there's
a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, and that can be found in today's financial release, which has also been posted
on our website at Caterpillar.com.
Okay. Let's get started. And this morning I'll be covering four main topics before we get to the Q&A. And they are
fourth quarter financial results, a recap of 2013, the 2014 sales and profit outlook, and I'll start this morning with the
fourth topic, and that's the $1.7 billion of stock repurchase that we're expecting in the first quarter and a new $10 billion

stock repurchase authorization that we announced this morning.
Now, to set the stage for stock repurchase, it's good to know that we had a great year for cash flow in 2013 and finished
the year with a strong balance sheet. We set a new record for Machinery and Power Systems operating cash flow at
about $9 billion, and that was about $1 billion more than the previous record from 2011. We ended 2013 with the
Machinery and Power Systems debt-to-capital ratio of 29.7%. That's an almost eight-full-percentage points below
where we ended 2012 and our lowest debt-to-cap in more than 25 years. You have to go back to 1987 to find a lower
one. 2013 was also a year where we repurchased $2 billion in Caterpillar stock and last year we raised the quarterly
dividend by 15%.
2013's cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet underpin this morning's announcement that we expect to
complete our existing stock repurchase authorization and our board's approval for a new $10 billion program. So,
record cash flows, strong balance sheet, $2 billion of share repurchase in 2013, plus another $1.7 billion expected this
quarter, and a new $10 billion authorization. We think that's all great news for shareholders and a reflection of strong
operational performance in 2013, and our confidence in the long-term.
Okay. Let's move on to fourth quarter results. And certainly while 2013 was a tough year, we're pleased to be ending it
on a more positive note; with sales and revenues nearly $700 million above our outlook and profit $0.25 a share above
the outlook. For the quarter, sales and revenues were $14.4 billion, and that's about $1.7 billion or about 10%, below
the fourth quarter of 2012, which was $16.1 billion. Profit per share was $1.54, and that's up $0.50 a share from the
fourth quarter last year. Now while profit is up, we did have two large items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012
that had a sizable impact on profit. We had the $580 million goodwill impairment; that was negative to profit, about
$0.87 per share last year. But we had a $300 million favorable tax settlement in 2012, and that helped profit by $0.45 a
share. So if you exclude those two large items, our quarter-over-quarter profit per share improvement was about $0.08.
Now for sales, more than all the quarter-over-quarter sales decline was in Resource Industries which is principally
Mining. Resource Industries sales were down 48% from the fourth quarter of 2012, and that substantial decline was a
result of both lower demand from Mining customers and from changes in dealer inventory. While Resource Industries
sales in the fourth quarter were well below the fourth quarter of 2012, they were about the same as the previous quarter,
and that was the third quarter of 2013. Sales in each of the past two quarters have been roughly $3 billion for Resource
Industries, and I'll talk about the 2014 outlook in a few minutes, but it's worth noting at this point that the $3 billion a
quarter that we've seen for the past couple of quarters for Resource Industries is about where we're expecting to average
in the outlook for 2014; probably a little below $3 billion a quarter in the first half and a little better in the second half.
On a much more positive note, fourth quarter sales in Construction Industries were up 20% from the fourth quarter of
2012. Power Systems sales were up 5% and Financial Products revenues were up 3%. That's great news, and that
demonstrates balance in our business. While we serve a number of cyclical industries, they don't all move the same way
at the same time. And it's great that Construction and Power Systems were up. Now excluding the goodwill impairment
that happened in the fourth quarter of 2012, operating profit declined about $166 million. That's $166 million on a sales
and revenues decline of about $1.7 billion, and there were certainly a number of puts and takes, but overall we're
pleased with our operational performance and the decremental operating profit pull-through of about 10% in the fourth
quarter.
Manufacturing costs were favorable $480 million versus the fourth quarter of 2012, and SG&A and R&D were
favorable combined about $200 million. Cost performance was the main driver of the good decrementals. And that was
in a quarter where we didn't get any help from price realization, which was about neutral, and our sales mix was
unfavorable because more than all of the sales decline was in Resource Industries and because of Mining. Bottom line
for the quarter, Resource Industries was down, but Power Systems, Construction and Financial Products were all better
than the fourth quarter of 2012.
Okay. So that's the quarter. Let's move on to a recap of the full year, which was a tough one particularly for our
Resource Industries segment. Back in January of 2013, when we started the year and provided our first outlook, the
midpoint of our 2013 range expected sales and revenues to be down from 2012. In fact, sales in 2013 were down and
the decline in Mining sales in our Resource Industries segment was much more significant than we had expected. As a

result, we ended 2013 with sales about $10 billion or 16% below 2012. And of that $10 billion, about $8 billion was in
Resource Industries and about $1 billion each was in Construction and Power Systems.
Now as a result of that $10 billion sales decline, profit was down as well, from $8.48 a share in 2012 to $5.75 in 2013.
While profit was down, our operational performance for the year was good. Our decremental operating profit
pull-through was less than 30% and that was despite a major headwind from product mix. With most of the year's sales
decline coming from relatively high margin Mining products, the sales mix headwind on profit was about $750 million
in 2013 versus 2012. We also had a sizable headwind from negative cost absorption, and that was related to our large
inventory reduction in 2013.
We had good performance despite those headwinds because we took action on costs. Excluding the cost absorption
impact from inventory, our manufacturing, R&D and SG&A costs were collectively down $1.2 billion in 2013. That
$1.2 billion improvement was a result of favorable material costs, lower incentive pay, short-term actions that we took
like temporary plant shutdowns and rolling layoffs, and as the year progressed, we started on more structural actions.
The restructuring actions that we took in 2013 resulted in nearly 2,000 fewer management and support employees,
4,500 fewer production employees and the closing, downsizing, or consolidation of a number of manufacturing
facilities.
While those restructuring actions spanned the company, they were more concentrated in Resource Industries. We
incurred $200 million of restructuring costs in 2013, of which about $130 million was in the fourth quarter, and we're
expecting another $400 million to $500 million in 2014. I'll talk a bit more about that when I cover the 2014 outlook,
but before I do that, I didn't want to end this recap of 2013 without giving a little rest of the story.
While 2013 was a year overshadowed by the big drop in Mining, there were a lot of good things that happened at
Caterpillar. First, while mining was negative, we're a diverse company; we serve a wide range of industries across the
globe and while sales declined in Construction, in Power Systems, that decline was small compared with Resource
Industries. Power Systems' profit was within $50 million of its 2012 record and our Financial Products segment
delivered record profit in 2013. The fourth quarter of 2013 top line for Construction, Power Systems and Financial
Products and their bottom lines were better than the fourth quarter of 2012.
I mentioned it earlier, and I think it's worth mentioning again; it was a great year for cash flow. We set a new record for
Machinery and Power Systems operating cash flow at $9 billion. We repurchased $2 billion of Caterpillar stock in 2013
and we raised the dividend by 15%. We ended with a strong balance sheet with over $6 billion in cash and the lowest
debt-to-capital ratio in 25 years.
It was also a year of inventory correction for both us and for our dealers. We reduced our inventory almost $3 billion
and dealers reduced their inventories by more than $3 billion. They were significant sales and production headwinds in
2013, but we think the significant impact on our sales is largely over. That doesn't mean that every quarter will be
exactly flat, but overall for the company, we don't believe that inventory changes will be a big story in 2014 like it was
in 2013.
In 2013, we also improved our market position for Cat machines again and made particularly strong gains with
excavators in China. And speaking of China, our total sales and revenues there in 2013 were about $3.5 billion, and that
was up more than 20% from 2012. From an operational perspective, we also continue to make improvements in safety
and quality, and while we understand that quality improvement is continuous, our dealers and customers give us
feedback that let us know they're seeing results.
So with that recap, let's move on to the outlook. Overall, sales and revenues in 2014 are expected to be roughly similar
with 2013 at about $56 billion, and that would be in a range of about plus or minus 5%. There are encouraging signs in
the world economy and we're seeing some in our own business, and that gives us optimism for sales in our
Construction and Power Systems segments and we think they'll each be up about 5% in 2014.
However, we continue to be cautious about the mining industry. Despite prospects for the improved economic climate
and continued strong production at mines, we are expecting a sales decline in our Resource Industries segment of about
10% in 2014. The good news is, mine production has generally been up and improved in 2013 and we think it'll likely

be up again in 2014. The bad news is that orders for new equipment remain pretty low. But we don't think that can go
on indefinitely, and we remain positive on our long-term view of Mining. Based on the size and age of existing
equipment fleets, we believe that miners are buying new equipment at a rate that's well below the average replacement
level they'll need going forward. As an example, we think that our sales of large mining trucks in 2014 will be around
half the long-term replacement level. That should be a positive for sales in the future.
In 2013, we took substantial actions to reduce cost and we're expecting to take more in 2014. That means that we're
expecting additional restructuring actions and charges in 2014 of $400 million to $500 million, and that's in addition to
the $200 million of restructuring costs that we had in 2013.
Now the most significant item in 2014 is the restructuring of our Gosselies, Belgium facility. We announced that
program on December 23, of 2013 and it's designed to improve the competitiveness of our European manufacturing
footprint by refocusing our current Gosselies operations on final machine assembly, test and paint with limited
component and fabrication operations. The actions there will include reshaping the supply base for more efficient
sourcing, improving factory efficiencies, and workforce reductions. Our proposals are subject to Belgian Ministerial
approval and we think a decision by the Belgian Minister of Employment will occur in the first quarter of 2014, and
subject to that approval, we expect to recognize about $300 million of employee-related separation charges throughout
2014.
The remaining restructuring costs of $100 million to $200 million that are anticipated in our outlook are related to a
wide range of actions across the company, and they're a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and
improve the efficiency of our operations. While we're expecting numerous actions, we don't expect that individually the
charges would be significant. We expect that the restructuring actions taken in 2013 and that we're anticipating for
2014 will be about $200 million favorable to our ongoing cost in 2014 and $400 million to $500 million per year
favorable to ongoing cost after 2015. Now, the most significant reason the 2014 impact is lower than the impact after
2015 is the timeframe involved in implementing the program in Gosselies, Belgium. It's extensive and it'll take several
years to complete. In addition, the other actions that we're expecting to take in 2014 will occur over the course of the
year, and as a result, we're expecting partial year benefits in 2014.
In total, we estimate the after-tax impact of the restructuring charges in 2014 to be between $0.50 and $0.60 a share.
Our profit outlook for 2014 is $5.85 a share at $56 billion of sales and revenues, excluding the $0.55 midpoint of the
restructuring charges, and about $5.40 per share, all-in including the restructuring. Now, there are a number of
reasonably important moving pieces that are factored into our 2014 outlook, and we've provided a listing of those key
items in the profit outlook section of this morning's financial release. And if you haven't already, I would encourage
you to read through that.
So, in summary on the outlook, $56 billion of sales and revenues in 2014, that's relatively flat with 2013 in the range of
plus or minus 5%; and $5.85 a share without restructuring, $5.30 all in. One last point on the outlook, and that's around
the first quarter. For the full year, our sales and revenues outlook expects roughly flat sales. And sales flat with the first
quarter of 2013 is probably a reasonable ballpark for you to think about for Q1 2014. However, as you think about the
first quarter profit, you may be looking back to the first quarter of 2013 as a reference point. And if you do, there's one
fairly significant item you need to consider and that's that last year, we had an $87 million favorable tax item in the first
quarter, and that was related to the research and development tax credit that was retroactively extended in 2013 for
2012. And that certainly won't be in the first quarter of 2014.
So that's the outlook, and we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.

<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: From Barclays. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Hey. Thanks.
<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: Mike or Doug, you talk about Cat's backlog declined to $18 billion in 4Q, it was
$19.1 billion in 3Q and it's down $2.2 billion in the year, yet you're guiding to a 5% increase in Power Systems, and
you did mention in the release that some of the backlog decline was in Power Systems. So, can you talk about the
conviction of your forecast here, especially some – you do have some decent emerging market exposure in this
business. Where is the growth coming from in Power Systems and why?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Okay. I'm going to embellish that a little bit, Andy, and talk a little bit about Construction
as well if you don't mind. For Construction, we've seen end-user demand begin to improve. In most regions,
particularly in North America, economically we think a little better, a little better GDP around the world will help that
as well. We've also seen actually our sales in China Construction improve as well. And it's probably worth noting that
for Construction, we still had a headwind in the fourth quarter on dealer inventory. Certainly not as much as it was in
the fourth quarter a year ago, but the improvement in the fourth quarter, if we would've had flat dealer inventory would
have been a little bit more.
On Power Systems, we're not looking for a big increase next year. We're in the ballpark of about 5%. And I would tell
you that it's not any one sector. If you look at what's in Power Systems, you've got Industrial, you've got oil and gas,
resip, and turbines. You've got Electric Power, you've got marine, you've got rail. And we don't really have any one of
those sectors that's up a lot. In fact, probably one of the smallest, which is marine in the transportation piece, it's
probably a little bit stronger than the rest, but I wouldn't really call that out too much. They're all kind of in the same
ballpark. You asked about conviction and backlog. When we do our outlook, we try to give you our best guess at what
we see in our backlog, what we're hearing from customers, what we think is going to happen in the economy. And we
try to put that together and do our best shot. So I would say, it's an outlook, so it's not a sure thing, but I'd say, we're as
confident as we usually are in an outlook.
<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: Okay. Mike, that's helpful. Just shifting gears, in 3Q you said that you were not
expecting a significant inventory change at the company level. But it still looks like if I'm doing the math right that you
lowered company inventories by about $700 million in the quarter. Was this mostly in Resource Industries and that's
why your margins were so weak there? And how do you get conviction that these kinds of declines are behind you
when you kind of had similar issues all year with company inventory de-stock?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, well, I'd say one thing is our sales in the fourth quarter were higher than we thought,
and the change in dealer inventory was about the same as we expected. And with production schedules relatively not
changing a lot in the short term, some of that came from inventory. And I'll tell you what gives us a little bit of
conviction that it's not going to go down as much as last year is essentially the amount of our inventory that is finished
goods. We've got the PDCs, for example. And a year ago, we had a lot of inventory in the PDCs, and it has come down
substantially. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but my recollection is that it's down more than half. So I think
that we expected that to happen this year. It's down to levels right now that I think are – there will be kind of seasonal
fluctuations, but by and large, I just don't think there's the likelihood that that finished inventory would come down as
much as it did in 2013.
<Q - Andrew Alec Kaplowitz>: Thank you, Mike.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of questions, guys. Just first on Mining, can we talk a little
bit more about what happened to both OE and aftermarket orders from Q3 to Q4? And do you need a major pickup in

orders in the second half of 2014 to deliver minus 10% for the year on the top-line?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, orders have – I'm going to pull after-market out of this because for us aftermarket is
kind of a daily thing. Our order board, if you will, is about 24 hours, so customers order, we fulfill and send. So that's –
sales are probably a better indicator of the future than what happened on the last day of the year. So, I think if you look
at order rates for new equipment, they have remained very, very low. That's despite mine production. Our customers,
they've actually had pretty decent years. Mine production has been up, and we think it'll be up again overall in 2014.
Despite that, they're not ordering much. And we haven't really seen much of a pickup. Certainly order rates are – were
for Resource Industries a little better in the fourth quarter than they were in the fourth quarter in the prior year, but
that's not saying much. And so, I think to answer your question, we do need some improvement in order rates to be at
minus 10%, but I wouldn't describe it as anything like robust or good or like 2012, but, yeah, some improvement.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Maybe it's time for me just to add a comment on Mining here in general. It's Doug
Oberhelman speaking. The interesting thing with our Mining customers, and I have met in the last 60 days to 90 days
with several of my counterpart CEOs at the Mining customers, and all of our Mining team has been with them with all
of our alliance customers certainly in the last 60 days to 90 days in some way or another. The feedback is fairly
consistent, and it's not illogical at all. Their Mining production continues. They are pulling ores out of the ground at
faster and faster rates. They are just doing what we did, frankly, in 2013 and that's pull our horns in, pull their horns in
with CapEx, we see that again in 2014.
But what they all have cautioned us on is that at some point in the future, because we're extending cycles, duty cycles,
because we've cut back on new acquisitions and even some parts in some cases, be ready for us at some point in the
future. None of them can predict when that is, and I can't either. But this is sort of typical with what we hear through
these deep cycles, that when it's over, it tends to come back fairly quickly. I'm not making that prediction here today. I
hope it's in 2014. I know it will happen in 2014 or 2015. But that's kind of the quandary we're in as well, trying to judge
from our customers when they feel comfortable kicking back in with new purchases.
Now CapEx is going down with miners in 2014, and you've all seen the numbers. We watch that too. A lot of that is
around – a big part of CapEx in mining is not around mobile equipment. So we will see when that turns, I'm convinced
we'll see not as Mike said a 2012-style ordering. I hope we don't. But we should see a fairly prominent turn when it
happens. And as Mike said, we'll – we should see something in 2014 to make our forecast, but it's out there, we just
don't know when. And I can't provide any more clarity than that. That's the feedback we get from our customers
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Thanks, Doug. That's really helpful. And then just my follow-up question on
Construction equipment, how did you get such a dramatic improvement from Q3 do Q4 in EBIT on essentially a $300
million sequential increase in revenues? And then more importantly, do you think that $500 million of quarterly EBIT
for Construction is a sustainable run rate into 2014, particularly as you mentioned with some lingering pricing pressure
in the business?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think for Construction, I'll say a couple of things. They had pretty good
incrementals from third to fourth quarter, and there are a couple of things going on in there. Their pricing was a little bit
better in the fourth quarter. They had more of this big order from Brazil in the third quarter that kind of dampened price
realization a little bit. Again, sales were up. They actually did a great job on costs in the fourth quarter. And the impact
on absorption of inventory decline for them was not a big deal in the fourth quarter. There was a little more of that in
the third quarter. But no doubt about it, they had a pretty good quarter. In terms of going forward, I won't – I'm going to
try not to give any specific guidance on profit by segment. But they were around 10% in the fourth quarter, and that's
probably in the ballpark of – we're not looking for a big decline. They were hurt this year by inventory decline, and we
don't see that happening in 2014. So their margins in 2014 ought to be better.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Hi. Good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess two questions. One, Doug, just philosophically, how
should we think about the message you're trying to send here with the share repurchase? Your view's changed quite
dramatically since you first became CEO, so should we think about the $10 billion over a five year, like 2 billion a
year? Would it be more front-end loaded? Would you look to be more opportunistic than the $1.7 billion you already
talked about? I guess – and then just my second question, Mike, as it relates to guidance. You gave some color on the
first quarter; I guess outside of that is there anything unusual we should think about as we think about the progression
of earnings throughout the year? Anything not in line with your typical seasonality, just given we have restructuring
benefits that are going to hit? I'm not sure how that happens in terms of you're saying you are expecting Mining orders
to pick up. I'm just trying to make sure we have the quarters correct. Thanks.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: How about I take the – I'll take the second part of that on the guidance. The $200 million
ongoing benefit that we kind of expected for this year, a lot of that is based on the things that we did in 2013. So that's
– those kind of things are in place, the big reductions in people that we had. So I think that $200 million, I probably
wouldn't divide it by four because we are doing more in 2014, but I would say if you divided it by four and then
favored the second half of the year a little bit more than the first half, that's probably reasonable.
Outside of – probably the biggest issue on timing that we're going to have during the year is when the actual
restructuring charges for 2014 hit. I mentioned in kind of the preamble that we need to have the Belgian Government
approve our program. And so until that happens, we won't be booking the charges for Gosselies, so that needs to
happen. Outside of that, I don't know of any real big items. I do think that the first quarter, for example, will have more
negative sales mix likely than the second half a little bit. The first quarter of last year, Mining was still quite a bit
higher than it is right now. So, I kind of was talking about the first quarter sales being relatively flat, but that's with
Mining being down a bit, and Construction being up.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Jamie, thanks for a thoughtful question on our buyback and cash. Let me give you a
fairly broad answer to that, and I hope complete. I have changed my position since I became CEO. You'll recall when
that announcement was made, it was the end of 2009. Our debt-to-cap was way over 50% at that time. We struggled
with our – to be sure we kept our credit rating, and we vowed not to cut the dividend at that time and both of those
came true. But as we looked forward, we all agreed that we had to have a strong balance sheet. A cycle like we saw in
2009 and now another Mining cycle like we saw in 2013, really puts pressure on our balance sheet, and we decided
we've got to have a rock-solid balance sheet, which we do today. You noticed at the end of the year it dropped below
30% debt-to-cap. If you take our cash into consideration, of about $6 billion at the end of the year, it was down 16%,
17%. And in my definition, that's a pretty solid balance sheet. So we accomplished that.
The second thing that we needed to do in the early days of me being CEO was to build up our capacity. We struggled
with capacity. We did not have adequate capacity in the upturn of the 2000s. We gave up market share around the
world. And our business model purely runs on field of population, which allows our dealers to do what they do in a
downturn better than anybody else by servicing the field population that's out there. We accomplished that one. We've
got capacity in place today, obviously far above $55 billion. We did $66 billion in 2012, so somewhere north of that we
have operating capacity today. We're capacitized just right. Our CapEx has come down substantially as a result of that.
So I think where we're positioned today going forward is significantly different than where we've been for a while, and
as a result, seeing cash build up on the balance sheet is not helping. That's one of the reasons we – when we had strong
cash last year, the two quarters, we announced buyback, we spent $2 billion. As we announced today, we'll spend $1.7
billion more this year – or this quarter, which will take a full advantage of our 2007 buyback program, and we
announced another $10 billion today of course over the next five years or so. I'm not going to make any prediction on
when we're going to do that, but as long as we see fairly stable and consistent cash flow, which I expect we would; as
long as we keep our debt-to-cap in the low 30%s, that allows us to acquire if we choose to do so, and that's another
question that's kind of embedded in yours. We do not have anything at all big on the horizon.

I'd say, we'd be back in the mode we have been for many years, a number of acquisitions possible, all relatively small
in size. In fact, we hold a placeholder every year of about $1 billion for acquisitions, sometimes we go that high,
sometimes we don't. But I – we will be looking for acquisition opportunities, I would say particularly around Power
Systems. That's a great business for us, it's very stable obviously, there are some places to expand, we've got lots of
opportunity around the world, so that might be a place, again in a smaller way, not a huge way, that we might do it.
And so I'd say that if we get lucky, that every year we buy a little bit back, but I'll make no forecast on that. We have
cash, we'll probably use it, if we don't, we'll probably wait, and that's kind of how I'd look at all of that, Jamie. Great
question. Thank you.

Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Hi. ISI. Regarding Resource Industries, if you add back the restructuring in the fourth quarter
the margin was about 7%. Can you give us some help on how you're thinking about the margins for RI if the revenue,
as you said earlier, would stay around the same level that we saw in the fourth quarter?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I would say, David, that fourth quarter usually has a little higher cost levels than the
rest of the year. And with sales for Resource Industries kind of coming down to this $3 billion level, it has a little bit
bigger impact on margin. So they had a little more of an inventory decline that hurt them in the fourth quarter, they had
costs that were up a little bit in the fourth quarter, so that was a little negative from the third quarter, and as you
mentioned, the restructuring charges that they had in the fourth quarter.
In terms of going forward at this volume level, if you were to take the sort of average margin for the year, it's probably
not far-off of what you'd think for next year. There'll be puts and takes though. They've done a lot of work on cost
reduction, so that would be a positive. They would like to spend a little bit more to drive synergy benefits and spend a
little more on R&D, so that'll go the other way. But I think by and large, their margins from 2013 are not significantly
out of line at this kind of sales level.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. It's a little tricky, though, I mean, if you think Construction margins can be 10%, just
roughly in 2014, that implies an incremental margin for CI of 65% next year. That seems aggressive. But then if you
really think RI can do margins of 11% in 2014, it implies Power Systems' margins are down to 13% next year after
being 15%. So the math is not squaring.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I'm not trying to give you specific numbers. I didn't say that Construction would be 10%, I
just said it'll be – I think it'll be probably closer to that than the 5% to 6% that they had earlier in the year. I think also
one of the things that you need to remember kind of year-over-year too is, there are other things that are maybe not in
the segments. We had pretty substantial negative below operating profit currency losses in 2013 that we're not
expecting for 2014. So I don't think from an operating profit standpoint there'll be major changes, but I'm not
suggesting it'll be exactly the same in each segment as it was in the fourth quarter.
<Q - David M. Raso>: How about just qualitatively then, Power Systems, how do you think of their margins off of the
15.4% you reported for 2013?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, again, I don't think it'll be substantially different. Again, I'm not trying to do a
forecast by segment, but probably not substantially different. I mean, it was a great quarter and I don't want to pick on

the quarter, but if you were to take the year, I don't think their profit is going be dramatically different year-over-year.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. We can talk offline more the exact numbers. And lastly for CONEXPO, just any
framework we should be thinking about going into a meeting like this? I mean, historically, you've spoken of long-term
targets before at settings like this. Can you give us a little framework for this year?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think generically what we'll talk about is our strategy update. We've been working
on that for the last several months of 2013. So we'll spend time updating you on the changes that we made to the
strategy. And we'll talk a little bit about each of the major segments. And to your point, it'll be kind of a longer-term
view of what we expect for the future. But coming out of such a tough year in 2013, I remember this back in 2009
when we had a similar meeting. We kind of gave specific number targets, and it was – let's say it was tough to get
anybody to think the business could be that big. So – or that good. So I think, what you'll probably hear from us at
CONEXPO is more around strategy, business conditions, and the things that we expect to do going forward. It probably
won't be so much, here's a forecast for a particular year.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: That's right. David, it's Doug Oberhelman. That's right. And a couple of things, we'll
talk about how our business has changed since [ph] 2002 (42:27) and how we see it kind of, to use your word,
qualitatively going forward. But one other thing I'd ask all of you to do while you're out there, those of you that are
attending, is go down on the floor and look at our product offering. You'll be seeing a couple of things that you haven't
seen from us before. Number one, fuel economy. Frankly, we have struggled in the past to get some of our competition
on fuel economy. That period is over. Our Tier 4 interim and final machines that you'll see out there are in almost every
case best-in-class, and best-in-class by quite a margin.
So I'd really like you to spend time with our people on the floor. Secondly, equipment technology, condition
monitoring, job site, controls, everything around the electronics. We'll operate live dealer control room there. It's alive,
but it would look like a dealer control like we have all over the world today monitoring our machines and what we can
offer customers. And those two are very different than what we've talked about in the past. Then in our meeting, I think
you'll enjoy kind of a little look back at how we've changed the company and where we're going, as Mike said, between
here and the next few years out.
<Q - David M. Raso>: And Doug, if you can help us at CONEXPO or even right now, the strategy comment reminded
me of, it appears a majority of your dealers in China have dropped the SEM brand. You still have the original SEM
dealers selling. That's partly why you are still doing okay in China, but SEM has obviously been lagging the industry
data, I guess, in part because the traditional Cat dealers, the majority have dropped it. And thinking of SEM as may be a
lower cost solution, cost structure around the world, do you care to maybe comment a little bit on that SEM decision by
the Cat dealers, how it makes you rethink your kind of lower-value price point...?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes and I'll make sure that Ed addresses that at CONEXPO. But generally, we encourage
that change from here. The market is huge over there for excavators and the things that Cat brand does, and we decided
over the last year that that's really where we want them to focus. We went kind of back to a strategy of SEM brand for
SEM products inside and outside, although we still have quite a few dealers outside of China representing SEM. That
has worked well for us. We'll concentrate on that as a brand. It is a value brand, and of course we've been upgrading
that technology a little bit within the value offering against SEM's competitors. So we think we're in a better position
with that going forward, and again that will be a relatively small play in the scheme of things, but it's important inside
China.
<Q - David M. Raso>: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.

<Q - Nicole Deblase>: Yeah, it's Morgan Stanley. Thanks, guys. Good morning. So I just wanted to ask a question on
material costs. I think you guys noted in the 2014 outlook bit of the release that you expect material costs to be
favorable in 2014, but you're also looking for an improving economic environment and usually that causes commodity
prices to increase. So I'm just curious what you're expecting for material costs and why you expect a decline?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, this is Mike, Nicole. We didn't actually put it in the economic part of the release, but
generally speaking, I would say for mine commodities like copper, for example, we're expecting commodity prices for
2014 to be by and large around the 2013 average. So we're not likely to get big increases or decreases in commodity
prices. At least that's our view.
And so for material costs, you kind of have to look a little bit at how things have trended for the year. We have gotten
kind of better and better as we've gone through the year. We're exiting the year 2013 at a lower level than where we
came into the year. So even if we don't get any other cost reductions at all, we have a bit of a carryover benefit that
comes from the prior year. So that should be positive. And in addition to that, most of what we buy is not commodities,
believe it or not. It's components that are, have a lot of value added in it. And based on what we've negotiated with
suppliers, the changes that we've made, we're looking for overall material costs to be lower. And again, the bulk of
what we buy is not commodities. It's – it includes somebody else's value added. And so a combination of reductions
there and what we're coming out of 2013 with already give us pretty good confidence on material costs for 2014.
<Q - Nicole Deblase>: Okay. Understood
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: I may just add quickly, coming out of the strategy with, Doug, a big part of it was
supplier collaboration, and the idea that we would get to know our suppliers as well as we know our dealers. And we
spent a significant amount of time on that coming out of the strategy, so what we see in terms of our material cost
reduction is really a benefit of coming out with stronger supplier collaboration, their resources, their expertise,
combined with ours is producing a lot better decisions for us and a big piece of that reduction.
<Q - Nicole Deblase>: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then just on construction with respect to pricing, I saw in the
release that you guys called out that there is some pricing degradation or challenges in the North American market too,
which I think was isolated to Europe before. So if you can just provide us an update on what you're seeing in the
competitive environment in North America that'd be helpful.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think overall, I think for Construction, there's not really been anywhere where
we've had a lot of strength. I think it's been a tough environment around the world. So North America included. We
have had some issues here and there where we came out with Tier 4 products in North America before some of our
competitors, some of our competitors had credits that they were using to sell Tier 3 products for a longer period of
time. So as that expires, as let's say, everybody gets on a more equal footing with regard to Tier 4, I think that'll
probably help us a little bit in North America because it's been a little bit of a drag.
<Q - Nicole Deblase>: Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Potter. Please announce your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Alex E. Potter>: Thanks, guys. Piper Jaffray. So, I had a question here on China, in general. There's been this
downtick in PMI. Obviously bearishness around emerging markets that has surfaced here just over the last, call it, week
or so. But your commentary on China seemed at least relatively upbeat. Asia-Pacific Construction business was up
really nicely in Q4. Power gen seemed to be holding up okay sequentially. So basically I'm just trying to see if you've
seen anything recently to substantiate these initial signs of weakness in China?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, that's occurred – the market reactions really over the past week or 10 days or so. I
think in our business, it's been pretty positive. We've seen the – not just our sales but kind of the overall construction

equipment group, sales in the industry ticking up year-over-year and over the past few months. And we saw that again
in December. So, I think what we've seen has been pretty good. We've done better than the market there as well. Our
sales in China were up more than 20% this year. They were up in the quarter. So, it's not been a big negative for us.
Now, the flip side of that is, we're not looking for improvements in overall GDP for China. We're expecting 2014 to be
another year like 2013, like 2012, in that sort of 7.5%-ish range. So that's what we're seeing in China anyway.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Let me add a little bit, Mike, Oberhelman again on China. We are watching it very,
very closely from a couple of aspects. Obviously, liquidity in the banking system, and we keep a close eye on that, as
well as their reform efforts. And we have been laser focused on being a leader in China, and that's again around
building field population. So we have seen our market share go up, our field population go up and our business go up as
a result. That is not to say China is not without lots of caution, which we are very much aware of. And we watch that
every day. But at the same time, we have to have our dealers with a field population they can work on when times are
bad or good. So that's really our focus is that business model inside China.
<Q - Alex E. Potter>: Okay, fair enough. Last question here; was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on
Power Systems, maybe just qualitatively, which segments looking into 2014 you expect to perform better or perform
worse and some of the justification or reasoning behind that.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, this is Mike. I think with the exception of Industrial, which has had just a really,
really big up year this year and is going have really tough comps as a result, I think we're essentially looking
year-over-year 2014 versus 2013, no real outliers. We have Power Systems overall up, we think about 5%. And we
have between, for the big kind of subsectors, it's not going to veer far off that. So with the exception of maybe marine
might be a little bit better and Industrial might be a little bit worse, the rest of them, oil and gas overall, Electric Power
overall, rail overall, kind of up a little.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yeah, just a comment, a qualitative comment about Power Systems, really sparkled in
a tough year like 2013. And if you look back over the years, Power Systems has done that because there's a fairly wide
array of businesses in there. Take our rail business, between Progress Rail and EMD. EMD in its, our third year of
ownership is just getting it done. We've seen a lot of cost reduction in locomotives, we've seen a lot of work around the
aftermarket, kind of building out the Caterpillar DNA into locomotives, and we're very, very happy with that
acquisition and our current market position. Electric Power has been very anemic, as you all know, but within that is
our acquisition of MWM in Germany, which brings us a natural gas and gas in any form offering. We're building that
out, expanding through Cat dealers. Long-term, that's going to be a very good piece of business for us; and is again,
kind of counter-cyclical to everything else in the Power Systems business.
Our Industrial business, which is really the reciprocating engines that we sell to everybody from ag to lift trucks to
other construction equipment makers saw an increase in 2013 to make up for some of the shortfalls in the other
segments. So within that Power Systems business, there's an array of diversity. And then finally, the turbine business,
which has just been fantastic for us really the whole time we've owned it, going back to the mid-1980s. But with the oil
and gas boom, the fracing boom around this country and elsewhere, that has been a real stellar performer the last few
years, and I expect it to continue.
And then just an anecdote; I just returned from Eagle Ford area actually last week, and I had my ears to the ground on
what they're seeing down there, and actually our dealers there are a bit more optimistic than I expected. I'm not going to
say wildly at all, but there's still activity going on and they feel like 2014 could be another solid year. So, that's
anecdotal, but was certainly a positive thing at this point in time. But our Power Systems business is one that we're very
happy with. And again within that, it's kind of a complete and various array of businesses in itself.
<Q - Alex E. Potter>: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your affiliation then pose our
question.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: It's Vertical Research Partners and thank you. I wonder if I could follow up on what Doug
was just mentioning. There's a little bit of consternation in the market with some of the big oil majors talking about
maybe declining returns on some of the expensive CapEx, maybe cutting back, and maybe some of the other segments
of oil and gas being strong. Are you able to, I don't know, delineate your exposure to the big international oil
companies? And maybe you could just say is Solar set to have another record year? Thank you.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Well, yeah. I'd say at this point in time, as Mike said also, our Power Systems in 2014
ought to look a lot like it did in 2013. We're hopeful for a very modest increase, but that's after a lot of gives and takes
across that business. As you all know, the fracing business has changed the gas pipeline and gas compression business
immensely in this country, and there's still a lot of build-out on getting that gas out of the ground and that's what I think
we're seeing primarily around Solar. The big nationals around the world certainly are questioning where they're going,
and we see that. I've got to believe the opening in Mexico, if that – or when that starts because I do think they will pull
that off, is going to change the dynamics completely again, and that could be some upside although I don't know how
much of that we'd see in 2014, it ought to start.
So it's really a mixed – I think you've got – almost have to almost look at it country-by-country and see where that
goes, but we're not wildly optimistic about it nor are we that pessimistic for 2014. I have been surprised with gas here
in the last month or so going above $5.00, I would not have predicted that at all, but it's quite interesting. I don't know
what that'll do, but I think it's probably a fairly short-term phenomenon based on the cold weather.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Okay, great. Thank you, Doug. And then I don't know if you are willing to answer this or
not and you have given a decent amount of Mining information, but there is concerns that there is a couple more years
of CapEx decline out there. And obviously your sales have already maybe frontloaded some of that decline having
fallen so far. Are you willing to say how far your unit deliveries in Mining have fallen from peak in 2012 to what your
outlook is in 2014? It's more than 50%, I'm sure. It's probably more than 60%, maybe it's more than 70%, I don't know.
Maybe you can help out?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, yeah, I'll help you maybe a little bit, Rob. In a lot of ways – and we have a varied
business, it's everything from draglines to drills to big trucks to shovels. The largest-selling product category for us is
large mining trucks. And if you look at large mining trucks and you look at what we've shipped this year, which would
be relatively lined up with what our sales are. We're down probably close to 60% this year. 2013, I'm sorry, not last
year, 2013 versus the peak. And if you look at what we kind of have baked into 2014, you're looking at something like
75% below the 2013 peak for our shipments.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: That's what I thought and that's very helpful. Thank you very much, Mike.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: And this is Brad.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Go ahead, Brad. Sorry.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: I was just going to comment, we – when we look at our Resource Industry business,
we'll give you a forecast which is our best estimate in terms of that particular time. But from an operational standpoint,
we clearly understand there's risk, we knew there was risk in 2013, if you were in the Resource Industry business. And
in that business unit, they started taking action in the first quarter. The companies joined in and we really focused on
structural cost reduction and with that, we were able to deliver the $1.2 billion of cost reduction. And I'll tell you that
we're bullish in Mining on the long-term. Mike talked about our orders needed to increase for the 10% down scenario
and we'll walk into the first quarter in a cautious standpoint, and we'll remain focused on cost reduction around here.
But clearly, longer-term, we see that as a great business for us, but we remain cautious and we remain focused on the
structural cost reduction in 2014.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah.
