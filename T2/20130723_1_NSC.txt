Our actual results may differ materially from those projected and will be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
some of which may be outside of our control. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for
discussions of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to
reported results, excluding certain adjustments – that is, non-GAAP numbers-have been reconciled on our website in
the Investors' section.
Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. It's also my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2013
earnings call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including Jim Squires, our newly appointed
President, Don Seale, our Chief Marketing Officer, Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer, and John Rathbone, our
Chief Financial Officer. As usual, Don, Mark and John will provide commentary in their respective areas and then all
of us will be available for your questions.
Norfolk Southern's earnings for the quarter were $1.46 per share, a decrease of 9% compared with last year, but a very
solid result in the face of some considerable headwinds year-over-year. We continued to face a difficult environment in
export coal, with loadings down 16% in the quarter. In addition, we had a $65 million headwind associated with the
fuel revenue lag. As you will recall, second quarter of last year had a $61 million favorable fuel lag compared to this
year's $4 million unfavorable. Despite these two factors the majority of our other businesses performed well in the
quarter. Revenues other than coal were up 3%. Overall volumes were up 2% as increases in intermodal and
merchandise traffic up 5% and 2% respectively were partly offset by the 4% decline in coal volume. Don will provide
you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes.
Our system velocity and service products remain at a very high level. Our most recent customer survey confirms the
value of our reliable and consistent service, with overall satisfaction increasing to a new all-time high. In addition to
this positive external response, we see continued momentum in our service metrics. Terminal dwell and system average
speed both improved compared to a very good second quarter in 2012. Crude starts during the quarter were down 2%
on the 2% increase in volume, and equipment rents declined $5 million or 7%. As all of you know, a more efficient
network allows us to better utilize our people and our physical assets, and Mark will outline some more specifics
following Don's remarks.
Wrapping up the presentations will be John, with an analysis of each of our expense categories. The continued focus on
productivity and efficiency improvements kept operating expenses only 1% above last year as compared to a 3%
increase in revenue ton miles and resulted in an operating ratio of 70.2%. Now let me turn the program over to Don and
the rest of the team, and I'll return with some closing remarks before we answer your questions.
Donald W. Seale
Thanks, Wick, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. During the second quarter both our merchandise and
intermodal networks achieved all-time revenue records up 2% and 4% respectively, while coal revenue was impacted
by declines in our export and southern utility market segments. Our overall portfolio of business generated $2.8 billion
in revenue, down $72 million or 3%, compared to second quarter of 2012. Total volume grew by 2% or 39,000 units
led by intermodal, automotive and chemicals. With respect to yield, revenue per unit declined by 5% due to a 14%
decline in coal revenue per unit. Merchandise RPU was flat and intermodal revenue per unit was down 1%, compared
to second quarter of last year. Unfavorable fuel surcharge revenue accounted for lower than average RPU gains in both
merchandise and intermodal.
Negative mix in price mostly associated with export coal and negative mix within our utility markets accounted for $75
million of the overall revenue decline for the quarter and fuel surcharge revenue was down $59 million year-over-year.
On the plus side, higher volume contributed a positive $62 million in revenue variance. With respect to volume, on the

next slide, shipments increased 2% for the quarter due to gains in intermodal and merchandise, which offset a 4%
decline in coal.
Intermodal grew 5% with a strong domestic market and merchandise results were mixed as chemicals and automotive
were up 16% and 8% respectively, which offset declines in metals, agricultural products and paper. Now turning to our
individual market segments. Coal revenue was $626 million dollars in the quarter, down $129 million or 17% over last
year due to weaker demand across most market segments and pricing pressure in the export coal sector. Weak
economic conditions in Europe, slower growth in Asia and an excess coal supply across the globe impacted the
seaborne markets for both thermal coal and metallurgical coal and the weaker Australian dollar, now down 13% against
the U.S. dollar since January, has driven increased Australian coal production and exports.
On a more positive note our utility sector improved this quarter with an increase of 6,000 carloads or 3%. Stronger
deliveries into the Northern power region was up 18%, offsetting weak coal demand at Southern plants which were
down 12%. Coal demand at Northern plants improved as stockpiles began to reach normal levels in the quarter. In the
South, challenging coal dispatch economics and high stockpiles built in 2012 remain an impediment for coal demand,
but we see some signs of improvement ahead. Domestic metallurgical volumes were down 11% for the quarter due to
weaker steel production and the continued impact of the RG Steel bankruptcy, a comp which we cleared on July 1 this
year, and industrial coal volume was down 6%, due to competition from gas and higher tons per car as higher
efficiency equipment is deployed in this segment.
As I've shared with you in some of the past quarters, the next chart depicts change in volume in the quarter by coal
market segment and relative differentials in length of haul in various market segments. For example, with longer haul
Southern utility volume down 12% and shorter haul Northern utility volume up 18% in the second quarter, the relative
differential in length of haul between these two market segments was a large driver of revenue per unit. The same
impact was experienced with the decline in export coal volumes and market based pricing during the quarter compared
to second quarter 2012.
Turning to the next slide, with respect to changing coal production in each of the coal production basins, this next chart
outlines our changing business mix since 2010. As you can see our coal sourcing is moved from longer haul locations
like Central Appalachia to the Illinois Basin, which has 75% shorter haul characteristics; again, profitable new business
but impacting revenue per unit. Over the next several quarters we expect Illinois Basin coal to begin moving to longer
haul Southern steam destinations which will provide a better balance in length of haul.
Turning next to our intermodal network. Revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $588 million, up $25
million or 4% over the second quarter of 2012, driven by 5% higher volumes. As depicted on slide 7, the volume gains
in intermodal came from both domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 6% due to continued
highway conversions and the opening of new Crescent Corridor lanes during the quarter, while organic growth across
our international accounts boosted international volume by 2%.
As in previous quarters we continue to improve the efficiency of our intermodal network. The second quarter
experienced a four percentage point improvement over 2012 to reach 95% of all containers moving at double stack
service. This metric highlights loading efficiency and equipment utilization. This trend along with other measures
allows trains to carry a higher volume with reduced crew starts. During the quarter, crew starts were up 2% while
volume increased by 5%, and for the month of June, NS reached an all-time record for the number of intermodal units
handled per road crew.
Also, as shown on the slide, much of our volume increase occurred over our intermodal corridors as we launched new
services. For example, the Heartland Corridor continues to generate double-digit growth, up 18% in the quarter, again
reflecting the efficiency and productivity of double stack service from the Port of Virginia to the Ohio Valley.
Turning to our merchandise markets on slide 9, merchandise revenue was up 2%, reaching $1.6 billion for the quarter.
This increase came as a result of 16% higher chemical volumes and an 8% gain in automotive volumes. Iron and steel
carloads were down 19%, primarily driven by the reduction in import slabs, reflecting excess capacity in the domestic
steel industry.

Coil steel was also down due to an unscheduled plant shutdown in April. As with coal, the RG Steel bankruptcy also
continued to plague year-over-year comparisons, which we have now cleared. On the positive side, aggregates and
miscellaneous construction were up 6% and 2%, respectively.
Agriculture continues to be impacted by last year's poor crop due to the drought. Volumes fell as tight soybean supplies
were partially offset by increases in corn driven by increased volume from Iowa and Nebraska into the Midwest
processing plants. On the plus side, the current crop is shaping up to be a good one which bodes well for increased
shipping activity later this fall. 2013 corn acreage totals 97 million acres, the most planted since 1936.
Chemicals volume continues to rise with a 16% gain as compared to last year. This increase was driven by growth in
the crude-by-rail business, which accounted for 20,000 shipments, a substantial increase of 51% sequentially from the
first quarter. Automotive volumes were up 8% which was double the projected North American vehicle production in
the quarter as new business and increased production at NS-served plants bolstered performance. And finally, the
rebound in the housing market increased lumber volumes by 12%, which partially offset a 16% decline in graphic
paper.
Now concluding with our outlook, the market ahead continues to be mostly positive, but we face continuing headwinds
across most of our coal business. Competition from natural gas and flat to declining electricity demand will continue to
impact our utility franchise. But firming natural gas prices reflects some relief for coal in utility dispatch curves. And
we're seeing utility stockpiles move in the right direction.
With respect to export met coal demand, we see continued sluggish demand in Europe and slowing shipments into
Asia. Asian shipments are further being impacted by the weakening Australian dollar and lower benchmark met coal
price settlements. Also, thermal coal exports will face lower yields and volume associated with the weak API 2 Index
in the Northern Europe. In view of these challenges in both met and thermal coal exports we expect continued
headwinds for export volumes through the rest of the year with a softer third and fourth quarter than we experienced in
the first half of the year. And finally, regarding domestic met coal here in the U.S., we expect modestly improved
comparisons for the balance of the year.
Turning to intermodal, in our outlook we anticipate a continuation of solid opportunities for highway conversion as we
launch new service lanes and ramp up volumes at our newly opened terminals. We also expect continued growth within
our international segment as we are well positioned with excellent terminal and double stack opportunities across our
network. In merchandise, we continue to expect growth in four of our five business groups in the months ahead led by
chemicals, automotive and housing related materials. Agriculture should generate additional volume as soybeans and
corn beginning in the fourth quarter as a result of the new crop and we expect modest increases primarily in frac sand in
the metals and construction segment.
Wrapping up, in summary we expected our diverse market base to generate volume growth ahead, despite continuing
challenges in the coal market and a slow growth economy. We also remain committed to market based pricing at levels
that equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation. Obviously, with current conditions in our coal business this is a short term
challenge but that doesn't alter the value of our strong service product across a very diverse set of markets where our
pricing remains solid.
Thank you for your time and I will now turn it over to Mark for our operating report. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. Starting with safety, based on preliminary data our second quarter
performance stands at 1.07. We are well into our second year of implementing behavior-based safety, and while our
safety ratio has increased in the second quarter, we're confident we're doing the right things to reduce injuries in our
work place. We see more and more evidence of engagement in the safety process by our workforce as well as the
proactive management of safety.

Turning to service, our composite service metric continues to show consistent high levels of service performance and
year-over-year improvement. For the second quarter, composite performance stands at 83.7%, and it represents a slight
improvement over the second quarter last year and above a goal of 82.5%. These gains were achieved despite a more
normal winter this year in the first quarter and a very active spring weather pattern with flooding and a series of storms
in the Midwest. These gains continue to be led by train performance, which improved 2.5% versus the same quarter last
year, and in fact, even with these challenges, all the service components – train performance, connection performance
and plan adherence – have consistently remained at or above historical highs.
Turning to the next slide, spring weather patterns primarily impacted train speed, but overall train speed remained
essentially flat but consistent with the high levels that we've seen over the last year and a half. Turning to terminal
dwell, the other major component of network velocity showed good improvement, about 2% over the same period last
year. On our next slide, building on the progress we've seen over the last six quarters, improved velocity and other
productivity initiatives are the drivers behind the improvements you see here. Overall, we have reduced crew starts 2%
against a volume increase of 2% and a gross ton miles increase of 3%. Concurrently, we've reduced T&E overtime by
13% in addition to a re-crew reduction of 14% over the same period last year. Velocity-driven equipment rents have
been reduced 3%, while carloads per locomotive have improved 4% and gross ton miles per gallon have improved 1%
despite an unfavorable traffic mix change.
Turning to the next page, we continue to manage our manpower and asset base commensurate with our traffic volumes
and improvements in network velocity. Our active T&E workforce stands at 11,444. That's a 5.5% reduction over last
year. From an asset perspective, we have 244 locomotives in storage. Simultaneously we've been able to reduce our
active locomotive count by 2% versus the second quarter last year. And finally, we have approximately 9,900 freight
cars in storage. In addition to the velocity and productivity improvements that we reviewed on the previous slide, we
will continue to adjust the manpower and asset base in line with our traffic volumes. We also continue to push
productivity initiatives on all fronts, targeting improvements while maintaining high levels of service and velocity.
Thank you. And now, John, I'll turn it over to you.
John P. Rathbone
Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the second quarter. Let's start with our second quarter
operating results. As Don described, our railway operating revenues for the quarter totaled $2.8 billion, down $72
million or 3% compared to last year's second quarter record. Our results included a $4 million unfavorable field
surcharge lag effect, which is a $65 million decline compared to last year's $61 million favorable lag.
Railway operating expenses increased $26 million, or 1%, for the quarter on a volume increase of 2%. Income from
railway operations totaled $836 million, down $98 million, or 10%, and our operating ratio increased 2.7 percentage
points to 70.2%.
Turning to our expenses, the next slide shows the components of the $26 million increase. Purchase services and rents
increased $18 million, or 5%, reflecting higher expenses in the shared Conrail operating areas, increased roadway
maintenance repairs and greater haulage and other transportation activities. For the sixth consecutive quarter,
equipment rents were lower as we continue to see benefits from improved network performance and fewer equipment
leases. Materials and others increased $8 million, or 4%. Increased material charges for equipment repairs and higher
environmental expenses were partly offset by more favorable personal injury claims development.
We expect second half materials expense to approximate recent years' averages. Conversely, second half casualty and
other expenses may face moderate headwinds as a result of prior years' favorability. As you'll recall, in the fourth
quarter of last year we saw a $17 million favorable reduction in personal injury expenses.
Turning to our compensation and benefits expenses, similar to the first quarter results, productivity improvements
reduced employee activity levels. In addition, the quarter benefited $8 million from a resolution of a payroll tax matter.
These combined improvements effectively offset a $16 million pay rate headwind.

Fuel expenses increased by $1 million, driven by higher fuel consumption largely offset by lower prices. Similar to first
quarter, depreciation decreased by $3 million, or 1%, due to slightly lower depreciation rates resulting from our
equipment life study that offset the effect of a larger capital base. Now that's a trend we expect to continue for the
remainder of the year.
Turning to our non-operating items, other income was down $2 million, or 6%, due largely to lower coal royalties
driven by lower coal production. Interest expense was up by $6 million, due to last year's third quarter debt issuance.
Income before income taxes decreased $106 million, or 13%, due to lower income for railway operations. Income taxes
totaled $272 million and the effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 37.8% in 2012. The decrease was primarily
related to tax law changes enacted earlier this year. Net income from the quarter was $465 million, a decrease of $59
million or 11% compared to 2012. Diluted earnings per share were $1.46, down $0.14 per share or 9% compared to last
year.
As shown on the next slide, cash from operations covered capital spending and produced $622 million dollars in free
cash flow. For the first six months of 2013, we distributed $315 million dollars in dividends and repurchased
approximately 2.4 million shares totaling $314 million dollars with most of the share repurchases occurring in the
second quarter. And last year's results included higher share repurchases and borrowings. We are confident in our
ability to generate free cash flow and to access the debt markets. Our cash deployment strategy will continue to
prioritize investment in our business and as demonstrated in our dividend increase announced earlier this afternoon we
are committed to our dividend.
Consistent with our ongoing strategy we'll apply incremental cash to repurchase shares as guided by our assessment of
market conditions. Thank you for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, John. Well, as you've heard, the company delivered very solid results for the second quarter given the
combined headwinds of what we've seen in coal and the unfavorable comparison in the fuel surcharge revenue lag. On
the plus side there were some real positives to take away from our second quarter results in terms of both our continued
operating performance as well as strength in our autos, chemicals and intermodal franchises. I will say that our overall
carloads in the second quarter did not indicate that the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy had quickened, and in
fact, the latest data would indicate that the economy actually slowed somewhat.
Looking ahead, we see more of the same with slow and uneven economic growth for at least the next couple of
quarters. It goes without saying that from a Norfolk Southern standpoint, coal remains the real question mark, although
we are approaching more favorable comparisons as we lap the higher market-based export pricing that was in effect
through most of the first eight months of last year. With respect to the coal market, as you've heard from Don, exports
seem to be weakening while domestic utility coal shows signs of bottoming as excess stockpiles decline and natural gas
seeks a reasonable price point.
Offsetting those uncertain coal markets, we do have a balanced franchise and expect that the strength we have seen in
some other components of our business will continue, as well. We'll stay focused on continuing the improvements in
our service product and cost structure. And our goals are, as always, to give our customers superior service with a
superior value proposition and our shareholders a superior return. Our dividend increase is an indication of our
commitment to provide those returns and we are confident in our ability to do so for the long term. Thanks.
And I'll turn it back over to the operator to take your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Troy from Susquehanna
International.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Yes, thank you. I was interested in your commentary about export coal pricing, and specifically
how we do, in fact, anniversary those higher levels. It's caught in another two months. If you look at any of the pricing
indices internationally, obviously, you have compression suggestive of some pretty material spot weakness which
should translate into export coal pricing compression into next year, at least on the current trajectory. I'm just
wondering your thoughts in terms of where you see current transport spot rates for the export coal. And should we
expect another down year into next year just given where the markets are suggesting they'll be today?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good afternoon, Matt. This is Don.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Hey, Don.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: With respect to the spot coal market for export, we have seen the API 2 for steam coal, for
thermal coal, into Northern Europe might have dropped down to 79 at the current level, mid-80s for 2014 delivery
which is implying marginal improvement from where we are now, but not much. And I would say that most of our
production base, with the exception of Illinois basin and some of Northern App is – they're pushed with respect to
margins at those levels of API 2. With respect to met coal, we know that the met coal settlements for the third quarter
for the high end met coal is in the 140s. That makes it problematic for a lot of U.S. coal production and frankly one of
the impacts that we saw in our franchise this quarter was that low vol, more expensive met coal from the U.S. is not as
competitive with high vol B, for example, a lower cost coal coming from the U.S. going into markets at a cheaper price.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Understood. And my follow up would be just on the domestic side. You know our sense, and
we've heard from your competitor, but also just speaking with utilities is that stockpiles seem to be more historically
consistent than your comments seemingly implied. Or are you just being more conservative on the domestic outlook or
stockpile perhaps higher than some might think remaining in your service regions like the Southeast? Or are you just
trying to be a bit conservative after what has admittedly been a painful two years?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, it's really, it's a story of two different market segments. In the North, we're seeing
stockpiles normalized. In the South, we're still seeing stockpiles above normal. We're seeing heavier gas competition in
the South as well. But with the summer burn that we are seeing, we're seeing stockpiles begin to come down in the
South and they're at the normal level in the North.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: All right, great. Thank you, Don.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yep. Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Matt.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Afternoon.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: So I was looking at the intermodal side of the business and you've got 5% volume growth
but pricing was down. I'm just kind of curious in terms of market positioning whether or not that was mainly the more
competitive truckload market in the second quarter that you would kind of attribute that to or if there's been some
market share out there that you've been looking to grab as there's a competitive dynamic within that business?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good afternoon, Justin. The primary driver on the RPU for intermodal has been negative
year-over-year fuel revenue that we pointed out was $59 million lower so intermodal is wrapped up into that. The
second is that our growth segment in intermodal in the quarter was domestic highway conversion and it is coming on. It

will not have the same RPU characteristics of say transcon intermodal that has a higher revenue per unit.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Got it. That makes sense. And just looking at the crude-by-rail business, obviously good
growth in the quarter and off of a low-base. Curious if you guys are seeing the decreasing spreads between WTI and
Brent impacting volumes and really how that's factored into yields when I think about that business? I know you guys
have commented in the past that crude-by-rail comes on at kind of a lower than average chemical RPU. I was curious
how dynamic that is with what the spreads are doing when you think about how the pricing is positioned on that
business?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We don't see the spread compression that we've seen very, very recently between Brent and
WTI impacting our pricing at this point nor are we seeing that spread compression impacting volumes. I think it has
happened rather quickly and we will have to see whether or not that type of spread compression continues, but at this
point we haven't seen an impact in pricing or volume.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask you, maybe this one is good for
Wick or maybe Don, but as export markets feel like they're deteriorating a little bit more here in the back half of the
year. Is the network facing another dynamic where you could face compressed margins again as that high revenue
positive mix business comes off again like it did last third quarter? Or is there enough offset at this point that we're
lapping some of those resets that we had last year and you are getting the growth in intermodal and these really good
productivity metrics that the risk to margin compression from here is pretty much going to be contingent on maybe a
worse macro outcome?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think you've identified one of the issues we've been looking at. As we mentioned,
we do see the comparisons changing, particularly as we get past the first eight months or so of the year when we really,
as a result of the deterioration in the export market, saw a substantial compression in the margins which were necessary
in order to keep U.S. coal competitive. As Don mentioned there's still softness out there in the export market. We'll
respond to it in the appropriate fashion both from a productivity standpoint and Mark has a lot of initiatives underway
on the productivity side. But also on the pricing and margin standpoint as necessary to keep U.S. coals competitive but
to move the business at levels – margin levels that we find attractive.
Having said all of that, we saw a collapse, as Don outlined, as you all know, in benchmark export metallurgical coal
pricing from $330 a ton down to $160 a ton. We don't see anything like an equivalent collapse out there so we may see
margins bounce along around the level they are now. But certainly not another big reset in what we're going to do in
export pricing.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, and maybe if I can follow up on that. On the domestic front, Don, you did put
in a few slides here talking about length of haul and how that impacts RPU, which is obviously helpful from a
modeling perspective. But should we be thinking that higher RPU equals higher margin? Or is this going to be
relatively consistent? Because that's what ultimately matters, right, for Op earnings.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Our shorter haul business is very profitable to us. It's attractive business with favorable
margin characteristics. The reason that I'm providing that color with respect to the differences in market segments, it
impacts revenue per unit and it impacts the total revenue of the book-of-business for coal. But it certainly is profitable
business and we wouldn't be handling it otherwise.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good afternoon. I guess, one of the pillars for the rails really has been the pricing
power. I guess I just want to understand, Wick or Don, how you think, if you're being more aggressive on pricing
versus your peer. And I think you tried to address this earlier, but if you look at your peer, they posted overall yields
that were positive. Yours are down 4.5%. And then particularly in intermodal, they were up 1.5%, or more than 1.5%.
Yours are down 0.5%. How should we read that in terms of looking at competition within the market? I understand
there are mix differences. But I just want to understand if we're seeing a more competitive environment, particularly
given what we're seeing on the yields from what we can see as analysts.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, Ken, let me just say this. There's always been a competitive environment out
there. And there always will be. Our message to everyone has consistently been we price to the market and respond to
the market. And that's what we'll continue to do. In terms of some of the comparisons that you've talked about, I think
you put your finger on a very significant issue which is mix matters. And we have a very dynamic coal franchise and a
coal franchise that looks different from any other carrier's coal franchise. And as Don showed, we have had significant
changes within the mix of that franchise that have an impact on our revenue per unit. In a similar way, we have a great
intermodal franchise. The volume continues to grow there, but there is some amount of that volume that grows that is
shorter haul. And that can have an impact overall on revenue per unit as well. So we look upon it as we're competitive,
but we think everyone else in the transportation marketplace that we see and come up against is equally competitive.
We're going to continue to price to the market. And I think we'll do fine.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: So if I could just follow-up on that, looking at your volumes on Crescent were great at 9%,
but it's half of Heartland's level. But yet given the investments in new terminals that launched, do you view that as
disappointing? Is that something we should see ramp up? Or is it just a pace as new facilities are coming on, or fully
ramped up, we could see that accelerate?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, let me go back to something I think we talked about in the last quarter is as we
have brought these new facilities on. We're obviously committed to filling them up. We have a significant capital
investment in them. We have new train service. We're out selling that train service. But we have made a commitment to
everyone that we are going to fill those terminals up with business at margins that make good sense for us. And we'll
continue to be deliberate about bringing that business on to make sure it's the kind of profitable business that we want.
So do we view the acceleration there as disappointing? In no way. And we expect continued growth in that – in all of
those corridors.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Can I just clarify something, Wick, there that you just said? Are you saying you're pricing
to market? Or are you still saying inflation plus pricing?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No. Our long-term commitment, as we have said before, and you have to take the
issues in the coal market for what if they are, is that our long-term commitment is to price at inflation plus. And we're
confident that over the long term, we'll do that.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Thanks for the time. Appreciate the insight.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Keith, the length of haul of traffic that we're converting locally in the domestic market, I will
tell you, is less than the length of haul of received traffic that we generate in the transcon market. And also international
business moving from some of the East Coast ports like Savannah to Atlanta are in the 280 mile range. So it is a mix of
different lengths of haul. And I can tell you that some are as low as 260 miles, 280 miles.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: I'm sure. And in the long run that will reduce RPU as you're growing in domestic, even as
profitable. That's a lot of what we're seeing this quarter I guess is the 1% decline in RPU? Is that correct?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: That is absolutely correct.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Don, maybe I could follow up on the coal pricing side. I
guess when you think about the export market as you mentioned the settlements have come down for the third quarter
and typically there has been some variation relative to settlements both on the API side for thermal and met coal, too. If
you look out into the back half of the year is it fair to assume that coal yields are likely to be slightly down from where
we were in the second quarter, all else equal like fuel surcharge? Or is there something else we should be thinking
about? Obviously keeping mix relatively consistent with where we were in the second quarter.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Chris, with mix held constant second quarter to third quarter. We see marginal decreases with
respect to overall RPU as the second quarter versus the third quarter pricing reflects that market dynamic, the change
between the two quarters.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe bigger picture. You mentioned some of the
clearing price or profitability on some of your coal customers into the export market with where the international
settlement prices are now do you have a rough sense, maybe, of what percentage of your export business is profitable at
these levels for the producers? So I guess trying to say it another way, as you start to roll out into the back half of the
year and into 2014, is there a number of tons we can think about that has the potential to maybe come out because of
not being economic at these levels?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well in general, Central App production is under the greatest pressure because of the cost of
production. Net coal coming out of Central App, especially if it is low vol higher priced coal, is under greater pressure
because what we're seeing in the steel market is international and domestic but primarily domestic. Our international
producers of steel taking a different approach to save cost producing coke for steel making where they are taking a
longer process in the coke ovens which enables them to use lower quality coals like high vol B coals. We're seeing net
dynamic. The Northern App coal is tight right now in terms of this overall availability. The domestic market is getting
more robust. And we're seeing that compete for some of the Northern App coal that could go into the export market and
of course then Illinois basin coal, while the cost structure is favorable, is still facing an API 2 that's falling.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. So, it sounds like there's a lot of moving parts when you think about all the potential
puts and takes of what could be going into the export market in the next, call it two to four quarters?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Right.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Just a quick follow-up where you've mentioned that the coal revenue per
unit will be down sequentially, if I understood that. Were you referring only to the export – on the export coal side or
overall coal revenue per unit?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: On the export side, but also the domestic utility side to the extent that our northern
utility coal continues to outpace our southern utility coal. The reason I'm saying that is our northern utility coal based
on length of haul on average is about 50% the RPU of our longer haul southern utility coal.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Just switching gears now over to seasonality of your earnings profile historically has
seen a third quarter that is typically stronger than your prior quarters that took a – there was an impact last year due to
some of the factors that you were mentioning around mix. As that normalizes itself, if we were to look on a seasonality
adjusted basis taking in to consideration mix and any of the other moving parts like fuel surcharge, headwind and so on,
do you see that historical pattern returning or are we in a period that seasonality we would likely not see the same lift as
we have in years prior to 2012?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: You know, that's certainly been a pattern in the past but I would tell you that our
crystal ball for the third quarter right now is not good enough to tell you if that's a pattern that's going to be sustained or
not. We have a lot of uncertainties in our business as we've outlined and we'll just have to just see what the results are.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Cross market – I don't know if you can talk about little bit about employee count and
how you see head count evolving through the rest of the year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, Walter. So far this year we've dropped – in operations we've dropped a little over 400
people and that's pretty much across all the different operating groups and as we continue to roll out various
productivity initiatives we will continue to see that same gradual trend – that same drop in head count.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So overall you're going – you're likely to end the year around 400 people to 500 people
lower than last year just on an average basis?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, we've dropped over 400 people, so far this year, so I think we'd be looking at something
around the same run rate for the rest of the year.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Great. That's all my questions. Thanks very much, guys.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you first kind of a follow-up to a prior question
on the crude-by-rail. We're hearing that there's not really an impact I think from yourselves and from others on
crude-by-rail yet from this sharp compression in spreads. And I'm wondering if you can give a sense, do you think that
that's primarily due to term commitments as your big customer for crude-by-rail? Have they already committed to the
volume and that's why you're not seeing the volume respond to the change in spreads? Or what, it would just seem
economics would point that there would be an impact from those narrower spreads at some point in time. So I'm
wondering if you could give some thoughts on whether it's term or volume commitments or if that's not the case.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, it's all of what you just mentioned, the volume commitments, the commitment to rail
cars to handle that volume but also the fact that at the wellhead, Bakken as well as Canadian heavy crude is being
priced in a way that is competitive with Brent, even with the compressed spread at this point.

<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. All right. I guess switching topics to the intermodal side, you also had some
questions along this line. But how do we think about the ramp up of the Crescent Corridor? It seems like you've got a
lot of the capacity in place and a lot of potential? I guess when you talked about this a number of years ago, you
identified I think a million annual loads. And eventually, I don't know if your capacity is more like 500,000 or
whatever. But is it – is the issue that the truck market's not tight enough and fuel prices aren't high enough? Or so
you're more gradual in your ramp up? Or are you just really trying to be disciplined so you don't either do this well in
terms of service and that it's a matter of patience on offering new, starting up new trains? What is it, because I would
have just thought that this would be a pretty big impact at some point in terms of the volume side with the Crescent
Corridor?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, as you'll recall, back in the fourth quarter and also in our January call, we talked about
34 new service lanes. But we were going to phase those lanes in over the course of 2013. So we're phasing the services
in. We haven't launched them all simultaneously. And second, we are definitely watching the margins closely to build
the books of business as prudently as we can to optimize the attractiveness of that business that we bring to the new
network.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah. Let me add to that. Don is exactly right. And one of the things that we know a
lot of potential customers are doing is they're looking at our service patterns that we've now established. They want to
see how well we're performing against them. What that service reliability is and what kind of commitment they want to
make and I can tell you the trains are running well and we're very encouraged by everything that we see.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: So it's reasonable to think that 9% accelerates looking forward?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yes. I think that's a reasonable assumption. Having said that, we are going to
continue to be very measured and thoughtful about bringing this business on.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wick, can I ask you for some longer term thoughts here just
on the margin? We talked a lot on this call about the mixed headwinds. I'm sort of looking at Norfolk Southern's
historical performance and you were industry leading for so long and so far this quarter actually Norfolk will have one
of the higher ORs. And so at what point do you say we've got to take this more into our own hands and really start to
work these costs out in a much more significant way because if the mix is going to be more of a permanent issue as it
relates to coal it would seem to me that Norfolk has some tools at its disposal to try to change that outcome? But I'm
curious how you think about that.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: You know, Bill, we look at this all of the time and as Mark has outlined, we are
always looking at our cost structure. We have implemented a lot of technology to help us reduce significant areas of
our cost structure. We have done a lot of work and a lot of analysis to show that one of the best ways that we can do
that is just continue to increase network velocity. We're committed to that. The other piece of this obviously is that
operating ratio and margin are extremely important as an indicator of how well we're doing but we also want to go out
there and grow business. And we think that it takes some thoughtfulness in terms of the best way to grow earnings and
therefore grow shareholder returns. We'll confront the changing business mixes and we'll react accordingly but we are
focused all the time on trying to squeeze costs out of the network to the very best of our ability.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yes. Okay. Maybe you or Don could comment on this one. When we think about the service
levels that you're showing here, and they're quite good, does service directly lead to, if you have industry leading
service should you get industry leading price? Is it that simple or is it more that it's not quite so direct of a line.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Bill, industry-leading price could be defined in terms of the definition of RPU. And we're
looking at RPU with respect to the results for the quarter. And it reflects a lot of moving parts as we have already
discussed. So we do believe that superior service over time leads to superior pricing.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: But Bill, let me return to something I said earlier, which was we went through some
rigorous analysis over the past year or so in terms of system velocity and network performance, trying to understand at
what point you optimized your cost structure. We understand that higher system velocity leads to better service which
leads to more customer satisfaction. And eventually we think more business. But the driver that we found was that the
faster we can drive the system, the more costs come out. So we view our initiatives around service and system velocity
as much as a positive on the cost side as we do just in terms of providing that superior service to our customers.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Is it correct to believe that industry-leading service has a higher cost component? I mean I know
you said that costs come out with the fluidity. So is that the only piece of it? Or does it actually have an offset where
the net – you're required to get better price, effectively?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No. No. I think that's the point. And that was one of the things that came out of our
analysis. And really what you have been seeing in Mark's presentations now for some time, and that is the faster we can
run the network, the fewer assets it requires. The fewer people it requires, the fewer locomotives it requires, fewer cars
it requires to handle the same amount of business. So that's an important piece of cost reduction is continuing to take
the network velocity up.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Okay. Sorry.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: And it's also had the, this is Mark jumping in here. It's also had the effect, as you see, of
reducing our equipment rents. It reduces our re-crews. It reduces our overtime costs. And so while all that is going on
with the improvements we see with increased velocity, we have got productivity projects that are teed up around the
railroad that are also helping to drive cost reduction. And one of the newest ones that we've got launched which will be
more significant is a pretty intensive project that will work its way through our terminals where we will be going
terminal to terminal, finding a lot of efficiencies and productivity that will also lower our costs for our terminal
expense.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Thank you very much for the time.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Larkin from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thanks for taking my question, gentlemen. Have there been any major adjustments to the
capital spending program for 2013 in light of the perhaps more tepid outlook on traffic for the entirety of 2013 than you
might have envisioned when you put the capital plan together in the first place?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, John, there haven't. We came in with we think a very good capital plan where the
spending we're doing will enhance and maintain the network and our assets, add some new technology which we think
is important and as you saw, we continue to generate cash flow which is more than adequate to cover that capital plan,
cover our dividends including the increased dividend and help us repurchase shares. So we're comfortable with the
capital level that we've projected for this year.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you for that one. And then maybe a second one. There's been a lot written about how
the shale revolution is generating kind of world-class energy costs in the U.S. and that could lead to a lot of industrial
development and I was just wondering if Don, perhaps, could give us an outlook on what projects might be out there
over the next couple of years that could locate on your railroad that could perhaps offset some of the uncertainty in the
coal business?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: John, that's a very good question and we are seeing a very robust pipeline potential industrial
development projects that involve everything from DRI, direct iron reduction plants, to ethane crackers, to new
manufacturing facilities for all types of plastics. Ethane conversion, as well as the ongoing activity of re-shoring some
of the manufacturing that departed the U.S. and went to Asia that's beginning to make its way back to this country. Our
outlook is optimistic on industrial development.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Is that something that can have a meaningful impact in the next year or two or is it longer-term
than that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It's longer-term than that although I will say, John, that in the auto sector we are seeing
decisions made to move more manufacturing, more production of autos to this country not only for the domestic
market, but for the export market as well to use U.S. as a platform for exports.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe to just follow-up on the margin question earlier. You've talked
about productivity gains this year of about $100 million. Now that we're through the first half I was just wondering if
there was any update to that expectation and also if you could just talk about how much of that is coming from cost
initiatives versus any changes we're seeing in mix?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well as far as that $100 million savings we are well on track in order to meet that and in fact
exceed that. And that is coming from the variety of productivity initiatives that I spoke of earlier. So we look forward
to more of that same in the second half.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. And now we're getting a little closer to peak season. I was just wondering if you had
an early read on the potential pickup we could see in demand just based on what you're hearing from your customers
today?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Justin, with respect to the – what we used to call peak season, we basically now see elongated
supply chains that ordering starts much sooner in the summer and I would describe our outlook for a fall peak to be
more of a fall mound. It will be a gradual uptick to support retail sales which are not that strong to start with, but we
don't expect to see a peak. We do expect to see increased volumes starting August, September, October to support the
retail season.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Thanks. So in the past you've had a pretty favorable long term secular view on the role of the
U.S. and export coal markets, but given the comments you made earlier in terms of efficiency gains at coke making
facilities and steel mills and the fact that we are seeing a lot of this occur in China and maybe even layering on top of
that, expectations for reduced steam coal burn in Europe due to some of the environmental legislation going on over
there. Has your view changed here? It seems like there has been some structural changes, so hoping to get an update
there.

<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No. Our view on the export market over time has not changed other than the fact that
right now we are seeing an oversupply of coal in the world market. The Australian exchange rates are helping their cost
structure. Their production is up. We're seeing Europe in terms of their economic recovery not doing very well and
Europe, Northern Europe in particular is a natural market for U.S. export coal. So until we see the European economy
begin to recover, we will continue to see exports from the U.S. be challenged. I do believe that thermal coal in the
world market, the demand for that, will continue to grow, probably by as much as 50 million tons next year in just the
year 2014. So power plants are being built. Coal usage is being ramped up around the world. It's all a matter of who is
going to supply it and who has the cost structure to be able to supply it at world prices.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay. That's great color. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Hey, gentlemen. How are you guys?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Hi, Jason. How are you?
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Hanging in there. A couple quick questions. Looking at the intermodal business, we've been
hearing some hours of service going through some of your truck competitive lanes right now. You're obviously taking
some market share off the highways. I was wondering what is your long-term view on some of the competitive trucking
prices. I mean, it's been pretty muted for a while now. Is there going to be an opportunity coming up for you or, even
more importantly, some of your partners to be able to raise some of these intermodal rates?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Good afternoon, Jason. You know the hours-of-service law that just went into effect
July 1; we obviously are not seeing any impact yet. We've all seen the same type of projections out there of somewhere
between 3% and 5% loss of productivity in over the road trucking as a result of the hours-of-service law. We expect
that will continue, that will show or manifest itself as time goes on. And the law is being monitored and enforced. So
we do expect it to make trucking tighter, the capacity a little tighter. And we expect it to have a favorable increase or
impact on intermodal pricing.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. My second question is a follow-up. You guys, I think, Wick, you were talking about
running a faster network should equal fewer assets and employees. So as we look out longer term, looking at your head
count, is this going to be something where the head count just sort of hovers around this level as you improve the
network fluidity and speed?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I would say, as Mark indicated, we've taken our head count down some. We expect it
to come down some more. It will be gradual. We've got a lot of initiatives underway in terms of productivity, not only
in the train and engine workforce, but across all of the operating divisions. We expect them to, they won't come to
fruition in the next two months, but over the next year to 18 months we'll see continued reductions there. And then the
second piece of this is what's the volume? And we'll have to – head count will to some extent, be determined by
particularly on the train and engines side by what are the volumes we're handling. I can tell you we think that we have
plenty of capacity in the network today, certainly in the merchandise train network, to take on volumes without having
to add a lot of trains or train crews. I would expect that we're going to be able to take head count down more from here.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: I appreciate the time, guys.

<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Afternoon. So want to just go back to pricing. All of the other rails get some
form of same store pricing metrics and they are all in the 3.5% to 4% range if you exclude export coal, given all the
question you're getting on pricing and yields and when you are talking about as mix and fuel, do you feel comfortable
giving us a sense, are you in that 3.5% to 4% same store pricing range excluding the pressure you are seeing on export
coal?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Scott, we would prefer not to talk about the range of our pricing. We have made that decision
based on the fact that there are multiple constituents on our earnings calls. We will tell you that we're confident that we
continue to move forward with pricing that will exceed the rate of rail inflation over time excluding coal at this point in
time. We do think coal will bottom out and at the time that it does we will certainly convey that to everyone on these
calls. But our commitment is to inflation plus pricing.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then one other question on fuel. It seems like fuel, the lag impact, is more volatile
for you than in some of the other rails. Is that something that you're thinking about trying to change or can change in
the way you structure your fuel surcharges so it's less volatile going forward?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well we look at that and we understand that it does add some volatility in terms of
the surcharge and the lag as well. Every carrier has and always has had its own program. We have our own program.
We look at it and monitor it all the time. It's not something that you necessarily change quickly because a lot of our fuel
surcharge components are wrapped up in contracts of various duration. But we're going to do what we do in every
instance. We're going to look at the effectiveness of the surcharge program. We're going to look at how it's viewed in
the marketplace and respond accordingly.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Are you trying to smooth out that volatility? Or is there an offsetting advantage you think you
have, or yeah, we have more volatility, but on the offset we get this that maybe the other rails don't get?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: You know, we have watched this and looked at this. And while we understand that on
a quarterly basis it may add some volatility, at the end of the day, I think we seem to get to about the same place that
most other folks do over a longer period of time. And we'll watch it. But the volatility in and of itself we view as
something that's just part of the program we have in place today.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: That's a fair point. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our last question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Don, wanted to talk a little bit about the utility
pricing in the East. Your competitor has introduced this idea of fixed and variable pricing for about 20% of its business.
And I had two questions for you. The first is do you have any similar programs in the works? And the second is, do you
think at some point you might be forced to price match at a marginal level to keep some of the plants that you serve
competitive relative to those plants that might have a variable pricing structure?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We have been having ongoing discussions with some of our utility clients regarding that
pricing methodology on a quarterly basis. We'll continue to have those discussions and reviews. And where it makes
sense for us in terms of profitability and margins and being competitive, we will certainly continue to have that
dialogue and take definitive action accordingly.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Do you think that, that marginal pricing structure could influence dispatch curves and
the competitiveness of various plants? I guess I'm just trying to figure out if you feel like you might get pushed that
way by the market.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That is very uncertain to us at this point.
