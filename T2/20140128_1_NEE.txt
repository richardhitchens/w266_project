Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong financial results in 2013, while
continuing to execute on the objectives we shared with you at our Investor Conference in March. At FPL, we continue
to execute on our large construction projects, focused on productivity and cost effectiveness and identified and made
substantial progress on our incremental capital investment opportunities. Achieving these objectives will help us to
continue to deliver the best customer value in the state and one of the best in the nation.
Also at FPL, the Florida Public Service Commission gave its approval for the natural gas transportation capacity
contracts that will provide the commercial basis for a new third pipeline into the state, which ultimately will benefit all
Floridians. This is an essential first step to enable the Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection
Pipeline projects to move towards construction.
At Energy Resources, we continue to execute on our backlog of U.S. and Canadian wind projects and met our
milestones for the development of our U.S. solar portfolio. We also remain focused on further developing our U.S.
wind portfolio and securing incremental solar opportunities.
In our Transmission business, we commissioned the Lone Star Transmission line during the first quarter, on time and
under budget. As we discussed last quarter, we were awarded development rights by the Ontario Energy Board to
develop the East-West Tie Line transmission project with our partners, Enbridge and Borealis. And we continue to
pursue a number of other transmission opportunities in North America. Overall, 2013 was a very strong year that
positions us well for 2014 and beyond.
At FPL, our strategy is founded upon offering the best customer value in the state and on finding ways to improve our
value delivery over time. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to deploy capital that improves productivity and
leads to cost savings that will benefit our customers and help keep rates low for the long term.
In 2013, we invested approximately $2.9 billion at FPL, with approximately $700 million of this associated with our
three modernizations. Our Cape Canaveral modernization ended service in April, ahead of schedule, and more than
$100 million under budget. The Riviera Beach modernization is on budget and slightly ahead of schedule, and we
expect this new efficient plant to enter service in the second quarter. We continue to expect to bring the modernized
Port Everglades plant into service in mid-2016.
As a reminder, FPL's settlement agreement provides for base rate increases to recover the capital and operating costs of
the modernizations at Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades as the plants enter service. Together, we
estimate that the three modernized plants will provide customer benefits of more than $1 billion over their operational
lifetimes.
Early in the year, we successfully completed the extended power uprates at our four nuclear units, which added more
than 500 megawatts of clean, emissions-free energy to our fleet. We also completed the installation of approximately
4.5 million smart meters in our service territory, which is part of our Energy Smart Florida program, and began to
realize benefits from the more reliable and efficient infrastructure that the program helps enable. Our day-to-day system
reliability remains in the top quartile nationwide, and our customer satisfaction scores increased in 2013.
At Energy Resources, we continue to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable development
opportunities. As we noted during the fourth quarter earnings call last year, we anticipated 2013 to be a down year for
the new wind installations compared to our record year in 2012. But we remain encouraged as we move into 2014 and
2015. In addition to the 1,175 megawatts of new wind projects that we had previously announced, we signed contracts
for 250 megawatts of projects since our last earnings call, bringing our total U.S. wind development program for 2013
through 2015 to 1,425 megawatts.

Of this total, we commissioned 250 megawatts during 2013, all in the fourth quarter. Based on everything we see at the
moment, we believe our total 2013-to-2015 U.S. wind program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts.
In Canada, we brought 125 megawatts into service during 2013 and expect the remaining 466 megawatts in our
backlog to enter service by the end of 2015, with the majority expected to come into service in 2014.
You may recall that as of the March Investor Conference last year, our backlog of contracted U.S. solar projects
consisted of roughly 800 megawatts. Of that backlog, both Genesis and Desert Sunlight were partially commissioned
during the fourth quarter, with 280 megawatts entering service between the two projects. We also completed our
20-megawatt Mountain View project earlier this month.
The remaining 245 megawatts of Genesis and Desert Sunlight are expected to enter service in 2014. And our
250-megawatt Macquarie project is progressing on schedule and is expected to come into service in 2015 and 2016. We
had a successful year meeting our objectives for new U.S. solar development and signed contracts for 290 megawatts of
projects, which are expected to come into service by the end of 2016. The balance of our contracted U.S. solar backlog
is now 785 megawatts.
Let me now walk through our results for the quarter and the full year. We will begin with results of the FPL and then
discuss Energy Resources and the consolidated numbers.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income of $248 million or $0.57 per share, down $0.04 per share
year-over-year. For the full year, FPL reported net income of $1.35 billion or $3.16 per share, up $0.20 per share versus
2012.
As a reminder, our results include the transition costs associated with Project Momentum that I spoke about last
quarter. This includes a negative impact of roughly $0.03 in the quarter and approximately $0.07 for the full year.
2013 marked another year of continued investment in infrastructure projects, which helped improve our overall
customer value proposition and was also the largest driver of our growth and contribution to earnings per share.
We saw a decline in clause contribution to earnings per share, as the completed nuclear uprate projects were moved
from clause to base rates, with only a minor impact on net income. As I noted earlier, FPL's capital expenditures were
approximately $2.9 billion and, as a result, our regulatory capital employed grew 10.4% year-over-year. And this
translated to net income growth of 8.8%.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 10.96%. This includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition
costs. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE for the year would have been 11.25%.
As we noted last quarter, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a
predetermined regulatory ROE for each period; in this case, the 11.25% that I just mentioned, excluding special
charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs.
During the quarter, we reversed $54 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year in order to achieve this
predetermined ROE. For the full year, we amortized $155 million and have roughly $245 million remaining. This
leaves us in a slightly better position than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.
You will recall that we had always expected 2013 to require the use of more reserve amortization than any of the
remaining years of the agreement.
The Florida economy continues to strengthen, and most of the indicators we track are improving. Florida's seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate in December was 6.2%, which was down once again versus the prior month, down 1.7
percentage points since December 2012 and down 5.2 percentage points from the all-time high of 11.4%, set nearly
four years ago. This is now the state's lowest unemployment rate since June 2008.
The number of jobs in Florida was up 192,000 compared to a year earlier. And December was the 41st consecutive
month of positive job growth in Florida, following more than three years of job losses. Florida's private sector
continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 462,000 private sector jobs have been added since December

2010.
The housing market in Florida also continues to show signs of resiliency. Housing permits in Florida jumped 25% over
last November versus a U.S. gain of 8%, and mortgage delinquency rates and the inventory of existing homes in
Florida continue to decline. The Case-Shiller index for South Florida shows home prices up 16% from the prior year.
Other data released in 2013 suggest that Florida, once again, has a very attractive business climate compared to many
other states. The U.S. Census Bureau now estimates that Florida's population increased by more than 230,000 people
over the 12-month period that ended July 1 of last year. And many analysts now project that Florida will pass New
York as America's third largest state some time in 2014. Overall, Florida's economy is progressing well and is poised
for further growth.
As we discussed throughout the year, we continue to see our customer metrics at FPL improve moderately. Underlying
usage per customer increased 1.0% compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year, underlying usage per
customer grew 0.4% compared to 2012. We expect long-term usage growth of approximately 0.5%, net of the impacted
efficiency and conservation programs through the period of the rate agreement.
Another encouraging development during the quarter was a decrease in the percentage of low-usage customers. The
12-month average of the loan usage percentage has fallen to 8.2%, its lowest level since December 2007. The number
of inactive accounts has also continued to decline, reaching its lowest level since 2005.
During the fourth quarter, we also saw the largest increase of customers since late 2007, with approximately 80,000
more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2012, representing an increase of 1.7%. While this is clearly positive,
roughly half of the increase could be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability, enabled
by our smart meter program that we highlighted on our third quarter call.
These new customers, which are disproportionately low usage and residential, have a lower impact on our sales. We
estimate that customer growth accounted for about 0.8% increase in sales in the fourth quarter and 0.6% for the full
year. Overall, we are seeing continued improvement in our customer data. And we continue to believe that Florida will
experience above-average growth over the long term.
Turning to our incremental development efforts, we have several updates to share regarding our progress. FPL's storm
hardening plan was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in November, and the incremental reliability
investments we are making to strengthen the system remain on track. Excluding our major generation capital projects,
we plan to invest approximately $7.8 billion to $8.3 billion over the 2013-to-2016 period in our hardening and
reliability efforts as well as all our other infrastructure investments. This also includes fuel for our four Florida nuclear
units.
During the quarter and following further discussion with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, FPL
withdrew its petition for the peaker upgrade project. We are currently working with the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection to perform additional emissions monitoring to measure our existing peakers' impact impact
on local air quality. We expect to file a new petition and supporting testimony once we have a clearer idea of the scope
of upgrades that will be required.
The monitoring could extend up to a year. And while it is too early to comment on the scope or timing of the project,
we believe the ultimate solution may require us to deploy less capital than we had originally anticipated.
The Florida pipeline, which includes NextEra Energy's minority interest in the Sabal Trail Transmission joint venture
and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Florida Southeast Connection, continues to move through the regulatory process.
The PSE's approval of the contract is now final. FERC approval is expected sometime in 2015, and construction is
anticipated to be completed in mid-2017.
Looking forward, financial results from the pipeline projects will be reported as part of our Corporate and Other
business segment. And so in future earnings releases, we will discuss developments in the Corporate and Other section.

Let me turn now to Energy Resources, which reported fourth quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $85 million or $0.20 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $173 million or $0.40 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to
adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter decreased $0.02 from last year, with greater contributions from new investments
and Gas Infrastructure being slightly more than offset by corporate G&A and existing assets. All other effects were
minor.
For the full-year 2013, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $556 million or $1.30 per share. Adjusted
earnings were $780 million or $1.83 per share, up $0.17 or 10% from the prior year. As we discussed on our fourth
quarter 2012 call, we expected to see growth return in 2013, as some of the headwinds experienced in 2012 subsided,
and our new investments contributed meaningfully to earnings and so improved.
For the full-year 2013, a $0.17 increase in adjusted EPS was driven by several factors. Contributions from our new
investments added $0.31, with $0.04 coming from an increase in CITC's. We elected CITC's for roughly 280
megawatts of solar projects in 2013 compared to approximately 455 megawatts of wind projects in 2012. The greater
capital cost of solar projects accounts for the increase from 2012 to 2013.
The contribution from Gas Infrastructure increased $0.04 over the prior year, primarily as a result of additional
production. These positives were offset by increased corporate G&A and other costs of $0.12, of which $0.03 were
transition costs associated with Project Momentum. Lower contributions from existing investments in 2013 negatively
affected the comparison to last year by $0.03. All other effects were minor.
Looking forward, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts of new solar generation in 2014. As we did last
year, we have included a summary in the appendix to the presentation that compares our realized equivalent EBITDA
to the ranges we provided in the third quarter of 2012. Generally speaking, we came in within the ranges we had
anticipated.
During the year, we placed approximately 375 megawatts of wind into service. We also reached production levels of
nearly 30 million megawatt hours during 2013, the highest level in company history. We estimate that overall wind
resource was a couple of points below the long-term average. Of the roughly 30 million megawatt hours of production,
approximately 60% were eligible for PTCs. The remainder represents output from projects on which we have elected
CITCs, projects that have passed their 10-year window of eligibility for PTCs or Canadian projects.
Nearly 50% of the PTCs generated were allocated to investors under the differential membership interest or tax equity
partnerships we have entered into that allow us to monetize the tax benefits from our renewables projects more
efficiently. As shown on the accompanying slide, the percentage of PTCs allocated to investors grew in 2013. And we
expect that proportion to continue to grow to between 55% and 60% in 2014, as we see the full-year impact of our 2013
tax equity partnerships flow through.
Looking at the company on a consolidated basis, for the fourth quarter of 2013, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income
was $327 million or $0.75 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were
$414 million and $0.95 respectively. For the full-year 2013, the company's GAAP net income was $1.9 billion or $4.47
per share. Adjusted earnings were approximately $2.1 billion or $4.97 per share.
The Corporate and Other segment improved slightly relative to 2012, as earnings from our Lone Star business
increased but were offset by residual interest and taxes. For the full-year 2013, on an adjusted basis, the Corporate and
Other segment was up $0.03 from 2012, driven by growth in the Regulated Transmission segment.
In 2014, we expect annual contributions to earnings from this segment to improve modestly. 2013 marked another year
of significant capital investment for both FPL and Energy Resources, exceeding our internally generated cash flows by
about $1 billion. Our treasury team executed on approximately $7 billion worth of financing transactions across a wide
range of capital sources, including refinancing and various capital optimization opportunities.
These were designed to meet our capital needs, while also supporting our balance sheet and credit strength, which are
central to our business strategies. In addition to a variety of conventional debt issuances, we continued to make use of
project debt to support growth at Energy Resources. And we also sold additional differential membership interests to

efficiently utilize tax credits generated by new wind projects.
We also issued $500 million of equity units to ensure we have the equity support needed during this transitional period
of high capital expenditures. These will convert to straight common equity in 2016, at which time they will be
integrated into our ongoing financing program.
As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, our equity needs are dependent on our success in firming up
incremental investment opportunities that we outlined at our March Investor Conference. We expected to need to issue
at least $1 billion in equity before the end of 2014 to achieve our target credit metrics. During the quarter, we entered
into transactions to issue approximately $1 billion in equity. And when considering our current capital expenditure
program, our target credit metrics remain on track.
As a reminder, our growth in cash flow naturally picks up, as our large construction projects enter service. So
additional equity needs from here on will primarily depend on whether or not we see additional incremental capital
expenditures that affect 2014 meaningfully.
In light of the progress made against our execution objectives, we continue to be comfortable with the 2014 adjusted
EPS expectations we shared with you last spring of $5.05 to $5.45 per share. And for the longer-term outlook, we
continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base.
As always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating
conditions. In the appendix, we provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations. We expect the
majority of the adjusted EPS growth in 2014 to come in the second half of the year. And the fourth quarter comparison
should be particularly strong, given the impact of Project Momentum transition costs in the fourth quarter of 2013.
While we have already begun to see significant benefits from Project Momentum, we expect these to continue to
increase as we go through the year, making for stronger growth comparisons in the second half of the year.
In addition, we expect the first quarter for Energy Resources to be challenged by the difficult market conditions we've
seen so far this year in the Mid-Atlantic region, caused by extremely cold weather and limitations on natural gas
supply. This will likely have a negative impact on any business, including our Full Requirements portfolio in the
Northeast, with fixed-price load obligations. While some elements of our portfolio have benefited from these
conditions, we expect the Full Requirements business in the Northeast to underperform under these extreme conditions.
For the full-year 2014 at Energy Resources, we expect somewhat lower growth in adjusted earnings than we enjoyed in
2013. While we expect continued strong contributions from new contracted renewables projects, both solar and wind,
we expect the existing portfolio will be down year-over-year, as we have four nuclear refueling outages scheduled, as
well as the ongoing impact of PTC roll-offs.
In addition, we expect interest expense to be higher, not only because of a larger capital base, but also because of the
impact of higher rates.
Finally at FPL, growth in the Wholesale segment should be an important driver of growth overall in 2014. But
variability around Wholesale load will consequently become a source of variability for FPL earnings as well.
With regard to the longer-term outlook, we continue to see the 5% to 7% range through 2016, translating to an expected
adjusted earnings per share range of $5.50 to $6, as reasonable. However, 2016 is still a long way off. And many
factors could change our expectations.
Since the Investor Conference last March, we've seen many favorable developments, some of which have clearly
moved our 2016 expectations up within the broad range we have outlined. On the other hand, we've also seen some
negative developments, such as rising interest rates, which must temper our expectations. And many of the projects on
which we have had made progress will drive earnings in 2017 and beyond more than 2016.
Overall, we continue to believe the $5.50 to $6 range is reasonable, given all the data we have at the moment. And we
are working hard to ensure we are as high as possible within that range.

Over the past months, we have continued our evaluation of ways to efficiently recycle capital invested in Energy
Resources' projects, including so called yield co structures. While we are not yet at the point of making a decision, we
can share with you a few thoughts. Many of you have volunteered your thoughts on the impact that forming a yield co
might have on NextEra, and we thank you for your input, which we consider seriously. We've also explored further a
range of possible private transactions, including structures analogous to a public yield co.
As a result, there are five general points which we can emphasize. First, we are committed to the general policy of
recycling capital, both to promote efficient capital utilization and to maintain an appropriate portfolio balance.
We expect to concentrate on deploying capital where we believe we have the potential to create value – typically,
though not necessarily, in the earlier stages of project development and operations. And we expect to reduce capital
investment in areas where we believe we have optimized project structure and operations and/or where others may have
lower capital costs. Typically, though not necessarily, projects that are more mature in their operations and lifecycle
position.
Second, in executing this policy of recycling capital, we will continue to be opportunistic, trying to find what we
believe are the best structure and the best market for each situation as it emerges. Even if we pursue a more general
structure, such as a yield co, we expect there will continue to be individual transactions outside this framework, such as
individual or small portfolio sales to specific investors, as well as project financings and tax equity partnerships.
Third, our continuing assessment over the past few weeks suggests to us that the public form of yield co has some clear
advantages over the private forms we have also been considering. In particular, we have come to believe that valuation
levels are likely to be lower for the private format – at least in today's economic environment – and that there is less
likelihood that those valuation levels will be reflected back on the stock of the sponsor, the so-called read-through
effect.
Of course, these are our considered judgments, so there is no analytical way to be sure. And there can be no guarantee
that we are right. Based on these and other considerations, however, we think it is unlikely that we will pursue the
private version.
Fourth, as we have previously said, our focus is on sustained value creation for our shareholders. The mere fact that
public yield co vehicles may trade well in today's environment is not, in itself, a sufficient argument to go forward with
one.
We recognize that the question of value creation is ultimately one of judgment. But we want to be sure that when we
reach a judgment, it is based on the best information available. Fifth, as we have also previously stated, were we to
pursue a public yield co, we would want to be sure that it was structured so as not negatively to impact our corporate
credit position, which we continue to view as an important element in our competitive strategy at Energy Resources.
Again, however, I need to emphasize that we have made no decision one way or the other. We continue to examine a
wide range of practical issues, including structuring, tax, governance, portfolio composition, interaction with existing
financing arrangements and ongoing reporting and compliance issues.
Finally, while we will continue to take a deliberate approach to resolving the questions we have and reaching a
considered judgment, we hope to be in a position to give you a clearer assessment before the end of the second quarter.
Before taking your questions, let me conclude with a summary of our key areas of focus for 2014. At FPL, our focus
will continue to be on excellence in execution. We will strive to deliver the best value in the state to our customers, and
we will continue the execution of our major capital initiatives, including the two remaining modernizations, our storm
hardening program and our system reliability initiatives.
We will also seek to finalize our determination of the upgrades that will be needed for our peaking facilities to meet
future environmental standards. Supporting our strategy at FPL, we will be pursuing the successful development of the
Florida Southeast Connection and Sabal Trail pipeline projects, with emphasis on being in a position for timely receipt
of all necessary regulatory approvals.

At Energy Resources, we will continue to focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. And we will continue to
advance the development of our industry-leading portfolio of contracted renewables projects.
In particular, we will be looking to extend our strong backlog of projects into 2015 and beyond. And at NextEra Energy
Transmission, we will be focused on reliable operations and successful development of new project opportunities.
Across all our businesses, we will have a special focus on implementing the many initiatives that emerged from Project
Momentum. A competitively strong cost position continues to be an underpinning of our strategies across all
businesses.
At the corporate level, we will seek to finance our activities in a way that supports our strong credit position and
ensures that our credit metrics continue to improve on the path we have laid out for you.
And with that, we will now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dan Eggers at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Before we get run over on the yield co conversation, I guess if you could just talk a little bit
about the wind portfolio and the difference between expected generation additions and what you have under contract.
And when you think those two numbers merge into a final decided number for 2014/2015.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: If we go back to the Investor Conference last year, at that time, we were talking about
expectations for a U.S. wind program for 2013 and 2014 with a range of 500 MW to 1,500 MW. So what's happened
since then, really, is in particular with the IRS clarification of some of the language around eligibility for that PTC, we
can clearly see a path to extend that program from 2013/2014 to 2013 through 2015.
So based on that and what we're seeing in the marketplace, we've revised upwards our view of the total portfolio
opportunities, so that's the 2,000 MW to 2,500 MW. And as you can see from the numbers, we're close to 1,500 MW
already in the backlog. So that means we see the potential for another 500 MW to 1,000 MW of projects that could be
contracted from here on. The timing of that will play out over the course of the year since, at this point, we're really
thinking of it as a program through 2015. Anything that's going to come in service before the end of 2015, we're really
going to have to have the contracting piece wrapped up by close to the end of this year. So we should know a lot more
about where we are by the end of this year.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And I guess just kind of on the yield co, thanks for giving more detail on the thought process.
But when you look at some of the decision points you have sitting out there, what do you need to get comfortable with,
the impact on the credit rating for the Corporate? Is that an agencies conversation and a modeling conversation on your
side? And then I guess when you think about sustained value creation in a public equity, what do you need to see to get
comfortable; whether that's a durable opportunity or not?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well I guess first, I'd just kind of repeat the list in the prepared remarks. I mean we're
working through a lot of practical issues, structuring, tax, governance, there's competition in the portfolio, all of those
kinds of things. Certainly, the credit impact is very important to us. That's a function both of modeling and, obviously,
of conversations and feedback with the agencies. I'm sure many of you're aware that Moody's put out a general piece on
the subject of yield cos, which essentially says that the impact on credit depends.
And so we want to push further to make sure we understand exactly what that "depends" looks like. So it's going to be a
variety of things like that. On the question of the sustained value creation, again, as I mentioned in the prepared

remarks, ultimately, that comes down to a judgment call. I think we clearly have some evidence, just through the
passage of time, that helps provide us some input on that. But that's just something that we're going to have to reach a
point of comfort with on a judgmental basis, and we're not at that point yet.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And I guess the last one. Just as you guys think about NextEra as a whole, how comfortable is
the board with the idea of prospectively changing the rate of growth for the consolidated company from 5% to 7% to
something else, if you were to allocate more growth to the yield co design?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well I think that, that really – the answer to that is really subsumed in the overall question
of, is there a value creation opportunity for NextEra Energy shareholders? If the trade offering growth that you're
talking about ultimately results in greater value for our shareholders, and I think that's clearly a very positive factor.

We'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wondered if you could just talk broadly about renewable economics that you're seeing in
terms of improvements in the technology, kind of PPA levels in general that you're seeing. If you could just talk sort of
holistically about the competitive dynamic for renewable as you're seeing it. Do you see the technology improvements
helping to expand that market? How are the competitive dynamics out there?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: A couple of general comments, and I'll ask Armando to expand. But just as a reminder,
folks, we've seen very substantial improvements in wind economics, driven by technology, larger machines, [ph]
turbine power (35:33) and longer blades. To the point where, as I think most people know, in a strong wind regime, is
possible to sign a long-term PPA with prices in – with two handles on them and still get acceptable returns.
So in many parts of the country today, including the impact of the PTC, wind is the most economic form of new energy
generation. We've also seen significant improvement on the solar side for PV with panel prices coming down. But solar
is a much more limited market, focused on primarily the desert Southwest and a few other areas.
So that's been the general trend. Relative to that general trend, I wouldn't say that in the last six to nine months, there's
been any major departure. But let me ask Armando now to comment on how that is playing out in market dynamics.
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Yeah. I'd agree, obviously, with all of that. The couple points I would add is interestingly
enough – I think we've talked about this before – in some areas of the country, we are seeing where solar's crowding
out wind. The economics of solar have clearly improved across the board. It's not just the overall cost of the panel or
the balance of the plant, but it's also small changes in efficiency.
So although wind economics have clearly improved in some areas of the countries, primarily the West and the
Southwest, it's clear that solar is a better alternative. That's the first point I'd make. The second point I'd make is a
couple of years ago, we talked about seeing more RFPs on the solar side, which we thought was a clear positive. We
continue to see that. We continue to see that even in states that don't have requirements, renewable portfolio standards
for solar. So we're encouraged by that. We're seeing them all the way up through the Canada border and all the way
down to Mexico. So I think that's a real positive for solar that we'll continue to see.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Well that's helpful. Then just as a follow-up on the yield co. For a public option, I know one
of your objectives has been to think about aligning incentives, ensuring that there is an alignment there. When you
think about aligning incentives, would an approach where there're incentive payments along the lines of what we see in

the world of MLPs be something that could be a tool to achieve that?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Potentially, that's certainly a whole area that we're looking at and we think it's important.
But there'd be as close an alignment of interests as possible.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. So incentive payments, in general, that's an area that you're focused on and thinking
about that.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. We're certainly studying how that has worked out in the MLP space. Is there a way
of incorporating some of those elements into different structures? All of those kinds of things, yes.

And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So first – hitting the yield co, first off. What is it about end of second quarter? Is there
something you're waiting for in particular? I just wanted to get a little bit more of a sense as to data points you might be
looking for the markets to make this decision. And when it comes to the valuation discrepancy that you commented on
of late, is it something that you've seen in the public market? Or is it something in the private markets that is really
driving the discrepancy in the valuations in your mind? Just to make it a little clearer.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: The answer to the second question is really based on the market feedback that we've been
observing on both sides over the last few months. So again, I want to stress that that's a judgment call because
obviously, unless you went out with a particular structure, hypothetically, in two parallel universes, one public,
one-private, you never really know. But that's what we're seeing, based – our reading of the market data.
On the bigger question of the timing, I appreciate that we are being frustrating to a number of folks out there. There's
no one particular thing in the outside world that I can point you to. This is more a function of the ongoing process that
we're working through. I think I've mentioned to a number of folks that I've met with over the past six months that it
seems like every session we have with our team internally, they answer a series of questions that we have and that
prompts more questions. So we're continuing to work methodically through our questions, but I do think that we will be
in a better position to give you an update by the end of the second quarter.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then looking at the supply business, obviously, you tweaked 2014
expectations. How do you think about that in 2015, onwards? Is this of a one-time impact from the first quarter's event?
Or should we structurally think about revising expectations from that segment?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well we're going to have to see. Obviously, we just have to see how the quarter actually
plays out. I mean there's a big difference between what's happening – or what's been happening NEPOOL versus what's
been happening in PJM, obviously. And so in part, what the future looks like depends upon how rapidly the gas
transportation constraints are opened up in different parts of that region. So it's clearly the dynamics of the business and
the pricing of that business again, a change, going forward. But we'll have to see. We're certainly not going to change
our return expectations for that business, so we would definitely expect to see higher pricing in the future.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got you. And then just turning to the utility real quickly, you've talked a little bit in
the past about opportunities to add E&P assets potentially within the portfolio to lock in pricing. Where are you with
respect to that?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I would say that we are still in the very early days – and just as background for everybody.
After we worked through the opportunities to improve the efficiency of the generation fleet, that made a huge impact

on our fuel consumption and, over the long term, reduces our expected fuel bill, which we pass through to the customer
very substantially. What remains is still a substantial portion of the bill. And it is subject to volatility, although we don't
see gas prices going up to – back up to the 2007 levels. There's clearly volatility in there.
So it certainly seems to us that anything that we could do that would help lower the long-term costs of that component
and, in particular, to reduce its volatility would be highly valuable to our customers. So that's really the motivation for
thinking about E&P reserves.
So we're still in the very early stages. It's important to recognize that FPL is a very, very large consumer of natural gas.
And so to have a meaningful impact that beneficial that the customer can really see, you've got to do a lot. And we're
probably not going to do anything on a large scale, initially. So if we do proceed down that path, anything we do, we
will start on a small scale. But I don't have any particular timeframe in mind on that.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And then just quickly, lastly, in terms of the competitive dynamic with other yield cos
out there now. Are you seeing more of a cost of capital compression in some of the PPAs out there ? What's the
dynamic, if you will?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No. We certainly haven't seen that – so far that. Maybe that's a longer-term trend, but it
certainly hasn't been the case so far.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hey, Moray. Could you give us a data point on what the current PTC-eligible project
number ended up coming in at the end of the year, terms of meeting that 5%?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I'm not sure I'm following your question, Steve. Could you try...
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: The kind of amount of potential assets that would be able to get the PTC that expired,
meeting that kind of 5% threshold?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. I get you. I get where you're going. Yeah. It's significantly larger than the upper end
of what we believe is reasonable, given actual market conditions. So we're not going to be constrained by the Safe
Harboring issue.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. I guess my other question – and apologize to beat on the yield co. But in terms of the
kind of credit analysis you're doing, could you just give us some sense of what you've heard or what the rating agencies
have already said on this structure and potential impact on corporate credit?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I think at this stage, Steve – I'm sorry to say this, but really the only thing I can say is the
answer is, it depends. And so we're not far enough along to know what the final structure or mix would be to make sure
that it's still not negative to credit.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Two questions, one on the boring side. Just looking at the quarter and even at
the year at O&M at both NEER at the Corporate level, big year-over-year upticks. I assume NEER is tied to new
projects, but just any comments you may have to add onto that.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: I'm sorry – on the FPL side, O&M actually is down year-on-year.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Right. NEER and Corporate.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Oh, I'm sorry. NEER and Corporate. Okay. On the NEER side, it's really growth of the
business. We did put a little more into development expenditures, particularly late in the year. But there's nothing
unusual going on there. It's fundamentally growth in the business. It's actually less than we expected it to be at the
beginning of the year because we started to see some early benefits from Project Momentum.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And then a solar-related question. You made a number of comments about the
economics, you and Armando, about the economics of solar relative to the economics of wind. Is there any interest in
NextEra in terms of the rooftop solar business? If so, what are the economics like when you look at it? How would you
actually enter that business if you were to decide to do so?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well the short answer is yes, there's an interest, but let me be a little more clear. When we
say rooftop, that covers a wide range of territory. Sometime last year or possibly in 2012, we authorized the team to go
ahead and do some basic exploration of the – I'll call it the distributed solar space. The conclusion we came back with
was that we don't see, at least at this time, an economic opportunity in the residential end of that space, which is often
what people think of when they say rooftop.
We do think there may be some opportunities in the C&I space, as you get towards particularly the larger C&I
customers. Those projects often tend to look not that different from a small utility scale project. So we are currently
exploring that area. We acquired a small company that was already in that business, and we have a little backlog of
projects. But at this stage, I would say that's definitely in the category of a toe in the water. And we'll have to see how
that goes. At least at this stage, there's only a useful market for that in areas where rates are high. In Florida, we have a
very low rate structure, so it's not such an economic incentive.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And finally on the customer supply business or the retail supply business at NEER, how
should we think about what's the worst-case scenario? I mean we're expecting another couple of days of crazy weather
here in the Northeast. We've had heat rates blow out. We've had local gas prices at various Northeastern gas hubs
completely blow out. You've had – in prior quarters, going back to issues in Texas a year or so ago – and we've seen
other companies like Reliant back in 2008 have some issues on the supply side in terms of just being caught short
megawatt hours. How should investors think about what kind of the bear case outcome would be for that business for
you?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, first of all, let me just say, inherent in that business, it obviously has a left tail. So
when you have extreme conditions of high/low and high prices, any portfolio like that is always going to underperform.
How bad could it be? Well obviously, it depends upon how many days of extreme conditions you've built into your
anticipation. I think we've been reasonably conservative in what we're looking at so far. I don't think it's going to end
up having a material impact on the year overall, but it's clearly going to weigh in on the first quarter.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thanks, Moray. Much appreciated, and I'll follow up with your IR team offline.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: As you think about growing solar and emphasizing that part of the business more, can you
maybe comment on any potential impediments or bottlenecks to the tax equity markets? Are you seeing any
bottlenecks, or a little bit of color there would be great?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: On the tax equity market, I guess I would say that there is really about the same amount of
capacity now that there has been for the last couple of years. Not surprisingly, we think that rates in that market are way
too high and they really should come down very substantially. But there hasn't been a great deal of change the last
couple of years. We also would certainly like it if there was more depth in the market, but the reality is there's only a
certain number of players. So it's perfectly adequate for the kind of scale of activity that we have and that we anticipate
for the future. But like any other capital market, you'd always like there to be more depth and lower prices.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Got you. And then just one quick follow-up. As you think about potential public yield cos, can
you maybe just give us a sense on how to think about recapturing of any kind of an ITC or PTCs for qualified assets
that get dropped down into a yield co?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well one of the sort of criteria for thinking about asset suitability for a yield co is really
whether they are in their PTC generation phase because the way the yield co vehicle would typically be structured, it
would not able to take advantage of PTCs. And therefore, you would be better off, in general – this is a general
statement; might not always be true – but in general, retaining those at the sponsor level and utilizing the PTCs in
another way at that level. So – and it's really a matter of which projects become suitable for a yield co.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Okay. Got you. And then just lastly, as you think about doing a yield co, how much of your
decision making on whether to move forward or not is predicated on whether you see any movement in the MLP Parity
Act?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: That's really an independent issue, that the decision making that we're going through is
looking at the vehicle or potential vehicles, as they might exist today, with today's tax law.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Got you. Thank you very much.

will have made your decision. Should we interpret that to mean that on the 2Q earnings call is when you'll announce
something? Or are you retaining the flexibility to announce something earlier than that? Just a little bit extra
clarification on the timing.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well to be clear, we're not saying we will have necessarily made a decision by the end of
the second quarter. But we certainly expect to be in a much better position to give you our overall assessment. So by
that, I mean by the quarterly earnings call, could there be something beforehand if we arrive at a decision? Yes, I
suppose that's possible. I'm certainly not going to commit to anything earlier.

<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi, Moray. At your Investor Conference in March, you forewarned us that next
year, it could become a much more robust cash generator in the years ahead, depending on the level of capital outlays.
And looking at your cash flow statement for the year, that certainly seems to have been the case. And I was hoping I
might get you to talk about some of the largest drivers of the changes in the cash flow statement.
So for example, I see that cash from operations is up by over $1 billion or 25%, largely on a $1 billion increase in
depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes, both of which are up by 50%. And then on the other hand, your
CapEx or cash used in investment is down by almost $3 billion, which is a decline of 30% with a net effect that your
cash used in financing activities has reduced your borrowing requirement by about $3.8 billion or 75%. So those are
dramatic changes, and I was just wondering if you might kind of take us through the highlights.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. I guess I'll just go back to some of the things that I'm sure people have forgotten but
that we talked about in the March Investor Conference last year. On the growth in the operating cash flow, first, let's
focus on FPL. We knew that we were entering a new rate agreement in 2013. And one of the key benefits of that was
the reduction in the amount of surplus depreciation that we were going to need, really the conversion of non-cash
earnings into cash. So with the initial base revenue increase and then the subsequent GBRA rate increases, we're now
getting real cash returns that are commensurate with the regulatory returns. Not exactly equal but commensurate.
So we knew that, that was going to drive a significant growth on the FPL slide. On the Energy Resources side, in 2012,
we had just completed the 1,500 megawatts of U.S. wind. And so we knew that, that was going to come – coming into
service and driving cash flow on that side.
So those – and that continues going forward. As the big new projects at Energy Resources come into service out of
their construction phase, they start to contribute to the growth in the operating cash flow. On the CapEx side, we knew
that 2012 was going to be a peak year for CapEx. We were right at the peak of the spending on the FPL side with the
nuclear uprates, the modernizations and ongoing infrastructure spending. And of course, we had not only the 1,500
megawatts of U.S. wind but spending on solar projects, which were not yet anywhere near coming into service, all of
that concentrated in 2012.
So 2013, we saw that start to come down to hopefully more normal levels. So those were both the principal dynamics
that we had tried to focus people on last year. And I just think they came in very much where we expected. So we're
pretty much about where we expected to be on the operating cash flow. We're pretty much where we expected to be on
the CapEx, with one exception, which is we have ended up accelerating on the Energy Resources side some of the
capital spending. We had some opportunities to negotiate some improved pricing on some equipment, which led us to
accelerating some capital spending and also because the development program has gone well.
So those are the main two dynamics. And then as you noted, that produces a huge swing in the free cash flow. Of
course, we also did the equity unit, but more important the $1 billion equity transaction, the combination of a $400
million of straight common and a $600 million of forward late last year. So that contributed significantly, too. But it's a
pretty dramatic swing, and it's reflected obviously in the credit metrics for 2013. And we expect to see, not to the same
extent, but a continuation of same general trends in 2014.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Excellent. Thank you very much. That was just what I was hoping for. Just one
quick follow-up question. Your decision to reverse a portion of the depreciation/amortization that you had taken in
2013 in the fourth quarter. Did that stem primarily from more rapid-than-expected growth in volume sales? Or what
was the driver of that decision?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No. To be clear, just to reiterate, it's directly driven off the policies maintaining a target
ROE, regulatory ROE. The indirect driver that you're getting at actually was that we made quicker progress on the
O&M front, coming out of Project Momentum than we had originally anticipated going into the year. So – and that's
why we end up with a little bit more, $245 million left over at the end of the year. Well I think we – at the end of last
year, we were anticipating we'd be somewhere around $200 million or $220 million.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Got it. Great. Thank you very much.

And we'll take our final question today from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Two quick questions. First, Moray, you talk about the impact of the weather in the
Northeast on your load serving business. Once we get through the season and you assess where you're at, are we going
to see that show up, if I'm looking at the equivalent EBITDA ranges that you gave for the different buckets in NEER?
Will we see the impact of that show up in Customer Supply, Power and Gas trading or in the spark spread and other
line for the 1,000 megawatts or so you have in the Northeast ?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well it's going to be spread across those. Obviously, it's a complex situation. The Full
Requirements book is in the customer supply line, so that'll be much lower than we had originally anticipated. Some of
the physical assets up there as in spot spread and other will probably look somewhat better. How much better remains
to be seen. We'll have to see how the pure marketing and trading line looks. But there are puts and takes even within
that. So there're a lot of complex effects. And some parts of the portfolio have done very well. But the Full
Requirements have clearly underperformed, and that's relatively speaking, for us, quite big in the Northeast compared
with our asset positions.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. And then the last question, of course, it's on yield co. When you gave your five sort of key
issues that you were grabbling with, one of them was that you wanted to retain the flexibility because you need to be
opportunistic to find the best way to monetize each sort of asset in your portfolio. How do you marry that up with or
balance that with the necessity for having a certain amount of sort of visible manufactured growth in the yield co to
attract a low enough yield to make it a low enough cost of capital to be attractive ? In other words, you have to promise
people growth, but then you're saying you want to be opportunistic in the way you place your assets.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Right. And that's clearly one of what I call the pragmatic issues that we have to work
through. We've got to make sure that if we were to pursue the yield co path, we don't end up inadvertently
compromising the value of some particular assets which might have greater value realization if dealt with a different
way.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you. That's great. Take care.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Great. Thank you very much.
