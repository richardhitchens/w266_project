MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the EMC Q1 2014 earnings conference call. All parties are in a listen-only mode until
the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any
objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I'd like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President, Global Investor Relations of EMC.
Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you, good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Today
we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci, and David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO and
EMC's CFO.
Joe will begin our discussion with his views of the trends happening in IT, EMC's vision and strategy, and how the
EMC Federation is managing the transition to the third platform. David will then make a few comments on our results
and provide a bit more detail on how our various businesses and products are positioning EMC for success in the third
platform. He will also discuss our outlook for the year 2014. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines
to take your questions.
I want you all to be aware that we are providing you with new schedules for Pivotal. We have reclassified some
non-core revenues out of Pivotal and into the EMC Information Infrastructure business. These non-core revenues
include the data computing appliance and various Pivotal implementation services that make more sense within EMCii.
Importantly, this change will give you a better view of the strategic growth within Pivotal. These new schedules will

include five quarters of reclassified data so that you can have a good view of trends here. We have included this
information in our press release schedules and in the appendix of today's slide presentation.
We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out all the key assumptions and
discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful
in understanding our assumptions in context and ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your
models. This model is available as background in today's slides available for download in the Investor Relations section
of EMC.com.
Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The
reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release,
supplemental schedules, and the slides that accompany our presentation. In addition, all financial comparisons will be
on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated.
As always, the call this morning will contain forward-looking statements. And information concerning factors that
could cause actual results to differ can be found in EMC's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci, Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony. I would also like to welcome everyone to today's call. As always, thank you for your interest in
EMC.
For sure, the information technology industry is now going through a major transformation, a secular shift from the
client server PC era of computing to the mobile cloud, big data, social networking era. This new era is being called the
third platform of IT. And, as is the case with all big IT transformations, we and all the other industry players will face
strong disruptive headwinds as well as new opportunities that are absolutely massive, opportunities that if executed
upon correctly will usher in a decade-plus of solid revenue and earnings growth.
Additionally and very importantly, as we navigate through this transition, we and the rest of the industry are facing a
global market which is exhibiting an air of caution and spending, resulting from an array of economic and political
uncertainties around the world. Collectively, these two factors are creating an environment that is not for the faint of
heart.
Against this backdrop, we said EMC's consolidated revenues and non-GAAP EPS would both grow by 6% this year,
including the impact of AirWatch. As part of this 2014 guidance, we said in our Q4 call that for Q1 we expected our
top line revenue to be $5.4 billion and produce a non-GAAP EPS of $0.34. Importantly, we also said on our call that
we would strive to build storage backlog. In other words, our plan called for growing storage bookings considerably
faster than storage revenue in Q1.
As you have undoubtedly noticed by now, we exceeded our Q1 revenue forecast by over $80 million and beat our EPS
plan by $0.01. And as David will cover shortly, while our storage revenue was down 3%, our storage product bookings
did exhibit positive growth year over year, and thus we did grow backlog.
Given that we slightly beat our forecast for Q1, given that our Federation model and strategies are resonating very well
with customers and given that our Q2 second half product cycles will be quite exciting and robust, I would like to take
this opportunity to reaffirm our 2014 guidance of $24.6 billion in revenue, $1.90 per share of non-GAAP EPS, and for
$5.8 billion of free cash flow. Again, this updated guidance now includes the impact of VMware's AirWatch
acquisition, which closed in Q1.
And as part of our confidence in 2014 and to honor our pledge to return more cash to our valued shareholders, the EMC
board has unanimously voted to raise our quarterly dividend by 15%, starting on its first anniversary this July. This
would make our annual dividend $0.46 per share.

Speaking of confidence, as I alluded to earlier, what really gives us confidence in our future is our strategy, our
Federation model, and by far the most important factor, our people. So before I turn to our strategy, I would like to
thank my 64,000-plus colleagues across the EMC family, the talented, innovative people of Pivotal, VMware, and
EMC Information Infrastructure for their hard work and dedication to our customers.
Our strategy is squarely and clearly aimed at helping customers transition to the third platform of IT and to help them
transform into a more agile software-defined enterprise. And while our customers are undergoing this IT and business
transformation, we are also providing them more automation, more flexibility, and lower operating costs for their
current second platform IT systems, on which they currently run the vast majority of their business.
In mobile, we are helping customers empower their mobile workforce with enterprise mobile management and mobile
security. In cloud computing, we are providing customers with a software extraction and automation layer of
technology across their compute, network, and storage resources. This software-defined data center approach helps
customers form very efficient private clouds that work seamlessly with a wide choice of compatible public clouds. This
hybrid cloud software-defined data center approach will yield customers more control over their IT, more flexibility,
and more choice and far lower costs.
And to provide customers with an open platform for developing and operating new cloud applications that can be run
on multiple leading private and public cloud infrastructures and not lock the customer into any particular one, we have
helped form the Cloud Foundry Foundation. Today, the Cloud Foundry Foundation includes industry leaders such as
IBM, GE, Intel, HP, SAP, NTT, Accenture, and there are many, many more players who have and will join Cloud
Foundry and back this important PaaS [Platform-as-a-service] initiative.
In big data, our customers need to ingest huge amounts of data quickly and reason over it and act on it in real time. This
big/fast data capability will usher in an era of game-changing new, agile, software-defined business models in virtually
all industries. The ability for an enterprise to innovate quickly around this phenomenon will likely determine its success
or failure, perhaps even its life or death.
In security, the mandate for customers to assure and protect identities is paramount, as is the ability to examine
information packet flow and content. On top of this, the ability for customers to form information governance rules and
to measure their compliance with these rules is also critical.
To maximize our focus, assure strategic alignment, and capture the massive opportunities that will be presented to us in
this transition to the third IT platform, we at EMC have implemented a unique and powerful Federated operating
model. In our Federated model, VMware will take the lead in providing an enterprise-class solution for empowering the
mobile workforce. EMC Information Infrastructure, or EMCii, will partner very closely with VMware and provide
information storage capabilities that meet the required needs for speed, robustness, and cost for this opportunity.
In cloud computing, VMware will drive the software-defined data center and the hybrid cloud. EMCii will drive a
software-defined storage technology named ViPR for block, file, object, and HDFS [Hadoop Distributed File System].
This technology will work on top of EMC's arrays, competitors' arrays, and vanilla white-box storage. Additionally,
EMCii with partners will also supply complete converged infrastructure systems of server, storage, and network. And
very importantly, EMCii will fully partner with VMware and its franchise partners on vCHS and also continue to
partner closely with other important service providers on their cloud initiatives.
In our Cloud Foundry and big and fast data initiatives, Pivotal will take the lead, with EMCii helping to build out
customers' physical HDFS data links and VMware helping provide software-defined data center technology options.
And of course, in security RSA will provide industry-leading identity protection and verification technology, look for
anomalies and stop suspect packet flows, while assuring strong governance audit and compliance.
Additionally, going forward, the EMC Federation is collectively incredibly well positioned to play in new and
potentially very large markets which are now only in their infancy, exciting markets around network functions
virtualization, or NFV, and in and around the Internet of Things. To learn more about our technologies, our missions,
our products, and our opportunities, please join us in person or virtually at EMC World on May 5 through May 8.

In closing, I am incredibly excited by the opportunities the EMC Federated companies have before us and by our
overall strategic position. We are number one in storage in the second platform. And we are well positioned for and
growing very rapidly in the third platform. We are number one in virtualization and leading the software-defined data
center and hybrid cloud charge. We are a clear innovator in the new, rapidly emerging generation of application and
data fabrics, and we are a leader in several very important growth areas in cyber security.
Thank you again for being with us today. And now let me turn it over to David Goulden to present more details and
color on both the EMC Federation and EMCii. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
For the first quarter of 2014, EMC reported revenue of $5.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.35, both slightly ahead of
where we told you we would be for Q1, including AirWatch. Compared with Q1 a year ago, Pivotal grew 41%,
VMware grew 16%, and EMC Information Infrastructure declined 3%. The differences in growth rates among and
within our businesses reflect some of the transitions in the industry as well as changes we made to our own business in
the first quarter. I'll cover these changes shortly.
Within our major geographies, revenue growth was flat in North America, up 8% in EMEA, down 2% in APJ, and
down 11% Latin America. Our BRIC-plus-13 markets were down 1%.
As we indicated in January, in Q1 we modified our fulfillment practices in our storage business to mitigate extra costs
from trying to fill high-volume orders at quarter end. The decision to fill these orders more rationally did result in a
smoother close, although we have more work to do on inventory. As expected, this change in business practices
resulted in Q1 revenue being lower than is seasonally normal. While the level of unfilled orders increased versus Q1 a
year ago, they did not grow as much as expected because our Q1 revenues were higher than anticipated. These unfilled
orders will continue to build in Q2. The good news here is that storage product bookings grew in line with our growth
expectations for storage for the year.
Looking at line items driving our earnings growth, consolidated gross margin in Q1 was 62.8%, down slightly
compared with Q1 of last year. Looking at I-I, margins were down year on year, primarily due to volume. Excluding
fixed costs, storage product margins would have been up from last year's Q1. Pivotal had a higher mix of professional
services revenue because more of their software license orders are now being recognized on a subscription basis.
VMware's gross margin declined from last year's Q1 due to AirWatch as well as ongoing investments, including vCHS.
Operating expense grew at 8% as we continued to make major investments across EMCii, Pivotal, and VMware in
high-growth areas such as flash, software-defined data center, software-defined storage, converged infrastructure, big
data storage and analytics, PaaS, hybrid cloud, and mobile. The increase in OpEx over last year amounted to about
$0.06 per share.
Our tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than last year's Q1 and hurt on the year-on-year EPS compare by a
penny. We benefited by $0.02 in the quarter versus last year from lower share counts, reduced by the retirement of our
convertible debt, and our buyback program. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.35, a penny ahead
of our expectations.
We generated $946 million in free cash flow in Q1, 30% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our cash and investments
at quarter end were $15.3 billion, as we used $1.7 billion in Q1 to retire our convertible debt, invested $1.1 billion with
the acquisition of AirWatch, repurchased approximately $400 million worth of EMC shares, and returned about $200
million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. As Joe said, we are very pleased to announce today that we're
increasing our quarterly dividend by 15%, starting July 1. At this level and with our committed buyback program, we
expect to return over $8 billion of cash to our shareholders over the course of 2013, 2014, and 2015.

Our uses of cash reflect the healthy balance of investments in our future with returns to shareholders today. Our
investments in the business are critical to our long-term success. The priority for customers today is to drive
competitive advantage by harnessing the forces of mobile, social cloud, and big data, forces that characterize the third
platform of IT. However, most enterprise workloads reside on second platform infrastructures, so customers are
carefully evaluating how to leverage these second platform investments as they plan for the third. As a result, they're
looking for technology partners that can support both.
The EMC Federation boasts some of the industry's best assets across the third platform drivers of mobility, cloud, and
big data. And more importantly, we're making progress in each. Pivotal is winning many flagship enterprise customers
who want to build modern cloud-agnostic applications and reason over their troves of data. VMware is in the early
innings of a huge opportunity, building out software-defined data centers, improving the end-user computer experience,
and adding seamless connections to external clouds via vCHS. And EMC Information Infrastructure is partnering with
enterprise customers for the build-out of hybrid clouds, including new web-scale environments for applications with
higher service level requirements and partnering with cloud service providers to standard new, value-added cloud
services.
The second platform will continue to be a very large market for a long time to come, and there's plenty of opportunity
for EMC to innovate and gain share. We have an industry-leading position and vast installed base, and customers are
looking for ways to make their second platform environments more efficient. Technologies like flash, hybrid arrays,
software-defined storage, and software-defined data center are some of the fastest growing areas of IT as they make the
second platform more efficient for customers and set them up well to bridge to the third platform.
As we provide you with a summary of the quarter and an update on how we see the industry and our business evolving,
we will highlight our progress in five key technology areas: flash, big data, software-defined data center and
software-defined storage, converged infrastructure, and cloud. These technologies play an important role in
modernizing the second platform and in building out the third.
Starting with big data and Pivotal, in its successful first year of operations, Pivotal has laid a solid foundation for
growth. With differentiated technology in big data analytics and Platform-as-a-service, Pivotal is now focusing
exclusively on software and strategic services in driving a business model that reflects this. As part of this, in Q1 we
transferred the data computing appliance and Pivotal implementation services to the EMC Information Infrastructure
business. This ability to direct resources to where they make most sense within EMC is one of the many benefits of the
Federation model.
Looking at the growth of Pivotal on this new basis, Pivotal grew revenue 41% over last year's Q1, while bookings grew
significantly faster. As we mentioned last quarter, revenue growth does not reflect the growth in demand as Pivotal
builds out its subscription-based revenue stream. We are very pleased by the fact that Pivotal has captured a marquee or
the marquee customer in almost every major industry sector. We have landmark booking wins in Q1 with wins at a
major global telco, a large U.S.-based bank, and a global consumer electronics manufacturer. The combination of
high-value strategic services and the Pivotal One platform are driving customer adoption and excitement. A global
media company has engaged with Pivotal Labs to build an application using Pivotal Cloud Foundry to drive the future
of revenue enablements. And Pivotal Labs is also connecting a healthcare provider to its customers with a secure
application that leverages the power of big data analytics.
For the cloud to live up to its full potential, born in the internet application should be able to run seamlessly on any
cloud, and this is the reality we're enabling with Cloud Foundry. The growth of Cloud Foundry as an industry standard
continues, as we've been adding many new sponsors who will be announced in the very near future. We are confident
that laying the foundation for open source software developments and governance for next-generation applications now
will expand Pivotal's market opportunity exponentially in the future. This is because we believe that open always wins
in the long run, and we're still in the early stages of building out next-generation applications.
Turning now to VMware and the software-defined data center and cloud, VMware's industry position in both of these is
unparalleled. Our offerings in SDDC continued to gain traction, with the mix of license bookings for non-standalone
vSphere of over 45% in the quarter versus over 30% a year ago. NSX is showing strong momentum with a growing

number of pilots and increased production use. VMware's hybrid cloud business, which includes its VSPP [VMware
Service Provider Program] program and the vCHS, more than doubled again year on year in Q1 and will continue to
ramp with the robust roadmap ahead, including vCloud Government Services, which is on track to GA in the second
half of the year.
VMware's third strategic objective, end-user computing, is also gaining momentum. In Q1, VMware introduced its new
desktop-as-a-service offering on vCHS, completed its acquisition of AirWatch, and earlier this month refreshed its VDI
solution with the launch of Horizon 6, which stands out for its integration with VMware's SDDC components. With a
stronger portfolio than ever, VMware is on track for another year of solid execution in 2014.
Now turning to EMC's Information Infrastructure business, as you know, for some time now, the growth rates in the
storage industry have been pressured by several factors. These include the deployments of efficiency technologies to
stretch resources within a tighter spending environment as well as the introduction of new infrastructure paradigms for
next-generation workloads. CIOs are evaluating the best way to move forward, prioritizing third platform technologies
to drive top line growth and spending on second platform technologies only as much as they have to. We have seen this
dynamic play out in our own results for the past few quarters as customers study their alternatives. The effective
customer pause stemming from these cyclical and secular factors was most pronounced in the high end this quarter.
Several additional factors contributed to the year-on-year high end decline as well, including our new quarter end
fulfillment practices, a maturing product cycle, and double-digit growth in Q1 of last year. While these additional
pressures will ease as we move through the year, overall storage growth will be driven by our emerging storage as well
as by our unified and backup segments and helped by a series of very strong announcements across the portfolio we
have planned for this year.
As expected, overall storage revenue declined in the quarter. But excluding VMAX, storage revenue grew 6%. We are
very pleased that our growth in our emerging storage segment, which includes a number of third platform technologies,
accelerated to 81%. Storage bookings in emerging storage helped offset slightly lower than expected bookings in the
high end. Overall, storage for our bookings, which of course includes VMAX, grew at a pace consistent with our
full-year expectation for our storage revenue growth.
Our emerging storage business encompasses best-of-breed assets in areas that are thriving with the shift to the third
platform, including flash with XtremIO, software-defined storage with ViPR, and cloud where service provider needs
for distributed object storage are met with Atmos, and big data analytics which continues to be the most rapid
expanding use case for Isilon.
Let's discuss the five key technologies we mentioned earlier: flash, big data, software-defined data center, converged
infrastructure, and cloud; and how EMC's Information Infrastructure business is capitalizing upon them, starting with
flash where we have a very strong position.
In its first full quarter of general availability, XtremIO continued its very strong momentum. We began shipping our
20-terabyte XtremIO systems, which are key to increasing XtremIO's use for databases and analytics applications.
XtremIO won dozens of new customers in the quarter along with business from many repeat customers who would be
impressed with XtremIO's consistently high and predictable performance in real-world workloads. These workloads are
typically random in diversity, such as VDI and virtual servers, while constantly high-performance such as very high
speed transaction processing, requirements for which XtremIO was specifically architected. XtremIO's architecture
results in performance that simply doesn't change as the system is filled or as the I/O load grows. And we have a very
aggressive roadmap this year for XtremIO feature expansion and EMC portfolio integration.
As successful as XtremIO is, the vast majority of flash capacity shipped by EMC is in our hybrid storage arrays. Over
70% of VMAX and VNX2 systems ship with some flash capacity. And in all, EMC sold more than 17 petabytes of
flash in Q1 alone, up over 70% over last year and we believe way ahead of anyone else. With this portfolio of offerings
to accommodate the variety of applications for flash, including our server-side software, EMC is the industry leader in
enterprise flash storage. We continue to innovate and expand our lead in flash as its role in the data center grows.

The big data phenomenon is what we've been talking about for some time. And this is an area in which Isilon really
shines. Growth here continues to be a major contributor to our emerging storage growth and Isilon's fastest growing use
case by far is Hadoop analytics. In Q1 we continued to see the power of the Federation at work. Customers are using
Isilon to support best-of-breed solutions from Pivotal. They're also using Isilon with other Hadoop distributions. This
new end market is in addition to Isilon's traditional strongholds in media and entertainment and its growing presence in
enterprise workloads. With its expanding variety of use cases, Isilon continues its track record of success and gained
share yet again in Q1.
An important trend that's driving major transformation is software-defined storage. Within software-defined storage,
we have a number of assets across the Federation: ViPR, ScaleIO, and vSAN from VMware. ViPR is our flagship
enterprise-wide software-defined storage platform. ScaleIO and vSAN are software-defined storage products that both
turn internal server-based storage into virtual network storage, both of which are very different. A full software-defined
storage platform requires both a control plane and a data plane, and ViPR uniquely provides the separation. The ViPR
controller is a cloaking layer that abstracts and standardizes the management of EMC and non-EMC storage and
presents that storage to multiple physical and virtual environments, including VMware. The ViPR data plane provides
the objects, ACFS, and other software-defined storage data services that customers can run on existing arrays or on
dense commodity hardware. ViPR is programmable, enabling customers to consistently automate and add features to
their entire storage environments and to build hyper-scale cloud storage capabilities.
ScaleIO creates a pool of storage that can scale across thousands of servers and presents itself as an external block array
which can be managed by the ViPR controller and exposed to any physical or virtual environments, including those
from VMware, OpenStack, and Microsoft. As we complete our integration plans, ScaleIO can be simply thought of as a
block data service of ViPR.
VSAN, introduced in February, creates a pool of storage that is exclusively managed and accessible via VMware ESX.
VSAN scaled out to the size of a single ESX cluster, 32 nodes, and is very easy for a VMware admin to use.
ViPR is delivering value to customers today. For example, a large telecom in the UK selected ViPR in Q1 to provide
the software-defined storage platform for their cloud offering. With ViPR, the customer has fully automated
software-defined block and object storage across both EMC and non-EMC arrays. In this example, ViPR was just one
part of a much bigger win as the customer also selected our SRM software for single-paying blasts reporting for all
their storage, EMC and other, ScaleIO for low-cost high-performance block storage on commodity hardware and
existing servers, and EMC's consulting and professional service to implement and maintain the environments. At EMC
World in two weeks, you'll be hearing a lot more about SCS [Site Caching Services] and our very exciting
developments here.
Another force that is transforming the industry and our business is converged infrastructure. After exiting 2013 at a
demand run rate of $1.8 billion, VCE continued its momentum into Q1, with demand for Vblocks once again growing
at well over 50% and over half of the Vblock unit sales in the quarter going to new customers. Since Vblocks were first
introduced in 2010, both enterprise and service providers alike have been adopting converged infrastructures in part
because of the ease and speed with which Vblocks allow customers to stand up private or public clouds.
A great example is FOX Sports in Australia, who used a recent relocation as an opportunity to build a private cloud on
Vblocks. With 40 to 50 terabytes of data moving daily and data growing by 3 petabytes per year, FOX Sports wanted
an infrastructure that would handle the enormous amounts of traditional broadcast media but also new media, which
required twice as much storage. The on-premises infrastructure-as-a-service solution on Vblocks has provided them
with IT that was rapid to install, given the short timeframe for the move, and that is easy to maintain.
Growth of our VSPEX reference architectures built around VNX continued at its rapid pace in Q1, with demand more
than doubling year-on-year once again. This is due in no small part to our channel partners who have wholeheartedly
embraced VSPEX and shared in its success. Now two years on the market, our momentum indicates we're building on
the leadership position we quickly captured in this space. We are very pleased with our growth in converged
infrastructure and continue to be the clear leader in CI.

The four technologies we discussed so far, flash, big data storage, software-defined storage, and converged
infrastructure, are enablers of cloud infrastructures, both public and private. The adoption of IT-as-a-service is creating
a new era of IT agility, efficiency, and choice for clients. And our entire storage portfolio covers needs from well-run
private and hybrid clouds through the public clouds. EMC's next-generation backup and recovery offerings are a good
example, allowing customers to build efficient data protection-as-a-service infrastructures.
Our recent announcements include cloud features such as data isolation with secure multi-tenancy for private or public
cloud deployments, the ability for multiple data owners to access data protection how and when they want it, as well as
flexible capacity-based licensing that unlocks the right capabilities when they need it. The strongest driver of growth in
backup and recovery this quarter was Data Domain, which had another excellent quarter and continued to support our
leadership position in this market, illustrating its value to customers as they modernize their backup architectures.
Off-premise cloud providers are making use of our entire storage portfolio to stand up offerings for their customers.
Our Service Provider Partner program, which exclusively focuses upon supplying information infrastructures for our
partners' out-of-service offerings has been our fastest-growing vertical every quarter for the past two years. This
program continued its rapid expansion in Q1 and is now at a $1 billion run rate. This number only represents the
demand from named top service providers in our SP Partner program.
In addition, there are several other ways customers are consuming EMC infrastructure in the cloud. When you consider
the technology we sell, service providers who are not included in the SP Partner program to software companies who
use our technology to stand up software-as-a-service to customers who buy our technology to deploy in service
provider data centers, and also our sales to value-added content providers, we estimate our overall 2013 revenue for
off-prem cloud use cases was well over $2 billion.
Atmos, which we believe is the leading commercially available object storage system on the market today, has
contributed to this success, as its geographically distributed object-storage architecture provides an ideal foundation for
web-scale content depots. We're excited about our future in the cloud, including the growing storage capabilities within
vCHS, and you can expect to hear more about our plans in just a couple of weeks.
Our strategy for success in storage over the long term depends heavily on the success of the Federation overall. Many
of our biggest customers are looking to take full advantage of scale and architectures to leverage the data in their
domain, and in these instances the complementary technologies of Pivotal and VMware are critical. It is the EMC
Federation that enabled us to have strategic conversations and brings the critical mass required to succeed in the third
platform.
RSA is often a part of these strategic conversations, as security is a primary consideration when customers look to build
out their next-gen strategies. RSA did well against a strong year-ago compare, up 5% in Q1. Security analytics and
Archer each grew over 25% again this quarter, and together that represents close to 30% of RSA's revenue.
Actionable analytics are critical to any agile and responsive IT security strategy. For example, within 36 hours of the
public disclosure of the Heartbleed bug, our security analytics customers could download new updates which let them
identify Heartbleed-related vulnerabilities and spot attempts at exploitation. Our leadership position in the security
space was evidenced by record attendance at the RSA Conference in February of nearly 30,000 attendees; clearly very
strong interest in security and in the RSA brand.
Our Information Intelligence group revenue is slightly off where we expected it to be this quarter, although we are
quickly growing our subscription bookings, which get deferred and earned out over the life of the contracts. For
example, all of Syncplicity's revenue is subscription, and revenue here was well over twice what it was in Q1 of last
year. Syncplicity's trial implementations quickly go viral in the enterprise, where it often makes sense to host
Syncplicity in a private cloud, driving storage demand as utilization gross. A great example is a tech company that
started off with a 500-seat trial a year ago, bumped it to 6,000 just a few months later, is now at 50,000 seats, and on
their way to 150,000 seats.
EMCii's service organization is playing a key role in facilitating cross-Federation deals. A great example of this is an
engagement in Q1 at a large global telco that implements Pivotal Cloud Foundry for use by the customer's big data

team. The trust that customers have developed over the years with EMC and with our brand is an important asset in
weighing new partnerships for next-generation build outs.
We're well positioned within EMCii and fortunate to have such a broad base for stakeholders who are dedicated to our
success. I'd like to thank the EMC team, our partners, and our customers for their support this past quarter.
As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our outlook is unchanged. We still expect IT spend growth and storage growth
to be broadly similar to what they were in 2013. As we said in January, we expect the combination of our higher and
lower growth offerings in storage to result in 3% storage growth for the full year, which we believe is faster than our
peers in the space.
With our strong foothold in second platform environments and some of the most exciting IT assets in the industry
helping us propel customers to the third platform, we are well positioned to meet our 2014 targets, which now include
AirWatch: revenue of $24.6 billion, up 6% year on year; non-GAAP operating margins between 24% and 24.5%;
non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, up 6% year on year; and free cash flow of $5.8 billion.
EMC is at the threshold of expansive opportunity, and we are very confident we're on the right track with our
Federation model. We have the right technologies in Pivotal, VMware, storage, and security, and are making progress
in the key areas of flash, big data, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure, and cloud. And we have the
right team of people committed to mobilizing the power of the Federation for customers.
With that, I will turn it to Tony to moderate the Q&A. Tony?

Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourself to one
question, including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for your
cooperation in this matter. Rebecca, can we open up the lines for questions, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. You may ask your question.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks, first just a clarification and then a question. David, on the annual revision, is that just the
inclusion of AirWatch, or are there other things in there that are making for the $0.05 correction?
And then on the high end where you've seen, according to my math, about a 20%-plus type of contraction on a
year-over-year basis, how recoverable is this? How soon is the product cycle coming here to address this? What is it
that you think is within your control versus not within your control in your ability to turn this business around?
<A - David I. Goulden>: All right, great. Thank you, Ittai. Let me handle those in turn. So yes, just to clarify, our
guidance for the year has not changed. When we guided last in January, we did not include AirWatch in the guidance,
and the changes to the guidance are only for the addition of AirWatch. There's no other change in our guidance for the
year. So I know a number of people had a little bit of confusion around that. AirWatch basically has about a $75
million impact on the top line and a $0.05 impact on the non-GAAP EPS, and that accounts entirely for our change in
guidance from January.
Now let me move on to the high end. And yes, as we showed you on the chart, it's down a little over 20% year on year
this quarter, so let me explain a few things that are going on. So the first thing that's going on is there are a number of
math factors. And what I mean by math factors is, A), we had a tough compare into Q1 last year, where it grew double
digits. But importantly, the changes in business practice that we implemented at quarter end and the building of backlog
impacted our Symmetrix line that made the year-on-year growth look a lot worse than the actual underlying bookings

growth; so the biggest factor, math.
The second factor you talked to, obviously as you know, over the years the high end is very dependent upon product
cycle. And at the moment, we have a maturing product cycle. We do have a refresh plan during the year. I'm not going
to tell you exactly when. I don't want to impact our own business more than we have to, but that's certainly a factor.
And the third factor, which is the industry backdrop, and I mentioned it my prepared comments, is basically people are
buying only as much as they have to typically off second platform technologies due to the cyclical factor driven by the
economy and people stretching the efficiency and life of their platform, and also some secular factors as people just are
evaluating alternatives generally in the data center. So that third factor will stay with us, but the first two are very much
within our control. So the first one is the math, which will go away in subsequent quarters, and we do expect to see a
boost from the product cycle later on during the year.
One important thing that I'd mention is that we watch our installed base of Symms very carefully because that's one of
the key metrics that we track. And it's interesting that over the last few quarters, despite a lot of consolidations because
of what's happening in the Symm market is people who are moving from the old DMX technology or the VMAX1
technology to VMAX2 will often tend to consolidate multiple frames into one. Despite that consolidation factor, the
installed base of Symmetrix has remained essentially flat over the last several quarters, which means that to the extent
that we've been consolidating frames, we've also been selling new frames out into the marketplace, and that's a key
metric which we track.
So undoubtedly there's a little bit of churn at the lower end of the base with some of the older systems, but the installed
base has remained very flat, which is also very important because we're not losing installed footprint, which means that
the opportunity to rebound and get some growth back into the Symm base is out there for us. So hopefully, that gives
you a number of factors around Symmetrix that will be helpful.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Ittai; next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew J. Nowinski>: Good morning, congrats on the nice quarter. I just wanted to get a little more color on the
public cloud market. I know you said you generated in excess of $2 billion in revenue from off-premise deployments,
but I'm curious if that's extending your sales cycle as customers evaluate the economics of the public cloud. And then
could you also provide your views on how Cisco's recent public cloud announcement impacts EMC?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Okay. So, Andrew, let me take the first one, and then Joe may want to comment on the
second one. So the existence of the public cloud is one of those secular factors I just mentioned in my last answer that's
just causing customers to look at where they should be deploying their workloads, and really it is all about workloads,
so there's no one-size-fits-all. Certain workloads are better in a hybrid cloud or private cloud and some workloads may
be well suited to the public cloud. So to the extent that the cloud is out there and is clearly a growing phenomenon in
the marketplace, that is one of the secular factors that is just impacting people and creating this general pause in the
marketplace as people look at second and third platform technologies.
What we wanted to do in terms of giving you a couple data points is first of all demonstrate to you that we have a fair
amount of our business actually going into our cloud partner program, our service partner program. But then it's much
more than that when you look at the totality of what we sell to public cloud. So EMC storage technology is very
prevalent in public clouds, and you see a significant chunk of our business in 2013 came from that route to market. Joe?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: It may be a little lengthy, but if you look at what's happening here and you go back to what
was called platform one mainframe and minis, you've got all in one. You've got your server, your compute, your
network all from one vendor. Yes, you could buy some plug-compatible devices, but the management of the control all
came from one vendor. In platform two, we went to silos. So it became a storage industry, a networking industry, a

server industry.
On top of that, there was another industry that was built, the management industry, to help glue it all together. And
scale-up technology has ruled the day. If you look at platform three, what's happening, it's taken a little bit of both of
those, but it's basically recombining at least, at the controller layer, the software for the control, storage, network, and
compute. The management software from many, many different vendors is being replaced with a layer of automation,
and scale-out technologies rule. So what you see is companies like Cisco, companies like us obviously are trying to
provide this software-defined layer. And of course, they want to use their own technologies and their clouds.
But another factor I think to succeed in the future is coopetition. You're going to have to understand that you're going to
compete in more areas but there's a lot of power in cooperating, and that's what we've done with VCE. So the
partnership with Cisco is still strong. My guess is as we both go for the software-defined scale-out, reuniting in the way
of storage, compute, and network, obviously there will be areas of rub. But again, the companies that are going to do
best are going to understand how to do coopetition. That's where we are and you can see that John [Chambers] is very
committed to VCE. I'm very committed to VCE. The company is very committed. Both companies are very committed
to VCE, and it's doing extremely well.

Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Great, thanks. Last night, VMware talked about a $100 million contribution from AirWatch
this year, and then you obviously beat the first quarter by $75 million ex the AirWatch contribution. So you've got $175
million of upside over the last three months, but you're only raising the full-year by a little less than half of that. So can
you talk about has your view around the next three quarters changed over the past three months, or should we just view
that as conservatism as you continue to rebuild the backlog through the year? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Katy, thank you. Let me address that. So VMware did talk about $100 million of
contribution from AirWatch. But basically, if you look at what VMware's midpoint of their guidance is in April
compared to the midpoint of their guidance in January, it's up by $75 million. So basically what happened for AirWatch
is it didn't change their expectation of AirWatch contribution to license revenues. They did get a little bit more
expected contribution to services revenues. But the midpoint went up by $75 million and we've reflected that in our
numbers, so that's why it's $75 million.
In terms of the Q1 beat, you're right. We actually beat our Q1 outlook by a little over $80 million. About $70 million of
that was in the storage business. And if you remember back to the early part of my prepared comments, we said the
reason for that was that basically we didn't build our backlog quite as much as we expected to. And you can think of it
intellectually in terms of that extra backlog is why we beat and we now have to build our backlog up in Q2. So those
two things both normalize out, which is why we're increasing our full-year guidance from what we actually said
initially in January by the extra AirWatch, and the beat this quarter in storage will be basically used to build additional
backlog in Q2.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thank you.

<A - David I. Goulden>: Thank you. We're actually very pleased, obviously, with what happened in Europe,
particularly grading on the curve. We actually had strength across almost every single market in Europe during the
quarter. Only one country, and I'm not going to get into calling out single countries by name, but only one country out
of our whole portfolio didn't show decent growth. So everybody was up around that 8% average. We do think it's good
execution, so we're just very pleased with how things went in Europe last quarter.

Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. Could you talk about in a little bit more detail how you get to the 3% growth in
storage for the year? You talked about high end, but other products and other things that you're excited about perhaps
into the second half because those growth rates have to be pretty robust.
And then if you don't mind, there has been talk in the press around a Project Mystic where perhaps there's an integrated
appliance with VMware around selling vSAN coming as well in the second half. Is there any commentary around that
and could that be material? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Ben, Thank you. Let me take that. So let me explain to you how we get to 3% storage growth
for the year. It's actually relatively simple compared with what we did in Q1 as the baseline. So as we said in my
comments, our storage product bookings, which is the key indicator for the quarter given all the change in backlog, you
really have to look at what happens to storage product bookings. Our storage product bookings for Q1 grew very much
in line with the 3% that we said we'd grow storage out for the full year. So in order to get to the 3% for the year, we just
need to maintain our bookings growth rate throughout the year.
Now we're going to have a lot of help going through the year compared to what we had in the portfolio in Q1 because
we have a very robust set of product announcements throughout the year starting at EMC World in a couple weeks'
time, but then there will be a couple other major announcement phases during the course of the year as well. So we're
very excited about what we're going to have adding into the portfolio over the course of the year.
I don't want to get into specifics around individual projects and code names and things like Mystic. There are all sorts
of speculation in all sorts of industries about what is going to be announced. I'd rather wait until we get to the
announcements and talk about them as they occur.

Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. You commented that your bookings growth was lower than you had
anticipated in your original outlook. And it appears as though perhaps your backlog build was maybe 50% to 75% of
what you had expected it to be. Can you confirm both those statements? And I guess I'd have the opposite question,
which is if bookings growth was weaker than you thought for Q1, why are you confident in maintaining your guidance?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Toni, we did not say that bookings growth was lower than we expected. We said that
bookings growth was in line with our expectations of revenue growth for the full year, so just to clarify that point.
On the second point, you're right. Our backlog build was less than expected by roughly the amount that we
over-achieved revenue during the quarter. Now in the interest of total and full transparency, I'll tell you that internally

we maybe strived to do a little bit higher than the bookings growth rate at the 3% level we talked about for the year, but
that was our internal expectation as opposed to anything that we would have baked into our guidance. So relative to
what we guided, our bookings growth rate is absolutely in line with where we expect revenue to come out for the full
year.

Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Thanks a lot for taking the question. I want to ask you about free cash flow generation. I
know that you guys have reiterated the full-year consolidated free cash flow. But when I look at the Q1 results and go
back over time I think on average you've done between 26% to 28% of full-year free cash flow in Q1. This number
today would imply about 16%. So in order to hit that $5.8 billion number, are there any underlying assumptions or
anomalies that you're making to that free cash flow over the next couple of quarters?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Aaron, yes. Thank you. Let me answer that as well. So a few things happened to free cash
flow in Q1, by the way, all of which we expected as we put our plan together for the year. So first of all, obviously free
cash flow is impacted by lower net income, which was obviously driven by changes in our business processes and the
lower revenue growth. So that was the first factor. The second factor is we had a significant increase in tax payments
Q1 this year versus Q1 last year; that we expected. The third factor was our CapEx spending was up in the quarter,
principally because we acquired one of our properties overseas, in one of our international markets. It just made a lot of
sense from a CapEx point of view. And then the fourth factor was overall timing of payments. So we expected all those
going into the quarter. We knew that Q1 cash flow was going to be lower than historic average. We understand all the
differences and we're on track for the $5.8 billion.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Aaron; next question, please.

Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, thank you. Have you seen any change yet to the product cost and margin profile as a result
to the backlog changes, or is that something that acts as a tailwind later this year? And I guess related to that, last
quarter you mentioned that your bookings margins were higher than the recognized margins. Could you give some
similar color for what you saw this quarter?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, absolutely, Bill, so a couple things. If you go back to my prepared comments, we did
say that if you take out the impact of fixed costs on our margins, because obviously from a storage product point of
view, revenues were lower. So backing out the impact of fixed costs, our margins on our storage product revenues were
actually higher than they were in Q1 a year ago, and they reflect two things. One is the impact of the backlog running
in, and the second would be very comparable year-on-year overall booking margins. So our booking margins were
basically similar. We got the benefit from the backlog.
In terms of the changes of business practices on the fixed costs, which is where they impact things mainly, we saw a
little bit of benefit. But as you see, our inventory levels are still higher than we'd like them to be. We've got a bit more
work to do on inventory in the factories. And as we have continued to work that down, we expect to get more benefits
into the fixed costs.

Next we have Daniel Ives with FBR. Your line is open.
<Q - Daniel H. Ives>: Yes, thanks. Joe, could you just talk? Going into this year after a 1Q versus last year, if you can,
maybe compare and contrast relative to product cycle what you're hearing from your sales customers. And just overall,
that would be just an interesting comparison. Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I don't know if it's changed a lot. I think obviously we're deeper into the transition. There
were customers' realizations that there's something big happening here in what we call this third platform of IT. They
understand that on the back of the Internet of Things and the ability of having telemetry in almost every device and
they're going to be able to analyze that, collect it, analyze it and act on it in real time, they're going to be able to change
their business models and their industries are changing. So there's a lot more focus on the future. That's causing caution
on today because obviously if you know you have to move to the future, you might say what's the minimum I can
spend on today to give me the maximum amount of horsepower, if you will, to spend on the move to the future? So
obviously, that's all escalating.
There are pockets of economic uncertainty out there around the world. Obviously, the emerging markets are a little
softer and there are a lot of factors affecting those markets. So I think it's pretty much the same, but I guess we're in a
later inning of the game. Last year we were in the second inning. We're probably in the fourth inning this year, and the
pace of change is accelerating. We're mincing no words. This is a huge secular shift, one personally I'm excited about
because I think we have great assets – I believe we have great assets to capitalize on that. And again, as I said in my
remarks, it's not for the faint of heart. But if you do it right, there's going to be a massive reward and payoff.

Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia, CLSA. Thank you.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay, great. Maybe you could give us some more color on the emerging markets. It was
down a bit, but that was still better than others. What are you seeing from a storage perspective, and maybe a specific
comment on China, if you could?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, Lou. Our emerging markets were actually impacted a fair amount by currency, also
impacted a bit by currency. So we were down 1%; we were up 1% in constant currency in BRIC-plus-13. The biggest
factor for us was actually a really tough year-on-year compare in Brazil. We had a 68% growth rate in Brazil last year.
We had a 37% growth rate in Latin America because of that. If you take out Brazil, our BRIC-plus-13 end markets
were up by 7%, and so much stronger that on average. And within APJ, China was actually our strongest market, so we
feel good about the progress that we're making in China. So that gives you a little bit of color on the puts and takes
around the emerging markets.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Lou. We have time for one more question and then we'll have a few
concluding comments from Joe.

<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. So you talked about the benefits coming from the new product cycles at some
point post-EMC World and beyond, but also you talked about the secular trends and the pausing in spending as
customers make IT decisions. So I'm just wondering, relative to your full-year guidance, if you can just talk about the
balance between those two things. And then also maybe just share some of your views about what you're embedding
for the full year in terms of macro and geography and maybe U.S. federal spend. Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Maynard, let me start with the last one. We are still anticipating the IT spend and storage
spend will be roughly the same as 2013, so no bounce-back in IT spending. Relative to the assumptions for the year and
pause, we always find that the pause factor is greater in the first quarter because in addition to any secular or cyclical
issues around pause, a lot of customers are still trying to get their budgets in place and finalized. That's always a factor
that goes into the first quarter.
So the fact that we had storage product bookings growth in the first quarter that was in line with our expectation for
full-year growth in storage is actually quite reassuring for us because you've got the pause. We've got relative to the
new products for the year the low point of the product cycle for what we announced this year because obviously
nothing is announced yet. The first things will be announced in a couple weeks' time at EMC World. So when you go
through the year and you say the pause should be a little bit less, hopefully, and the product cycle should be stronger,
then that is actually good sign for us getting to the numbers for the full-year. And those are some of the assumptions
we're basing our continued confidence around making our full-year number around.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Maynard. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Let me again finish where I started, and I just want to thank you for being with us today. We truly and deeply believe
that the EMC family of companies has great assets and great people that are really well positioned for the third platform
IT. Customers trust us in this current client server era. Therefore, we think we're well positioned to help customers on
that journey as they transition their IT, but more importantly transition their enterprises, their companies into more of a
software-defined, more flexible, more agile enterprise.
We have, again, really talented people. These talented people are excited about our future and our opportunities. And
again, I invite you to join us at EMC World either in person in Las Vegas or virtually. I will do most of it over the web
so you can get a good feel if you don't want to travel, and you'll learn a little bit more about what we're doing across the
companies. And so thank you very much for being with us and we'll see you soon.
