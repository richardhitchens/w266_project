MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Release
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial
results in the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ
materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risk and uncertainties, including
those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission including in
the risk factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statement whether as result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.

Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2013 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles so called non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP

measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly
financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable
GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net
investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a
significant impact on GAAP net income.
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and
John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today
to participate in the discussions are other members of management including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas;
Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter with most financial
metrics exceeding our plan. Second quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 11% over the second quarter
of 2012.
Operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 7% increase over the prior-year period, and operating return of equity was
12.3%. This quarter's results reflect the continuation of our strategic shift away from capital-intensive market sensitive
products to high return, lower risk product lines, as well as our strategy to grow emerging markets.
This shift was evident with variable annuity sales down 40% versus the prior-year period while sales rose 28% in our
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment, 32% in Latin America, and 32% in the emerging markets within our
Europe, Middle East and Africa segment.
Our investment margins were favorable again in this quarter as a result of good variable investment income, effective
asset liability management and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect
earnings under a low rate scenario.
In the second quarter, our average investment spread across all U.S. product lines was the top end of the roughly 200
basis point to 250 basis point range experienced during the past few years.
To help you think about the impact of interest rates and earnings, I refer you to the low interest rates stress scenario in
our 2012 10-K. We said that the continuation of the late 2012 interest rate environment in the U.S., through year-end
2014, would reduce our operating earnings by $45 million in 2013, and $150 million in 2014 relative to plan.
In late 2012 the 10-year treasury yield was 1.69%. Our plan assumed rates would steadily increase and reach to 2.38%
by year-end 2013, and they remain at this level through 2014. In addition, credit spreads were tighter in late 2012 than
assumed in our plan. Today, the 10-year treasury yield is approximately 2.6%, or slightly above our planned
assumption, and credit spreads have widened, which puts them roughly in-line with our plan.
With the rate environment only slightly more favorable than our plan, we do not assume investment margins will
expand as a result of the recent increase in interest rates. To be sure, higher interest rates are a positive development,
but the benefits for MetLife are reduced risk of margin impression in balance sheet charges.
Now I would like to provide an update on customer centricity, followed by some comments on the regulatory
environment. We continue to expend significant effort on the four cornerstones of our strategic plan because they are
firmly within our control and critical to becoming a world-class organization. Regulatory outcomes by contrast are only
partially within our control, but require no less effort given their potential impact on our long-term competitive
position.
Customer centricity is an important element of our strategy, and while it won't show up the numbers overnight, it can
help create an enduring competitive advantage for MetLife. I have noted in the past that MetLife and the life insurance

industry have not done as good a job of delivering exceptional customer experiences as some other industries. Simply
put, we are just too hard to do business with.
As a result of important simplification work we are doing around the globe, we have early indications that enhancing
the customer experience not only increases customer satisfaction, but also reduces additional work and ultimately
lowers cost for MetLife. Results in several areas: faster call handling, improved self-service, first contact customer
resolution and streamlined claims processing bear this out.
In Korea, improved technology has dramatically reduced telephone wait times, with 86% of the calls answered in less
than 20 seconds today, up from 27% before the upgrade. In the U.S., simple fixes to our website tripled customer use of
our online change of address process and virtually eliminated related customer complaints.
In the U.S. and Mexico, call center representatives, newly empowered with better tools and technology, are now
resolving 60% of customer problems in a single contact, up from 45%.
And in Poland, a redesigned claims process including simpler forms, reduced documentation requirements and
proactive status updates to customers reduced life insurance claim payments turnaround times by 30% from 5.6 days to
3.9 days. There is still much work to be done, but I am encouraged by our early progress on improving the MetLife
customer experience.
Now let me offer few observations on the regulatory environment. As you know, on July 18, the Financial Stability
Board designated MetLife and eight other insurance companies as globally systemically important insurers, or G-SIIs.
Our understanding is that being named a G-SII has no legal effect unless MetLife is designated a Systemically
Important Financial Institution, or SIFI, by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.
If we are designated a SIFI, MetLife would be subject to enhanced prudential standards, promulgated by the Federal
Reserve. Furthermore, the Fed would have to determine whether to subject U.S.-based G-SIIs to additional supervision
and prudential rules.
Two days before we were named a G-SII, FSOC voted to advance MetLife to Stage 3 of the SIFI Designation Process.
As I said at the time, I do not believe that MetLife is a Systemically Important Financial Institution. The life insurance
industry is a source of financial stability, even during periods of financial stress that long-term nature of insurance
liabilities protects against bank-like runs and the need to sell assets quickly.
For pure protection products, the company makes no payment unless an insured event occurs, so there's no way to
accelerate the liabilities. For products that include a savings component, there are strong disincentives to surrender and
cash out. Not only can policy holders face surrender charges and tax penalties, but they may find it difficult to purchase
new policies, if they have to be medically re-underwritten. The existence of the state-based guarantee funds provide a
further incentive for customers to hold on to their policies. Importantly, state insurance regulators have the ability to
halt surrenders in the event of financial distress and have typically done so.
As a practical matter, being moved to Stage 3 means that FSOC can request nonpublic financial information to examine
a company's potential for systemic risk. During the process, MetLife is permitted to submit additional information to
FSOC demonstrating that our business does not pose a systemic risk. It's unclear how long we'll remain in Stage 3 of
the designation process. Our only frame of reference from the insurance industry is the experience of AIG and
Prudential, both of which spent more than seven months in Stage 3.
After Stage 3 is complete, a two-thirds vote of FSOC is needed for a proposed determination that a company is a SIFI,
including an affirmative vote by the chairperson, who is the secretary of the treasury. If the company received a notice
of proposed determination, has 30 days to request a nonpublic hearing to appeal the decision.
FSOC then has 30 days to hold a hearing and another 60 days post-hearing to make a final determination, which again
requires a two-thirds vote of FSOC including an affirmative vote by the chairperson. At that point, a company may
bring action in U.S. District Court seeking to have the determination rescinded.

The critical question for insurers designated as SIFIs is what the prudential rules will look like. Will they be bank-like
capital rules? Or rules appropriate for the business model of insurance? Senator Susan Collins of Maine helped put this
issue in perspective in a letter to the federal banking regulators last fall. For context, Senator Collins sponsored the
provision of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring capital standards for non-bank SIFIs to be no less rigorous than those that
apply to banks.
In her letter she said, "It was not Congress's intent that federal regulators supplant prudential state-based insurance
regulation with a bank-centric capital regime." We strongly believe that insurance companies should be regulated
differently than banks. As I've said many times, if life insurers are subjected to capital rules designed for banks,
MetLife's ability to issue guarantees would be constrained. We'd have to raise the price of products we offer to
consumers or stop offering certain products altogether.
To be clear, we strongly support prudential regulation of the life insurance industry. After all, we are financially liable
for insolvencies to the state-based guarantee funds. What is imperative is that the rules be tailored to the business model
of insurance.
In closing, while the regulatory environment remains fluid, we are delivering strong financial performance today and
executing on our strategy to generate increasing shareholder value over time.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results including a discussion of insurance
margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash,
capital and guidance.
As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.44 per share, up 11% year-over-year. This
quarter included a few notable items, all in our EMEA region.
The first relates to our pension business in Poland. In June, the government of Poland announced three proposals and
any one of these three would materially change the country's pension system. A change in the system is expected
before the end of the year with implementation occurring sometime in 2014.
We expect that the economics of our pension business will be materially altered in Poland, resulting in either a
significant reduction or the elimination of our pension assets under management, which were approximately $7 billion
as of June 30.
Therefore, we have written-off the entire DAC and VOBA balance related to this business, resulting in an after-tax
charge of $26 million or $0.02 per share in the second quarter. Going forward, our preliminary estimate is that this
change to the Polish pension system will reduce EMEA's operating earnings by $15 million to $30 million annually.
Also in EMEA, we had a couple of one-time tax items this quarter. The first was a tax benefit of $52 million, as we
made an APB 23 assertion for the region. This was partially offset by a $30 million write-off of a deferred tax asset
related to our U.K. Wealth Management business due to regulatory changes that made future sales growth and profits
less certain for this start-up operation. The net benefit of these two items was $22 million or $0.02 per share.
Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $471 million or $0.43 per share, and included net
derivative losses of $1.1 billion after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was driven primarily by three items that
we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment. These are, number one, an
increase in interest rates. Number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the weakening of the yen relative to
the U.S. dollar. And number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.20 at June 30, down modestly from March 31. This slight decline was
a function of modest net income due to the net derivative loss and two quarterly dividends declared in the quarter.

Turning to margins. Underwriting was generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in Retail Life was 89.7%
due to unfavorable experience in both Variable and Universal Life and Traditional Life. This result was higher than our
expectation for the quarter and worse than the 85.6% ratio in the second quarter of 2012.
The mortality ratio in Group Life was 86.5% in the quarter, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 87.3% and well
within the target of 85% to 90%. The improvement in the mortality ratio was driven by lower Group Universal Life
claims experience.
As a reminder, a one percentage point change in the mortality ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of
approximately $2 million to $3 million for Retail Life and $8 million to $10 million for Group Life.
The non-medical health benefit ratio was 89.5%, up 210 basis points from the prior-year quarter of 87.4% and at the
top end of the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary driver for the increase in the ratio was weaker underwriting
results in long-term care, due to higher incidents and to a lesser extent an increase in the average claim size.
However, we are seeing an improvement in disability underwriting results, as the overall claims incidence trend
continues to be favorable. As a reminder, a one percentage point change in the non-medical health benefit ratio equates
to an operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis.
In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 107.5% for retail and 97.7% for group. Retail
was impacted by higher than budgeted catastrophes in the Midwest. Overall, catastrophes were higher than budgeted in
the quarter, by $16 million or $0.01 per share. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were higher year-over-year
in both retail and group at 86.1% and 92.1% respectively. The increase was driven by elevated non-catastrophe weather
related losses and lower favorable prior-year reserve development.
Next let me turn to investment spreads. In our QFS, you will note that the spreads remain strong and are higher versus
the prior-year quarter across all major product lines in the U.S., driven by higher variable investment income and
derivative income. A simple average of the investment spreads in our U.S. businesses were 244 basis points this
quarter, which compares to 231 basis points in the second quarter of 2012 and 235 basis points in the second quarter of
2011.
This progression illustrates the resilience of our investment margins despite a challenging interest rate environment. In
the quarter, pre-tax variable investment income was $312 million reflecting strong returns from private equities and
hedge funds.
After DAC and taxes, variable investment income was $202 million or slightly less than a $0.01 per share, above the
top end of our 2012 or 2013 quarterly guidance range.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5% for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of
pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 22.8%. This compares favorably to
the second quarter of 2012, which had an operating expense ratio of 23.7% and 23.4% excluding pension and
post-retirement benefits and closeouts.
We are pleased with this performance as it reflects progress on our strategic goal to reduce net expenses by $600
million. Through the first half of 2013, gross expense saves were $248 million, while net saves were $173 million after
adjusting for reinvestment of $12 million and one-time cost of $63 million.
I would now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I will focus
on areas where our results may have differed from your expectations. Therefore my comments will be on retail
annuities, group, voluntary and worksite benefits, corporate benefit funding, Latin America and Asia.
Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $368 million, up $142 million or 63% versus the prior-year quarter. The
earnings drivers were comprised of several factors including favorable market impact, lower ongoing DAC
amortization, lower operating expenses, and higher net investment income.

Variable annuity sales were $2.8 billion in the quarter, down 40% year-over-year, and 22% sequentially. We continue
to target full year VA sales of $10 billion to $11 billion. Effective August 12, we are eliminating sub-pays for all GMIB
Max and Enhanced Death Benefit Max products, other than our current product GMIB Max V.
Group, voluntary and worksite benefits reported operating earnings of $275 million, up 3% year-over-year. And I
mentioned previously, underwriting results were unfavorable in long-term care and property and casualty, and this was
the case both year-over-year and relative to our expectations. However, improved investment and expense margins
were effective offsets to less favorable underwriting margins.
Turning to corporate benefit funding, operating earnings were $350 million, up 10% year-over-year. The growth was
driven by improvements in investment and underwriting margins. Investment margins improved as a result of lower
credit and interest, primarily on capital markets products and higher variable investment income. The increase in
underwriting margins was primarily driven by mortality gains in the U.S. pensions business.
In Latin America, operating earnings were $125 million, down 7% year-over-year, and 11% on a constant currency
basis due to adverse mark-to-market investment results in Brazil and Mexico, the impact of inflation in Mexico and
Chile and higher expenses, primarily due to business initiatives in the region.
While bottom line results are pressured, underlying business growth in the region drove solid top line performance.
Premium fees and other revenues were up 12% year-over-year, and 8% on a constant currency basis driven by growth
in worksite market in Mexico, group insurance in Brazil and direct marketing in Argentina.
In addition, total sales in Latin America were up 32% year-over-year with strong growth in all countries. In Mexico,
sales growth was driven by increases in retail and group products. In Chile, the sales increase was driven by growth in
the agency force. In Argentina the increase was driven by direct marketing. And finally, sales growth in Brazil was
driven by higher accident and health sales.
Turning to Asia, operating results were $330 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year and 27% on a constant
currency basis. Earnings were driven by underlying business growth, higher fee income from the surrender of foreign
currency fixed annuity products in Japan and strong equity market performance in Japan, which resulted in a decline in
Variable Life guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves that benefited operating earnings by $19 million.
This quarter, we again saw higher surrender activity in Japan, which was an item we highlighted on our last call. This is
the result of customers harvesting gains in foreign currency denominates fixed annuity products, denominated in
Australian in U.S. dollars. We believe the customers have shifted assets into equities, which continued to perform very
well. In the quarter, surrender fees in excess of plan contributed $35 million to Asia's operating earnings. We expect
that surrender fees will decline significantly in the second half of the year.
In addition, as a result of elevated surrenders in the first half of the year, we would expect to see a reduction to
operating earnings by slightly less than $15 million annually. Finally, Asia's second quarter operating earnings were $9
million lower than our plan as the result of the yen weakness relative to the U.S. dollar.
As we have stated previously, we have hedges for our 2013 projected yen exposed operating earnings at strike prices at
around 90 yen to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options, which provide protection against the yen
weakening beyond 90 yen, but allow us to participate in the upside should the yen strengthen. Our protection now
extends through the third quarter of 2014 with currency options at around 90 yen in place for the first quarter, around
95 yen in the second and in the range of 95 yen to 100 yen for the third quarter.
Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$6.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by $1.4 billion of subsidiary dividends,
as well as the $550 million release of capital from unwinding MetLife Bank, as we mentioned at our May Investor Day.
Next I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios
annually. So we do not have an update for the second quarter. With regards to Japan, our solvency margin ratio was
1,033% as of the first quarter of 2013.

Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies, for the
second quarter of 2013, was $614 million and $176 million respectively. The statutory operating earnings were up $382
million from the prior year due to improved market conditions, while net income was lower than the prior year
primarily due to derivative and joint venture capital losses.
For the first six months of 2013, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance
companies were $1.4 billion and $734 million respectively. Total adjusted capital for our domestic insurance
companies is expected to be approximately $27.4 billion as of June 30, down 6% from December 31 primarily due to
subsidiary dividends paid to the holding company. Excluding the dividends, total adjusted capital would have been
down 1% for the year due to unrealized losses driven by derivatives.
Finally, let me provide some comments regarding guidance. Considering the out performance in the quarter and the
first half of the year, we now expect to exceed the top end of our 2013 EPS guidance range of $4.95 to $5.35. We
believe that our operating EPS will likely be lower in the second half of 2013 relative to the first half of 2013, primarily
for four reasons.
Number one, we still anticipate investment spread compression for the balance of the year, despite recent increase in
interest rates, due to our expectation for lower variable investment income and lower core yields. Number two, we
assume a less favorable market impact for the second half of the year.
Number three, we expect that surrenders in Japan will return to a more normal level in the second half of the year,
which should mean a decline in surrender fee income relative to the first half of the year. And number four, we project
higher expenses in the second half of the year driven by key enterprise initiatives. Partially offsetting these items is the
anticipated accretion from the acquisition of Provida, which is expected to close at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne, Agee. Please go
ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Good morning, everybody. Two questions, unrelated issues. The first is you talked and gave
some good detail on the potential change from the pension reform in Poland. I was wondering if you could sort of give
us an update on your expectations. There has been a lot of discussion about potential for reform in Chile, so maybe you
can talk about your current business there and then the potential impacts on Provida.
<A - Michel Khalaf>: Hi. Good morning, John. This is Michel Khalaf. Just let me...
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Good morning.
<A - Michel Khalaf>: Good morning. Let me first of all just give you a little bit of the background around the
proposed pension reform in Poland. Poland was one of the best performing economies in the EU following the financial
crisis. However the economy slowed down significantly in the last year, 18 months so GDP growth is expected to be
under 1% this year. In addition to that, Poland has two main major challenges. One is around its debt to GDP ratio,
which under the Polish constitution must be maintained under 55%, otherwise, that would trigger austerity measures.
And the other issue that Poland faces is that the EU requires it to have its budget deficit brought down to under 3% and
that budget deficit is currently close to 4%.
So given this economic background political situation with a government in its second term facing elections in 2015,
the Polish authorities are intending to introduce changes to the pension system, which is tantamount really to a partial
re-nationalization of the system. But the situation as Poland is quite unique in the sense that Poland is facing these
challenges and hence the proposed reforms. Obviously we're disappointed at these developments. We think that in the

long run, these measures will have detrimental effects especially as far as the development of capital markets in Poland
and as far as participants in the pension system as well. And we're working hard with the other participants in the
market and industry and trade associations to hopefully convince the government to make some changes to those
proposals. So that's a little bit the background on Poland. Let me turn it over to Bill Wheeler to talk to you about Chile.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thanks.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Thanks, Michel. So, John, a couple of things, just give you a little context about Chile.
Chile is a very attractive place to do business. It has a AA minus sovereign credit rating. That's the highest in Latin
America. Obviously, we took that into account, when we announced the acquisition of Provida. Just remember, we
think we've bought Provida at a very attractive price relative to where other properties in that market have traded over
the past couple of years. So it's a transaction that we're still very excited about. There is a presidential election
campaign going on in Chile, so there have been some comments about the AFP pension scheme. You know, Chile
thinks they invented and I guess they did invent this private pension scheme 20 plus years ago. They're very proud of it.
They think it's been a roaring success and I don't disagree with that.
The comments in the presidential election have come both from the contenders for the new job as well as the existing
President Piñera. Michelle Bachelet, who was president of Chile previously and is now likely to be the winner in this
coming election in November, has made some comments and I would guess the comments are along the lines of she
wants to see contributions increased some sort of 10% of salary to maybe something like 12%. And also, she wants to
make sure that workers at sort of lower socioeconomic levels, sort of itinerant workers are covered more thoroughly by
the existing pension schemes. I would also say she has talked about a lot of reforms in a lot of areas of the country and
so this is one of many things that she's focused on in her election campaigning. So when we step back and think about
what's been said and sort of her track record – remember she had been President before so she's a known quantity. We
are still very comfortable with the Provida acquisition and think it's going to be very successful for us.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thanks for all that context. And then the second question I just had, John, you mentioned in
corporate benefits funding that it was really the investment margins expanded largely because of lower crediting rates
related to capital markets-type business. Could you maybe give us more clarity there, especially as it relates to is this a
lower level crediting rate that we should expect will continue or is it more tied to – what is that tied to? Is it tied to
LIBOR? Is it tied to rates at the longer end of the curve; should those crediting rates jump back up?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Right. Well, I would view this more as a one-time opportunistic excellent management
performance by our Investment team, really in the quarter. Also we've had good derivative income across all the lines.
This line also benefited from some good returns we had on our sec lending program. So a lot of the assets that we've
loaned out in the quarter were from this group, and we had slightly higher margins than we've had historically. So I
would not put this for a full run rate.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Appreciate that. Thank you very much.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Steve will add a little bit to this too, as well.
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: Let me just add a little color. It's Steve Goulart.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Hi, Steve.
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: And we like to think of it as more than one-time too because a lot of it was really related to
just what's happening in the capital markets. As we've been refinancing our funding agreement back notes, obviously
those costs are coming down and they're down substantially. If you look at what we refinanced in the first half of the
year, on the order of $6 billion worth, it's down 100 basis points to 150 basis points, and our asset yields are just not
coming down as rapidly. So we're seeing good margins there.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: That's really helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions. First on cash. At $6.5 billion, even if we
adjust for the Provida acquisition, it seems like cash is tracking a little bit at the high end of what you have guided for
the end of the year. So I want to see if maybe you had an update there.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We're tracking within the range we gave you on Investor Day.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Okay. And then on ROEs, I think as of midyear you are already in the 12.5% range. And
thinking of previous guidance, which I think was 11% to 13% ex any buybacks and probably 11% if rates remain low,
it seems like you are already exceeding that. So do you have any thoughts as to do ROEs, or do they maintain at this
level? Do you expect them to come down a bit? Maybe think about the next step of the ROE story?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We've got a few impacts that will impact the future outlook for ROE. As we said just on the
call, that we expect the operating EPS to be – operating earnings to be slightly lower than the first half of the year going
forward. We also have our convertible equity units coming in this fall that will add to the denominator and, of course,
we are building capital. We're not doing capital management actions, at this time, and that will build up.
So ROE will be pressured without other actions going forward slowly over time. Contrary to this, will be our ability to
grow revenues faster than our expenses, which the implementation of our strategy appears to be executing so far this
year.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Thanks, good morning. First question for Steve Kandarian. First of all, thanks for the
timeline on the whole regulatory outlook. It was helpful perspective. But if I take what you said and I think about the
precedent that you mentioned, I guess AIG and Pru sitting in Stage 3 for 7 months and then 30 days to 60 days of
incremental weight time, and I couple that with your comments around – in the past around perhaps not doing anything
more aggressive in terms of share repurchase until we actually know what the rules of the road are. So can I take from
that that as long as that timeframe is out there, seven months plus, we are probably not going to see anything in terms
of share repurchases?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hi, Suneet. What I've done in the past on this type of question is just simply say, as
of today this is where we are. Because things come down the pike over time that you learn more about the process of
where things are going so you could change your point of view based upon new information. So I don't want to put a
stake in the ground but as of now we don't think it's prudent to announce some large share buyback program in the face
of the regulatory uncertainty that we have.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Then a second question on Japan. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the accident
and health market there. Obviously Aflac has announced a pretty big partnership with the Japan Post and I'm
wondering if that will somehow impact your – I think your target market, which I think is a little bit more
direct-to-consumer marketing, which I would assume would be a little more in the rural areas. So I guess how are you
thinking about your growth potential in that market given that sizable transaction or sizable partnership that was
announced?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Yeah, it's Chris Townsend. Let me tell you first of all in terms of how our A&H
business grew in Japan for the second quarter. We grew it 10% year-on-year and that was growth across all four
channels so across the career agency, independent agency, DM and the bank channel. So we've said to you a number of
times before that the strength of our business in Japan emanates from the breadth of distribution we have and that's

being played out in the numbers you're seeing here. Interestingly enough the bank channel where we're challenged in
terms of some of the fixed annuity business, we grew 73% year-on-year in the A&H channel and we're selling A&H
business to about 30 different banking partners now. So we feel we've got a good reach across the country and a reach
across distribution, which will allow us to continue to earn very good money out of the A&H business.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Any comments on the Japan Post tie up?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: The Japan Post business is an extension of an existing contract which that company
has and it will I'm sure put them in good position for the cancer business. We and our A&H business is slightly
different to Aflac in their 80/20 cancer to medical where exactly vice versa in terms of 80% medical 20% cancer. I
would say that we actually launched today a new cancer product in Japan, which is fairly revolutionary in terms of
some of the types of covers that it offers and we're hoping for good things out of that product.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay, that is helpful. Maybe one last question for Steve Kandarian I guess. You have talked
to us about some of the initiatives that you have highlighted, the expense savings in the emerging markets. But the
other one that we haven't really heard a whole lot about is the global group benefits initiative. So just wondering if
there is any color that you can provide in terms of your progress there towards I think what are $250 million of earnings
by 2016.
<A - Maria R. Morris>: Hi, Suneet. It's Maria Morris. Thanks for the question. We're actually quite pleased with the
progress we've been making in the group area across the globe. As you know, we are actually working with our global
companies and we've seen sales increased year-over-year the triple digits which is phenomenal. We've seen our
multinational sales of triple digits in each of the three regions and our expatriate business continues to do well as well
where sales and expatriates will be up over 50% for the year.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Is it moving the needle yet in terms of earnings or is that still on to come?
<A - Maria R. Morris>: We've been making some investments as you're aware of. We talked to you about those in
Investor Day. So we're investing in the early years. We are seeing that we're above plan on earnings but our earnings
were more tempered in the early years as we invest for the future.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Good morning. First a question for John just in terms of your comments about second-half
earnings drivers. One of the things you mentioned Japan surrenders, you expect to fall off; is that what you have seen
thus far into 3Q? I know we are a little, what, one month into the quarter, but are you actually seeing that play out thus
far? And then the other question on third quarter earnings would be you also mentioned you are assuming lower
variable investment income. Because of the lag on private equity recording I assume you had pretty decent visibility on
that, so should we be expecting something below plan or maybe middle of the plan in terms of near term where that
trends? That is my first question and then I have one follow-up.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: You have two questions, but I'll give you that on one. The second half earnings drivers with
regard to Japan, yes we've already seen a decrease tapering down in that. So we do expect that to taper down for the
remainder of the year. With regard to VII, we have – some is – some of the funds are on a one-month lag, some is on a
one quarter. So we're seeing it slightly less, but who knows what the equity market's going to do in August and
September, and that's a key driver to these types of returns. So we're basically assuming on plan right now for – which
is the mid-point of the range that we've given.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Got it, okay. So mid-point. And then just a question on long-term care; you had mentioned
the weakness in results as one issue for the quarter. Can you frame that a little bit? And are you still actually making
money in long-term care even with the higher claims you are seeing? And is this an issue that we should be thinking

about in terms of the potential balance sheet impacts?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yeah. Hi, Tom. It's Bill Wheeler. We make good money in long-term care. The issue with
long-term care is we have to hold a lot of capital against it. So the ROEs are not terribly attractive. But even with these
incidence rates, long-term care is solidly profitable.
A little color on the incidence. What we're seeing is higher reported claims and the approval rate on those claims is
pretty high. We're sort of digging into the issue now to make sure. We recently moved some of the claims management
and reporting of claims operations. And whenever you do that in any – with the insurance business, you always can –
sometimes new wrinkles can cause some blips, in terms of how the claims management is done. So we're digging into
that and trying to understand it better. But in my mind, this is a – this did cause the non-health morbidity ratio to jump a
little bit, but it's not that significant.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: So Bill, still a lot of margin left?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: I'm sorry. What's that?
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: You still have a lot of margin left on the LT, say?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: In terms of balance, this isn't – wouldn't remotely size up to be a balance sheet issue.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. First question for Steve on capital deployment. You mentioned you had
– probably buybacks would be on hold until you get greater clarity on SIFI. Does that apply to dividends, as well?
Because you did raise your dividend despite uncertainty on SIFI, so. And then the other question's on just, if you could
give us a little bit more detail on the components of the derivative losses. How much of those related to interest rates,
foreign exchange or the nonperformance risk?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hey, Jimmy. I'll take the dividend question. As you know, we just increased our
dividend earlier this year by 49% from $0.74 a share to $1.10. And we announced the Provida acquisition for
approximately $2 billion using cash on our balance sheet. So we are deploying capital in a way we think is prudent in
light of the regulatory overhang. We don't think, at this point in time, engaging in share buybacks is the right thing to
do. So that is kind of where we stand right now on deployment of capital. I don't rule out what happens later in the year,
in terms of changes to our dividend. But as of now, we're comfortable with $1.10 per year.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: With regard to the net derivative loss, it was about 60% rates, 20% FX and 20% own credit.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay. And the dividend, I wasn't assuming that you would raise it right now, anyway. But I
think in a couple of quarters you're going to be at four quarters at a consistent rate, so. But you're implying that the
buyback comments won't necessarily apply to dividends though, right?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: That's correct.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay. And then just following up on long-term care, are you thinking about like raising
prices on the Inforce business? And if you are doing that, where you are in that process? And then finally, several of
your competitors have actually had success with variable annuity buyouts, and I'm wondering if you could just
comment on your thoughts on parts of your block that are perhaps a little more under water?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: So, Jimmy, this is Bill. The – with regard to long-term care price increases, we've been
raising prices on our long-term care Inforce for I think three years now, and we've sort of been going block by block in
terms of doing that, and we've had very good success. We announced another round of price increases or the new

initiative at the end of 2012 and we are going through the state approval processes now. In our latest round of price
increases, 25 states have had granted us approval.
Now before you get too excited, these tend to be smaller population states. And the big population states where most of
the block is are – haven't opined yet. So they're – so – but we think it's going well and, you know, we actually frankly
have a lot of experience in terms of getting these rate increases through the regulatory process and this one is going in a
very similar fashion to what's happened to us before.
So that's sort of this latest on long-term care prices. We are looking at what some of our peers have done with regard to
variable annuity buyouts. We're trying to analyze whether or not that makes sense for us. We haven't made a decision
yet whether it does. Obviously, the reality is if the stock market improves and interest rates move up, our Inforce
becomes less and less in the money and our net amount of risk is a relatively small number and our in the money-ness
is a relatively small portion of the Inforce block. So, we haven't ruled it out but we haven't made a decision yet.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Thanks very much. I just have one question for Steve Kandarian. Steve, I was intrigued by your
comments that you are focusing intensely on improving the customer service experience. That would seem to be a
logical and normal thing for any business to do. It's just that in the life insurance business, I tend to think of it as having
far fewer customer interactions than say the P&C business. In the car insurance business, for example, people's cars get
in accidents, their homes are hurt by damage and they're looking for claims paying ability. But in the life insurance
business, I tend to think of it as a business in which people sign up and sort of may occasionally make changes to
addresses and what have you, but don't have as many interactions as in the property casualty business.
So why are you focusing on the, in what you call the customer experience as much as you do? And how will you know
whether the expenditures are paying off? And I'm going to put myself on mute to block background noise. That's my
one question. Thank you.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hi, Eric. We've looked at a lot of studies around the issue of companies being
customer centric and yes, P&C has more interactions than life, but we still have a fair number of interactions with our
customers, even simple things like change of address or calling about some information on their product and their
balances and so on and savings products. And if we don't provide a good customer experience in those interactions,
people are not going to recommend us to family, friends, others who say, you know, I'm thinking about buying this
product or that product that falls in the life insurance category. Who did you buy from? Did you have a good
experience?
So the data is pretty clear that if you do a good job giving service to your customer, your top line improves because
referrals, second sales and the third sales to existing customers, as well as if you design the process right in terms of
interactions and how the products themselves are sold and how the information that goes to customers is articulated,
you'll get your costs down because all of those customer complaints and second, third phone calls and trying to move
people around the system to figure out an answer to their question, becomes expensive.
So again, the studies in this are pretty clear that your top line and bottom line can improve over time. It's not something
that happens in the first six months or 12 months. It is a process and will take a number of years.
Well, we will track this. We will have data over time, but I don't have data for you right now. The cost that we're
talking about here is not enormous amounts of money for some of the fixes that we're talking about. And simple fixes
to websites to make them clearer, make the process much easier for the customer to interact with us, are not big ticket
items but it takes time and attention and it takes a lot of people to focus on it. And I used to hear when I was at
MetLife, when I first got here a mantra about customer service, that's good enough. I don't think that customer service

that is good enough is good enough.
I think you have to have good customer service if you expect your existing customers to recommend you to others, if
you expect that your ability to deliver customer service over time will be at a reasonable cost. So that's why we're
engaged in this effort and it's something that we're all focused on. Including all of us here at the executive group level,
who make phone calls to customers who have had problems with their interactions with us where we can, on a firsthand
basis, learn about those experiences and help us become more sensitized to what our customers face every day as they
interact with us.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning. I wanted to go to the, I guess the derivative losses in the quarter. And I
guess the question I want to ask is this, is obviously rates going higher is a positive thing. But it does have that effect on
earnings, both statutory and GAAP. And I guess what I'm thinking about is, if you just take the assumption that rates
will continue to migrate higher perhaps follow the forward curve, if you will. Who knows where they go. But how
should we think about that in kind of future statutory dividends? And like does it – because I mean I'm really thinking
about the nonparallel accounting treatment. Should – like is this meaningful?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Well as we think, our projections as we thought out to 2016 assume rates will be
increasing. Our plan this year was the 10-year treasury to go to 2.38%. We're in excess of that now, but then to slowly
be increasing. And we factor all this in when we think about our cash and capital projections, when we give you the
ratios that we spoke about on Investor Day. So I mean, we do take this into account.
You have to remember that there's – we generally have longer data derivatives. So it's more tied to the longer end of the
curve. Today, we still have very short-term rates – very low short-term rates, and I think as people think forward over
the next few years that's where some of the more interesting pressure might come, is the curve flattening some more.
So there's really two dimensions to the whole rising interest rate.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. And then, I guess, I think you, you pointed out some key enterprise initiatives in
the back half of the year, as a driver of higher expenses. I know there's been a lot going on with the company, but you
highlighted this specifically in the back half of the year. Is there anything specific that we should be thinking about, that
you can talk about?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We have some of the – as we spoke about at our – at the Investor Day, in terms of the cost
saves we also have some strategic expenses coming through. They've been fairly light so far, but they will be building
throughout the remainder of the year. And that's one of the aspects of the large investments in technology much related
around to improving customer service that Steve mentioned.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. And then just finally, just thinking about variable annuity, or I should say
annuity earnings. I know you had very wide fixed annuity spreads, but you had a substantial gapping up of the kind of
the ROAs on the block. And I'm just thinking, I mean are we at a new basing level if you just kind of back off some
spread on fixed annuities? But just thinking about the level of annuity earnings, I mean are we at a new basing level
that we should be trending going forward off of?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Well I wouldn't trend it off as high as what we have done this quarter because due to
the factors that I mentioned, we are reinvesting as those annuities mature and the cash flows turnover in that business.
We're investing at a lower rate than what we have historically. The derivative income has held up very well. The
investment teams have been able to keep those – that derivative income up and that's been one of the big out performs
versus our expectations in the core spread.

We also have good VII that's allocated to that line of business. So you have to put that piece down. You also have
remember, we've had very favorable equity markets in general in the annuity business and that drives with larger assets
from that. So we get more fee income from that business line flowing through. So the higher asset base and dependent
upon your views of equity market performance that will rebase higher, obviously. But this is pressure of the
reinvestment narrowing down.
