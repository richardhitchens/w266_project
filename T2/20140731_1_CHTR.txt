MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Charter Communications Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Stefan Anninger. Sir, you may begin.
Stefan Anninger
Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2014 second quarter earnings call. This morning
we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results. The press release, trending
schedules, and presentation for this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com.
As a reminder, there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings,
including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects, constitute forward-looking

We will present today certain information regarding the Comcast Charter transactions. That information may be subject
to various assumptions and uncertainties described in the presentation materials including slide 30. We will also be
referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP
measures as defined by Charter may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies.
On July 1, 2013, Charter completed its acquisition of Bresnan Broadband Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. Unless
otherwise specified, all customer and financial data referred to on this call are pro forma for the Bresnan transaction as
if it had occurred on January 1, 2012.
Finally, all growth rates noted on this call, and in the presentation, are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless
otherwise specified.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. And with that, I'll turn
the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Stefan. Charter continues to perform well against its key objectives. We're driving deeper penetration of
our services into the home, earning more revenue per household by selling more product at the point-of-sale and
increasing ARPU over time. We are investing in quality service to reduce transaction costs per customer and extending
customer lifetimes through better service delivery. As a result we're growing market share, increasing cash flow for
Home Pass and improving our return on investment.
We added 27,000 new residential customer relationships versus 2,000 last year. We're selling more than last year with
simple, high-value offers that resonate with consumers. We're also selling more services at the time of sale, with PSUs
per connect growing year over year, and Triple Play sell-in to new video customers reaching 58% this quarter. Roughly
a third of our customer base now subscribes to our Triple Play service, and we have a large number of unserved
opportunity passings, offering potential customer relationships and Triple Play growth, and we have a clear path to
upselling Single Play customers to video and voice.
Customer retention has also improved as a result of our more competitive product and service delivery. The key driver
of our improving service reputation is the use of Charter-trained and paid employees to create quality service
transactions. Over the last year we've grown our residential customer base by 4.5%, and including commercial, Charter
now serves over 6 million customers. In the second quarter we added 55,000 residential PSUs, double the number we
added during the same period last year.
Both our residential video and broadband net additions improved year-over-year. Total video net additions improved by
26,000 year-over-year, and over the last 12 months we've grown our expanded basic video base by 51,000. We're
growing our video market share versus the competition. Our improving video and Internet customer results are being
driven by the value that consumers increasingly see in a fully digital HD two-way video product and our superior
broadband product as we continue to widen the speed gap versus our competitors.
Total second quarter revenue grew by 7.3% versus 4.6% for the same period last year, with the residential revenue
growing by 6.4% versus 4.3% last year, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.9% given the accelerating revenue.
Our single largest operational initiative this year is our all-digital transition. At the end of the second quarter, 60% of
our plan was all-digital. Over 96% of our customers now have at least one two-way digital box in their homes,
providing digital pictures, an interactive programming guide, and full Video on Demand capability. We now have
approximately 9 million boxes deployed across our footprint and expect to have over 10 million deployed by the end of
this year. And while going all-digital can be a disruptive process, it's going very well and we're on schedule.
We're also introducing our new product suite under the Charter Spectrum brand across those portions of our footprint
that have gone all-digital. Customers in those areas now have access to the Spectrum product, including over 200
channels of HD, minimum Internet speeds of 60 megabits, and in Saint Louis, a minimum Internet speed of 100

megabits. Charter Spectrum is not just for new customers. Those customers that subscribe to the pricing and patching
structure we introduced in 2012 receive our Spectrum product suite once a market is transitioned to all-digital. By
year-end we expect to be fully digital and all customers to have access to Charter Spectrum.
Our Charter Spectrum product will continue to improve. Earlier this month, we launched our new cloud-based guide,
called Spectrum Guide, to a subset of our Fort Worth, Texas customer base. Over the coming months, we'll test the
Guide in front of a growing number of customers in several markets to gauge the Guide's performance at scale. That
Guide works on existing and new boxes, avoiding the customer disruption and capital to achieve a modern two-way
interface across the full video customer base. So far the results have been promising.
We also continue to enhance the value of Charter TV tablet and mobile applications. We are adding more national
cable networks and local broadcast stations to the app, and will continue to bring live channel counts available on the
app up to 170 in most markets. We also plan to add Video on Demand content and other new features in the coming
months.
In late April we announced a multi-part transaction with Comcast. Since then we've been working with all parties on
developing integration, transition and service plans for the Time Warner Cable and SpinCo assets involved in the asset
sale and swap. So we're making progress and we're just as pleased with this set of transactions as we were when we
announced them. As a brief reminder, we have entered into three transactions, all to occur simultaneously and shortly
after the Comcast/Time Warner Cable transaction closes.
First, we'll execute a tax efficient exchange of assets whereby Charter and Comcast will exchange cable systems
serving approximately 1.5 million Time Warner video customers, but 1.6 million Charter video customers. Second,
Charter will purchase Time Warner Cable systems serving approximately 1.5 million video customers. Lastly, Charter
will purchase a 33% stake in a new publicly traded cable company consisting of the former Comcast systems serving
approximately 2.5 million video customers.
As slide 7 shows, these transactions will create a highly efficient footprint for Charter in the Midwest and Southeastern
United States, much of which will be contiguous with or adjacent to SpinCo's footprint. Charter will divest systems in
California, New England, Northern Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Virginia, and parts of
Tennessee. These are regions where we have good and growing systems, but where we have only partial DMA
coverage, which limits our ability to fully market our services efficiently. And we'll acquire Time Warner Cable
systems in Ohio, Wisconsin, Kentucky, and some smaller pieces of Indiana and Alabama.
Additionally, SpinCo's footprint, primarily located in Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana, and Alabama will be adjacent or
contiguous with much of Charter's wholly-owned footprint, enabling Charter and SpinCo to provide key services to one
another by a two-way services agreement.
At close, Charter will own or service over 8 million video customers, providing scale and operating efficiencies for
both Charter and SpinCo. Between Charter and our equity ownership in SpinCo, we'll be operating a highly efficient
footprint in communities that we find attractive and where we know we can compete well by delivering a highly
valuable product set to customers, providing more effective local service and have a larger, more efficient capability in
the local advertising market. We're also confident that from a regulatory perspective these transactions will support the
successful close of the Comcast/Time Warner Cable transaction.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. Let me start by briefly reviewing the quarter and then add some additional color on the transactions, as
well as how to think about the economics of the new Charter. As a reminder, unless otherwise stated, the results we're
discussing and shown in today's slides are presented on a pro forma basis, as if we had acquired Bresnan on January 1,
2012.

Turning to slide 9 of today's presentation, as Tom mentioned, residential PSU growth during the second quarter
essentially doubled compared to the same period last year. We lost 29,000 residential video customers during the
seasonally weak second quarter versus a loss of 55,000 last year, a 26,000 improvement. Note that our second quarter
residential video customer net adds include approximately 15,000 digital and bulk digital upgrades versus 6,000 a year
ago.
In residential Internet, we added 49,000 customers, up from 38,000 last year, and we added 35,000 residential voice
customers versus 45,000 last year. Over the last 12 months, our residential customer base has grown by 4.5%, and
second quarter revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.9% year-over-year, driven by higher product selling, first
quarter rate adjustments and higher average dollar step-ups at promotional rolloff.
As slide 11 shows, our accelerating customer growth, combined with our ARPU growth, resulted in residential revenue
growth of 6.4% year-over-year, and just below the first quarter residential revenue growth of 6.5% in the first quarter,
benefiting modestly from the earlier rate adjustments as compared to 2013.
Looking at Commercial, we added 19,000 PSUs versus 18,000 last year. Commercial revenue grew by 19%, driven
primarily by small and medium businesses. Excluding the lower growth hospitality video base, commercial telecom
revenue grew by 22%.
Now turning to expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 12, programming expense grew by $54 million, accounting for
about 55% of the increase in total operating expense versus the prior year quarter. Programming costs grew by 9.8% on
an absolute basis, driven by contractual rate increases and 1.3% growth in our expanded video customer base over the
last 12 months.
Cost to serve customers, which includes field operations, network operations and customer care costs, grew by 4%
year-over-year, compared to 7% revenue growth. And marketing spend increased by $8 million, up 6% year-over-year
on higher sales. Other costs grew by $17 million or 9.6% year-over-year, driven by higher labor costs to support
commercial revenue, as well as some additional corporate expense.
In total, adjusted EBITDA grew by $58 million or 7.9% year-over-year. Note that our second quarter adjusted EBITDA
did benefit from non-recurring items in the second quarter, some of which came inside of our programming expense.
Excluding these items, our second quarter adjusted EBITDA growth would have been just shy of 6%.
Turning to slide 13, second quarter capital expenditures totaled $570 million. Just over 50% of that spend was driven
by CPE to support our all-digital initiative and new customer acquisition. $134 million of our total CapEx was
dedicated to our all-digital initiative, with most of that spend inside CPE. For the full year 2014 we continue to expect
approximately $2.2 billion in capital expenditures for the plan we've laid out, with $500 million of that spend to be
one-time in nature for all-digital and our insourcing initiatives.
The one caveat here is that as we put together integration plans we will incur some incremental costs in both CapEx
and OpEx to position the company to serve roughly twice as many customers. That hasn't occurred in any material way
today, but to the extent it does we'll certainly reference it on these calls.
We ended the quarter with $14.1 billion in net debt, with a weighted average borrowing cost of 5.6% today, and our
leverage ratio fell to 4.6 times on an LTM basis, just above our target leverage ratio of 4 to 4.5 times.
So that covers our second quarter operating and financial performance, but as Tom mentioned, we're planning the
closing and integration activities for the announced transactions both with Comcast and Time Warner Cable. That
process is going well. Part of that process is for each company to prepare carve-out audited financial statements for the
1.6 million residential and commercial video customers we will swap to Comcast, the 3 million TWC video customers
we receive in the swap and acquisition, and the 2.5 million Comcast video customers which go to SpinCo. Those
carved out financial statements will be used for two purposes. One, to provide a better estimate of the purchase price
based on the 7.125 times full-year 2014 carve-out EBITDA multiple and secondly for Charter's S4 proxy statement.
Those carve-out financial statements and accounting pro formas will be prepared based on current ownership and
operations and will not include synergies or dissynergies. For purposes of starting EBITDA of the TWC systems to be

acquired, we expect EBITDA to be slightly higher than the carve-out EBITDA's programming dissynergies will be
offset by fully loaded overhead allocations in the carve-outs. Much of that allocated overhead cost does not transfer
with any of the systems. Net-net, even after we add some additional overhead at Charter to support a larger footprint,
we expect the effect of multiple paid for the net acquired EBITDA of TWC systems to be at or slightly below the
headline multiple of 7.125 times.
At SpinCo, we anticipate the differential between carve-out and starting EBITDA, excluding the impact of the
management fee paid to Charter, to drive a small dissynergy to the headline SpinCo purchase multiple of 7.125 times.
How new Charter and SpinCo can develop over time is perhaps the more material point, and the right way to think
about Charter is to first take the 4.3 million residential and commercial video customers we have today and deduct 1.6
million video customers which will go to Comcast in the swap. The swap systems going to Comcast from partially
owned DMAs are from partially owned DMAs and on average have lower video penetration rates due to less efficient
marketing capabilities. But we've made these systems far more competitive in the past two years and as a result they've
been growing at least as quickly as Charter overall. So excluding these systems, Charter is left with 2.8 million video
customers with slightly higher product penetrations and similar growth potential relative to Charter today, and
significantly lower capital intensity to getting in 2015 after all-digital completion this year.
Netting to that 2.8 million base of remaining Charter video customers, we will add approximately 3 million TWC video
customers in markets which have slightly higher video penetration than Charter today, and over the long term should
operate at margins consistent with the same potential that exists for Charter. In the near term, we intend to take these
systems all-digital and implement our pricing and packaging strategy. So the growth trajectory of these new systems
becoming just over 50% of new Charter, should look similar to Charter during the 2012 through 2014 timeframe.
We'll make the all-digital investment in these new systems, but we expect lower overall capital as a percentage of
revenue relative to the same investment period at Charter, as we don't expect the acquired systems to require the same
level of insourcing needs, which is spending on trucks, tools, test equipment, and facilities, and we'll be purchasing our
CPE at a significantly lower price than when we started digitization at Charter. So we believe those systems, which
represent 50% of the new Charter, can develop and grow on a similar trajectory to Charter over the past two years with
less capital intensity.
And of course in addition to these starting EBITDA comments and the potential growth trajectory I mentioned, we will
have the management services fee of 4.25% stake of revenue, or roughly $200 million per year, included within
Charter's results.
We do not currently expect to consolidate SpinCo results, so SpinCo will be an independent and separately traded
public company with its own executive team and separate board. Charter will have an operating service agreement with
SpinCo, providing services to SpinCo at cost so that it can benefit from Charter's infrastructure, scale and operating
strategy.
I think these comments provide a better framework for people to think about new Charter over time. Obviously there
will be some one-time integration costs and transition service payments to Comcast while we scale certain areas to
migrate, and we'll highlight those along the way, same as I mentioned with respect to pre-closing expenses.
On a somewhat related topic, a brief update on our tax assets and the anticipated effects of the M&A transactions. After
the 2013 internal tax reorganization, we really didn't see ourselves becoming a material cash income taxpayer until
after 2019. In value, both our NOL and excess tax basis when compared to others, we believe the NPV of those
combined tax assets, noted on slide 16, is in the $3 billion range today, of course subject to business plan and discount
assumptions. We think the transactions with Comcast will drive faster use of those tax assets with higher income,
which will increase the value of our tax asset slightly, and we expect some section of so-called section 1031 gain on the
asset swap, which will utilize some of our NOLs and create corresponding increasing basis.
On a pro forma basis, we still don't expect to make material cash income tax payments until after 2019, and we'd expect
to begin making material payments to Comcast in 2020 for the tax benefit we realize in the step-up value in the TWC
assets. The total gross payments to Comcast could be in the $2 billion range on an undiscounted basis and will be

booked on our balance sheet as a long-term liability on a net present value basis, which we estimate to be about $1
billion.
As a reminder, Comcast will pay the upfront tax in selling us TWC assets, and we get a tax asset with the associated
basis step-up. We'll pay Comcast that step-up benefit over time as it's used by Charter, with a discounted bullet
payment after eight years for any remaining step-up benefits not utilized over the eight-year period.
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks for all the color on the transaction. I just had one question, more mundane
perhaps. On your Triple Play penetration, at least in my model I've – continuing to rise, but I was just looking at the
recent trends, it seems like it's moderated. Do you expect that to reaccelerate based on all your initiatives? Or do you
think we're sort of asymptoting towards the steady state? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Jason, this is Tom. I think that our Triple Play penetration to video continues to increase,
and it won't increase at the rate it has over the last two years, but I think it'll continue to increase on sell-in for two
reasons. One that I think our product is more compelling, and two, as your base of subscribers subscribing to Triple
Play gets higher, then you for of move transferred transactions and all of those kind of transactions, selling at higher
Triple Play rates over time. So I expect Triple Play growth to continue against video and continue to increase, but not
as rapidly as it has. But that's also – when you look at it from a modeling point of view against the whole subscriber
base, the question of the mix of video and data also comes into play. And we've continued to have strong data-only
sales.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions. Chris, on the new Charter details,
and thanks for all that in your prepared remarks, I just wanted to make sure I understood how you think we should be
thinking about the acquired assets. You talked about the growth looking like kind of 2012 to 2014 for Charter, which I
think you based on an EBITDA/CAGR basis as sort of looks like about 6% to 7%. It obviously was quite low in 2012
and has ramped quite nicely. I just wanted to see if I was thinking about that the right way.
And then on the CapEx front, any advice on how we should think about the all-digital costs or the capital intensity of
those acquired systems relative to what we saw for you in 2012 to 2014? It sounds like it will be lower because you're
buying the boxes cheaper and the systems are maybe further along than they were in 2012, but any help there would be
great.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. From 2012 to 2014 really we implemented the changes at the beginning of Q3
2012, and we are where we are today. I don't have the exact CAGR in front of me. That would seem to be a little bit
high, which you mentioned, relative to what I recall from an EBITDA standpoint. I think the more important thing
when I gave that outlook is – think about the way that, when Charter made its transition, that it impacted the amount of
Triple Play sell-in. The things that we made were positive and negative short-term impacts to selling channels, go to
market, what that did to ARPU, and what you saw through the Charter model come through over time. First and
foremost you saw the PSU growth related to Triple Play tick up. Subsequently, you saw ARPU growth and you saw

combined revenue growth and eventually, as we started to migrate more of the base, eventually you saw EBITDA
growth. That's really the general point I was trying to make as opposed to quarter-by-quarter example guidance. And
the model will be applied in a pretty similar fashion as to how we go to market. You'll have re-pricing taking place.
You'll have a change in sales channels. You'll have a general disruption from M&A generally.
But all just to give a little bit of indication that it's – we're going to do the same things that we did at Charter. And it's
going to be – I think what most people haven't understood, it's going to be over 50% of Charter's customer base that it's
applied to in the new Charter. So we're not just adding a net 1.4 million customers. The key point I was making is that
we're deducting 1.6 million of already fast-growing assets and routing 3 million of more moderate-growth assets today
that we're going to apply our operating strategy to. So there's going to be a transition in the consolidated results as a
result of that, but there's a proven track record which you can apply.
As it relates to capital expenditure, in the prepared remarks – the operating model is designed to grow. We're going to
implement the Triple Play operating strategy, and we'll take systems all-digital, and that will drive CapEx, but I don't
think that some of the support line and maybe some of the scalable infrastructure line spend that you've seen at Charter
will necessarily need to be spent on the 3 million assets that we acquire in the same way.
But we will be spending on CPE and the volume will be significant of boxes that we buy, but we expect to be buying
them at a cheaper rate than when we started digitization efforts at Charter. And in fact today at Charter we're buying
boxes at a dramatically lower cost than when we started at Charter, and we'd expect that to apply or even improve as
we incorporate the digitization of the 3 million systems.
So I think the capital intensity on that vintage of growth, if you will, can be lower as a percentage of revenue relative to
what it was at Charter.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Got it. And I apologize. I hadn't adjusted for Bresnan. I took the 4.5% on our
numbers. Thank you for the comments.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess, Chris, back to slide 15. I guess the implied
growth in 2014 for the pro forma Charter, as you guys laid out, is about 6% and obviously there's a lot of moving parts
in all the investment that you just talked about. So I mean, I guess obviously you don't want to look too far out, but I
mean as we think of the playbook you guys apply to these assets, should that accelerate or decelerate through this
investment period as you guys get these boxes out there and upgrade these networks?
And then secondly, maybe for Tom, you talked about the tests you guys are doing with the cloud-based guide. I mean if
things proceed as expected and you have successful tests, when do you think we could look towards a commercial
rollout of the new guide? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So on the first question, and these are not our guidance and what we've done, these
are actually your numbers. And that's what we've done is we've taken consensus, similar to what Comcast and TWC
did in their joint S4. We're all having to get to what could be purchase price on the relevant assets, so we've applied
Wall Street consensus to the relevant piece parts, and it's as good as anything at this stage. So that's all that – all those
numbers represent on page 15. Obviously, if we thought it was entirely misrepresentative, we wouldn't put it there, but
it's really just a Wall Street consensus applied.
I think when you think about the forward growth curve, are we done at Charter as it relates to growth on the existing
assets that we have today? And the answer is no. We think we're continuing to improve on operating execution and
usually financials flow when operations do well.

As it relates to the new assets that are being acquired, as I mentioned to Ben, they're going to go through a process
similar to what we've done at Charter. I think people tend to typically overestimate how quickly financials turn based
on implementation of operating strategies. It takes a while to get momentum going, and they tend to underestimate how
long that momentum will go and the amount of growth that can be driven once you have momentum in the
marketplace. That's just our general view.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So with regard to the user interface, we have been testing it in Fort Worth. We're going
to test it in other markets this year. We're pleased with what we're seeing. The attractiveness of the UI is that it's a
state-of-the-art user interface, cloud-based, and it works both on new boxes and legacy boxes, and it works on whether
or not the box has a DOCSIS modem in it or whether it's pre-modem generation CPE. And we think that it's going to be
commercially launched everywhere we operate in 2015, and unless we find something in the testing that throws us off
of that track, that's our intention. And we think that we'll be able to launch that same user interface across all of the
assets that we're acquiring and servicing as part of this transaction. So it has a dramatic possibility in terms of
completely changing the look and feel in upgrading the state-of-the-art user interface functionality across not only old
Charter but new Charter as well.

Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. Question for Tom and Chris, just drilling down on ARPU a little bit. So this is now I
guess a full year since you have now had some – or two years, I mean, since you've had significant numbers of
customers that were going into the new pricing plan. What are you seeing when they hit their step-ups? Have you
learned anything new about retention rates and customer behavior as those customers get their price increases?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I wouldn't say we've learned anything new. We are getting the kind of retention that
we expected. And the pricing is working. We still have – we're about 75%, including Bresnan, 80% without Bresnan,
new price and packaging. So we're getting less and less of a base remainder going from legacy to new pricing and
packaging, which will have an impact in a favorable way toward growth of ARPU going forward because the mix of
[ph] side grid (32:25), so to speak, from legacy to new will go down. But in terms of the core strategy, which is to put a
better product in front of a customer at a promotional offer and have the ability to step that pricing up through time
because the product is good and it stands competitively in the marketplace, even at the higher pricing, that is working.
And it's working well, and it's working the way we planned it, and the retention rates are what we expected.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: And if I could just follow up, Chris, to put a finer point on the TWC systems conversation
that you gave us. Are we right in assuming that when you feel like the product is there that you'll do the same thing in
those systems and move those customers onto promotional prices and then step them up at years one, two, three?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yes. I mean, obviously we'll go look at all the pricing and packaging variations that
exist inside those assets, and we may not do it exactly the same, but the general notion of using the network in its
fullest capacity in an all-digital way with better video than satellite can provide, better video than our phone
competitors provide, higher data speeds and a low cost, fully-functioned, fully-featured voice product all put together in
a package that saves consumers real dollars in a competitive sense and gives them the superior product, that's our
strategy. And we think if we do that and use the network effectively, that we can – we need promotional pricing to
break the inertia of the marketplace, but once we do that we think we do have pricing power within the product mix.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning. For Chris, your cost to service customers in marketing were higher than I
forecast. How much of that was one-off expense related to the move to all-digital and I guess the Spectrum rebrand?
And then how much disruption do you temporarily see to your video base when you move a market to all-digital?
Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. Well, let's take those apart. One, I don't know your model, but marketing was
up, in my recollection, around 6%. We're selling more. So we think that's good. And we're selling more and we're
spending more to go get it, and that's positive ROI. From a customer operations or cost to serve perspective, we have
grown our customer relationships year-over-year by 4.5%, and our cost to serve is up by 4%. We're selling more with
more early tenure customers who tend to have a higher operating cost in the first year of operation, so I think we're still
seeing margin enhancement as it relates to the cost to serve line.
You introduced a very good point, which is in spite of the significant activity of all-digital, so I think the operating
team's done a really fantastic job, despite all the disruption at providing better service and then all the transition that
was already taking place in the business plus all-digital. And to have cost to serve only up by 4% when you have 4.5%
customer growth really is a pretty big accomplishment in my mind.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And just to put a little color on that, many weeks we do 100,000 homes where we change
out a digital box or add a digital box. Logistically it's quite complex, and it does cost money, and it does cause friction.
I mean we have to make appointments with people. We have to create service calls. We have customer education issues
that go with this transition. And we're handling all of that, growing our business, and growing our EBITDA at the same
time. But once the digital transition is complete, we think that some of those operating costs come out as well as capital
costs.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Thanks, Jeff.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Thank you. It's David Joyce here. I was just wondering if you could provide some other color
commentary on the response that you've seen on your subscriber base when you've been going all-digital. Are you
seeing a lift in the subscribers yet? Also with the momentum that you're seeing with the pricing and packaging, are you
seeing any sort of incremental response from the competitors? Has that been changing to any degree yet? Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well I'll answer the last part of your question first. The competitor environment hasn't
materially changed, and we continue to see better performance where we've gone all-digital than where we haven't.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think that answered both the questions, so take the next one.

Your next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Can you talk about the business ETF program that was launched a couple
of weeks ago? Has that been a real barrier to entry? And then second, as you think about the acquired markets, are there
capabilities coming there that will help accelerate the overall business mix, or what needs to be done in those markets?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Right. Well, with regard to the early termination fee or buyout of contract offer that's
going on in commercial, it's already a very rapidly growing area for us, small business on the coaxial plan, and our

objective is to go faster. And we think that our marketing strategy, along with some product simplification strategies
that we have for commercial, will improve our ability to execute our marketing strategy and to reduce our operating
costs and make our service better by having a faster-growing, more uniform kind of product for the small business
universe.
With regard to the transaction, we're going to have a much better regional footprint, and the DMAs that we cover will
be extremely efficient from a marketing perspective. We're going from an environment now where we can only mass
market to 48% of our marketplace through television, radio and newspaper. And the reason that's so is because we are
positioning the DMAs we operate in is, as a percentage of the DMA, relatively small. After this trade and swap and
acquisition, over 95% – actually very high 90% of our marketplace we'll be able to use mass media. What that means is
we have a denser, fuller marketplace in which to operate. And from a commercial perspective we'll be able to cover the
entire area and region.
So we think that some of the customers that currently have multi-site locations in the mid-size part of the commercial
marketplace are underserved by us, and in this new operating environment we think that we'll have an opportunity to
put products together that will make our service penetrate against that middle market for business.
In addition, by having better brand strategy across multiple DMAs, the whole commercial space ought to accelerate, in
my view.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Scott Goldman>: Hey, guys. It's Scott Goldman on for Mike. I just had one quick housekeeping question,
and that is on the $14 million expense benefit, wondering, Chris, if maybe you can give us a little bit more detail about
what's behind that and which line items it's hit? And I think you said part of it was a benefit on the programming cost
side, and it looks like programming costs are trending up sort of low double digits for the first half of the year, and I
think you guide is sort of – can be commensurate with where some of the others in the industry are, which is probably
more high singles, so just wondering what the outlook is for the back half?
And then if I could just squeeze one more quick one in, just wondering, as sort of Bring Your Own Devices starts to
permeate a bit more, still probably in its infancy, but wondering if you're seeing anything from the BYOD community
and the reaction from subscribers as you start to deploy more and more set-top boxes into the home?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So, Scott, we did have some one-time benefits inside of the quarter. We didn't provide
a breakout. Some of that was programming, but certainly not all of it, and we're not going to do a line-by-line
[indiscernible] (42:06) analysis each quarter. But we think it was important to provide that disclosure in Q1. We also
had the acceleration of the rate increase over year-over-year, so we provided that as well. Net-net, we think that
EBITDA growth, net of the one-time and rated related items is increasing from Q1 to Q2 and has been for many
quarters. And I think that's the most relevant point.
From a long-term programming outlook, I don't think our views have changed. From a short-term programming
outlook, we've consistently said that we expected our programming costs to be consistent or similar to other operators
in the space. I don't know that I've heard too many people talking about the mid to high single digits, but we'd expect
ours to be consistent with others as adjusted for expanded basic video growth. So unlike many, we're growing video
market share, so not only do we have rate pressure like everybody else, but we have very positive volume pressure as a
result of growing video market share. That's the kind of programming expense you actually want to see. Third one was
the Bring Your Own Device, maybe, Tom?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: That's for Tom.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I mean I do think that the Bring Your Own Device potentially has a possibility to reduce
CPE through time for us, but we've been working on increasing the capability of our app, which works on Bring Your
Own Devices, tablets and mobile phones, and we're getting significant uptick in use of that device. So we think that we
continue to need to put CPE out because people need CPE from us in order to make their televisions operate with the
fullness of our product in a two-way interactive service function, and a lot of the Bring Your Own Devices don't
necessarily comport with our entire product. But that said, I see a world in which that's possible, and so it may be that
over the next few years that our CPE costs, which are going down because of investments we've made, could even be
less if there's a bigger proliferation of fully functional Bring Your Own Device kind of assets out there.
<Q - David Scott Goldman>: Okay. Great. Thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Good morning. I'm wondering if you could comment on the programming cost differential per
subscriber in the systems coming into Charter versus those going out? And the transactions, are they any different? And
then also, as you're engaging with programmers now on new renewals, are you finding you're gaining any leverage at
all in the negotiations because of the increased scale? And how are the programmers approaching SpinCo? Can we be
assured that SpinCo can use Charter's programming contracts, or are you seeing any pushback on this? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. I don't really want to respond to any of that. Bryan, there's huge sensitivity
around everything that you just asked, and I think what we've said today and provided in the slides is about as far as
we're prepared to go and for obvious reasons. When you've asked those questions, we're going to hold our cards close
to our chest.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: What about just on the first part, on the programming cost differential and at your rate card,
and what's coming in versus going out, I'm just curious is there anything structurally that gives you a lower cost, maybe
in some of those mid markets based on the retrans footprint or the RSN footprint? Or when you look at the numbers
does it end up coming out about the same?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. I don't think that we're going to get into that here. I don't think it behooves us,
and it's not in the interest of our shareholders to do so.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas William Eagan>: Super. Thank you. I have a question on the FCC. The calendar has gotten a lot more
crowded over the past couple months and will probably get even more crowded if other potential deals are announced.
So I guess for Tom, is there any risk that the FCC has to stop the 180-day clock in an effort to better assess the
changing landscape? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, it's always a possibility, and it's been done in the past, but the FCC has actually
said that they wanted to ask for lots of information up front, which they did, and that they were going to try to go
through the process within the normal timeframe. So that normal timeframe clock of six months is ticking, and if they
stay true to their objectives, the deal will close by the end of the year, at least for Comcast and Time Warner Cable, and
our deal will close 30 to 45 days after that. But it's been stopped in the past.

Your next question will come from the line of Will Milner with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Will N. Milner>: Thanks very much. I just want to focus again on slide 15. Lots of helpful information, but really
on the top line growth of the 3 million TWC assets that will, as you say, be over 50% of the enlarged Charter coming
in. I mean TWC today posted residential revenue growth of less than 1%. I mean, is there any reason to suspect the
revenue growth of the 3 million subs that are coming in will be materially different from that number? And I have one
follow-up.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. No. Look, unfortunately, I don't think it's appropriate for us really to talk about
assets that are not ours as of yet. The methodology that we've used is really for illustrative purposes in terms of
determining the purchase price and what the starting EBITDA could be on a consolidated pro forma when you add in
all these different pieces, assuming that the consensus estimates was correct. That's really all it's intended to do, so I
don't want to stretch it into more than it is, or get into the mode of really commenting on somebody else's assets for the
time being and how they might perform. The reality is we'll know when we close. I'm sorry. The other question you
had was?
<Q - Will N. Milner>: Yeah. Now that's switching back to your business, I guess. Just on the CapEx profile going
forward, I mean the guidance obviously this year is absolutely clear, $2.2 billion of which $500 million is one-off, but
at the same time I'm just thinking about the potential on the Fort Worth trial and the cloud-based EPG. I mean as you
look into 2015, if that trial is successful and you have a full commercial deployment, is there potential to sort of
materially change the number of boxes you're going to upgrade in 2015 as a result of that trial? How should we think
about that?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I don't think the trial of the user interface is directly related to our box strategy. Now, by
the end of – what I mean is, it's – by the end of this year, at historic Charter, we will be all-digital, and we'll be buying a
relatively small number of boxes without this transaction. So as we go into 2015, we would want to put the new user
interface out in historic Charter on all the boxes that we've already bought, and it would have no impact on future box
prices.
In the acquired systems, how soon we can get going with an all-digital strategy in 2015 after a transition services
agreement is put in place, and how that would roll out in 2015 I don't really know. But it wouldn't happen the day you
close that you'd suddenly move to a much faster capital spend. You'd have to do some planning and packaging and
pricing and branding and prepare the system operationally for the new sets of hardware, which takes time. But the user
interface, if it is working the way we hope, it might be able to be deployed even before you go all-digital. And it's a
relatively minor capital expenditure compared to a box rollout.
<Q - Will N. Milner>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Our final question will come from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James M. Ratcliffe>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just wondering if you have any
thoughts on the Windstream transaction announced earlier this week, and about whether our REIT architecture could
make sense for an MSO in general, and in particular, what the puts and takes would be for a growth and
accretion-oriented MSO like Charter in particular? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So James, it's not the first time this idea's been shopped around, but we tend to believe
the largest value for Charter is in operating its assets well and gaining market share, and controlling your network

operations is a very key element to our strategy. So we believe the inherent value will be recognized through our
performance over time versus trying to isolate the value of that network now at the expense of potential cash flow
growth. Another thing to keep in mind is we also have significant tax assets already today, and it's not like we lack
complexity. With the organic and inorganic strategy we'll focus on delivery and the way we're set up today, I think, is
the most valuable way today for Charter shareholders.
