I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.
John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Wells Fargo had a terrific quarter and has now generated
14 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth with record earnings in the second quarter. This consistent, strong
performance during a dynamic economic interest rate environment again demonstrates the benefit of our diversified
business model. We are not dependent on any one business to generate growth. We have over 90 businesses that are all
focused on just one thing, meeting our customers' financial needs.
Our results this quarter demonstrate the momentum we have throughout all of our businesses. Our strong performance
is broad based. Compared to year ago, we earned a record $5.5 billion, up 19%, and grew earnings per share 20%. We
grew pre-tax pre-provision profit by 3%. We reduced our expenses and improved our efficiency ratio by 90 basis points
to 57.3%. Our core loan portfolio grew by $42.3 billion, up 6%. Our credit performance was outstanding, benefiting
from our conservative underwriting and improving economic conditions, especially in housing, with net charge-offs
down to 58 basis points and our total net charge-offs down 48% from just a year ago.
Our strong deposit franchise, which becomes even more valuable in a rising rate environment continued to grow, with
total deposits up 10% from a year ago, while we reduced total deposit costs by 5 basis points to 14 basis points. We
achieved record retail cross-sell of 6.14 products per household. Wholesale Banking grew their cross-sell to 6.9
products and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement cross-sell increased to over 10 products, 10.35 to be exact.
We grew return on assets by 14 basis points to 1.55% and return on equity increased by 116 basis points to 14.02%.
Our capital levels continued to grow with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increasing to 8.54%
and based upon our initial review of the leverage ratio proposed – proposal issued this week, we believe our current
leverage levels would exceed the well-capitalized requirements at both the bank and the holding company. Our strong
earnings growth has enabled us to grow our capital levels, while returning more capital to our shareholders. In the
second quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.30 a share, up 36% from a year ago, and we continued to buy back
stock.
Before turning the call over to Tim, let me conclude with some comments about my views on how the current
economic and rate environment impacts Wells Fargo. We continue to be optimistic about the improvements we're
seeing throughout the economy. While commercial loan demand is still modest, jobs are being created, consumer
confidence is increasing and the housing market continues to demonstrate strong momentum. In fact, in the second
quarter, the housing market improvement was stronger and more broad based than it had been since before 2008.
Sales were up and residential property prices increased by 13% across the country. Yet affordability still remains
attractive, even with the increased prices and higher interest rates. The strength in the housing market was a positive
catalyst to our results in the second quarter in a number of ways, including higher originations for home purchases,
lower environmental costs, reduced repurchased reserves and improved credit quality. Assuming the housing market
state remains strong, we currently believe it will – and we currently believe it will, our overall results should continue
to reflect these benefits.
While the economy continues its slow but steady improvement, the current rate environment is obviously very different
than it was just 90 days ago, when we last announced our earnings. We knew rates would eventually rise, and we've
been planning for a rising rate environment for some time. The benefit of our diversified business model is that it
provides opportunities to generate earnings growth over a variety of rate environments. Some of our businesses
naturally do better in a lower rate environment and others benefit from rising rates.
Tim will highlight the growth we've achieved across a number of our businesses on our call today. We do not manage
Wells Fargo based on a specific rate environment. We manage Wells Fargo, as we have for decades, to satisfy our
customers' financial needs. Rates rising for the right reason and improving economy is beneficial for our customers

which then in turn benefits Wells Fargo.
Tim will now provide more details on our second quarter results. Tim?
Timothy J. Sloan
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the first half of our
quarterly supplement, starting on page two. John and I will then take your questions. As John mentioned, Wells Fargo
had another outstanding quarter with record earnings of $5.5 billion, up 19% from a year ago and up 7% from the first
quarter. Earnings per share grew to $0.98, up 20% from last year and up 7% from the first quarter. We have now
achieved 14 consecutive quarters of EPS growth and nine consecutive quarters of record earnings per share.
As John just mentioned, the rate environment this quarter was very different from last quarter. In fact, the economic,
housing and rate environment has differed significantly over the past 14 quarters of our earnings growth. While the
drivers of our growth have varied, our consistent risk discipline and diversified business model have remained the
same. Our results this quarter compared to the first quarter clearly show the advantage of our diversity, with our bottom
line results benefiting from strong broad-based trends, including net interest income growth as we grew loans and
invested in securities, fee growth across a variety of our businesses, reduced expenses generating positive operating
leverage and improved credit and capital levels.
As you can see on page three, our year-over-year results were also strong with growth in pre-tax pre-provision profit,
net income, EPS, both total and core loans, core deposits, ROA and ROE.
Our revenue diversification is highlighted on slide four, a 50-50 split between spread revenue and fee revenue from our
diversified businesses and cross-sell activities. Trust and investment fees were once again our largest fee category, as it
has been for the past five quarters. We achieved positive momentum across many of our businesses, which I'll highlight
throughout the call.
Let me start by highlighting some key drivers of our second quarter results from the balance sheet and income
statement perspective. On page five, you can see we had good balance sheet growth this quarter, growing loans,
deposits and securities. I'll provide more detail on the securities we purchased later on the call. The decline in our
provision expense this quarter reflected improvement in home prices and our overall credit performance.
Turning to the income statement on page six, mortgage revenue was stable in the quarter and revenue growth was
driven by stronger trust and investment fees and higher net interest income. Our expenses declined, as we expected,
primarily reflecting seasonally lower employee benefit costs.
Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page seven, we continue to have solid loan growth
with period-end loans up $26.8 billion or 3% from a year ago and up $2 billion from the first quarter. Loans grew even
after the continued run-off of our liquidating portfolio. This portfolio has declined by over 50% since 2008 and the
headwind to overall loan growth caused by this run-off has continued to slow. In the second quarter, the liquidating
portfolio declined $15.5 billion from a year ago and $3.2 billion from the first quarter. Excluding these liquidating
loans, our core loan portfolio grew by $42.3 billion, or 6% from a year ago, and was up $5.2 billion from the first
quarter.
Commercial loans grew $1.8 billion in the quarter with broad-based growth in C&I and foreign loans. Consumer loans
grew $250 million with growth in nonconforming first mortgage loans, auto and credit card, partially offset by the
expected run-off from liquidating and core home equity portfolios.
Deposit growth remained strong with period-end deposits up $10.9 billion from the first quarter. Average deposits were
up $23.6 billion from the first quarter and up $85.8 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average core checking and savings
deposits were up 8% from a year ago. We grew our primary consumer checking customers by a net 3.5% from a year
ago, up 2.1% from last quarter. These are active checking account customers who transact with Wells Fargo regularly.
The growth we've achieved with these relationship-based customers demonstrates the strength of our deposit franchise

and should generate future growth, as we focus on remaining their primary bank and meeting more of their financial
needs.
We continue to lower our deposit cost with average deposit cost of 14 basis points in the second quarter, down 1 basis
point from the first quarter and down 5 basis points from a year ago. We've successfully grown deposits, while
reducing our deposit cost for 10 consecutive quarters.
As shown on page nine, we grew tax-equivalent net interest income by 3% from the first quarter. The growth in NII
was driven by securities purchases, lower funding costs, loan growth, higher variable income, as well as the benefit
from an extra day in the quarter. Average earning assets grew $31.1 billion from the first quarter, reflecting increases in
short-term investments, loans and AFS securities. We purchased $21 billion of AFS securities during the second
quarter, primarily agency MBS. And we purchased an additional $6 billion of securities in the first two weeks of the
third quarter.
We remain disciplined during periods of lower rates and we were prepared to deploy liquidity as rates rose. We
benefited from this disciplined approach in the second quarter by investing in higher-yielding securities. While higher
rates driven by an improving economy will be positive to our results over the long term, including higher-yielding
earning asset growth and improving credit quality, there're also some short-term effects such as lower mortgage refi
volume and reduced OCI that I'll highlight throughout the call.
Higher rates impact our businesses in different ways and at different times, which reinforces the benefit of our
diversified model. Our net interest margin declined by 2 basis points from the first quarter to 3.46%; this decline was
driven by three primary factors. First, our continued deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase,
reducing the margin by 6 basis points. As I've highlighted in the past, our deposit growth had little impact on net
interest income, but it is dilutive to the net interest margin. Offsetting this decline by 2 basis points was higher variable
income, including higher PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends. This variable income is obviously lumpy and can
increase or decrease in any quarter. Finally, the net impact of re-pricing and balance sheet growth improved the margin
by 2 basis points, largely due to the benefit of the growth in AFS portfolio and reduced funding costs. While margin
was relatively stable this quarter, it is still reasonable to expect continued net interest margin pressure.
Despite a decline in total fee income in the quarter, many of our businesses demonstrated strong momentum, including
deposit service charges up $34 million from the first quarter benefiting from seasonality and account growth, trust and
investment fees up $292 million on strong investment banking fees and higher retail brokerage asset-based fees. Card
fees grew $75 million on credit and debit card account growth and higher purchase volume. Commercial real estate
brokerage commissions grew $28 million with strong activity for both private and public deals.
Overall, noninterest income was down slightly from the first quarter on lower gains from deferred compensation plan
investment income, which is P&L neutral, weaker customer accommodation trading and lower fees including a lower
gain on sale of the PCI loans.
Our mortgage business continued to generate strong results in the second quarter with revenue up modestly from the
first quarter as highlighted on page 11. Mortgage originations were $112 billion, our seventh consecutive quarter of
more than $100 billion in originations, reflecting the benefit of the housing market improvement and low interest rates.
As rates rose late in the quarter, applications for home purchases remained strong, but refi application volumes declined
as expected.
We still had a relatively large unclosed pipeline at the end of the quarter, but refi volume is obviously very sensitive to
rates. Refis were 56% of originations in the second quarter, down from 69% in the first quarter. We've managed
through many refi cycles in the past and we will adjust the size of our business based on production volumes through
this cycle. Gain on sale margins declined to 2.21% and with the increase in mortgage rates, we would expect further
declines in our margins and originations.
Expenses declined from seasonally high first quarter levels as shown on page 12. This decline was driven by a 4%
reduction in personnel expenses, reflecting lower employee benefit expenses due to the first quarter seasonally high
payroll taxes and 401(k) matching. These declines were partially offset by higher salaries reflecting annual merit

increases and higher revenue-based incentive compensation expense from strong results in capital markets, WBR and
mortgage. We also had increases in other expense categories, primarily driven by our continued investment in our
business to drive future growth, including project spending for product improvements and system enhancements, higher
advertising and promotion expense driven by seasonality and a new campaign launched in the second quarter.
Operating losses increased $131 million in the second quarter, primarily from litigation accruals related to various legal
matters and we also experienced increased costs associated with regulatory and compliance requirements. Our focus on
reducing expenses while investing in our businesses to generate revenue growth is reflected in our efficiency ratio
declining to 57.3% in the second quarter. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to
59%.
As John mentioned at the start of the call, the recovery in the housing market is driving significant improvement in a
number of areas, including some of our environmentally-elevated costs. As highlighted on page 13, in the second
quarter, most of these costs were significantly below what they had been over the past few years. We had a nominal
amount of costs associated with the independent foreclosure review this quarter from customer call volumes following
the distribution of remediation checks. The improvement in real estate value has helped reduce foreclosed asset
expenses by $49 million compared to first quarter and by $143 million from a year ago.
Mortgage revenue this quarter was reduced by $25 million for additions to our repurchase reserve not related to current
originations, which is the lowest build we have had since prior to 2008.
Outstanding repurchase demands were relatively stable compared with the first quarter and new demands emerged
consistent with our expectations. However, not all elevated costs are behind us. Mortgage revenue was reduced by $82
million to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure costs, as foreclosure timelines continued to extend, especially in
judicial foreclosure states.
Turning to our segment results, starting on page 14, Community Banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, up
28% from a year ago and up 11% from the first quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.14 products
per household, up from 6 products a year ago. To support sales and household growth, we grew platform banker FTE
by approximately 1,900 from a year ago.
Our credit card business continued to have strong account growth with a record 594,000 new accounts in the second
quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Our household penetration increased to 35%, up from 31% year ago. Credit card
balances were up 3% from the first quarter and up 9% from a year ago due to strong transaction volume and account
growth.
We also had momentum in our auto business with record originations in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, up 4% from
the first quarter and up 9% from a year ago. Our continued focus on serving our small business customers generated a
2.7% growth in business checking account from a year ago and we extended $9.3 billion of new loan commitments to
small business customers during the first half of the year, up 25% from a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, up 7% from a year ago and down $41 million from the first
quarter. Wholesale Banking generated record revenue of $6.1 billion. Investment banking fee growth was strong,
driven by higher equity underwriting, credit originations and loan syndication fees. Investment banking results included
a 34% increase in year-to-date revenue from commercial and corporate customers. This relationship focus also
benefited treasury management, as revenue grew 12% from a year ago, benefiting from better penetration of our
existing customers.
Wholesale Banking's cross-sell reached 6.9 products per relationship, up from 6.8 a year ago. Wholesale Banking
results continued to benefit from steady loan growth with loans having grown for 11 consecutive quarters. Average
loans increased 6% from a year ago with growth in nearly all portfolios, including asset-backed finance, capital finance,
commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. Credit
quality remained strong with net recoveries in the second quarter reflecting the improvement in our economy and our
risk and underwriting discipline.

Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned a record $434 million, up 27% from a year ago and up 29% from the first
quarter, reflecting the success of our core business strategy of growing asset-based relationships and the benefit from
the improvement in the markets. Revenue grew 10% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in asset-based fees and
higher brokerage transaction revenue. Retail brokerage managed account assets reached a record $331 billion, up 19%
from a year ago, driven by strong net flows and market performance.
WBR had strong loan growth with average loans up 4% from the first quarter, driven by nonconforming mortgages.
WBR continued to effectively partner with retail banking to meet the financial needs of our customers, increasing
cross-sell to 10.3 products per household. Assets referred from Community Banking to WBR grew over 25% from a
year ago, based on first quarter results. This partnership is a great example of how our businesses work together to meet
the financial needs of our customers.
Turning to credit quality on page 17, we had continued improvement across our commercial and consumer portfolios.
Second quarter net charge-offs declined to 58 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were
only $44 million or 5 basis points of average loans. Consumer losses declined to 101 basis points.
We've had especially strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate portfolios. These portfolios are
now providing a tailwind for our credit performance, compared to the headwind they provided when the real estate
market was weaker. Reflecting these improvements, our provision expense declined $567 million from the first quarter
and included a $500 million in reserve releases, compared with the release of $200 million in the first quarter and $400
million from a year ago. We continue to expect future reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the
economic environment. And while we don't know what our release will be in the third quarter, the favorable conditions
that drove this release this quarter have not dissipated.
The recovery in the housing market also benefited our expected losses in the PCI portfolio. This quarter the accretable
yield balance increased by a net $2.1 billion, which included a $1.6 billion increase in expected cash flows and an $876
million reclassification, primarily from our Pick-a-Pay portfolio. This reclass did not impact second quarter results, but
will be accreted into income over the remaining life of these loans.
In addition to lower charge-offs and provision expense, non-performing assets also improved with NPAs down $1.8
billion from the first quarter and down $3.8 billion or 15% from a year ago. Loans 90 days or more past due decreased
$206 million from the first quarter and were down 15% from a year ago with improvement in both commercial and
consumer loans. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined from the first quarter and
from a year ago.
Earnings are the primary driver of capital growth for Wells Fargo. As shown on page 19, our Tier 1 common equity
ratio grew to 10.73%, up 34 basis points from the last quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel
III, which reflects our interpretation of the Basel III capital rules adopted July 2, increased to 8.54% in the second
quarter. OCI negatively impacted the ratio by 24 basis points in the quarter, due to the increase in interest rates.
Because of our strong earnings growth, we grew capital even with the impact from the increase in rates. We expect
reductions to unrealized securities gains when rates rise and this is one reason why, as we discussed over a year ago, we
are targeting a capital buffer of approximately 100 basis points.
And just this week, as John mentioned, the U.S. regulatory agency issued a supplemental leverage ratio proposal. Based
on our initial review, we believe our current levels – leverage levels would exceed the well-capitalized requirements at
both the bank and the holding company. We increased our second quarter dividend to $0.30 per share, a 20% increase
over the first quarter dividend and purchased 26.7 million shares in the second quarter and executed a $500 million
forward contract that is expected to settle in the third quarter for approximately 13 million shares.
Including the shares under the forward contract, our share count would've been relatively flat for the quarter, offsetting
40 million shares issued during the quarter, primarily related to profit sharing and match contributions to 401(k) plans
and team members exercising options.
We have many opportunities to generate growth at Wells Fargo. On slide 20, we summarized the demonstrated
momentum we have throughout our businesses that I've highlighted on the call. In each of our businesses, we have

opportunities for growth reflecting the expanding needs of our customers. This customer, account and balance growth,
along with increased cross-sell will help drive our future results and reflects the benefits of our diversified model.
In summary, we had a very good quarter with strong broad-based improvement and demonstrated momentum across
many of our businesses. This included growth in loans, deposits, net interest income and fee growth across many of our
businesses. We reduced expenses and benefited from a continued improvement in credit quality that reflected our
conservative underwriting and the strengthening economy, especially the rebound in housing. Our ROA and ROE
continued to grow and we grew capital levels, while returning more capital to shareholders.
We will now open up the call for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, John.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Morning.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Tim, question on liquidity. Could you tell us where you are on the liquidity coverage
ratio relative to your understanding of what will be required of you in the new regulatory rules?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. John, it's a good question. One of the challenges is that the rules haven't been finalized
and similar to the Basel III capital rules, from the point that which they were originally proposed to where they were
finalized; there was a fair amount of discussion and change. I would tell you that we have adequate capital to operate
Wells Fargo. Having said that, we are going to continue to work with the regulators in terms of those interpretations;
there may be some incremental amount of liquidity that we need to raise, but it's certainly something that we are
focused on because liquidity risk is a key risk for the company. But, given the over $1 trillion of deposits we have and
given the experience we have in terms of operating in different environment, again we think we've got adequate
liquidity. We may need to raise a little bit more, but it shouldn't be material for the company.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So, it's a factor and as you think about the pace at which you deploy your cash,
you mentioned buying some securities here today. Is that a factor in how you think about deploying your liquidity?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No. It's not a big factor at all, John. I mean, again, to me it's much more important to think
about the liquidity needs for operating the business, as it relates to how much we want to invest in securities because
the first call for any of our liquidity has always got to be to our customers in terms of loan demand. But it's not a
primary driver in terms of the pace of activity. The primary driver in terms of the pace of our investment activity has
been – and over the last year we've been in this very low rate environment. Turn the clock back a year ago, we had a lot
of excess liquidity, there was a lot of concern that we were going to be in low rates for a while and there was this view
that we weren't investing fast enough. We wanted to stay disciplined then. That was the primary driver just like today,
one of the primary drivers for why we're investing more in our securities portfolios is because we think, given the rate
back-up, the returns are much more attractive.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yeah. And we did see a benefit there in the degree of net interest margin
compression, but you still have an expectation for some continued margin compression. What are the drivers there,
Tim? And then in terms of NII dollars, do still expect to grow the NII dollars from the current level?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So, on the net interest margin, I don't think the drivers have really changed that much. As you
recall, if you look at our net interest margin decline, which we've had one over the last 14 quarters, the primary driver
for the decline has been the fact that we've been growing deposits, which long-term [audio gap] (31:18) for the

company. Within a quarter, we can have some variability based upon the variable income, which was positive this
quarter, but last quarter it was negative. The balance sheet continues to re-price a bit, so the factors really haven't
changed because we haven't got to a point that the balance sheet has completely re-priced. So, we could continue to see
some continued compression in the net interest margin. The underlying factors really haven't changed.
In terms of net interest income, our goal is to grow net interest income over time. What happens in a quarter-by-quarter
basis, I just don't know for sure because there are a lot of factors. We had a lot of positive factors that drove our net
interest income this quarter, which I think was just absolutely terrific. Again, I don't know if that means we're going to
grow net interest income in the third quarter, but over time, I believe that we can grow net interest income. And we've –
this quarter I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And switching gears over to the mortgage revenues, did the gain on sale
margin of the 2.21% you mentioned hold up better than expected? What were the factors there? Is there any framing
you can do for us of how much pressure that margin could experience as you move through the next couple of quarters?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. John, I think that's a very fair observation. And candidly, I think the mortgage gain on
sale margin has held up better not just for the last quarter, but for the last year than I think anybody in the business or in
the industry would have expected. That said, it has come down and it came down over 30 basis points in the quarter.
And our best guess is that we are seeing pressure in the gain on sale margin and the gain on sale margin has
significantly declined.
Recall that last quarter we framed the gain on sale margin variability over the last few years that if you annualize it, the
low end was 1.60% and the high end, again on the annualized basis was 2.20%. We've been at the high end. We think
we're going to start to move down from there. So, I think there's going to be pressure. I do not believe you're going to
see at 2.21% gain on sale margin. I think it's more likely to be lower. But again, it's really a function of the competitive
environment, which we think has been very rational, as we've gone through this cycle, as well as the rate environment.
Recall that our best guess in the second quarter was that originations were going to be a little bit lower than first
quarter, but in fact originations were up in the second quarter because rates stayed low for a longer period of time.
Rates are now up and that's going to affect originations for sure. So, there's a lot of variability, but to put it very bluntly,
we think that the gain on sale margin is going to decline and it will decline somewhere in the range of what we've seen
over the last few years. But it is going to decline.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: But, John, as you know, and Tim is absolutely right, it will decline and margins will be under
some pressure, but we have this wonderfully balanced business within the business. In other words, when rates
increase, if refis drop, margins come in because there's more competition, but then you have a servicing portfolio and
that does better. So, there's balance within this business, not only – and there's also, of course, balance in the broad
distribution and diversity within the company. So it's – some businesses do better, some do not as well when rates rise.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, John. Tim, one follow-up on that. Could you remind us of the
mechanics by which the higher servicing income can work its way through the income statement and why didn't – it
didn't seem like we saw any of that start this quarter with the big move in the 10-year. What will trigger the kind of
offsetting balance on the servicing side where the income there, we'll see that start to rise?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, as John points out, over time I think that there is some balance in the business on the
revenue side because of the fact that servicing income tends to be a little bit less volatile. We should see some benefit
in terms of servicing income increasing as the housing industry continues to improve. As we pointed out, we did reduce
the value of the servicing for some elongation of some foreclosure timelines. Over time that will dissipate. And then
we'll continue to get the carry in the underlying servicing income. Our hedge ratio is pretty high, so it's not like we're
betting the farm on or the stagecoach on an increase in rates in the servicing portfolio. We'll see some benefit there.
But I think it's also really important to remember that there'll also be some expense trade-offs in the mortgage business
itself, as – if it turns out that originations are down, then it's immediately in the quarter you get a benefit from the
revenue-based compensation, commissions coming down and then to the extent that, that volume continues, then you
also make adjustments that tend to be on a lagged basis, on a quarterly basis, in terms of some of your other expenses.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Are you starting to make those adjustments based on what you're seeing in the
pipeline and the outlook given rates?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, you know, John, we're making adjustments all the time. The fact of the matter is we
entered the quarter with actually a pretty strong pipeline of $63 billion, which was only down 10%, 15% from the end
of the quarter. But there's no question that to the extent that we continue to see a decline in the pipeline that we will
make adjustments, and so you can assume that we will begin to make some of those adjustments this quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to John's last. We heard another mega
bank today say that if loan rates stay where they are that the mortgage market could shrink 30% to 40% in the second
half of the year. Do you agree with that statement for your company given what you're seeing in purchase trends? And
additionally, could you quantify if that number is correct, how much of the expenses can come up proportionate to that
30% to 40% decline?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, it's a fair question. I don't think anybody really knows what the volumes in the
mortgage business are going to be. I think one of the challenges for anybody in making that estimate today is that the
complexion of originations is really changing. When you look at the percentage of refi volume versus purchase money
volume that we had in the first quarter of this year for example, it was about one-third purchase money and about
two-thirds refi volume.
As the housing industry continues to improve and as we went into the spring selling season, you saw that mix shift and
it was more like 55%, 44%, 45% or whatever and what that means is that a larger portion of your originations are
coming from the purchase portion of the business. So, I think it is a fact that refinance volume is certainly very much
impacted by rates, but also we've seen now rates, the long end start to come down 10 basis points just in the last few
days. And so we don't know for sure where volume is going to be. We believe it's going to be lower in this quarter and
one of the things that we've learned in the mortgage business is it's probably not a good thing to think six months out or
nine months out because there can be so much variability. We think volumes are going to be down, but whether it's
going to be 30% to 40% I just don't know.
As it relates to expenses, again the timeline generally is that the revenue-based compensation declines immediately and
then to the extent that you have a continued origination reduction then you start to reduce some of your expenses, that
tends to occur on a lag-quarter basis, but at the end of the day we still believe that we can continue to have good
margins in the business and to keep the efficiency ratio about where it is because also remember that one of the other
important things that's going on in the business is you've got an improvement in the underlying housing industry so that
your environmental related costs hopefully will come down including foreclosures at the same time.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Erika, one other thing that I know that we should not forget, not like we've been through this
many times, but we have 6,200 stores, 30,000 or 40,000 personal bankers that refer business in, so when rates rise and
it's more of a purchase money business. We have all folks on deck helping serve customers and we still have tons of
our customers who are interested in buying homes and moving and so forth who are our customers, but do their
mortgage business other places. So we have still have lots of opportunity to capture purchase money business, which is
still not at the levels it was pre-crisis. So there's lots of activity going on there. Surely, the refinance volume is going to

come down significantly if rates continue to stay high, but as Tim mentioned, I don't know where rates will be. 90 days
ago, we wouldn't have talked about what we're talking about today. Things change very quickly in this business.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, Erika, let me just reinforce again, as you think about the third quarter and you think
about the volume that we've seen over the last couple of years, we've been very fortunate to see quarters in which
volume has been above $100 billion. We just don't think that we're going to see $100 billion of mortgage volume given
the current rates today in the third quarter.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Got it. Speaking of how Wells benefits as housing recovers, I know that you're frustrated
by the obsession on your margin, but as I think about slide 26 in your deck, it seems like you have $876 million of
reclassification to accretable yield and $1.6 billion of additional expected cash flows that could be helpful to your
margin over time. Should we think of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio similar to how we think about reserve relief for the
entire company in that, as housing gets better, you could release some of the marks into net interest income, which
would benefit or alleviate some of the concerns on margin?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: There's no question that the key drivers for the improvement or the reclassification where
housing prices as well as the underlying credit performance within that portfolio and those are very similar to the
drivers for the improvement that we've seen in our first mortgage portfolio and our home equity portfolios. In terms of
the impact, I'd love to tell you that when you re-class the $876 million, we get an immediate impact. That's not the way
it works. It occurs over the life of the loan. There will be some positive impact and you've seen that, and I'm hopeful if
the current trends continue that this isn't the last time that we've seen a reclassification. I can't promise you that it's
going to be the case, but it will provide some positive benefit over time. But again, we've got to make sure that we put
in the right context because our best estimate is, at the weighted life of that portfolio is still about 14 years.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Okay. Got it. And just if I could sneak one more in, just a clarification follow-up to
John's question on the LCR; your cash balances keep growing, but in other calls you've mentioned that you have
something like $50 billion of excess cash. Is that true still relative to how we should think about Basel III LCR
compliance? And I guess is the main message is potentially the cash balance will continue to build from here?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, I think that the challenge we all have including where we are in terms of the liquidity
coverage ratio is the rules haven't been finalized. If you would tell me what the final rules are, then I could tell you
whether or now we're, we have too much or not enough or the right or whatever. What I do know is that we believe that
we have additional ability based on how we are running Wells Fargo, based on our interpretations of LCR, all right, to
invest some of our liquidity in securities, but more importantly, we have it ready for our customers when they want to
borrow money. That doesn't mean that we may not raise liquidity if when some of the rules are finalized, but we don't
believe – and we believe that that's possible to do without a significant impact or a material impact in terms of running
the company, but again, I think it'd be premature to conclude what the final rules look like because they haven't been
finalized.

just the higher market levels or are you seeing some inflows there as well? I did notice like the deposits in that segment
were down a couple of billion, so I'm just wondering if there's some flows coming into the brokerage area?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well I think it's all of the above, Matt. There's no question that we've been benefited as
everybody in the industry has been benefited by the improving markets, the improving equity markets and the fact that
retail investors want to be part of that business. We did see some movement from deposits to investing in the market.
We think that's a good thing. We've been waiting for that for a while, but we also grew our customer levels, too.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And Matt, the other thing is, this is a big emphasis for the company. David Carroll and his
great team are working with Carrie Tolstedt and her team and Dave Hoyt, and within the company, this that one Wells
Fargo working together, so not only the markets help us, we're also putting a big emphasis on this. We think this is a
big growth opportunity for this company.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And then just separately, on the mortgage servicing rights, I know you talked about
potentially testing the waters to sell, and sorry if I missed it, but did you sell any this quarter and thoughts going
forward in terms of potentially selling them? I would think they're worth a little bit more now than a few months ago.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We'd hope that's the case, Matt. I think that as you know, we entered into a transaction to sell
a portion of our reverse mortgage portfolio in the first quarter. We didn't have any sales of MSRs this quarter, but we
will continue to look at selling MSRs. We think that that's prudent risk management, that the primary driver for doing
that is not because we feel like there's pressure as it relates to capital, but I wouldn't be surprised if we move forward
and execute a sale of MSRs this quarter or next.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Good morning. John, I guess I was just hoping you could expand kind of generally on the
comments you made in your prep remarks early on about the housing market. I guess what I'm thinking about is high
rates impact affordability, but you certainly seem pretty optimistic about the prospects for the housing market and
continued improvement. So, what trends are you seeing generally, particularly I guess most recently, just since you
guys see so much of the mortgage and consequently the housing market, that makes you keep this sustained optimism?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Sure. So first of all, I think I've mentioned before that we look at 400 or so MSAs,
metropolitan statistical areas, and we have a unique and pretty grounded way of seeing real estate across the country.
And the view is, it's better everywhere. It's been better everywhere for going on in some cases two years, surely in the
past year. And it's been stronger in some places than even probably we had expected.
Some of the states that were hardest hit, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, California are showing huge or very large price
appreciation kinds of numbers. Also if you look at – and yes, rates have gone up. But if you were in the mortgage
market before 2000, you know that these are unbelievably good rates. My first mortgage was at 8.5%. My second one
was 11.5% and I thought those were great rates at those times. So, affordability still is there. Household formation has
continued to happen in the last four or five years where people weren't buying, so there's a lot of pent-up demand.
The three important issues to a home purchase, what you make, what the house costs and what the financing costs. One
of those is still at close to 40, 50-year record lows. Compared to rental, owning a home is – makes economic sense.

Sure, it depends on where you want to live and how long you want to live there and so forth. So there is just strength
there and it improves customer confidence.
The thing I hear most about when I'm out in the marketplace is the lack of inventory. So we are expecting that prices
will continue to improve, probably not the level they have in the past, but housing sure has strength to it. So, I don't
know what's going to happen to rates over time, but when housing improves, it's good for Americans, it's good for
confidence and which in turn is good for financial services industry and Wells Fargo.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: All right. I appreciate the color there and then I guess, Tim, sort of along the same lines, your
consumer credit improvement – I guess we kind of knew it would improve, but I think the magnitude was probably a
little better than I would've anticipated. If we kind of just – if we were to, say, stay at this sort of level of housing, I
mean is there a point where you need continued improvement to impact the sustainability of such strong consumer
trends or are we there yet? Or how are you thinking about that dynamic?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah. I think it's a fair question, Scott. The underlying trends and factors that John referred
to are still improving and so it's hard to imagine improvement not continuing. Whether it continues to improve at the
same rate, I don't know. I think we've continued to be surprised by how housing has positively impacted our results.
I think it's also important to remember that, particularly when you think about the reserve release, that there were some
overriding factors that impacted the reserve release over the last few quarters including the fact that we had the OCC
guidance that impacted the third and fourth quarter of last year and also the potential for the impact from the damage of
Hurricane Sandy that's been working its way through the system.
But again, I think that the fundamentals for housing are strong. We have a large first mortgage and second mortgage
portfolio that tends to be the portfolio that where we have a disproportionate share of our losses even though they
improved – the consumer losses improved to just a touch over 1% this quarter. So we're feeling pretty good about the
improvement.
<A – [05KRY0-E]John Stumpf – Wells Fargo & Co.> Scott, if I could just add one more thing. Housing is uniquely
different than any other consumer asset class. When housing improves, people feel better. I mean two-thirds of
Americans or so own a home. When housing improves, it improves confidence, people spend more, the multiplier
effect on buying washers and dryers and other consumer goods is just very special around housing. So when housing
gets better, it really lifts all boats on the consumer side.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay. Well guys, I definitely appreciate the help. Thank you.

<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: First question, Tim, that other income line that you talk about the equity method and less PCI
loan sales gains, that line has been $450 million to $500 million for last several years. Is there anything particular that
happened this quarter and is there anything that would prevent it from kind of going back to that more normal run rate?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good question. It's really not what happened, it's what didn't happen this quarter. The
comparison to the first quarter and the primary drivers for the decline were, we had an equity investment that we
accounted for under the equity method and, as you know, when those appreciate in value as opposed to the cost
method, you have to go ahead and write up the value, which we did in the first quarter.

Just so you know, we actually sold that equity investment, so we got the cash in the second quarter. Then secondarily
we had a $151 million gain, which we had called out in the first quarter, from the sale of some PCI loans that were –
again, were in the first quarter that we just didn't have in the second quarter. So, I think it's more of what was missing in
the second quarter than what occurred. So, I don't know what's going to happen in the third quarter, but I think if you
look over a long period of time, the income from that line item being as low as it has been is not typical.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Right. Okay. And then secondly, the share count again was up and you guys had talked about
that we might be getting towards the point where we finally start to see it reduce. And I'm just wondering, are we at that
point and what needs to happen just with the math to finally start getting the share count down?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, we were almost at that point this quarter. That's one of the reasons why I called out the
fact that the timing of the settlement from the structured sale had that occurred in the second quarter and it's going to
occur relatively early in the third quarter, we would've been about flat. Notwithstanding, the second quarter tends to be
a quarter in which there's more share issuance, as we called out. I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but my
guess is that we're very close to the point at which we will start to see share reductions.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then just on the mortgage business, the pipeline was down but you guys had
mentioned last quarter that your closing times had gone down from 90 to 60. I'm just wondering how much of a market
share opportunity is this because it doesn't sound like you've really cut capacity yet. So can you just walk us through
originations versus pipeline and how much more you're actually just pumping through the channel regardless of what's
happening with the overall origination volumes in the marketplace?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, one of the reasons why we haven't made a lot of changes in terms of underlying
business is that the increase in the rates is – only happened a few weeks ago and we had a large pipeline that we were
working through. As you saw originations in the second quarter were a lot stronger than I think anyone would have
imagined. So I think that's going to naturally begin to change, because even though $64 billion is a great place to start,
it's definitely $63 billion, it's definitely less than $79 billion. And so our guess is that volume and originations will be
under the $100 billion mark and we'll need to go ahead and make some adjustments. But again, I think the competitive
atmosphere is very fierce, but it's very rational.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And my last question, Tim, just with regard to your favorite slide, you had big delta in
provision this quarter and you're talking about the mortgage banking revenue now starting to turn from here. So, I know
it's hard to say in any given quarter if you could actually be able to grow EPS the quarter ahead, but can you just talk us
through and again it's hard to see the provision move much more and we know that mortgage is kind of tailing, so what
do you expect to be the biggest drivers, other than that maybe the other income reverting backup to kind of continue to
get that net income moving the right way?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah, it's a very fair question given the potential decline in mortgage revenues. But again,
let's make sure we put that in perspective. Mortgage revenues are a little over 10% of our total revenues for the
company, that's number one. Number two, when you look at the breadth of the growth in the company in terms of net
interest income growth, you saw loan growth, you saw us take advantage of the fact that given the rate backup, we will
invest it more in securities. We haven't invested this much in securities in a long time and even when we saw the back
up in the first quarter. When you look at the noninterest or the fee revenues, really across the board we saw growth with
the exception of some of those areas that were affected by the backup in rates, so there's a good story there.
I don't necessarily think this is the end of the improvement in credit because the factors continue to – that are driving
the improvement in credit haven't bottomed out. So, and then I think it's likely that we'll continue to see some
improvement in expenses. So when you put it all together, I don't think it's just one item. If it was, I'd tell you and you
could decide whether or not it would make sense. But the good news for us because of our diversified model, we don't
have to rely upon one or two specific areas to be able to make up a decline in any business. We've seen declines in
some of our businesses each quarter now for the last 14 quarters and we've still been able to grow. Whether or not we
can do it in the third quarter, I can't promise you that. But I sure do like our chances to continue to grow earnings over
time.

talked about you could see some sales. Would these be material sales of MSRs? I mean what level of MSRs would you
like to hold?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We're very comfortable with the level of MSR that we have today. Having said that, from a
risk management standpoint, it's prudent to investigate sales of any of the assets that you have on the books, whether
it's MSRs or otherwise. I think to the extent that we would move forward to sell MSRs, we would focus on those MSRs
that tend to be to a customer that only has one product that mortgage that we service with the company that would be
where the primary focus would be. I don't necessarily think it would be material because we don't think we have to do
it. But it sure does make sense given the volatility in interest rates to look at all your assets to make sure that you know
how to and can execute on sales before you'd ever get to a position that you'd have to do it.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, Paul, think of it this way. I wouldn't make more than this than it is. I mean we have a
very large and important servicing business. We love that business. From time to time, opportunistically, we'll sell
something and reposition, but we like the balance and we like that business a whole lot.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then on the credit side, I mean I believe your reserve ratio is down around 2%. What do you
think can you take that down to with the improvement in credit and the improvement in HPI?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We don't have a target. It's a fair question, but we don't have a target. It was 2.01% at the end
of the quarter. It's going to be what it's going to be based upon the improvement in the underlying credit trends. I
wouldn't be surprised if it was below 2% next quarter. I mean that's a possibility. It could be a little bit higher, it could
be a little bit lower, but there's not a specific target that we have because it's really just the result of the underlying
credit performance.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you very much.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thank you.

<Q - Joseph Morford>: I guess as you mentioned, the economic data continues to improve with last week's
employment report and the strengthening housing recovery and why you talked about the multiplier effect. Are you
seeing much of a pickup in activity at the customer level as well and when might we see this translate into stronger loan
growth, particularly on the commercial side?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: The primary areas that we're seeing take hold is on the consumer side. You saw our
consumer loans. Again you need to back out the impact of liquidating portfolio. But, we saw auto growth, we saw a
credit card growth, which was very nice. We're continuing to see growth in terms of this household formation that's out
there and that allows us to continue to grow deposits. So, all those are good trends. There's no question there's going to
be a bit of a lag effect as it relates to stronger commercial loan growth. Our commercial loan growth again has been
pretty strong, which is now the, I think the tenth consecutive quarter that wholesale in total has grown and it's certainly
in certain segments and industries within the wholesale portfolio, we're seeing some good growth. But my guess again
it'll be a quarter or so before we start to see a big pickup.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: So you're not really seeing customers draw down cash yet or really make more investments?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, I wish they were but unfortunately not. When you look at line usage in the commercial
side, it's been pretty stagnant for a bit.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And you're right, Joe. That happens first. That's typically the first thing happens.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: And then just on investment banking, revenues up strong from the first quarter. Can you just
talk a little bit more about the drivers there and maybe if you could just an update on the business in general and how
it's progressing and market share gains and things like that?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Overall, the business is performing very well. The primary drivers for the growth wasn't
necessarily in any one specific product type within the business, and it was very, very much focused on our existing
customer base. The fees were up 40% year-over-year. Most of that again was with our existing commercial and
corporate customers. I think our market share at the end of the quarter ended up at about 5.8%, which was fine. We're
not running that business for any sort of market share. We're running that business to be able to be there for our
customers when they need us and when you look at the growth in the business and the fact that it's primarily focused on
those customers, it's performing quite well.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Joe, to add something to that, I make a lot of calls in that area on behalf of our team and these
are existing customers for the most part. They appreciate the skill set and the abilities we have in that business,
especially as we partner with our retail distribution platform. So, we make a compelling offer and our long-term
customers appreciate that added service that we have for them.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Thanks, Joe.

<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I'm trying to get just a real simple answer and that is I heard what you said, John, about the

already in the numbers of Wells Fargo? And my column A, based on what you said are some headwinds. The
origination pipeline down 10% to 15%, repurchase reserves are all pretty low. Gain on sale going down. And the
column B, are perhaps some tailwinds, expenses perhaps going down from the workout costs in the mortgage platform,
the MSRs and the credit. So which is greater, column A or column B? And John, in your opening remarks you said,
Wells benefits – your grammatical tense was the present tense and I think, Ken, at one point said Wells Fargo
benefited, the past tense. So, does Wells Fargo still benefit in their bottom line results from the improving housing
market or is it all in the numbers?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, here's the way I look at that, Mike. When housing gets better, it's better for Americans,
it's better for the country, and that includes us. We have a commitment to residential real estate and commercial real
estate for that matter in this company because that's what our customers want us to buy. I can't tell you if it's – what's
going to happen in the next quarter, but I can tell you this, an improving housing market will benefit customers and us
because we're at the end of the day a reflection of our customers. So, the benefits are yet to come. It might come in
different line items. You're right. If rates rise, there'll be less refinances. We've been there before, but it also means
improved credit. It means improved confidence. Customers start small businesses. We're a big-small business bank.
Environmental costs go away. So, I would take that trade all day long. An improving housing market, even it means
less refinances because rates are rising at the same time, that's fine.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Mike, the only other thing I would add is, I don't think you have enough columns on your
sheet of paper. We have 90 different businesses, right. We are not just a house – if we were just a mortgage company,
then I think the columns and the items that you pointed out would have been absolutely spot on, right. But this is a
portion of our business; it's a great business, terrific people, we're helping customers succeed all the time in that
business, but we have 90 other businesses or 89 other businesses in this company that are continuing to grow. And you
can see not only this quarter, but over the last year that many of those businesses have been growing, not only as it
relates to net interest income, but also to noninterest income. So again, who knows what's going to happen in the third
quarter, but over time this diversified model is very helpful when you have one business where revenues might be
coming down.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And if I can speak your language, so I guess you'd say there's 90 horses pulling the stagecoach
and as the mortgage horse is slowing down or potentially slows down, although it certainly has been stronger for
longer, which of those other 89 businesses do you think are most able to pick up the slack?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: All of them. It's not just one, Mike, and that's what's exciting, right. If it was just one,
actually we'd be worried about it. But – and whether it's – it's a nice analogy. That would be quite a stagecoach that we
would have. But, the mortgage horse has been a big strong horse, right. But we've got 89 other horses that are going to
be able to grow. And again, just look at the numbers this quarter to get a feeling for – we call out 10 to 12. There's even
more as you pour through the numbers in terms of performance.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I mean, we talked in the last couple of quarters about how we think we have an opportunity in
credit card. I mean, we are seeing great increases there. Look at the Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement side of the
business. Now these are not all one horse offsets the other horse, but when you have a whole team out there, the key is
keep the coach running, and we like that diversity.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And last follow-up, just in case the other 89 businesses don't pick up the slack right away, as
Jake Morgan said on his call earlier that you can have a slowdown in mortgage, but a lag in the expense take-out, can
you just remind us of the expense flexibility that you have outside of mortgage?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: We still think there's opportunity on expenses here, and I think Tim mentioned that earlier in
the call. So as you mentioned, on the mortgage side, first of all, there is the commission base, so that happens
immediately, and then we are very good at sizing the business based on what's going on. We've done that many times.
But in others businesses, we, for example, we started something called the neighborhood store. We have 6,200 stores.
We opened our first one in Washington, D.C., and that operates at 40% less cost, but the same functionality. There are
tons of opportunities like that. Paperless ATM receipt, nickels and dimes in the corners that all add up at the end of the
day in addition to the environmental cost.

Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning, Nancy.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: I promise I'm not going to ask a mortgage banking question.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Okay.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: There has been a lot of press around this issue of the kiosk branch that you're introducing I
think in the New York City. Could you just talk about that a little bit and whether this signals some sort of broader
experimentation with branch types throughout the network or is this something specific to New York?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, it's actually Washington, D.C., but so let me tell you, first of all, we have about 6,200
stores and the stores have been relatively flat in numbers, and there is a lot of discussion today about in our industry
whether stores are still relevant. We think they're enormously relevant, even to our millennial customers. And store
usage and channel usage, frankly, is based on many times age, affluence and activity. So – and when we talk with our
customers, even the millennials visit our stores, once every year or six months or sometimes it's places where they go to
open their first account. It's where people go if they can't solve their problem any place else and it's a place they take
their money if they come into a trust fund that funds out or whatever the case may be.
But here's the key. As long as our customers tell us that destination distribution like a store is important, we're going to
build it for them and we're going to have stores where they need them, where they want them and that's important to
growing deposits, to selling products and services to them. If we ever get a time where they say it's not important then
we'll adjust that way also. So, since stores are important, how do you make them more efficient? And how do you build
them in a way that allows for the convenience they want, the availability they want, but also under the cost structure
that makes sense.
The neighborhood store we have is about 1,000 square feet. During the daytime it's a full functioning store. It happens
to be paperless, it happens to have – the cash there is contained within machines that can check down to the dollar and
then after hours the walls fold in and it's a ATM vestibule. So you get the best of both. This is a test and learn. We've
done a lot of testing and learning around here and in many of those densely populated marketplaces, you can't rent a
facility of 5,000 square feet. A 1,000 is all you can get. So that makes it available to you. So if this works, we'll do
more. If it doesn't work, we've got – this is not the only test we've going on. We have lots of tests going on.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: But at this point it's an additive strategy. It wouldn't be where you would take existing
branches that are sort of "more normal branches" and change them? It's just an additive strategy at this point?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah. It's additive, but it might be a replacement strategy for certain stores. In fact, some of
what we're doing today is taking two stores and building a new one and consolidating two depending on customer
flows, depending on customer needs. We're a retailer, so most retailers that I respect are always looking at their
distribution footprint and model, but the long and the short of it is, we believe in the store concept. But I mean when I
first got in the industry we had the operations in the second floor and the board room on the bottom floor, in the
basement. I mean we had – and that's changed since that time. It'll continue to change.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Am I right in assuming that the breakeven on these things is like weeks or a few months?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, it depends on the activity in the store and the activity with customer. Five years ago, the
breakeven was very different than it is today. Customers borrowed more, there's a different margin on borrowing versus
depositing. But I wouldn't say it's in the weeks and months, but it's about 40% reduction in cost with the same
functionality. That's a big deal.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: All right. Second question is this. Your improvement in cross-sell from 6% to 6.14% and
your ongoing improvements in cross-sell, is this primarily one product, two products? I mean is there sort of still a
"lead" product you guys have that sort of leads cross-sell?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yes, it's checking accounts. That's why when I wake up in the morning, I get here and the first
thing I look at is the checking account report from the day before. I love checking accounts. I dream about them. I
just...
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: John, you've been in the business too long. I'm sorry.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: It's because it's a formational account for a consumer. And the second probably most
important is mortgage and that's why we're almost, we're obsessive about that, about serving customers.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Yeah. And just finally one quick thing and I probably already what know the answer is, but
I've got to ask it anyway. Given that there has been yet one more attempt at Glass-Steagall, break them up, you're all
too big, you're bigger now than you were before the financial crisis, blah, blah, blah. I mean are you – I would assume
that you would be in this group of break-them-up banks? And I guess my question is, what could you be broken up
into?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, Nancy, this is America. People are free to express their opinion and that's one of the
beauties of this country. And from my perspective, we are solidly in the real economy. I mean what we do is to serve
customers, small business, large business, commercial real estate customers, consumers and virtually everything we do
has a customer on the other side of it. When we take a deposit in, we don't put it into a vault and it sits there, we put it
to work. We make consumer loans, commercial loans, small business loans, loans to ranchers and farmers and energy
companies; that's what we do.
And that's proprietary, I mean that's putting because we have to manage those kinds of risks. I understand that. I don't
understand how serving customers broadly and deeply, including helping them with a public offering whether it be debt
or equity, somehow makes us riskier or weaker or puts depositors at risk, more so than making a loan. So, but I
understand that the dialogue. You got to realize the capital that's been raised, the discipline around risk of all kinds is
far different than it was just a few years ago. I'm proud of this company and proud of what we do and I know that we
are helping this economy to recover, to heal and we'll do all we can to do that.

that they were not all behind us, but I assume that we won't go to zero on a lot of these. Some of these will be ongoing
costs when I'm looking at your page 13 on your slide deck. How much room should we really think about is left to go?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I don't know the exact answer to your question, Andrew. I think it's a fair question because, as
you point out, we've made a tremendous amount of progress over the last few quarters. I don't think – so if you just pick
two items for example, foreclosed asset expenses, which were $146 million in the second quarter. That doesn't feel to
me to be the run rate that we would settle in. Could it go up? It could go up or could go down, but I think over time
there still is some room for that to decline.
And then also, I think the contra revenue item that we had, which was the MSR servicing and foreclosure cost impact,
again the primary driver there is continued foreclosure timelines in certain judicial foreclosure states, primarily New
York and New Jersey. And over time that will, I think, begin – will continue to moderate. So, I think those in particular,
there's probably a little bit more room to run. But you're correct. The rate of increase is going to slow down.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. Okay. That's helpful, thanks. And then secondly, back to liquidity, just want a
clarification because you had mentioned in an earlier comment about how you may need to raise some additional
liquidity, is that related to the LCR or is that related to the consideration of other things in terms of the OLA additional
bail-in debt considerations that are out there? Because when we look at LCR, we have you guys in a pretty healthy
range of 120 to 140 depending on how you calculate it. So, I was just a little surprised by that comment.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, I think that's the – you hit the nail on the head with your last comment and that it's hard
to calculate the answers when you don't really know what all the variables are going to be. We think that we have more
than sufficient amount of liquidity to be able to operate Wells Fargo. We've been able to demonstrate that through some
pretty significant downturns. The rules might change a little bit. If that's the case, will we have to make some
adjustments to the balance sheet. If we do that, that's fine. We'll adjust to that.
But it's not – the onset of finalizing the Basel III LCR and any of the interpretation that might occur from our domestic
regulators is not impacting the way that we're running the business today, meaning that we're not – we don't have some
money set aside that we can't lend to our customers or we can't invest in securities because we're too concerned about
that. There's a lot of moving parts and, again, we will comply with whatever the final rules are. We'll do that in an
appropriate timeframe, but it's not a limiting factor for the company today.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. And what is the constraining factor when we should think about excess liquidity
and the ability to deploy more into securities or loans or what have you? What is it that ...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It is economic growth and the rate of loan growth. When we think about the recovery, as
we've talked about, we continue to be in a recovery that has had to adjust to a tremendous amount of headwinds and it's
been from our perspective remarkably resilient, but our loan growth would be a lot stronger if we were at a 3% GDP
level or a 4% GDP level, which is about what I think everybody expected a few years ago when we started to come out
of the downturn. It's primarily loan growth, less today in terms of investments, less today rates. That was a big limiting
factor for us a year ago and nine months ago and three months ago, for that matter. Less today for sure rates because
rates are more attractive today.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: [Question inaudible] (85:25)
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And the beauty I think is borrowing does start. I mean, those costs are already embedded. We
already have those approved. I mean that's just all revenue then.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful Thanks.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Betsy.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey, good morning. A couple of questions; one on page 26, you got the PCI accretable yield
slide and you indicated the weighted average life is 14.5 years there. So, that's up from last quarter where I think it was
12.3 or something like that. And I'm just wondering, what is behind driving that up?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: A couple of things. One is just that we have a general improvement in the underlying
portfolio and the delinquency in the portfolio has come down a little bit, so that the expectation according to the model
is that customers are going to stay in their homes longer. It could be, though, that you could reach a point where as, you
continue to see home values increasing, that it could reach a point where those customers may be more comfortable and
able to sell their homes or even to refinance and that would begin to bring the average life down. But I wouldn't read
into that change any big change in our assumptions or anything like that. It's very variable on a quarter to quarter basis.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. But you're basically saying credit quality is improving and that's why the weighted
average life is extending.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Do you have anything at all in there for prepays or it's not rate related all?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, we definitely do. I mean that's part of the – it's one of the important variables within the
model. But again, personally I think that prepays are going to accelerate over time as values continue to go up, but we
haven't seen that yet in the performance level, but I think logically it could occur.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then – and which would shorten duration and pull in the PCI a little bit faster?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Correct.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separately, HPI going up significantly in the most recent quarter, if this level
of housing value held for the rest of the year, how much is that going to be impacting your loan growth? And I know
this question has been asked a couple of different times, but I guess the real question is, do you feel that the current
value of housing price is in 2Q's numbers or is there more to come from the HPI improvements that we've seen this
quarter?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: We tend to use lagged assumptions and we tend to be a little bit more conservative. I mean,
we're not going to take, for example, the housing price, the 13% that John mentioned what we've seen year-over-year
and assume that's going to continue forever, right. And so you've got to be very careful with that. I think we've been
and I think the entire industry and the markets has been positively surprised at the level at which housing prices have –
how resilient they've been, how much they've grown and the percentage that they've grown. So, again I think that we've
seen some nice improvement and our expectation is that we're very positively leveraged to home prices. And so we
could see some improvement from the results that you see here in the second quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: I'm just thinking in particular about home equity, because that to me seems like the area
where you should have some of the sharpest swings as HPI has gone up so much recently over the next couple of
quarters, but I don't know if that's a fair assessment given...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Betsy, I think you're absolutely right in that – maybe using the word leverage is maybe even
more appropriate there when you think about the impact to a home equity portfolio, which the majority of our home
equity portfolios are junior liens, to the extent that you've got a portion of that that's above 100%, increasing home
values really, really impact that portfolio.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So, are you seeing much in the demand and the origination pipeline for that product yet, or is
it too early?

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I think our home equity originations were up year-over-year, but I don't think they were
necessarily up significantly from the first quarter. It's a good product. It's underwritten very well today. It's one of the
many products we provide. It's a slight up-tick, but it wasn't one of the drivers for the home equity or our loan growth
we would've called it out.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Good morning, John. How are you?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Tim, I had a quick question for you. I'm going to go all the way back to the first question of
the day, and I can't promise what Nancy promised; it will be a mortgage question. When you look at the servicing side
of the business and how it flows through the income statement, I mean, the servicing asset or the MSR has been written
up about $3 billion in the last couple of quarters and yet the servicing income is still kind of stuck in that $300 million
to $400 million range per quarter. So, in order for that natural hedge to fully take hold, if indeed we see a material, and
that's my assumption, but a material decrease in refinance activity, do you have to start lessening up on the hedge on
the MSR for that to flow through to the income statement more so than it has?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: If you wanted to create a natural hedge, you would have to reduce your hedge percentages,
and then when you're doing that you would potentially create a lot more interest rate risk – not potentially, you would
create a lot more interest rate risk for the company. And we just don't think that, that's a prudent thing to do. So, I think
historically, when the business was smaller than it is today, it might have been a little bit more – we might have more
flexibility to do that. That doesn't really make sense to us today. So, our hedge ratios are relatively high, which is one
of the reasons why you're not seeing a one-for-one offset. There will be some benefit. There's no question about that.
And I think one of the key benefits of the servicing portfolio over time is that the quality of what you're servicing
continues to increase because you continue to originate better quality mortgages and that are going to pay for a longer
period of time and you don't have as much foreclosure impact.
I think that in terms of comparing our servicing results over the next few quarters with what we've experienced in the
last few quarters, most of the reduction that you've seen, it has been related to foreclosure elongation and things like
that and we're hopeful that, that's going to dissipate. But I would not look for the MSR to dollar-for-dollar offset and
any reduction in revenues from the origination side of the business. There's some natural relation, but it's not
one-for-one.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: And then just one quick follow-up, I think John had mentioned or I think both of you
mentioned, potential MSR sales going forward, and I think, John, you had mentioned – I don't want to put words in
your mouth, but maybe, but maybe there'd be kind of one-off type portfolio similar to the reverse mortgage sale
recently. Would the Pick-a-Pay portfolio be included as a one-off potential sale, in terms of MSRs?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, that one we own. I mean, we own the asset there. So, we – I wouldn't look for that area
per se, and I don't want to give guidance here, but I think what you should take away from this is that we like the MSR
business, we think it's critical to – well, we not only like it because of the business itself, but because of the cross-sell
we do out of it, and that we will sell from time to time opportunistically. I think Tim mentioned that we might look at
something that has a single product household kind of dynamic here, but we're always looking in all of our businesses
is an opportunity here to monetize something that might be more valuable someone else to us; sure we'll look at that. I
won't look for a big change here.
