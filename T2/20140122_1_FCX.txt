press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.
On the call today, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and CEO
of FCX; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. And we have several other
members of our team here with us today.
I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call to Richard, who'll begin reviewing
information included in our slide presentation. As usual, after the formal remarks, we'll open the call for questions and
answers.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $707 million, $0.68 per share for the first quarter of
2013 – for the fourth quarter of 2013, and $2.7 billion, $2.64 per share for the year 2003 – 2013, excuse me, compared
with $743 million or $0.78 per share for fourth quarter 2012 and $3 billion or $3.19 per share, for the year 2012.
Our net income attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2003 – 2013, excuse me, included net charges of
$166 million or $0.16 per share, as detailed in the press release, which included $73 million or $0.07 per share, for
unrealized losses on oil and gas derivative contracts, and $49 million or $0.05 per share, associated with updated mine
plans at Morenci, that resulted in a loss in recoverable copper in leach stockpile.
FCX's fourth quarter results reflect strong operating performance in both the mine and oil and gas businesses as we
were – we'll be talking about. Our consolidated sales of over 1.1 billion pounds were 17% above last year's fourth
quarter, and reflected higher production throughout the global operations, and in particularly at Grasberg, where copper
sales were over 40% above last year's fourth quarter.
Oil and gas sales totaled 16.6 million barrels of oil equivalent, that was ahead of our forecast. Our average fourth
quarter, average recorded copper price at $3.31 per pound, was below the year ago quarterly average of $3.60 per
pound, and gold prices of $1,220 per ounce, were 27% below the year ago quarter. Oil prices were strong in the quarter
as Jim will be talking about, with Brent prices averaging $109 per barrel and average realizations by our oil and gas
division of $94 per barrel before hedging impact.
Operating cash flows of $2.3 billion in the quarter exceeded capital expenditures of $1.7 billion. We ended the year
with total debt of $20.7 billion, and our cash balance was approximately $2.0 billion. We have approximately 1.04
billion common shares currently outstanding.
I'd now turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to the slide materials on our website.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone and for all of you on the East Coast, we're thinking about you facing that storm up there, I
know it's difficult. You ought to pack up some shorts and swimsuits and golf clubs and come see us in Arizona, enjoy
this weather in the 70s.
Looking back on 2013, when we went into the year and as we consummated the oil and gas transactions at 1st of May,
you heard us talking about execution. And that is what was really the emphasis of our entire organization, was on
operational execution during the year. And the results have been strong. We had a 12% increase in copper sales, and we
had growing volumes in all four regions that we operate in. We had a positive and significant contribution from the oil
and gas business. Jim will be talking about that.
We executed on our plans to grow our volumes. We have three major projects that we had identified to increase our
copper sales over a three-year period by 1 billion pounds. And we've completed the second phase expansion at Tenke
and that operation has operated very well. The Morenci Mill expansion has progressed and nearing completion in 2014.
We have initiated construction at the major project at Cerro Verde in Peru and it's progressing on schedule. In addition,
the Grasberg Underground Development Activities move forward this year, despite the interruptions that we had during
the year, and we are preparing ourselves for the completion of the mining of the Grasberg pit. It's currently scheduled
to be completed in 2016.

In the oil and gas area, the Lucius development project is progressing towards production. The understanding of the
assets within the deepwater that PXP acquired during 2012 and now a part of our portfolio is progressing and we've got
exciting new growth opportunities there. And then, with the renamed ultra-deep play, we're calling the Inboard Lower
Tertiary/Cretaceous Opportunity, we've got some exciting news there about a well we're currently drilling, about what
that means for our company going forward.
We continue to be focused on cost savings and discipline in spending capital. We've got our targeted debt reduction
that remains in place. We're looking for ways to accelerate that. During the year, we had, including special dividend
and our regular dividend and about a 10% stock price increased during 2013, an attractive return to shareholders of
17%, paid $2.3 billion of common stock dividends including the special dividend.
Our financial results reflect this strong operating performance virtually across the board. Our volumes in our mining
business for copper were slightly above our guidance, well above the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
Realizations of just over $3.30 are below the fourth quarter of the prior year. But going into 2013, there was a lot of
skepticism about where copper prices would be and markets appear to be stronger going into 2014 than they did going
into 2013.
Our site cost for the fourth quarter for the company consolidated was $1.16 a pound, reflecting strong volumes of both
copper and gold in Indonesia. And that was well below our guidance and well below our recent historical performance.
There was really strong gold production at Grasberg. We had access to higher grades and it just showed what that mine
provides to us. Our oil volumes, sales volumes were in line with our guidance and the business performed very well.
I mentioned that today copper markets appear to be strengthening from where we were a year ago. During 2013, China
went through a government change, a reorientation of its economy towards internal consumption with less emphasis on
exports and infrastructure development, but major spending on infrastructure continues as evidenced by the recent
announcement by State Grid to increase its capital spending, and that has a major impact on copper consumption there,
but consumer demand remained strong. Infrastructure investment in China is a major part of this marketplace.
In the U.S., demand has steadily improved, particularly in key sectors like residential construction, where housing starts
are up. There's today's news about mortgage applications being up. We're seeing improvement in non-residential
construction and the automobile industry continues to be very strong, an important consumer of copper. As we talk to
our downstream customers, we're hearing positive comments about their performance in 2013 and a degree of
confidence about 2014.
In the copper business, we're seeing some recovery in Europe. The beginnings of it, worldwide the cathode market
remains very tight. Exchange stocks have dropped dramatically during the second half of 2013. Today, they're lower
than they've been in 15 months. And a lack of strike – of scrap is driving higher capital consumption and that is being
an important part of the marketplace.
So we're seeing relatively positive near-term fundamentals for copper in a world that has continuing economic
uncertainties. But longer-term fundamentals remain particularly strong because of constraints on supply globally and
the demand for copper throughout the world.
Turning to slide six, you can see our fourth quarter unit production cost that I referred to earlier. Across the board, we
were lower than our plans for the fourth quarter, driven by cost control efforts that Red Conger and his team are
applying in the Americas, our operation in Africa is performing well and then having the higher grades in Indonesia
where our unit cost, net of gold credits, dropped to $0.21 per pound, resulting in this $1.16 per pound. You can see how
our sales from North America, South America, Indonesia and Africa were distributed during the fourth quarter.
We are releasing our preliminary reserve information for our mining business. Proven and probable reserves of copper
at the end of 2013 were 111 billion pounds of copper, 31 million ounces of gold and 3 billion pounds of molybdenum.
Since the Phelps Dodge transaction, we have had very significant additions to reserves, 45 billion pounds of copper, for
example, and continue to have opportunities to add reserves because of our very large resource base and our ongoing
exploration program.

Our reserves are, as you can see, pretty well-distributed between the Americas and Indonesia and growing opportunity
in Africa. Beyond reserves on slide eight, we have – and the reserves are based on mine plans using a $2 copper price.
We have mineralized material of significance associated with our existing ore bodies. If looking at a copper price of
$2.20, you see well over 100 billion pounds of mineralized material not yet qualified as reserves, so it's incremental to
our reserves, half of that is in North America and our work goes on to see about moving the mineral resources into the
reserve category and ultimately into development projects to generate cash flows; huge asset for our company.
Our mines are distributed around the world, led by our flagship mine in Arizona at Morenci; the Cerro Verde project in
Southern Peru; El Abra and Candelaria in South America and Tenke Fungurume, Grasberg, but we have – in a world
with a very limited number of world-class mines, which we're looking at with over 1 billion pounds of copper per year,
we have the opportunity of having five mines within that group and that's what our goal is, is to reach that.
I want to give you a report on Indonesia. Indonesia, for years, has been focused on looking at increasing processing of
minerals within the country. In our 1991 contract award, which is the contract we're currently operating on, there was
provisions in that contract, which we committed to develop a copper smelter, arrange for the development of a copper
smelter within Indonesia under certain conditions.
And in response to that, we followed through, we arranged with Japanese investors to build Indonesia's first smelter. It's
the only copper smelter and refinery in the country. Mitsubishi operates it. PT Freeport Indonesia owns 25% of the
equity and we supply copper concentrates to it. But that smelter is operating in Gresik.
Indonesia also exports, in large volumes, mineral ores across the natural resource space that aren't processed in the
country. And that includes nickel, alumina and in 2010 in the country – in 2009, when it adopted a new mining law for
the five-year period on requiring that ores be processed within the country. Following the adoption of the law there
were a series of implementing regulations that moved forward and that export ban was ultimately extended to copper
concentrates. The deadline for the ban was January the 12th of this year.
Now, our contract of work which defines our rights and obligations and our relationships with the government has
specific language that gives PT-FI the right to export concentrates. It also defines the taxes and other fiscal terms
applicable to our operations and states explicitly that we're not subject to taxes, duties or fees that are subsequently
imposed or on proved by the government, except as provided by the contract.
As this deadline of January the 12th approached, we were actively involved in discussions with the government, as
were other miners. And the final regulation that was adopted by the government exempted from the export ban, copper
concentrates that contained at least 15% copper, which our concentrates will be well above 15% on our life of mine
plan.
At the same time – and the government provided that exemption from the export ban for three years. But in a new
regulation that we did not anticipate, that was a surprise to us, the Ministry of Finance or the Government imposed a
duty on exporting minerals including copper concentrates and there's a progressive duty that's now in place, as a
regulation of the Ministry of Finance, which starts at 25% in 2014 and grows to 60% by 2016. This is something that
thus conflict with our contract of work.
Now where we are today is we are engaged in discussions with representatives of the government to discuss how this
new export tax applies. The government is working on regulations, which have not been complete. So, there is a degree
of uncertainty on exactly what its intention are for implementing this tax. We, of course, look at our contract and are of
the view that it does not apply to us, but we are going to work with the government in a way to reach an agreement on
it, to understand their position, ensure they understand ours.
I'll just point out that we've been operating in Indonesia since the early 1970s. We've never had a violation by either
party of the contract and we're confident that we'll find a way to work for it that will represent the interest of our
shareholders and be responsive to the government. So, that's where we stand. This is new. It just came out the weekend
before last. The regulations are up in the air and so there's not specific clarity on this issue at this point.

Now with Grasberg, as we've been dealing with this and as we dealt with the tragedy of the training facility issue
earlier in the year and as we reached an agreement with our labor union this fall that avoided a strike that was so
disruptive to us in 2011 and 2012, we've really had a substantial increase in the productivity and performance metrics
in conjunction with also having available higher-grade ore to mine in process.
In the first half of 2013, for example, our mill operated at average 157,000 tons per day. In the fourth quarter, we were
over 200,000 tons per day. Grades have improved in both copper and gold and that translated into lower unit net cost.
And you can see how the performance improved over the year. And then, as we look forward between 2013 and 2016,
we expect, under normal operations, to complete mining the pit, we'll have increasing amounts of both copper and gold,
with an extraordinary year in 2016 during the final phases of operating in the pit.
Currently, we are adjusting our operations to continue in a full fashion, but focusing on maintenance activities and
mining material that constrains the level of copper concentrates we're currently producing as we have discussions with
the government for this export duty.
I mentioned that our brownfield development projects are progressing. The Tenke Fungurume project is complete.
Cerro Verde is going well. We started construction there. Our team, with our contractors, are working well. And at
Morenci, we're 60% complete at that project and we'll be starting up next year to add 225 million pounds of copper in a
very high rate of return project.
We're continuing with our exploration program. Spending will be somewhat less this year, and that's more of a nature
of just what our focus will be and what our plans are. Certainly, no less emphasis on exploration, but the slide on 13
shows where we'll be spending money. Our projects will be focused principally on brownfield opportunities and
focused on our existing mines. But we do have a couple of exciting greenfield projects that we will also be pursuing.
With that, I turn over the presentation to Jim Flores to talk about our oil and gas business.
James C. Flores
Thank you, Richard. Good morning, everyone. On page 14, you have a slide of the Brent curve from January 2003 to
present, as well as overlaid with the LLS curve, Louisiana Light Sweet curve. And the takeaway from this slide is that
90% of Freeport Copper & Gold oil and gas revenues are derived from this curve pricing of oil in the Brent and LLS.
And we'll tell you where this provide a tremendous margins for our business, somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel
depending on basis differentials and regional markers, and that's what's fueling our oil and gas development: the Gulf
of Mexico, the Eagle Ford and California and also our Lower Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary exploration play.
What you can see from January 2011 through January 2013 is that the range has been $125 per barrel to $100 per barrel
in there, so about $110 per barrel average. We've consistently maintained these prices in the world for various reasons.
I mean a lot of world demand is continuing to increase. The fourth quarter numbers I saw were well over 93 million
barrels of world demand. It's continued to expand with all the easy money policy. We've had supply disruptions out of
the MENA area, the Middle East and North Africa, and we've had production growth here in North America. So, there's
a lot of misconceptions.
The curve going forward always has a 20% discount. And going forward and backwardation, I think it has a lot to do
with liquidity issues versus real price discovery.
So we continue to maintain our budget process, between $100 a barrel and $105 a barrel Brent. And going forward,
based on the production struggles around the world to grow production, excepting in North America and also the aspect
of consumption demand expanding around the world on a consistent basis that we continue to see accelerating this
year, so we're very excited about our budget going forward based on the strong pricing background.
I will mention that about a third of our CapEx budget is discretionary and early in the year we can move a lot of things
around to affect spending if the prices go the other way or something happens where the price margin erodes.

So, we're in a situation of real flexibility. Obviously, that flexibility erodes during the year, but I want to make sure
everybody understands that that third of discretionary is real and something that we keep that flexibility very close at
hand.
When you move to page 15, you can see what I talked about for our fourth quarter 2013 cash operating margin of
almost $1 billion, $900 million, or $56 a barrel. That, compared with the third quarter margin of $64 a barrel. We have
slightly higher prices but the big thing we had in the fourth quarter that we didn't have to be – suffer with in the third
quarter was refineries all want to turn around at the same time in the fourth quarter and we have large basis widening of
about $10 a barrel, which affected our margins even though we had higher production.
So, that's all been reversed. If you look at those operating margins here in January, we're back where LLS is trading
right on top of Brent, and you can see that on page 14 right at the end of that graph where LLS and Brent diverge. And
now, with those two curves come together, we're looking at $60 per BOE margin going forward.
You see the contribution in the pie chart being 47% out of the Gulf of Mexico; 30% out of the Eagle Ford; and 21% out
of California; and Haynesville, a gas asset, is about 2%. We've got a significant upside in all these areas and we'll take
you through the details on this adjacent slide.
The quarterly oil and gas operating summary. The operating margins on a per property basis: California, $54 a barrel;
Eagle Ford $63; the gas assets in Haynesville/Madden, about $9.50; and the Gulf of Mexico asset, $63.83./$55.95.
this puts us in the best-in-class group of operating margin. I think this is what separates oil and gas businesses from best
to worst, is what the operating margin, how much cash will they actually generating per barrel sold. And when you
have a heavy-natural-gas-oriented business with the low prices, these margins are much less. And obviously, with the
90% of our revenues coming for ore, we're in the preferred area of the highest margins in our group.
You see our sales by region very balanced, very consistent with the third quarter, in California, Eagle Ford, Haynesville
and the Gulf of Mexico.
Moving to slide 17, we've now start preliminary SEC proved reserves of 464 million barrels as of 12/31/13. By
category, very consistent with the last year: 34% PUDs, 53% PDPs and 13% PDNPs. And if you split it by region, with
Gulf of Mexico 37%, you see California with its large resource base being 40%, Eagle Ford 13%, and Haynesville and
others 10%. And then by commodity ratio, it's 6:1, which is the old BTU conversion ratio. It's not the pricing ratio, the
27:1 or whatever it is now. It's 75% oil, and 20% gas and 5% NGLs.
I will mention here, there's a couple of notable exceptions to our proved reserve base. Our Phobos discovery that we
made in the first quarter has not been a delineated offset, so it does not meet the proved reserve test on the
[indiscernible] (28:46) cost structure south of Lucius and Keathley Canyon. And also, this Highlander area, the
Lomond North well that we're going to discuss here in a little bit, is also not involved in our SEC PV-10 year-end 2013
reserves.
Those were the only two significant exploration wells that the oil and gas business conducted this year for our proved
reserve category of adding reserves. That will change here in 2014, with our exploration will expand in the deepwater
with the arrival of drill ships and our business will be more normalized as far as having reserves as we drill production
[indiscernible] (29:25).
Our Lucius development project is one of those areas where, as we continue to get closer to production, we're able to
add reserve to it. We've delineated the Pliocene reservoir and have more to do in the deeper Miocene reservoir.
Lucius is on schedule. We've had some pipeline delivery issues that our operator, Anadarko, has done a masterful job
of overcoming to keep it on schedule. It costs a little more money but on top of that, its surrounding area, when we put
on the 80,000 barrels a day and the 450 million cubic feet of gas that the facility is going to process, hopefully here
they're still processing in the third quarter of this year. So fingers crossed on that, but the project continues to move
along just as planned.

And our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico update, a couple of key things here, takeaways that are going to be impactful to a
couple of slides further on about annual production. We recently bought these facilities, Holstein, Marlin and Horn
Mountain, where – to have major development projects to achieve the production rates in development projects.
We have to do platform modification on each one. That's a 60 to 90 day shut-in for each different facility. In 2014,
Marlin is going to be shut-in in the third quarter. And 2015, Horn Mountain and Holstein will be shut-in. And when
you shut-in 30,000 barrels a day for 90 days, it does affect your annual production rate and so forth. But maintain that
2014 and 2015, even though we're growing, even though we're expanding our production base as a company, it's being
muted by those shut-ins; 2014 with Marlin and 2015 with Holstein and Horn Mountain.
Everything we're finding there geologically, all the new seismic we've shot and all the new imaging, we're finding
heavily resource-laden opportunities on our lease block and so forth. And the first area of development obviously is
Holstein, where we have a platform rig, getting ready to drill our first in-field sidetrack well to start maximizing our
production there. Our guys have done a fantastic job of maintaining high production rates without any drilling activity
or well intervention activity at Holstein, Marlin and Horn Mountain.
On the exploration front, like I said, we have an exciting year coming up, not only potentially Phobos delineation, but
our Tara prospect, which is a Lucius look-alike, of 300 million barrels to 500 million barrels in the Keathley Canyon
area that we plan on drilling, with one of our initial drill ships showing up. And probably we'll spud that well sometime
in the second quarter and our Copper project sometime in the third quarter, which you see right above Holstein.
And the Copper project is a project and an exploration opportunity. We think it's excellent as far as the productivity.
We think it's imaged very well, the seismic, and that is a pure product of our new imaging and showing the real
productivity that was being masked by the old data.
So, a very active year. But it's going to ramp up from here in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and is reflected in the production
rate of 2016, when we start really hitting on all cylinders.
On page 20, let's talk about Inboard Lower Tertiary, which is formerly the ultra-deep. We want to give it a geologic
nomenclature, a name, because – so it'll fit in with the rest of our projects. Our Lomond North well, and you can see it
really in the middle of that circle, is the northern-most well that we've drilled so far in search of a good reservoirs here
in the Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous activities.
Year-to-date, we found large structures and we found large sands and so forth, but we've got challenging reservoir
quality for the sands; porosities and permeabilities and those things have been on the challenging side.
Still dealing with a lot of pressure, so we're in the process of overcoming those and seeing completions of the Davy
Jones and of the Blackbeard Area and Lineham Creek later this year or early next year.
But Lomond is the first well that we drilled where we see excellent reservoir characteristics, consistent with porosities
in the 20% range that are more aligned with what we see in Miocene-type reservoirs and Pliocene-type reservoirs that
have excellent flow cap capabilities and excellent production rates.
It also is very correlative to the [ph] Porf Hutchin trend (34:03) 50 miles from the north, north of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. So, we're 50 miles away to the south. And on the northern edge of our area, we found over 150 feet of pay.
We're still in pay and still drilling operational well. We have another 1,000 feet to go to get down to TD in the
Cretaceous. And we're very excited about finally finding a reservoir that the log indications and our core indications
meets the criteria of a – should be a spectacularly commercial well.
We are moving at light speed to get this line of production equipment to test this well sometime this summer. We're
actually going to harvest some equipment from our offshore operations and we've got all that in place. We've got
56,000 acres on the structure at Lomond. It's a very large structure. It's going to – have a large reserve potential. And
we drilled kind of a mid-deep well, so there's a lot of up-dip anchorage to this well as we pile up these sands in the
Cretaceous and also the Wilcox.

We have in the production tests Davy Jones #2, Lomond North and Blackbeard #2 here this year, and we got a large,
extensive inventory of high-quality prospects. You will continue to hear more and more climaxing with the production
tests at Lomond the rest of this year, developing a low-cost source of natural gas with a lot of liquids. So on margin
basis, we're thinking this is somewhere between $20 a barrel to $30 a barrel margin, significantly higher than what we
have in the Haynesville and the Madden area, so can be competitive with some oil projects on return.
So, more on that on Q&A. Richard, I'm going to turn it back over to you to finish summarizing our activities.
Richard C. Adkerson
All right. Thanks, Jim. I'm going to talk about sales outlook and I want to point out that this is our plan with our
Indonesian operations operating in a normal fashion. We're currently working through this process of getting export
permits and so forth. And as we go forward with that, if there are revisions to this, we'll update you. But this is based
on a scenario of normal operations.
Our current sales outlook is consistent with our prior outlook of 4.4 billion pounds of copper, 1.7 million ounces of
gold and 95 million pounds of molybdenum. We've increased our outlook for oil equivalents from 57 million barrels
equivalents to 60.7 million barrels equivalents.
At $3.25 per pound copper, this plan would generate in 2014 $9 billion of operating cash flows including working
capital changes. We remain highly leveraged to the price of copper; a $0.10 per pound change in copper in 2014 means
$370 million to us.
Our unit cost, which reflects some grade-driven lower volumes in the first quarter of 2014, is a $1.45 a pound and $20 a
barrel equivalents for oil, as Jim just talked about. The current outlook for capital expenditures is $7.1 billion, with just
over $4 billion for mining and $3 billion for oil and gas.
We are looking on page 22, where we have our quarterly sales outlook – or this is the annual sales outlook. You can
see, going from 4.1 billion pounds to 4.4 billion pounds copper, and then moving up as we complete our development
projects to 5 billion pounds in 2015 and 5.7 billion pounds in 2016, where we have the benefit of the expansion projects
plus the extraordinary year in Indonesia as we near the ending of the mining of the pit.
You can see that in gold, with 3 million ounces of gold to our interest. That's net of the Rio Tinto participation in the
joint venture in that year. And you can see the annual oil and gas sales on equivalent basis. And as Jim said, that is net
of these maintenance tie-in – shut-ins of the deepwater rigs in 2014 and 2015. But by 2016, we would be at an average
of, like, over 220 a day there. And that, with these kind of margins, generates very substantial cash flow.
On a quarterly basis, as I mentioned, on page 23, we will be having lower copper sales in first quarter because of grades
in the Indonesia for mine planning purposes and also in South America, principally at Candelaria. And you can see our
quarterly outlook for all of our commodities in the third quarter. It's when the Marlin shutdown occurs, and that shows
the lower oil and gas equivalent production [indiscernible] (39:20).
Page 24 shows our minerals sales by region, and it shows increases in North America, which reflects the Morenci
start-up of its expansion project; South America affected by some lower grades both at Candelaria and Cerro Verde.
That's just mine sequencing issues. And then, Grasberg in Africa.
Unit production costs are shown on page 25. And in 2014, you can see the continued strong performance affected by
volumes across-the-board, but current plans for consolidated net unit costs net of by-product credits is $1.45.
Page 26 is the models we present each quarter. This is updated to show an average of 2015 and 2016 cash flow and
EBITDA generation, and that's in the solid section showing it in comparison with our outlook for 2014. You can see,
for example, at $3.50 per pound copper, we would be just under $9 billion here in 2014 but the average for the next two
years would be over $12 billion. So that shows just the effects of our growing volumes and the strong margins in our
business, and you can see how that would fluctuate between $3 per pound and $4 per pound.

On the following slide, we have our sensitivities to prices and also to certain costs, energy cost and currencies, for
services in conducting your analysis.
Our updated capital expenditure slide is shown on slide 28. We've talked about the $7 billion for 2014, and you can see
how the outlook is for 2015 and the new information that we're presenting for the first time in 2016. Jim made a point
about our oil and gas capital spending. This is the opportunities that we have today given current market conditions.
There is a lot of flexibility as to how we manage that if market conditions change. Certain expenditures are
discretionary. We also have the ability of bringing in partners, joint ventures and so forth to deal with that.
So we're going to manage, as we've indicated over this past year, the oil and gas spending to be consistent with the cash
flows generated by that business. The spending today reflects opportunities to increase volumes to pursue some new
prospects that we've identified and take advantage of the resources that we have available to us.
We are committed firmly to a strong balance sheet management. We've targeted reducing debt to a level of
approximately $12 billion to 2016, running our business with a continuation of current commodity prices and doing
nothing else would get us close to that. And our objective is going to be to manage our business safely, but to achieve
the volumes and cost targets that we have. We anticipate continuing the current common stock dividend $1.25 quarter a
share.
And so, this debt reduction target is clearly within our reach, considering our large resource base and having discipline
in about the way we run our business and spend our capital.
We are continuing to review divestitures and other options that are available to us through joint ventures and potentially
involving MLP structures. And that work is ongoing. We don't really have anything specific to report to you today on it
other than the fact we're all working very hard to do it, and we're all committed to getting this debt to the level that we
targeted and that remains the firm focus of our entire organization.
So here we are at Freeport, maximizing shareholders' return; a strong execution and management, as we got a great
track record of doing – focusing on shareholder returns and grow in a disciplined way to provide value for our
shareholders; protecting our dividend – protecting our balance sheet and paying our shareholders good dividends.
That's a story that we've been operating under for years and that's what we continue to be focused on as we go forward.
We appreciate your attention. And now, we'll be available for questions that you might have.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Good morning, Richard, Kathleen, Jim and Jim. I just wanted to dig deeper on this
Indonesian tax situation. Could you quantify what exact export tax rate you're paying currently? What the incremental
change would be assuming that this law is effected on Grasberg, either in sort of the gross dollar amount of in cents per
pound? And then, could you comment about your drive to continue with the underground CapEx? What would be the
point of proceeding with that if in the future you're going to be facing this progressively higher tax rate?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's okay – okay. Thank you, Jorge. We pay no export duties on copper concentrate
shipments currently and we've never had that as part of our operations. So, this is a new duty that's in there now.
We pay a 35% income tax, which our contract provides for. Since the contract was signed, income tax rates have
dropped in Indonesia and other companies currently pay 25%. We have a 10% withholding tax on distributions from
PTFI to FCX. There's payroll taxes. There's royalties under the contract. And there's other types of payments.

Overall, we have historically been one of Indonesia's largest income tax payers; in many years the years the largest. We
would estimate that we paid $15 billion in income taxes, royalties and other taxes to the government over the life of the
contract. And under the contract, we'll be paying very large amounts going forward. So, we are a major financial tax
payer and contributor to the government of Indonesia but not in the form of export duties on copper concentrate
exports.
The announcement and regulations that have been adopted today talk about a progressive royalty starting at 25% going
to 60% in steps through the middle part of 2016. And then, it talks about beyond that, there'll be a ban on exports.
We don't know exactly how that would be applied because the regulations to implement it have not been completed and
we're waiting to see that. But if you were to apply those rates to the gross value of our concentrate exports, it's a very
large amount that would be incremental to the very large payments we're already making to the government. And that
is what we're engaged in discussions on, with the fact that it's inconsistent with our contract of work and that the
amounts would result in a very large amount going to government. So, those are what we've got to deal with.
On underground development, based on our confidence that is supported by our track record of operating there over
many years and dealing in a country that's going through a tremendous social, political changes and economic changes,
we accomplished we're going to work this out. So, we're continuing with our underground development program – in
fact, had a good year with that, 2013 – because it's important so that we can make this transition from mining in the pit
to mining underground.
That underground development is a extraordinarily attractive development opportunity for our company. When you
stack it up against other projects around the world, given the high volumes that we can mine underground, we're
looking at underground mines providing 240,000 tons a day of ore to the mill which is just extraordinary, at a very low
cost, at cost levels based on today's cost that would be comparable to open pit mining.
It's just really important to us. And with our confidence of being able to work with the government to resolve this
matter, we're continuing with our development plans underground.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Thanks. And if I could just clarify. So what's being talked about is this – let's say, rough
numbers you do $3.3 billion of copper revenue in Indonesia in 2014, the part that's not processed locally, call it,
roughly half would be about one-sixth of $1 billion of revenue and then you would pay roughly a 25% export duty.
That's what they're asking for on the copper con, and also there'll be similar amounts on the gold as well?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, okay. First of all, we are currently processing about 40% of our output from the
Grasberg operations of PT-FI at the Indonesian smelter at Gresik. So that 40% will not be subject to any – the export
duty applied to international sales of copper concentrate so would be 60%. We sell concentrate that has both copper and
gold in it. So we don't sell copper concentrate and gold concentrate separately. And what we are waiting to see is how
these regulations would work and then how we can reach an understanding with the Indonesian Government about how
to reconcile this regulation with our contract of work and what's the basis for us to go forward.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Thanks. Speaking of the Indonesia topic, obviously, we know, picture's any indication,
negotiations can take a long time. So I have two questions. My first question is in the immediate term, the very near
term. How long will Freeport be willing to go in terms of timing without implementing more significant changes at the
mine? I think you mentioned that you're using workers to, I guess, stripping and maintenance, et cetera. How long will
that last before perhaps more significant changes at the mine? That's my first question.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, Dave, well, it's a good question. The practical issue we face is there's limited
amount of opportunities to produce copper concentrate and store it just because of the nature of the product and where

we are. We're looking at alternatives for that. We're adjusting mine plans to reduce concentrate production as we
continue to mine. We're looking at the plans of how to arrange shipments to the smelter at Gresik. We're looking at
alternative storage opportunities.
But as we go forward, we would want to focus operations on continuing to produce from the block cave at DOZ,
because the nature of block cave mining is not something that you can interrupt and preserve the operation. So we will
progressively be looking at ways of continuing to produce through the mill, first from the block cave supplemented by
the pit to shift to Gresik. We will maximize storage opportunities. And then if we're not successful in getting this done,
we would be forced to scale back operations in the pit and suspend operations now.
Look, we're positive about getting this resolved and that's what we're going to work to do. We believe it's in everyone's
interest to do it, and so that's the kind of communications we're having with the government. We've had a long history
of really – it's been a successful foreign investment for our shareholders, but also for Indonesia and that's what we're
going to try to build on to resolve this issue.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Thanks. And then, my follow-up, which is related in sort of the medium term. If there is
no agreement resolution, what is Freeport's next medium-term steps and what is the preference here? Presumably, there
would be a consideration given for the smelter and, if so, could you also when you answer this question, give us a sense
of the capital costs associated with building a smelter and things like that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We built this smelter in the mid-1990s. It was on the order of – and it's a world-class
smelter, 300,000 tons of metal, one of the most efficient smelters in the world. At that time, its cost was in the order of
$750 million. Since that time, the replacement cost for that smelter – we've had some third party experts analyzing this
in conjunction with working with the government. The cost of building that's roughly tripled, and since the Gresik
smelter was built.
At the same time, TCs and RCs haven't risen, the processing fees that smelters receive because of market dynamics.
The expansion of smelter capacity in Asia, principally in China and how that capacity stacks up with available
concentrates on a global basis. So you've got a situation where smelter construction costs have tripled and processing
fees are in the range of where they were back in the mid-1990s. And so that makes the economics of building new
smelters a challenge and that's what we've got to talk with the government about.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. And that's helpful on the smelter cost, very helpful. And just in terms of the first part of
that question, so what are Freeport's next steps? So what should we expect to hear from Freeport? Assuming that there
is no agreement reached, what would Freeport do next?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I don't want to speculate because I think we're going to reach an agreement. And,
obviously, as we have these discussions and particularly given the circumstances within Indonesia, with the upcoming
elections and so forth, for us to speculate publicly would just be inappropriate right now.
So we're going to keep the market informed. We're going to work as we've always done in a positive way. We're
engaged everyday and we're going to work to find a solution to this and, Dave, I know you've got to think through
those scenarios. But I think you can appreciate from our standpoint it's just not appropriate for us to try to speculate on
those sorts of negative outcomes.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Understood. Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Thank you.

<A - James C. Flores>: Hi, Sal.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Hi, sorry, good morning. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on Indonesia. First is, you have
increased your CapEx to $900 million a year from $800 million. That's about $500 million more for the next five years.
Just wondering if there is anything different you're doing or it's just a cost or escalation cost of...?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: A lot of that's just rounding. This is a project which is dynamic, and we make
adjustments as we go along. We do everything we can do to save capital. Some of it is things like labor escalation and
things of those natures, but there's nothing fundamentally changed about it.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Okay. And Richard, knowing what we know from your contract of work and derived audit, it
appears that it does protect you from any kind of changes in the mining law until at least 2021. I was wondering, would
you be willing to take it to a international arbitration court if government forces the new law on you?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, let me make two comments about your questions, Sal. While the primary term of
this contract does end in 2021, the contract itself provides for two 10-year extensions. And we report reserves through
2041 on the basis of that contract provision and the extensions are provided for an extension on the terms of the
original contract.
Now, I think most of you know that for over two years now, we've engaged with the government, as they've reviewed
contracts and as they compare this contract to the 2009 mining law. And we've indicated a willingness to sit down with
the government and talk about some revisions that would be responsive to certain of the government's aspirations in a
way that would protect the value of our shareholders. So that's the process that we've been going through.
The contract does provide that we do have the rights for international arbitration and that is a protection that we
consider to be important for our contract. We have a strong desire not to go to international arbitration and that's a
feature that's available to us. But it's not something that we see as an attractive course of action for this. The much more
attractive course of action we'd be able to find a mutually agreeable resolution to it with the government.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Thanks, Sal.

<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Not to keep on harping on this Indonesian issue but do you suspect that people who
are making these proclamations are fully aware of the details of your contract of work when they come out with these
statements?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Mike, Indonesia has changed so much. From the transition from the government in 1998
to the evolution of the country to be a free and open democracy with a free press and so forth. So like here and other
places in the world, there are people I know who are commenting on this who aren't familiar with the full facts of the
situation. There are also people who make comments for political purposes and that happens everywhere. So the point
is we will engage in serious discussions with people and press articles will be what press articles are and you have to
read that with a understanding of the nature of the situation.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: And the Indonesian presidential election is in July this year?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, no. There's initially a parliamentary election that occurs in the spring and the
presidential election does – initial rounds of the presidential election is scheduled for midsummer to July timeframe.
And then, if that doesn't decide the president, there would be a subsequent runoff election that would be later in the
early fall.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: I see. Last question on this, sir.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And the current President Yudhoyono is not eligible to run because of term limit.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Got it. In terms of the 2021 and 2031 and your extensions that you have -I
understand it's the same contract basically, but would an early announcement on the 2021 extension be basically the
only reason why you would give any changes, any financial or operating changes now in your contracts?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, it would only be...
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: [ph] About early concessions. (01:02:58)
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It would only be in connection with having a successful completion of the contract
review process and getting an extension to our contract. So, like we've done in other places and in Indonesia over the
years, as we listen to these things we thought and we had some productive discussions about how could we get a
resolution of this process – get the contract review behind us, get our extensions, end up having some concessions that
we would make from the contract that the government could feel that they had achieved something of importance in
representing the government and the people and we could have a way of successfully having a mutually agreeable
outcome to this, but it would be in the context of getting all this behind us.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Maybe a couple of comments. This is Jim Bob. And, Mike, to you and those that are talking
about these negotiations with the government, as Richard said, we got a democratic country. You got a Parliament, you
got ministers, you got the President. Now this is an announcement we just made, and when I read things that say we
could be subject to billions in taxes, we're not going to sit here and pay billions in taxes when the solution is working
out some deal that would involve a smelter.
What Richard's saying and what we're all thinking that we just have to look at the most practical. And when you talk
about why we're taking the 2021 to 2031, 2031 to 2041. The reason why that came up is because we'd be spending $15
billion underground and no sense paying $15 billion underground without planning for the years that we have to have
production there – pay the shareholders back.
But just look at it this way. Right now, the Parliament but just because this announcement was just proclamated on
Monday – they don't have any regulations there, they understand the deal about like our Congress understood Obama's
healthcare. There's a lot of questions being answered. When people see these pieces of paper that they haven't even read
yet because this was just announced on Monday. So that's why we're trying to just be patient here and let everybody
have a chance to read the darned thing.

Now, the people make stupid decisions. Our colleagues wouldn't shut down the United States government during that
time. They wouldn't dare do that, would they? Ho ho ho. So, just be patient with this. I've been over there since 1984
and getting the first contract to work in 1991, there were lots of times when you just had to sit and wait for people to
have a chance to understand thing.
So, there's a resolution here and we'll get there. We got the best copper mine in the world, one of the largest mines in

Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Hi. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I think, Jim, first of all, I just want to
congratulate you guys on meeting your objectives of strong execution in your operations. First question is changing the
subject a bit but then coming back to Indonesia on the second one. Your oil and gas expectations for 2014 and 2015
increased from your previous guidance given in the last quarter, as well as the expectation for capital expenditures. Can
you just provide more color as to where are these increases coming from?
<A - James C. Flores>: Oscar, this is Jim. Good morning. One of the main increases – there's two components to the
increases in production. Number one, we retained the Gulf of Mexico assets. We did not sell them because of some
productive events that happened there. We accelerated some of the behind pipe reserves; or are in the process of doing
that in conjunction with Chevron's operations. So the present value changed dramatically and we're going to enjoy
those production, so that's number one.
And number two, as we're scheduling work to be done in the Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater's long lead times, long lead
time projects, we're finding more efficient ways to do things. We're finding ways to look at the facilities from a
standpoint of what's best over the long term and the most reserves. For instance, in our Horn Mountain facility instead
of us drilling wells on the facility and interrupting production and actually having a lower production volume in 2015.
We're doing subsea only into Horn Mountain versus the combination of dry trees with the rig on the Horn Mountain
structure and subsea, therefore, have minimal supply interruption of existing production. At the same point in time,
we'll go ahead and get all of the high potential subsea tiebacks.
Yes, that costs more money initially, but the returns are higher and the production consistency and growth from the
business point of view is more consistent. So I would characterize it as the Gulf of Mexico [indiscernible] (01:09:32)
and fine-tuning our Gulf of Mexico model from a standpoint. And as I said, about a third of this CapEx is discretionary
or timing of those types of things. So if we ended up with, say, a $20 erosion in oil prices, we can make a lot of
adjustments here over a single year period, but for sure , over a two-year period to rein things in and we're committed
to – we've got a great margin business. We're committed to fine-tuning that and while prices are high and demand
worldwide is continuing to accelerate, we think it's a good opportunity for us to be aggressive with our development
plans for our planning purpose, but we are positioned to always have the flexibility to change that at the market shows
us that.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay, thanks, Jim. That's very helpful. Now if I may just going back to Indonesia. Richard, the
existing operations include a smelter refinery for copper, but not refinery for gold. As I understand the slime that comes
out of the smelter gets shipped out to be processed elsewhere. Would the progressive tax be applicable if it, in fact, is
applicable to all of the gold shipped from Grasberg? And then, in your three times the replacement cost for the smelter,
are you including a gold refinery in that amount?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Let me just make sure the rest of the people on the call understand. Thanks for
your comment about our operations, Oscar. The PT-FI is our other operations that produce concentrates, sells the

concentrate to PT Smelting, which is a jointly owned company in which PT-FI has a 25% interest. That concentrate
includes copper, gold and silver. The PT Smelting's smelter and refinery produces copper cathode from that
concentrate, which is the basic product of pure copper that then goes to fabricators to produce wire and other copper
products.
There is a residual slime – it's called slime – that has the gold and silver in it. And currently there is not a processing
facility in Indonesia to process that and that's since the construction of the PT Smelting facility has been shipped to
Japan for further processing. We are still waiting to see how these regulations come out. But our expectation is that
that's slime will be able to continue to be shipped without export duty at least for the next three years.
So we don't think that that's going to be a restriction on PT Smelting's operations. The feasibility study that we're
working with would include a slime processing facility. So when we're looking at the cost of a project that would be $2
billion, $2.5 billion plus working capital, that would include a facility to process the slimes and recover the copper and
gold in Indonesia.

Your next question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Hi, good morning. Richard, I was wondering if you could just talk about how you're arriving
at the 40 million pounds per month for the copper full. Is that based on the tonnage associated with the export licenses
that you haven't been able to obtain or that'd been delayed?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. It just reflects what our mine plan shows and then we wanted to give – since we're
giving the disclosures on a basis of not having any impact of this situation or our operations, we wanted to give you
some sense of what we're talking about. So what we're looking at is based on our mine plans and a plan of continuing to
ship to PT Smelting. This with what would be effected for international shipments out of PT-FI.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. And then the second question is looking at your free cash flow guidance for the share
after dividends, it's about roughly breakeven. In terms of hitting your net debt target of $12 billion by 2016, it seems
like some form of asset sales will be needed. Can you just comment on how active the company is at pursuing various
asset sales or potential MLP to ensure you hit that target?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Curt, from the start, we've seen the situation because of the capital we're spending
at Cerro Verde and other places that this cash flow from our normal operations was going to hit us in 2016. That's
mining business adds, oil and gas adds, considering the platform shut-ins and all of these projects ramping up. So 2016
and the very favorable operations in Indonesia in 2016, all that adds up to 2016 being a hell of a year.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And so that's through our normal operations where we could reach it. Now, beyond that,
as I mentioned, our board's challenges – we're challenging ourselves to find ways of advancing that and we're working
very actively on the possibility of asset sales, potential joint venture arrangements, potential transaction involving the
MLP market in some way. So all those things are working and we're really focused on trying to advance the time when
we get the targeted debt level reached.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: So we understand and that's been the facts, just about the flow of capital and so forth.
About 2014, 2015, the cash flows are going to fund these projects to generate some volumes. Not only 2016 but those
volumes go forward way beyond 2016 and then we have additional growth opportunities in those – really in those postCompany

2016 years is when the oil and gas growth really kicks in, the capital that Jim was talking about, having the opportunity
to spend that enhances that. And then we're looking for the next round of expansion projects in the mining business.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions. Jim Flores, can you just clarify what you said
about the Lower Tertiary Cretaceous play? I think you mentioned there you experienced some challenging reservoir
quality. On which projects did you experience the challenging reservoirs? And then you also mentioned excellent
reservoir quality. I think you were talking about the one you're drilling, Lomond North. Just clarify that please.
<A - James C. Flores>: No, Joe, just kind of for our Lomond North well, Highlander, as the excellent comparable
rocks through traditional South Louisiana production at any depth, to find it at 28,000 feet, 29,000 feet under this
pressure's truly spectacular. And so, we're holding all hurrahs and so forth toward a production test this summer, and
we'll show you what 20% of rocks can do.
The other reservoirs that we found today have less porosity, but they also have the higher pressures that I talked about,
and they're going to be more challenging to produce. We've been very forthright with all the investors and so forth
saying, we're trying to get to the core of this play. But the exploratory drill bit, we have eight points of control now.
And the latest well, this Lomond well is by far the best reservoir that we've found to date. And that trend, I expect to
continue now that we know what to look for and what to find, but Lomond by itself will support the entire deep
expectations of the play than what we see right now and also be a spectacular return for our Royalty Trust investors as
well.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: So, Jim, are you less optimistic about Davy Jones and Blackbeard West than you were before
based on reservoir quality?
<A - James C. Flores>: There's no optimism here; it's nothing but realism, Joe, and it's going to be, what it's going to
be from a standpoint. But I'm just giving the comparison toward what we found and how we're improving the
operations and this is what our shareholders pay us for is to make sure that we're always improving and moving the
needle toward higher quality margins, higher quality reservoirs and this has been a quantum leap in this Lower Tertiary
Cretaceous play that I think we'll be very surprised with the people as it unfolds with all the data in the production test
this summer.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Okay, great. And then, Jim, you also mentioned $20 to $30 per barrel cash margin. So were
you specifically referring to Lomond North and Highlander? And could you give me just a quick calculation on that?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, you can back into it from a gas standpoint and gas condensate, but if you're talking
about 20 barrels per million, that'll get you pretty close and we've talked about all of those prices at the volume we're
talking about. You can get some pretty nice margins there. It's kind of traditional gas condensate margins you're seeing
in the Permian sand and the Central Oklahoma area and also North Louisiana, when you're talking about condensate
rich plays. But you're talking high 50-plus million a day wells, you're talking about high volumes and great returns for
our shareholders.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: Right. And then just give us the update on the Gulf of Mexico asset sale.
<A - James C. Flores>: We've postponed it indefinitely because of the acceleration of a lot of the recompletions
behind pipe reserves. At this point in time, we're going to keep it going forward.
<Q - Joseph Allman>: All right. Thank you very much.
<A - James C. Flores>: Sure. Thanks.

Your next question will come from the line of Adam Duarte with Omega.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Good morning, guys. Two questions. One is, what are the next steps for Lineham Creek? And
secondly, given your heavy completion schedule on the second half of this year on the ultra-deep stuff, when do you
see first distributions to the royalty trust units? Thanks.
<A - James C. Flores>: On Lineham Creek, Adam, Chevron is the operator and we are – Chevron is the developing its
completion plan and will be coming out with AFEs and so forth. I would expect Lineham Creek because of Chevron –
this is the first well of this depth that Chevron's completed in this trend, taking their time and so forth, it may be first
half of 2015 before we get a completion at Lineham Creek.
That's why the Lomond North, the Davy Jones 2, the Blackbeard West completions this year will be more significant to
the distribution of the royalty trust and we think we'll be able to make distributions within four months to six months of
commercial production.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hey, Joan?
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Hello. Can you hear me?
<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah, Joan. We can hear you. Go ahead.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Okay. I'm on a plane about to take off from Kennedy. So, I'll ask my questions as long as I can.
So, as far as Davy 2, can we get more color, I may have missed some going through security, but I don't – I doubt it.
And what is your timetable for Ship Shoal 188 and the implications that would have for Treasure Island?
<A - James C. Flores>: We're in the process of completing Davy Jones 2 right now and the West Blackbeard one you
referenced would be the subsequent operation on the completion for that. Assuming the Davy Jones operation goes as
planned, we should be completed with Davy Jones in the second quarter, we'll be moving on to the West Blackbeard
completion, which would be a third quarter completion there.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Okay. Can you give us more color on what exactly you're doing, why you think this is going to
be different than Davy 1? I know Davy wasn't complete – wasn't cased all the way to the bottom, which it now is, et
cetera, et cetera. So, would you give us more information please than that?
<A - James C. Flores>: Right. It's hard to give you more information on what we're doing differently. We have the
reservoir performs differently and the relationship between the drilling fluids and the reservoir don't become the
impediment that we think happened to Davy Jones 1, as well as we're operating in a much better environment with
twice the hole size and more standardized equipment. Joan, we've drilled a lot of wells here since we drilled Davy
Jones 1. We've learned a lot of things that work, and some things we still don't know.
The one thing on the Davy Jones 2, it was the deepest well stratigraphically we drilled to date, and that was before we
had the sophisticated logging tools. We don't have as much diagnostic information as we'd like, like here on the
Lomond well, on cores and logs and so forth. But drilling the Lomond well, and having a lot of core sands in the

there's no guarantees or expectations or change other than we're going to try as hard as we can.

<A - James C. Flores>: If everything goes to plan, that's correct. It's all subject to change in weather and operational
challenges.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Okay. Now, as far as what you know so far from Lomond North, do you plan to be buying
more, being active again in the [ph] next three-sales (01:24:33) or have you got everything on your plate that you want?
<A - James C. Flores>: We would never comment on that, Joan, that's obviously a strategic reason and so forth of
what we're going to do or not do. We're going to react appropriately to create value for you as our shareholder and
everyone else and we have a tremendous acreage spread here at Lomond, got a lot of drilling to do and a fantastic
reservoir. So it's going to get a lot of attention here early on.
<Q - Joan E. Lappin>: Okay. And would it be fair for us to assume that as far as the shallow water is concerned, there
will be no drilling in the future and that it will all be onshore?

some other questions at this point in time. So stay in touch. I appreciate it.

Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you for the presentation and the good results. On your slide 34, the long-term
Grasberg profile, in 2017, you forecast 900 million pounds of copper and 1 million ounces of gold. Presumably, that's
after the open-pit mining has concluded. Do you expect to produce that from the block cave in 2017 or will part of it be
from the IOZ separately and from stockpiled open-pit ores carrying over. It's quite remarkable that you're avoiding a
bigger down-dip.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. John, you're remembering past years where we did show a much bigger down-dip.
One thing that's happened, our continuing exploration and delineation, the IOZ was the older mine, it's went to the
DOZ, the Deep Ore Zone, all this is a continuation of block-caving that started really back in early 1980s. But we have
an extension of the DOZ, [ph] causes (01:26:44) the Deep MLZ, which we are targeting to bring on in 2015. And that
mine's early years has some very good grades of copper and gold.
So, that has really helped us mitigate the impact of the transition from the pit to the Grasberg block cave, which lies
underneath the pit which we can't start mining until we get out of the pit because of [indiscernible] (01:27:13). So, that
will ramp up, but won't provide much in the way that 2017 will include the DOZ – [indiscernible] (01:27:30) and the
Deep MLZ and some stockpiles from the pit that we'll have.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you. And if I can ask a second question, on the slide 33, the oil and gas hedging,
those were puts and swaps, so there's nothing that caps the upside or is there?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: [indiscernible] (01:27:52)
<A - James C. Flores>: John, the swaps do, that's obviously a fixed contract, but the puts do not.

Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Hi, everyone. A question on your Gresik smelter. What is the maximum amount of copper
concentrate that people can send to that smelter, particularly, is there any rule that limits the amount that your
competitor can send to that smelter?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, the sales of concentrate to that smelter are like they are under the rest of the global
industry, they're on the basis of sales contracts. And so the smelter has a capacity of about 1.2 million tons of
concentrate. Currently, we supply about 90% of that, I believe; and so going forward, it'd depend on how those
contracts play out.
There's no regulations that govern that. That's strictly commercial negotiations between PT-FI and PT Smelting. We're
part owner in PT Smelting. And then the other Indonesian copper producer had been providing some concentrate there,
but there's nothing that legally gives anybody any rights or any roadblocks to providing that. It's strictly driven by the
smelter's capacity and its existing contracts.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Understood. And have you already informed your customers that you might not be able to
supply copper concentrate?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we have active communications with our customers. Several things are going on in
the smelting business right now. The [ph] Philippine (01:30:01) smelter is down from the storm. So, we've always been
able to work cooperatively with our customers, with the timing of shipments and so forth. We don't have a real
short-term issue of problems to deal with.

impact if you don't get to a resolution?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, it's having an impact now in the sense that because these new regulations and the
fact that the full regulatory scheme has not been finished yet and communicated, we're currently not exporting. We had
some ships that loaded early in January that had permits that carried over from 2013. So, we've had shipments on that
basis, we have shipments to PT Smelting, we've timed everything to give us some working room here as we deal with
this issue. So over time, the ultimate event that would start requiring to do more significant scalebacks would be not

having space to store the concentrate that we produce.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Got it. And second question on a different topic is somewhat on the oil and gas business, in
terms of the cost guidance for 2014, it has gone up to $20 per BOE. And I was wondering if you guys could give us a
breakdown maybe by the four regions. Is there any particular one that's accounting for the increase or is this more of
greater output from California, which inherently is good margins, but also have higher cost?
<A - James C. Flores>: No, Brian, that's a good catch. I meant to bring that up. Our actual costs are $17 a barrel. But
when you shut-in Marlin, which is 30,000 barrels a day for 90 days, it has a dramatic effect on the overall and it kicks
our overall company-wide cost up to $20 a barrel.
The next year, we think our cost is going to be somewhere in the $18 a barrel range, again, that is absorbing shut-in at
Holstein which is about 16,000 barrels a day and then Horn Mountain, which is another 14,000 barrels a day. So that
kind of gives you the artificial inflation to our costs at the $20 barrel for this year and $18 barrel next year. And you'll
see our cost goes down towards $15 a barrel in 2016, just because we won't be suffering those shut-ins.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Got it.
<A - James C. Flores>: So there's no movement in costs other than in those shut-ins. I appreciate you brining that up.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, it's just volume-driven.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. So it should be tracking at $17 the first half and then increase in third Q, maybe a little
bit in 4Q as we model in these shut-ins?
<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah. And then that's going to change as it'd depend if we're planning a 90-day shut-in, if
weather goes our way and things happen maybe we can [indiscernible] (01:34:00) couple of weeks earlier, that all has a
dramatic effect there, so. But hopefully that's a number that we – it's an outside number at this point.

Our final question will come from the line Daniel Rohr with Morningstar.
<Q - Daniel Rohr>: Thanks a lot. Richard, I was hoping you could update us on your current thoughts regarding
medium-term Chinese copper demand. You touched on briefly in your introductory remarks, the changing composition
of Chinese GDP, curious as to what you think that means for Chinese copper demand growth over the next five years.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we continue to be very optimistic about China. You know the – in the global
copper markets are tight. In China you have – and you can see that with premiums that are paid with falling exchange
stocks around the world, and just how dramatic will they fall. In China, you do have this copper that's in the bonded
warehouses that are off-exchanges. So, depending on how that goes, depending on how these financing deals go. But
when you just look at the performance of the economy in China, even though there's some slowdown, the size of the
economy has grown to the extent that these somewhat lower percentages still translate into very substantial amounts of
copper demand.
So, we're optimistic about it. We're also realistic to know that there could be changes depending on how they manage
the inventories, how these financing transactions work and just how their global activities go. But we're optimistic
about it. And as I said, I think in general the markets are much more optimistic about it than they were a year ago.
<Q - Daniel Rohr>: But do you see the main growth drivers from an end-use perspective shifting over the next several
years or is it still going to be mainly infrastructure, mainly construction providing that incremental demand?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's clearly shifting. I mean, I think China's automobile production is way up, I mean way
up. The things for consumers, air conditioners and the like are up. But at the same time for that, China is going to have

consumer-based economy, as well as continued infrastructure development.

purchasing trends (01:37:13) that we acquired. A lot of work has been done under those big platforms. The subsalt had
not been explored, we hadn't even focused on it. So, we're trying to prospect the subsalt under those big platforms out
there.
The prospects that we see as a result of this well in the Wilcox and Tuscaloosa, opens up the whole onshore to us. And
I want you to understand the impact of that, the Lomond well is the only well that's been drilled onshore between the
Tuscaloosa trend and Baton Rouge and the wells that are drilled along the coast. You've got the entire 100 mile square
area, a new trend has been opened. And when you think about our exploration in the minerals business, our exploration
is all brownfield. And so we've got big ore bodies that have not been drilled and exploited deep.
And so when you look at that and we have a few greenfields [indiscernible] (01:38:34 – 01:38:39), really good
intercepts. Our story is so big, based on current production. But remember, we have a big production and we also have
a big growth story. And that's because we have the best prospects in the minerals business. We're the best places to find
ore is underneath ore. We have the best prospects in the deepwater. We're best place to find oil and gas is below oil and
gas.
And that's coming true. The Lomond well, if it hadn't Cretaceous and the kind of porosity of the Tuscaloosa trend. It's
just like some of the spuds that we saw in deepwater, where people didn't think the Miocene deposit out there, by the
Wilcox. So this thing is just getting started. So that's why we're in the continental [indiscernible] (01:39:39). The
production profile look great, but our exploration looks even better. Thank you.
