Sean M. Connolly
Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Before we summarize our full-year
performance, as I often do, I want to ground everyone in the big picture. Hillshire Brands is a focused food company
with category-leading brands. We're equally committed to delivering growth and profitability. Accordingly, we believe
in a very disciplined approach to brand building and innovation across our core brands. And we also believe in
reducing costs in order to fuel our growth agenda.
With one year of our plan complete, I feel very good about the progress we're making to build a leading food company.
In so many ways, it's been a gratifying first year. We took on an enormous amount of change and we've made real
progress on our business, our team and our culture. While we're proud of what we accomplished, we recognize it's only
one year and we have a lot more to do. Nevertheless, we delivered very solid results in fiscal 2013. Simply put, our
strong businesses became stronger and our soft spots have begun to move in the right direction.
Our EPS came in well above our original guidance range, but we are clear-eyed that this was driven by significant
commodity deflation and one-time SG&A favorability, mostly in the first half of the year. When you strip away those
unexpected tailwinds, the year came in squarely in line with our original expectations.
Importantly, our brand building and innovation investments unmistakably strengthened our core brands and our
innovation program overall has been jumpstarted as we now have a rebuilt innovation pipeline and a much more
disciplined process.
Finally, the team demonstrated a keen recognition that they need to fuel our demand drivers by delivering their cost
savings targets. Not only did they deliver, they also identified new efficiency opportunities.
In the marketplace, our overall consumption trends improved meaningfully in fiscal year 2013. As you can see on this
slide, Jimmy Dean, Ball Park, Gallo, and Aidells were standout performers. Hillshire Farm was well on its way to
overall growth prior to our lunchmeat packaging challenges, more on that in a minute, but other businesses still need
attention.
As an example, our State Fair corn dog business softened late in the year amidst intensifying price-based competition.
Now with our core businesses in relatively good shape compared to when we began this journey, we are
well-positioned to provide more attention to some of these smaller brands that have dampened our overall results.
I'm often asked; is your investment in MAP having the impact you expected? The answer in fiscal 2013 was absolutely,
yes. Let me remind you that we historically underinvested in MAP at a rate of about 3.5%. Our goal is to get that
number to 5% by fiscal 2015. In this past year, we stepped up our investment to 4.4%. As you can see on the right, that
increase was highly focused against a small number of businesses, most notably Jimmy Dean. And I'm pleased to
report that each of these investment areas delivered very good growth. We are highly disciplined with this spend,
meaning we spend where we have confidence in a return and we always look to drive more efficiency into these
investments.
With respect to innovation, we took a big step forward in fiscal 2013. First, we put a dedicated team in place to
overhaul the innovation process and rebuild the pipeline. This team is led by our first Chief Innovation Officer. We set
clear expectations that by fiscal 2015 we would be generating between 13% and 15% of our annual revenue from
innovations launched in the prior three years. We have already moved the needle here climbing to 11% in fiscal year
2013 from our past history of 9%. And the two products you see here are both examples of innovation success in fiscal
2013.
In the case of Jimmy Dean Delights, this is an example of how we're successfully strengthening our core brands. We
launched several new items of Delights last year including the Flatbreads line you see here. We increased MAP up over
50%, and we saw sales growth of over 30% on what the scanner data will show you is now roughly a $150 million

Delights franchise in retail sales.
In the case of Ball Park flame grilled burgers, we have a good example of successfully delivering on our strategy to
extend our power brands into adjacent categories. In this case, taking Ball Park into frozen. And when we backed this
great product with MAP support, we saw sales take off, which is exactly what you want when you have strong repeat
rates like this product does.
And to pay for our demand-generation investments, we have embraced a rigorous approach to cost management. We
remain on track to deliver $145 million of cost efficiencies, spread over the first three or four years of our company's
existence. Importantly, we achieved our targeted $40 million cost savings in fiscal 2013 and the plans are in place to
execute against the remaining $105 million.
I should point out that there's more to this work than the monetary savings. We're also building core capabilities on how
to do more with less and that bodes well for sustainable growth and profitability. At the end of the day, I'm very
pleased with the significant cultural shift toward embracing an efficiency mindset.
Now I'm sure many of you are curious where we stand in our efforts to resolve the Hillshire Farm lunchmeat packaging
issue that emerged last quarter. So, I'll take a few minutes here to give you a full report.
First, I'm pleased to inform you that we fixed the manufacturing challenges we encountered. The meat is nicely
layering into the new package. It looks great and the lines are running better than ever. But we also made a necessary
change to optimize our package graphics to increase consumer impact in stores. Specifically, we now believe we lost
visual impact on store shelves due to the switch to the clear-packaged lid while consumers consistently articulated a
preference for the clear lid in numerous quantitative tests; their actual purchase behavior noticeably changed when we
made the switch.
As we dug into the disconnect between what consumers were saying and what they were doing, it became clear that
there was a positive benefit to the red lid that the consumer could not articulate. We concluded that they were
habitually drawn to the vivid red Hillshire Farm brand block in the retailer's shelf set. We then immediately mobilized
to design a new red lid to fit the new wider package structure that we had moved to.
We believe the revised package with the red lid gives us the best overall solution, in that, reverting to the red color
gives us the shelf impact we're seeking and the new wider package structure also enables the consumer to clearly see
the nicely-layered meat through the transparent backside of the package.
By the way, I see a silver lining in this experience for us. In the old days, it would've taken us the better part of a year
to navigate a course correction like this. In this case, we were able to be in the market with a new solution in less than
10 weeks. But what you really want to know is; is it working? And the answer is yes. And to make the point, I'll delve
into more detail than I typically do, but I think you'll find the more-granular data helpful.
What you're looking at here is multi-outlet scanner data on baseline volume consumption for our seven to nine ounce
Hillshire Farm lunchmeat tub. Recall base volume is the volume you sell outside of price promotions and it's the best
proxy for underlying brand health. What you see here left to right is a number of things.
First, that our base volume at fiscal 2013, which is the red line was encouragingly performing well above fiscal 2012,
which is the blue line prior to the package switch. Then you see the rapid drop-off and sustained decline while we were
using the clear lid, but then most critically you see a strong rebound in performance on the right side as we moved to
the new red lid.
Now better service levels played a role here, but the point is it's working. What we need now and expect now is to see a
similar rebound in promoted volume, which is still down as competitors became aggressive in filling the merchandising
void that our issue created. We're confident we'll get that clicking in quarter one. Overall, we remain very confident in
the growth potential of the Hillshire Farm brand in the lunchmeat space.
I've said previously that we wouldn't solve all of our challenges in year one and we didn't. But we did make progress
and we expect more this year. In the last year, our bakery operations successfully navigated challenges associated with

being an early adopter of the Food Safety Modernization Act requirements and is now among the best positioned frozen
bakery assets in the industry.
While early days, the foodservice bakery team's innovation in upscale desserts appears to be working. And on the retail
side, we're enhancing our frozen bakery competitiveness via investments in improved price gaps and new product
innovation.
In our Sara Lee deli meats business, we've seen the larger, bulk deli business gain traction behind improved product
quality. You can't see this in the scanner data, but this business is nearly stable after being a chronic decliner
previously. On the smaller pre-sliced Sara Lee deli meat line, which is the piece you see in the scanner data, we still
have work to do as our share of shelf has declined in recent years with the expansion of the super premium segment.
Our State Fair corn dog business is one we don't talk about often, but this is an important category for us. It's on-trend,
convenient food. We are the market leader. We have the best quality product in the space and until recently, we were
the only national brand. We saw our growth trends here however turn to declines in the second half of fiscal 2013, as a
competitor invested heavily behind wider distribution and deep price discounting. Accordingly, we've mobilized to
restore growth through ramped-up innovation and ensuring we're price competitive in the marketplace. These
investments, while the right thing to do to protect the business, will be a drag on results this year and Maria will
elaborate more on that in a few minutes.
Let me now provide some overall perspective on how to think about fiscal 2014. First, recall the comps this year will
be very atypical, particularly in the first half, where we dramatically outperformed normal trends last year in fiscal
2013. In fact, in a major reversal from the first half of last year we now face material near-term inflation. Further, we
will be wrapping non-recurring favorable items in SG&A. So, clearly our fiscal 2014 results will be tipped to the back
half.
Second, we remain unwavering in our commitment to doing what is right for long-term value creation. Accordingly,
we'll continue our disciplined investment in brand building through efficient MAP spend and we take the need for
discipline here seriously. In fact, we've eliminated significant non-working spending while increasing our planned
in-market working MAP presence in fiscal 2014.
Third, we have a robust innovation agenda we're investing behind. And we've aligned it with customer-launch windows
for our categories. Q3 will be a significant window for us this year and we'll share more on these innovations at a later
date.
Fourth, we worked hard to build our market-leading positions and we will work hard to defend them; most often that
will be strategic through brand building and innovation. Sometimes it will be more tactical in response to competitive
flare-ups. The point is, we favor non price-based competition, but we will ride the right horse for the course. Finally,
our work is not done strengthening soft spots on smaller brands and we will do just that.
When you put it altogether, our fiscal year 2014 plan reflects both the realities of the near-term climate plus our
commitment to long-term value creation. We are out to build a fully-competitive company that can endure.
So, we're committed to doing things the right way. Frankly, our fiscal 2014 profitability expectations are roughly in line
with where we originally expected the business to be by the end of fiscal year 2014, despite the near-in environment
being a bit more competitively intense than we had originally envisioned.
We expect to build momentum as the year progresses, both on the top line, where our innovation programs kick in in
the second half, and on the bottom line as early on we will navigate inflation and significant one-time wraps, and then
benefit from our cost programs and easier comps in the second half.
The upshot of all of this is we are confident in the potential of our business and its cash flows and are now in a position
to return additional capital to shareholders. As you saw in our announcement this morning, and Maria will elaborate
further, we are pleased to be increasing our dividend and are also targeting $200 million in share repurchases over the
next two years.

Finally, before I turn it over to Maria, expect us to continue to pursue targeted M&A opportunities as a central part of
our value-creation strategy.
Maria, over to you.
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you've seen in our numbers and just heard from
Sean's comments, our fourth quarter financials, both the top and the bottom line, were challenged by some unusual
items, but our underlying business continues to make progress, and we were able to end the year with EPS slightly
ahead of our updated increased guidance.
I'll walk you through some of the financial details. There were three unusual things that had a significant impact on our
fourth quarter results. The lunchmeat transition, which we expected and two that were unexpected; the one-time Q4
reduction in inventory levels held by a major customer and favorable expenses in corporate from adjustments that are
primarily related to employee comping benefits and franchise state taxes. These three items make it difficult to see the
underlying trends of our business, but excluding these items, we would have generated positive sales growth in the low
single-digits, with a single-digit earnings decline.
Beyond those three items, we also experienced commodity inflation for the first time in fiscal 2013. This is in contrast
to the substantial favorability we were getting from lower input costs in earlier quarters.
As we've discussed before and consistent with our strategy, we invested a portion of the first half favorability we had
back into our business, both in MAP and targeted investments in marketing and innovation. We ended the year with a
strong cash balance and for the year, we delivered fiscal 2013 earnings ahead of our original guidance, with the help of
favorable input costs. Outside of that benefit, earnings performance was generally on track with what we originally
expected.
Now let's take a look at the quarter's financial results. Our adjusted net sales declined 2.1% on a 1% decrease in
volume. If you exclude commodity meat sales, our adjusted net sales would have been down 2.6% on a volume decline
of 2.6%. Lower sales were driven by our Retail segment for the reasons just discussed. Our Foodservice/Other segment
grew in the quarter.
First profit dollars and rate were down for the quarter versus last year on lower volumes and higher input costs. For the
year, our gross profit rate ended at 29.9%, up from our 28.5% baseline in fiscal 2012, reflecting the substantial benefit
of lower input costs earlier in the year.
You see on the slide that our fourth quarter MAP investment was $47 million. You shouldn't take this as a run rate, as
the $47 million includes reinvestment of some of the first half favorability into MAP. The 70% year-on-year MAP
growth rate reflects not only the additional level of investment but also the fact that last year's fourth quarter MAP
spend was unusually low, at only 2.8% of sales.
Our SG&A, excluding MAP, ended up being down 3% for the year with our segments up and corporate down. This
reflects savings offsetting the stranded costs coming into our P&L and the benefit of one-time items.
You'll recall that I had told you to expect corporate expense to end at $50 million for the year. However, we came in at
$41 million on some favorable adjustments in the fourth quarter. Our normal corporate run rate is about $15 million a
quarter.
The result of all of this, lower sales and gross margin on unusual events, inflationary input costs, higher MAP
investment and lower SG&A resulted in our operating income being down 23.2% for the fourth quarter. But looking at
the total year, our adjusted operating income was strong, up 12.5% versus prior year resulting in an adjusted margin of
9.3% and we closed out fiscal 2013 at $1.72 of adjusted EPS, which was up 18.6%.

Now let's look at the segment, our Retail segment sales were down 3.8% and operating income was down 32.3% in the
fourth quarter. The positive performance of our Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and Aidells businesses were offset by the items
we've been discussing; the lunchmeat transition, customer inventory issue, higher input costs and increased investment
versus a year ago. For the year, retail sales were up slightly and operating income was up 5.5%.
In our Foodservice/Other segment, fourth quarter volume grew 4.4% driven by sales of commodity meat. Total net
sales were up 2.7%. Excluding commodity meat, Foodservice net sales were up 1.3%. Within Foodservice, sales grew
in Bakery as we lapped the difficult fourth quarter last year when we were going through the transition of our bakery
plant in Tarboro, North Carolina.
The Foodservice environment continues to be challenging and beyond the broader industry challenges, desserts in
particular have been a tough space. That said, we have an excellent Foodservice team and they continue to execute our
strategy to grow through innovation and to take share in targeted spots. We've identified specific channels, product
categories and customers where we see solid growth potential. We have strategies to capitalize on the opportunity in
each of these areas and we're seeing success.
In the fourth quarter our convenience store sales were up double-digits. Our high-end desserts business grew double
digits with good momentum. And we're having success with targeted promotional activity with national accounts.
In addition to our focus on growth, we're executing strategies to offset industry margin pressure through innovation,
superior value proposition and product mix improvements. For the year, the Foodservice/Other segment was relatively
flat on the top line and had an operating segment profit margin of 7.3%.
Moving on to cash. We closed the year with $400 million of cash. During the quarter, we settled a $40 million legacy
swap obligation which is why our cash balance is down from $416 million at the end of the third quarter.
Overall, we ended the year with good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. We're under two times levered with
adjusted EBITDA of $509 million on gross debt of $951 million. This provides us with the flexibility to increase our
cash to shareholders and pursue our M&A strategy as a path to leverage our assets and capabilities to create
shareholder value.
At this point you know we're increasing our dividend to $0.70 per share and that we're targeting to deploy $200 million
of capital to repurchase shares over the next two years. Let me put that in perspective of our overall capital-allocation
strategy. We intend to continue to invest in our business as our top priority. Our investments in brand building,
innovation, capability development and efficiency programs are targeted at creating long-term sustainable growth and
profitability.
Now that we're through our first year as a standalone company and we're also through two-thirds of our legacy cash
obligations, and now we have a better feel for what we have on the underlying cash flows of our business, we are
taking our annual dividend up by 40% to $0.70 a share. This puts our payout ratio in the low 40s and, at yesterday's
stock price, the dividend would put our yield at about 2%.
In addition to the increase in the dividend, we're targeting $200 million of share repurchases over the next two years.
I'm not going to speculate on the exact timing of the repurchases, as we'll look to do them opportunistically and balance
the expected returns against our other opportunities on a regular basis.
As a reminder, we have authorizations in place to repurchase $1.2 billion worth of shares, plus another 2.7 million
shares so the $200 million number is the statement of intent, it's not a new authorization. With our strong balance sheet,
the good underlying cash flow of the business and including the impacts of the dividend increase and the anticipated
share repurchases, we still have the flexibility we need to actively pursue targeted M&A opportunity.
We believe there is significant value creation potential here, but as you know we don't control action-ability and timing
of acquisitions, so we'll continue to monitor our capital position and balance our opportunities to produce the highest
shareholder returns over time.
Given where we are with our leverage position, we don't expect to pay down debt in the near term.

Looking forward, we expect sales to increase slightly in fiscal 2014 overall and that we will end the year with solid
growth momentum. The sales outlook incorporates our expectation that we'll continue to invest behind growth and
innovation. And that we will achieve continued strong performance on our businesses that are growing.
Additionally, we are anticipating a positive benefit from new innovation that will roll out during the fiscal year,
particularly in the second half. Our outlook also anticipates the return to growth of Hillshire Farm lunchmeat later in
the year after we have navigated through tough near-term competitive dynamics.
And finally, our top line guidance reflects our expectation that we will stabilize the softer spots in our portfolio. The
positive growth that we expect from these actions and in these areas will be offset by a number of things. First, we
expect our level of commodity meat sales, turkey in particular, to decrease significantly versus fiscal 2013. This puts
close to a point of pressure on the year-over-year comparison for total company net sales.
Next, we will rigorously defend our market position against intensified competition in corn dogs and lunchmeat as Sean
discussed earlier. This will put pressure on pricing and hence, net sales for pieces of our business.
And finally, while we will continue to strengthen our soft spots in our portfolio, we are not expecting growth in our
Bakery business, which represents about 10% of our total revenue.
As you know, we don't give annual MAP guidance, but that said we expect total marketing investment to be up
year-on-year to support the growth of our business. Generally marketing investment includes MAP, plotting behind
innovation and trade-promotion activities. Exactly which of those areas will increase and by how much will depend of
what we see as we carefully monitor the competitive environment and assess the readiness of our innovations.
Our earnings outlook for fiscal 2014 is flat to down mid-single digits. Incorporated into this outlook is the sales
estimate I just spoke about; higher input costs for the year, continued investment behind brand building and innovation,
the benefit of our savings initiative helping to offset inflation and defensive pricing actions and the lapping of one-time
benefits we experienced in SG&A in fiscal 2013.
As you think about our fiscal 2014 earnings growth guidance, I remind you that fiscal 2013 was an unusual year, and
when we compare our earnings outlook against our fiscal 2012 base line, we are clearly making progress with our profit
model. We're expecting our gross margin rate to be higher and our SG&A cost to be lower than where we started out.
Additionally, our operating margin expectations for fiscal 2014 are in line with what we expected in our original
three-year plan.
Let me comment on some other areas of guidance. We are expecting a tax rate of 35%, net book interest expense of
about $40 million and corporate expenses of $60 million excluding significant items. We expect our CapEx to be at the
high-end of our previously-stated range of 3.5% to 4% of net sales as we invest behind productivity initiatives and
growth.
For significant items, we are anticipating P&L charges in cash outlays of $85 million to $95 million for fiscal 2014.
This estimate incorporates cash related to our legacy obligations, as well as the costs associated with our productivity
program. Post fiscal 2014 this would put our remaining significant items estimate at $35 million to $40 million on the
P&L and $55 million to $60 million in cash obligations.
So let me sum it up. We delivered strong financial results in our first year out. Our earnings outperformance versus
original guidance reflects substantial benefit from favorable input costs and SG&A favorability. Heading into this year,
we're expecting a more challenging operating environment. So if we achieve the high-end of our guidance with
earnings equal to fiscal 2013, those earnings will have been achieved very differently in each of the two years.
Importantly, we are making progress versus our starting point as a standalone company and our margin expectation for
fiscal 2014 is in line with our original three-year plan. And finally, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, I will
say, that the unusual nature of fiscal 2013 with significant commodities and SG&A favorability in the first half, and the
unusual items in the fourth quarter that we've discussed on this call, will make for exaggerated quarterly year-over-year
comparisons as we go through fiscal 2014.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Bank of Montreal. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ken.
<A - Maria Henry>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just thinking about big picture, thinking about 2015, you talk about like this is – the
unusual situation with commodities going up and down. Do you guys think about, what type of input costs and
competition that you need to get to 2015? Or does that become less relevant as you become more into the packaged
food and get your marketing spending where it needs to be? Can you put that in the framework for us?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. I think the key is that we're not changing our mid-term outlook at all. Our plan
remains intact. We're looking to get sales growing 4% to 5% and to get to a double-digit OI margin and that the actions
we're taking on the business and the organization are aimed at delivering just that because we've got a great branded
portfolio and we'll continue to be unwavering in our efforts to get its potential unleashed and really take costs out. In
any given window, margins could be temporarily inflated or depressed but we're focused on delivering really the 200
basis points of underlying OI margin expansion off our starting point from a year or so ago. And the way we'll get there
is stronger brands and cost efficiency.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: So the inflation just doesn't make as big of a deal in 2015 or do you have specific
assumptions for that year? I guess is what I'm trying to get at.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, the way I think about that Ken, is look, inflation happens, so does deflation. We can't
control that obviously, but what we can control is the strength of our brands. We can control our cost structure and we
can also innovate our portfolio in ways that make it less impacted by swings in meat costs. Jimmy Dean Breakfast
Sandwiches are a great example of this where only a fraction of the weight of the product is meat, while meat plays the
key role as hero ingredient. So from – really from day one, it's been our plan to put the 200 basis points of underlying
OI margin into this business through both stronger brands and cost efficiency and we're making very good progress in
that regard and we'll continue to march on.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question, Robert Moskow. Your line is open and state your company please.
<A - Robert Moskow>: Thanks. It's Credit Suisse. I guess what I – if I look at what my model was for fiscal 2014
back a year ago, I did have a higher EPS estimate than what you're guiding to. And I think the bigger driver is the sales.
Like the sales came in lower than I thought this year, maybe some of it from divestures, but as you look to next year,
Sean, you're saying it's going to be a more difficult operating environment. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?
Are you seeing the need to lower prices in certain categories that certainly happened in fourth quarter. Are you seeing
more of this risk of inventory de-loading and are you seeing a weaker consumer than what you had expected?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, clearly, per my remarks earlier, the year will be tipped to the back half, but we fully
expect to build both top and bottom line momentum as the year unfolds. And to complete this year with solid growth

momentum, clearly the first half will be a bit lighter, as we complete our lunchmeat recovery and we bear the net sales
impact of more competitive pricing in some categories. But nevertheless, we view those as near-term situations and
we've got a robust innovation agenda coming into the back half of the year and we're very confident we will be building
momentum through the year and close out the year in a good position.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Sean, if commodities are going a little bit higher, and especially in pork in the near-term, why
do you think the competition is getting more intense? Why do you think that the promotional activity is going up?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, it depends upon the category. So, where in some of our categories, we've seen – it's
been a fairly competitive environment and usually, in a lot of cases, that's because they're very attractive categories. So
frozen breakfast sandwiches, as an example, last year we saw a lot of activity there in terms of competitive entrants and
we really doubled down to protect our leading market share. And because Jimmy Dean is probably farthest along in our
portfolio in terms of brand building and innovation, the response we got, both in terms of growing our business and
defending our market leadership position, was just outstanding.
Corn dogs is another category that's very interesting, because it's snackable, it's convenient, it tastes great. So when you
see categories like that, it's not unusual at all that you'll get competitors interested in it, especially where there's a
limited number of entrants, as had been the case previously in corn dogs.
I think lunchmeat is a bit of a unique animal in that, the category overall, as I've said before, needs innovation, because
people love sandwiches, but it's been stagnant for the better part of a decade. We were well on our way to stimulating
the category with innovation, and we had actually had our lunchmeat business growing nicely in terms of net sales
performance by the time we got out of quarter two, then we ran into the issue we've talked about extensively around
our package transition.
And what that's done there is, that really creates a void for competitors to see that we can't merchandise fully because
we didn't have the product fulfillment in place and they jumped in and filled those merchandising voids and really
looked to take an opportunity to steal away some market share in the short term. So, that's more – I would describe that
one as more of an acute issue, where people saw opportunity and they dialed it up and now that we've got our ability to
get lunchmeat in the market fully in place, we've got to make sure we get our market share back and get that business
back to growth.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: So, Sean, you're not seeing any issues in the macro that would make you reconsider the 4% to
5% sales growth? You think you can grow at that pace even though the macro is changing a bit?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. The growth rates that we put out before are not changing, our outlook overall is not
changing. And keep in mind again, we've got market-leading brands that not only have potential to grow within the
categories where they're already established by being refreshed, but they also have the potential to extend into adjacent
spaces. We've done that exceedingly well with Jimmy Dean, we're beginning to do that with Ball Park, with frozen
flame grilled burgers, and we've got opportunities with our other brands as well. For example, the back half of this last
year, we launched Aidells into these gourmet chicken meatball initiatives that we've got out there that are just fantastic.
So given the size of our company relative to some of the food giants, we think that kind of growth rate off of our base is
absolutely achievable.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Ken Goldman. You line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: JPMorgan. Thank you for the question. Sean, I wanted to ask about the lunchmeat packaging
issue, not the production problem, but the lid color, because for a long time clear packaging was being held up by you
as sort of the flagship example of how Hillshire would drive growth via innovation and it didn't work out, right. I'm not
saying this a big deal right, it's just a color of a lid. But I guess if – I'm curious does this call into any question on your

end some of the other innovation plans you have now and whether they'll work? And I'm curious maybe which lessons
your team has learned from this experience and maybe which changes you've made internally to perhaps make sure this
mistake doesn't happen again.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, what you see in this case was that
there was a disconnect between what consumers were saying in research and what they were doing in practice. And that
is not the first time that has happened in the world of a branded packaged goods or market research. I think the key
point I want to stress is that I am incredibly pleased with the progress we've made on innovation overall. So, significant
progress on rate innovation, I feel great about where we are.
But all that said; you never bat 1.000 when it comes to innovation. I've said that before as well. I think the key is to
learn fast and course correct fast when you see something is off. In this case, we fixed the manufacturing challenges,
we did get our lines running better than ever, the meat is layering beautifully into the package, service is back to
normal. But we also used common sense and we acknowledged that the consumer couldn't fully articulate what this red
lid was doing for them in terms of really creating pop on the shelf. So we made a quick decision, we mobilized and we
got a solution into market in less than 10 weeks, which is way better than we've done previously.
So, I think the bottom line here is, we're well on our way with innovation overall, we're well on our way back with
Hillshire Farm lunchmeat overall and we've got big plans for Hillshire Farm lunchmeat in the future.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: And a quick follow-up, Maria. Looking over guidance for the year, can you talk about which
line items have the most flexibility to come in better or even worse than your current expectation? I'm asking because
you've beaten the Street each in the last four quarters. Just trying to get a sense of where you might be conservative
today.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. I think a couple of comments around our earnings outlook for fiscal 2014. If I think about
what are the most variable items in what drives our outlook on the earnings side, there's really two things. The first is
input costs and the second would be how competitive dynamics play out throughout the year, including how much
price we can take against the rising input costs that we see. In the near-term for fiscal 2014, we have two things
happening at the same time. We have increasing input costs and we have the intensified competitive environment in a
couple of the spots that Sean has been talking about.
So where we typically look to price recover against inflationary input costs over time, here in the beginning of the
fiscal year, we've got rising input costs and we've got some pricing actions that may go the other way, based on what
the competitive environment is. And those are the biggest factors that give variability to exactly where we expect to
land the year.
As I went through in my prepared comments, I went through all the details of what the assumptions are in our outlook
for 2014. The cost programs are completely underway. We have full line of sight to them; I'm 100% confident we'll
deliver against the objectives on the productivity side of the house that we have. It's really the more market driven,
external factors that introduce variability.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Thanks so much.

Thank you. Next question, Ken Perkins. Your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Ken Perkins>: It's Morningstar. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to touch on the competition for State Fair
a little bit more. I know you've worked to instill a culture of productive paranoia, but I'm just wondering if you can
speak to sort of the opportunities that you think maybe you left open to the new competitors. And if – what levers you
think you can pull to regain your footing, whether it's just all price or the mix or the innovation? If you can talk about
that that would be great.

<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think it's a two-step process, Ken. And the first step is to defend the market share
and the business we own today. And what we see now with a more competitive environment, with more company on
the shelf nearby us and price gaps that we didn't have to deal with before, we've got to make sure that we're priced
competitively, and that we're promoting competitively, because as we do that, with the market leading brand that's
well-established in the category and with the quality products we've got, we will see a response.
But beyond that, the State Fair brand equity is really about all family leaning toward kid, convenient fun-food
enjoyment. And that means that State Fair does not have to be limited to being a corn dog. It's got innovation potential,
in corn dogs and beyond corn dogs. Currently we have a corn dog on a stick business, we've got a mini-snack business.
We think there's potential beyond that. So, the second piece of it is really about bringing that innovation pipeline to life
and getting these products into the marketplace over the next couple of years.
<Q - Ken Perkins>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Ann Gurkin. Your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Davenport. Good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, Ann.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: I want to ask you a follow-up question on the pricing and where you think you may need to adjust
pricing across your portfolio; if you could just get to that again. And then, if you could also address how we should
think about Jimmy Dean as we come off a very strong performance this year?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Let me take the Jimmy Dean piece and then I'll hand it off to Maria to talk a little bit about
pricing. Jimmy Dean is a fantastic, billion-dollar brand. It's growing robustly top line and bottom line, and it is nowhere
near being done. If you look at breakfast sandwiches as an example, it's a category that I would describe as very
youthful. It's only 30% household penetration. And if you saw the article in The Journal this week on the importance of
getting more calories and more protein into the breakfast day part, in terms of what it does for weight management, we
think there's a long way to go there in terms of additional growth and that means additional innovation and we'll
support it with additional investments. So Jimmy Dean will continue to ride that horse for some time to come.
<A - Maria Henry>: And on pricing Ann, we talked about two areas in particular, where we see intensified
competitive dynamics in the near-term, we talked about lunchmeat and how we see our position coming out of the
packaging change and our focus on defending that great piece of our franchise and the other area we've been talking
about is corn dogs, where we've got some price gap issues to a very aggressive competitor in that space. Outside of
that, with inflationary input costs, we do look to recover input costs through pricing over time and so you would expect
that to continue in terms of how we manage our pricing strategy.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: And have you put price changes into the marketplace for deli and corn dogs?
<A - Maria Henry>: We have put some pricing changes into the market at the end of the fourth quarter and we are –
we continue to work through our pricing tactics on the lunchmeat side to coincide with the packaging change that is
going out into the market.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Typically, when we're talking Ann, about competitive flare ups and price adjustments for
those purposes, you tend not to see shelf prices change, you tend to see promoted prices get a little bit more competitive
reflecting what we believe is the temporary nature of those kinds of moves.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question, Jason English. Your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, guys. Goldman Sachs.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Sean, first question, MAP spend ramped substantially this year, as we look into next year, I
know you said higher. Can you give us a sense of how meaningful it may pickup?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I think Maria hit the nail on the head. Total marketing spend will increase year-on-year, that
encompasses MAP, innovation investments, trade spend and new item – new innovation slotting expenses. And
frankly, that total basket of activities reflects how much we've got going on with respect to brand building and
innovation.
On MAP specifically, we don't guide to an annual number other than to say that for the midterm guidance through
fiscal 2015, coming out of fiscal 2015, we expect to be at a rate of 5% that year. And as I said from the beginning,
when we got started coming out at 2012, don't straight line it there because within any given quarter, or frankly with
any given year, it depends upon a number of things, where we are. It could depend upon seasonality, is it grilling
season. It could dependent upon competitive dynamics. Do we need to get more promotional in the short-term, and it
could depend upon how much innovation is in the marketplace requiring support to generate awareness.
So, the MAP line will move around. I think the bottom line is; we're going to be supporting our brands meaningfully
and we'll support it with MAP meaningfully and as we spend MAP versus last year and even the year before, we're
making big progress in getting more efficient in terms of really making sure that the percentage of the total MAP
dollars that we've got are maximum working dollars versus non-working dollars. And by working dollars, I mean
things like media running a commercial as opposed to agency fees, commercial production fees. Things like that where
we're pushing hard on efficiencies so we can get a non-working MAP spend down.
<Q - Jason English>: Thank you for that. And coming back real quick on the pricing questions, just to make sure I
understand this. On lunchmeat, it's not just a factor of maybe raising list prices and dealing some back. But it sounds
like there's a, at least some near-term inability to even raise list prices. And then on corn dogs we're talking about
rolling back in the face of inflation. Do I have it right?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well. I think what my comment to Ann was really that, in categories like this where it's
more of a competitive flare up, what you tend to see is promoted pricing get more aggressive because, in the case of
lunchmeat as an example, the other players in the category have gotten much more promotional as we kind of stepped
out of promotion because we're working to get our product fulfillment back. So we've got to get competitive in terms of
promoted volume price points and promotional activity overall in both of those categories near term.
<Q - Jason English>: And that constrains your ability to raise list prices, is that right?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. Well, I think this year is a bit more pressured in the near term, because we've got to
keep prices competitive in certain categories. And when there's a benign competitive environment, you've got position,
amidst inflation, to take prices up more in certain categories than we'll do in the very near term.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.

little bit about the financial criteria, especially how long you'd be willing to wait before a deal becomes accretive?
Thank you very much.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Alexia. Thanks for the question. On M&A, we think it's a great opportunity for us to create
shareholder value, because we have great assets and capabilities that can be leveraged. Specifically, what we're looking
for in acquisitions, are acquisitions that align with our strategy and that have smart financials and by that, I mean that
they have attractive top line growth trends, they're accretive to our margin structure and EPS. And obviously looking
for opportunities where we can structure deals that create shareholder value, meaning that we can get them at a price
that we think is reasonable with what we can do with them.
As you know with acquisitions, we don't control the availability of them and therefore we don't control the timing of
when we might do something. In terms of size, we see attractive assets in the market on the very small ends of the
scale, we see assets that are similar to size to Aidells, which was a great acquisition for us a couple of years ago.
But we also see attractive assets on the higher end of the scale and that's one of the reasons why we set the capital
allocation coming into this year where we did. We want to maintain flexibility with our balance sheet and to go into a
levered situation to be able to move very quickly if an attractive asset becomes available that can add to our portfolio
and give us some opportunity to really accelerate the shareholder value creation objective that we've got.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Next question John Baumgartner. Your line is open and state your company.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Wells Fargo. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Sean, simply more of the
conceptual, bigger-picture question, in terms of the Foodservice business, can you talk a bit to the opportunity there for
protein growth going forward within the convenience channel? It seems as though you're getting some benefit there in
your numbers this past quarter. How are you visualizing the rate at which retailers move towards greater adoption of
some of these fresh programs in their stores going forward?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: So you're talking about within the retailer and grocery type of environment, but you're
talking about the deli type of operation, which as many people know is more of a Foodservice type operation. I just
want to make sure I understand your question, John.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: The convenience outlet, I guess more specifically, the opportunity there for the fresh
product?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Okay. So well, let's face it, the consumer spends half of their dollars on food away from
home. So the market is enormous in terms of food sales away from home and consumers are also incredibly pressed for
time. So the convenience channel in particular is a very strategic channel. In that, you've got a lot of our shopper base
who are going in there, they're buying food, they're buying beverages and that channel in particular tends to skew
toward men and men tend to skew toward protein. So it's an attractive space. The Jimmy Dean equity is a good
example, It has very good equity in that space as does Ball Park, as does Hillshire Farm.
So Foodservice, there's not a food company I know of, of our scale or larger that doesn't have a meaningful
Foodservice division. We'll continue to have one. But the whole channel is in bit of cyclical malaise right now and I
think in that type of environment, our goal is to win share through innovation and better service. And if we do that, we
will be better positioned to emerge in even stronger growth as the cycle turns. So right now in Foodservice, the
environment is challenged, we are gaining share in a lot of channels and a lot of categories in a difficult environment
and we think that's a right way to play it as we're working through this.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Thanks, Sean. Appreciate it.

Thank you. Our last question is Christine McCracken. Your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Christine Lee McCracken>: Cleveland Research. Thanks for taking the question. Just really briefly, you
mentioned in your prepared comments that you were seeing a bit of a shift back I think to bulk deli and some of your
competitors have made similar comments. I'm just curious what do you think is behind that move? Do you think any of
it could be in any way related to the challenges you've had on some of your lunchmeat items, or do you think it's more
of a cost issue? Maybe if you could elaborate on that a little.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure. Let me make sure that I was clear in my comments earlier. I was not referring to any
shift to the bulk deli. What I was referring to is, our deli meat business in the deli section of the store, which is under
the Sara Lee brand, the bulk of our business there is in bulk. Meaning the behind the glass, service deli, sliced deli, and
that business had been a chronic decliner and it's almost stable now as we've refreshed that product quality to
outstanding product quality. So that's really what I was referring to there.
Certainly, there is some interaction between the deli section and the sliced mainstream lunchmeat section, but it is not
the one-to-one dynamic the way some might lead you to believe.
Lunchmeat sandwiches are simple meals overall, meaning that the consumer has a consideration set of a number of
diverse options, and the common thread between those options is that they all tend to be convenient, they all tend to be
satisfying and they all tend to be day-part specific. So in the case of deli meat, we're really talking about lunch. And the
way to win in that broader set is to offer a relevant benefit so that the perceived value of our offering is elevated. So
when you see switching out of a category, it's usually because the category needs to be refreshed. And lunchmeat,
including the deli, would clearly benefit, in my opinion, from increased innovation and that's exactly what we intend to
do.
<Q - Christine Lee McCracken>: All right. But you are seeing more stable trends in that deli category and that is, I
mean it's been a few years now of declines. And do you think that's like a shift out of Foodservice? Is that the more
expensive alternative or what do you think's behind that?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I think that the point I was trying to make a minute ago is, there's tremendous – there's
always switching between convenient, simple meals in different parts of the store and what people – consumers tend to
switch out of are categories that have become dull and they haven't been refreshed and the one they tend to switch into
are categories that have been innovated, they're exciting, they're relevant, they're provocative. And the deli section
certainly has had some of that innovation and some of that excitement brought back to it. And we've begun to
contribute to that with our Sara Lee innovations I think we can do more.
<Q - Christine Lee McCracken>: Thanks for that color. Just real quickly on turkey. You'd mentioned that you
expected a little bit of a decline, I guess, in sales there. Is that just a reflection of the volume cuts that the industry has
made or is there something more to that?
<A - Maria Henry>: Well, as you know, that we're vertically integrated on turkey. And so what I was referring to is
what we consider commodity meat sales and as we're vertically integrated, sometimes we have more turkey than our
internal demand requires, and then we sell that on the market. In fiscal 2013, we had an unusually high level of sales of
our commodity turkey. I expect that that will be significantly lower in fiscal 2014 and that's what I was referring to.
<Q - Christine Lee McCracken>: All right. Thanks for that.

see them added in 2014? And how does the decline – recent decline in grain prices sort of play through? Obviously, the
delay from that happening and it getting to the protein level and then reaching you, but can you put that a little bit into
context and help us understand just longer term broader picture, like how that might flow through your P&L?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Akshay. Let me make a couple of comments on commodities. We do see commodities
being inflationary for the entirety of fiscal 2014. We see them being acutely inflationary here in the near-term,
particularly in the first quarter and even the first half. So that's how we think about it.
In terms of what happens with grain prices, and corn in particular, we do expect that that will flow through the cycle.
Not exactly sure when or how – to what extent that that will end up giving us some relief from what we're seeing today,
but for fiscal 2014, we are assuming in the outlook that I provided that we will have inflation on the commodity side
through the entire year.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: But I think if you look at last year, Akshay, to your point, when there's a significant event in
the grains market, there's usually a ripple on effect. Last year was the worst drought in 70 years. Who knows? We'll see
how the summer unfolds. Some people think we're going to have the largest harvest ever. So, too early to tell, but we'll
be monitoring it so we can report out in terms of the ripple effect.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: And the near term inflation that you alluded to, does that have anything to do with the recent
significant rise in sort of sow prices, which is the result of disease issue which is temporary and should subside, so pork
obviously is a big deal. Chicken we know there's inflation and it's been strong and beef has sort of been inflationary for
a while. But, is the near-term driven in any way by the increase in sow prices recently?
<A - Maria Henry>: Yes. Yes it is. And your other comments are right on. While we don't break out the specifics of
our commodity basket, you guys know that sows are clearly an impact on us and that's been a big [ph] goober (59:15)
as of late, and both beef and packaging costs are also up and clearly, we use both of those in the products that we sell.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: And just one last one on innovation and just competitive dynamics. I think Kraft had said that
the lunchmeat category is pretty competitive. But I'd like to focus just on innovation. It seems like some other larger
players, Hormel included, are pretty focused – and yourself – are focused on innovation. It seems like the timing, I
mean, off it as such that a lot of it is yet to hit. We're seeing sort of revved snack wraps being launched by Hormel and
Kraft talks about a bunch of innovation coming on and you guys also have some slated for later.
How – can you just characterize like sort of the innovation environment for the lunchmeat and just meats in general,
meat snacks in general now versus what it's been over the last few years? I mean is it at an elevated level versus the last
three years and do you expect that to continue? I mean, I'm just trying to get a sense of how positive or neutral or
negatively you're thinking about just innovation in general for the categories you're in.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, innovation, I think good companies believe in innovation and believe in the power the
innovation. Everybody wins when there's innovation, the consumer wins because they get better products;
manufacturers win because they drive better sales, hopefully better margins. So I think sophisticated food, branded
food manufacturers want to be innovators and we certainly want to count ourselves near the top of that list over time
because innovation is central to our vision, it's central to our game plan.
We had a very good year in terms of fiscal 2013 moving the needle on innovation. We've got a big year in terms of
innovation for fiscal 2014 coming in the back half of the year. And we've got exciting stuff planned farther out for
fiscal 2015. So I'd really rather not comment in terms of competitive innovations, but I'll focus the attention on our
unwavering commitment to innovation. And we'll be in a position to talk more about what we've got coming at some of
the industry conferences as the year unfolds.
<Q - Akshay Jagdale>: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.

Thank you. Our final question is from Robert Moskow. Your line is open and state your company please.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thanks. Could you just comment on the nature of the inventory reset that you have in the
press release? Is it a permanent reset and why did it take place?
<A - Maria Henry>: Rob, it is a one-time reset. If you think about it from the customer perspective, they're managing
their inventory; they decided to run at a lower fundamental inventory level. They reset that. It's one-time. We've seen
order – ordering patterns restore to normal, so that was one-time and it ran through the – our numbers in the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Thank you.
