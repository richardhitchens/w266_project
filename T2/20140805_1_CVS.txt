and they'll participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks.
During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow up so we can provide more
callers with a chance to ask a question.
Now I have one key date to announce this morning. We plan to host our annual Analyst Day on the morning of
Tuesday, December 16, in New York City. At that time you'll have the opportunity to hear from several members of
our senior management team who will provide 2015 guidance as well as a comprehensive update on our growth
strategy. We plan to send invitations with more specific details via email sometime in August but please save the date.
Again, that's Tuesday, December 16. If you don't receive an invitation and would like to attend please contact me at
your earliest convenience.
Please note that just before this call we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information
you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance.
Additionally, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will be filed by the close of business today and it will be available on
our website at that time.
During today's presentation we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially
from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings,
including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in the filings.
During this call we'll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance,
including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find the definitions of these
non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our
website and as always today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for
one year.
And now let me turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Thanks, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to hear more about the strong results we posted
for the second quarter.
I'm pleased to see that we met or exceeded our expectations on every key measure of performance. Our adjusted
earnings-per-share increased 16.5% to $1.13 per share. That's $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance range. Both the
PBM and Retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations and delivered strong gross margins, and as a result
operating profit in the Retail business grew 6.5% and profit in the PBM grew 30%, exceeding our expectations.
Additionally we generated nearly $400 million of free cash, keeping us on track to achieve our full-year free cash flow
goal. Now given our strong performance year-to-date we are raising and narrowing our adjusted earnings-per-share
guidance for the year to a range of $4.43 to $4.51, and that's up from our previous range of $4.36 to $4.50 and Dave
will provide the details behind our financial results and guidance during his review.
But before I move on, I do want to say that I'm extremely proud of the work our colleagues are doing to drive
continued strong results across the enterprise.
So let me turn to a brief business update and I'll start by level-setting how we see the current state of health reform. I
think as everybody knows there are reported to be about 8 million individuals who have enrolled in the public
exchanges, and we saw the biggest increase occur toward the end of open enrollment. The mix of individuals who are
newly insured, as opposed to those who previously had coverage, it still remains unclear, with various sources quoting
anywhere from a low of 27% of individuals newly insured up to a high of 85%, with multiple data points suggesting it
might be somewhere in between.

With regard to Medicaid, available data indicates that 6.7 million individuals have gained coverage, which is up from 3
million at the time of our last earnings call. Now while the net number of newly insured remains somewhat of a
mystery, we can be confident that several million Americans have gained coverage in recent months, and this should
provide a positive secular trend in pharmacy volume growth for the next several years. Our experience to date with
respect to the combined impact of both public exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid is consistent overall with our
expectations and is expected to yield a modest benefit in 2014.
We continue to expand our focus on building strategic enterprise relationships with health plans, whether or not we're
the PBM. We support more than 25 commercial health plans, co-ops and Medicaid managed care organizations across
26 states as their PBM, and we expect this number to grow. We have also implemented preferred pharmacy networks
or Maintenance Choice in more than 20 states. And as we emphasized at our December Analyst Day, we are
well-positioned across the enterprise to partner with health plans in a variety of ways. And we're actively helping them
advance their strategies in their respective markets while growing our enterprise share.
Now let me update you on our ten-year agreement with Cardinal Health that builds upon our combined sourcing
expertise. As you're aware, last month we completed the formation of Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic sourcing
entity here in the U.S. and located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. And at that time, employees and functional
responsibilities were transitioned from CVS Caremark and Cardinal to Red Oak Sourcing. And as we work together to
get the venture up and running, we further refined certain aspects of our agreement. And the structure of the final
agreement is slightly different than what we've talked about previously, so Dave will walk through how the venture
works during his financial review, highlighting the three ways in which the venture is expected to deliver value. So we
remain excited about Red Oak and we look forward to its future contributions.
Moving to our PBM business, I'll start with an update on the 2015 selling season. And as we noted on our last call, the
marketplace has been active. Pricing remains competitive yet rational, and I'm pleased to report that to date we have
been very successful in this selling season. Gross wins for 2015 currently stand at $5.4 billion and span across all client
segments, while net new business stands at $2.6 billion. And this net new number includes business lost through
acquisition which makes up more than 60% of the lost business. These net new business numbers do not account for
any impact from our individual Med D prescription drug plan which I'll touch on a little later.
As for renewals, we've completed nearly 70% of the $26 billion in business up for renewal, with a retention rate of
nearly 97%. Now I think our selling season success reflects our track record of generating savings for our clients
through our unique suite of capabilities. Top of mind for clients this selling season is achieving better control of their
specialty spend. Among our clients, specialty represents about 22.5% of total drug spend under the pharmacy benefit
and projections have this continuing to grow at a mid-teens rate. Now all specialty spend, including that paid under the
medical benefit, will likely grow to as much as 50% of total drug spend by 2018. So I think you can see it is critical that
we bring meaningful solutions to the challenges.
Our Specialty business remains strong in the second quarter, as revenues were up about 53% year over year. In addition
to benefits from new business and the addition of Coram, another driver of specialty revenue growth was Sovaldi, the
new hep C drug. There are estimated to be roughly 3 million people in the U.S. requiring treatment and as everyone
knows, the potential cost of treatment is very high.
As you might imagine, the growing costs in this category are of significant concern to our clients, and we have a
number of programs in place to ensure appropriate utilization and cost management. And as competing products
become available late this year and next, we will look for opportunities to introduce formulary management to further
drive down costs.
At CVS Caremark we continue to differentiate our Specialty offerings in the marketplace with a goal of providing a
high level of clinical support to patients while managing trends for our clients and driving continued share gains. As an
example, our Specialty Connect offering has been rolled out. It's been well received by both clients and patients, and
you'll recall that Specialty Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities, providing choice and convenience for
patients while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. No other PBM can offer this
today.

And as of late July, more than 60,000 Specialty patients have been transitioned to the Specialty service model, which
again, offers enhanced clinical and benefit support. The program is generating high satisfaction scores with patients, it
resonates with clients as a differentiated approach to simplifying the Specialty process for members, and physicians
appreciate the ease-of-use in getting patients started on therapy.
Our medical pharmacy management program also continues to enjoy strong interest and uptake in the marketplace,
with several new implementations underway. And our site of care offering through our Coram Infusion business
enables us to provide patients more convenient, low cost alternatives to hospital infusions, whether at the physician's
office, a retail infusion site, or even the patient's home.
The Coram organization has been fully integrated into the Specialty group and our new capabilities have been a topic
of discussion in the current selling season for Specialty business on a carve-in or stand-alone basis. So we remain
optimistic that we can continue to gain Specialty Pharmacy share as we work to develop innovative offerings that
capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality and access.
Another important way that we manage trend for clients is through our highly proactive approach to formulary
management which, as you'll recall, we introduced to the marketplace back in 2011 for the 2012 plan year. Since then,
we've updated our formulary on an annual basis with a mission of being able to manage trend for our clients while
providing comprehensive, cost-effective, and clinically appropriate options for their plan members.
Now building on our formulary success of the last three years, we recently notified our clients that we will be removing
22 products, in addition to select diabetes test strips, for the 2015 formulary. And from 2012 through 2015, our rigorous
approach to formulary management is expected to result in total savings to our clients of more than $3.5 billion.
Before turning to Retail, let me touch briefly on our Med D PDP, SilverScript. As expected, we currently have
approximately 3 million lives in our individual PDP and for the first half of 2014, our normal monthly attrition has
been only partially offset by choosers and auto-assignees. And as we came out of sanction earlier this year, we began to
enroll choosers in February and receive dual auto-assignees in May.
Additionally, as the dual demonstration projects continue to progress in certain states, we do expect to see some
transition of dual eligible lives through the second half of this year. And while we may recapture some of these lives
through our health plan partners, it is likely we will lose a modest number of lives as a result. So we expect to end the
year with about 2.9 million lives in our individual PDP, and we continue to see significant opportunity to grow the
individual PDP business over the long-term.
As a matter of fact, last Thursday we received the preliminary benchmark results from CMS for 2015 and I'm pleased
to report that SilverScript was below the benchmark, and therefore qualified, in 32 of the 34 regions. The only regions
we didn't qualify were Alaska and Nevada, consistent with prior years. So these strong benchmark results should enable
us to retain the vast majority of the auto-assignees we currently serve, so we're very pleased with the outcome.
Moving on to the Retail business, following the effects of the difficult weather and flu season that we experienced in
Q1, total same-store sales reaccelerated sequentially in Q2, increasing 3.3%. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5%
versus a year ago, and were negatively impacted by about 160 basis points due to recent generic introductions.
Pharmacy comps were also negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the transfer of specialty
scripts from our retail segment to our PBM segment as a result of the new Specialty Connect offering, and Dave will
talk more about that later. Pharmacy script comps increased 3.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis, and we continue to gain
pharmacy share.
I want to touch on a topic that has received a lot of attention lately based on some competitor commentary; that being
generic inflation and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. You'll recall that when we gave our 2014 guidance last
December, we told you that we expected continued pressure on pharmacy reimbursement, and the market is generally
consistent with what we anticipated. As to generic inflation, while the cost of goods inflation does exist on some
generic items, it is not material in the context of our overall purchasing volume and again, was generally within our
expectations.

Page 5 of 19
On balance, the deflationary nature of the generic pharmaceutical market remains intact, and overall, our pharmacy
margins increased this quarter for multiple reasons, were in line with our expectations and again, Dave will talk more
about this in the financial review.
As for the front store business, comps decreased 0.4%. Our front store comps were positively impacted by
approximately 80 basis points from the shift of the Easter holiday and as we planned for exiting the tobacco category
this fall, we have begun to see a sales impact. Front store comps would have been approximately 110 basis points
higher if you exclude tobacco in the estimated associated basket sales. Now adjusting for this tobacco impact and the
Easter shift, front store comps were roughly flat in the quarter sequentially improving from Q1.
Front store traffic declined as customers continued to aggregate their trips and at the same time our average basket size
continued to increase, reflecting the strength of our loyalty program and the personalization it enables us to offer. And
consistent with our prior statements we are making responsible investments in profitable promotions and remain
committed to not chasing empty sales.
Driving higher margin store brand sales continues to be another area of focus. We saw notable growth in share gains in
store brands this quarter with store brands as a percent of front store sales increasing about 80 basis points to 18%, and
we see significant opportunities to continue to expand our share of store brand products by building on our core
equities in Health and Beauty while also seeking opportunistic growth in other areas.
Additionally, in order to drive better results, we continue to explore innovative personalization strategies through
insights from ExtraCare. As an example, during second quarter we expanded our Send-to-Card digital coupon option
for all ExtraCare personalized offers that were historically only available either at the ExtraCare coupon center or on
the bottom of a customer's register receipt. Adoption has been very strong, with over half of our registered users
already trying this new feature and we also continue to turbocharge our personalized email promotions with our active
email subscriber list, growing 21% versus the same quarter last year.
Turning to our retail drugstore program, we opened 34 new stores, relocated eight and closed four, resulting in 30 net
new stores in the quarter and we're on track to achieve square footage growth of 2% to 3% for the year.
In the quarter, we recently announced that we have a definitive agreement to purchase Navarro Discount Pharmacy.
Navarro is the largest Hispanic-owned drugstore chain in the U.S. with 33 retail drugstore locations in the Miami-Dade
County area, in addition to Navarro Health Services, a specialty pharmacy serving patients with complex or chronic
diseases.
We expect to maintain the current product mix, and will learn from our Navarro colleagues about Hispanic marketing
and merchandising, and we expect these lessons to be transferable to certain other CVS markets.
The Navarro brand is one of the most recognizable in the Hispanic marketplace. We plan to retain it. If you recall we
adopted a similar strategy in maintaining the Long's Drug name for our acquired locations in Hawaii. That has been
successful and we expect to complete the Navarro transaction later this year.
Let me touch briefly on MinuteClinic which continues on its healthy growth trajectory. In the second quarter revenues
increased 24% versus a year ago. We opened 32 net new clinics in the quarter, bringing our total to 60 year-to-date, and
keeping us on track to open at least 150 new clinics this year. We currently operate 860 clinics in 28 states plus the
District of Columbia and in recent news, a new partnership with USA football named MinuteClinic their official retail
medical clinic and sports physical provider, and we will offer a special discount for sports physicals to more than
1,000,000 young athletes and their coaches. CVS Caremark and MinuteClinic also added four new health system
alliances during the quarter and another four in July, bringing our total number of affiliations with major U.S. health
systems to 40.
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.

David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone.
As I typically do, I'll begin this morning by highlighting how our disciplined approach to capital allocation continues to
enhance shareholder value. I'll follow that discussion with a detailed review of our strong second quarter followed by
an update on our guidance. So let's begin.
During the second quarter we continued our long track record of paying quarterly dividends to our shareholders with
payments totaling $322 million. With a strong earnings outlook for the remainder of this year, we expect our dividend
payout ratio to surpass 25% at some point during 2014. We're making continued good progress toward achieving our
35% payout target by 2018.
Additionally we repurchased 16 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $74.91 per share.
Year-to-date we've repurchased more than 27 million shares for $2 billion, and we still expect to complete at least $4
billion of share repurchases for the full-year 2014.
So between dividends and share repurchase, we've returned more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the second
quarter alone, and have returned more than $2.6 billion during the first half of this year. Our goal has been to return
more than $5 billion in 2014 and we remain on track to meet that goal.
As, Larry, said, we generated nearly $400 million of free cash in the second quarter, bringing our total for the first six
months of the year to approximately $2.2 billion. The key driver continues to be our healthy growth and earnings,
coupled with improvements in our working capital performance, fueled mainly by the PBM's growth.
All in we continue to expect to generate free cash of between $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion in 2014.
Turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.13 per share, up
16.5% versus LY and $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance range. This strong performance reflects solid growth
across all of our operating segments. The retail segment produced results at the high-end of our expectations, while the
enterprise's outperformance was driven primarily by better-than-expected results from the PBM. GAAP diluted EPS
was $1.06 per share.
And now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis revenues in the second quarter increased
10.7% or approximately $3.4 billion to $34.6 billion. PBM net revenues increased 16.2% or approximately $3 billion to
$21.8 billion. This strong performance was driven by net new business, specialty pharmacy growth, drug inflation and
product mix. Offsetting this to some degree were lower mail choice claims, reflecting the decline in traditional mail
order volumes, and an increase in generic dispensing. The PBM's generic dispensing rate increased approximately 180
basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 82%.
Now revenues in the Retail business increased 4.5% in the quarter or approximately $730 million to $16.9 billion. Sales
in the Retail segment were better than expected, driven primarily by branded drug inflation as well as volumes. Retail
GDR increased by approximately 160 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013 to 84%.
Let me point out that, with the second quarter results, we have begun to experience the type of shift between segments
that I highlighted at past Analyst Days. As you know, our focus isn't limited to just one channel, mail or retail, as it is
for many of our competitors. Our channel and business segment agnostic offerings will enhance the performance of the
enterprise and sometimes at the expense of one individual segment. For that reason, recall that we have been suggesting
that you focus on the growth of the enterprise rather than the individual segments to best gauge our success. And with
the implementation of Specialty Connect this past quarter, we essentially transferred revenues out of the Retail
Pharmacy segment and into the PBM segment, as the PBM took over the dispensing of nearly all specialty
prescriptions filled by CVS Caremark.
As anticipated, the transition had a larger impact on sales dollars than scripts, given the high cost of specialty drugs.
The impact on sales dollars in the second quarter was approximately $145 million, and this impact will grow larger as
we ramp up in the third and fourth quarters. Obviously the shift dampened year-over-year top line growth at Retail,

while enhancing revenue growth in the PBM. And as Larry said, it had an approximately 130 basis point negative
impact on Retail Pharmacy comps, but it had an insignificant impact on Retail script volume.
Now turning to gross margin, the consolidated company posted an 18.3% margin in the quarter, a decline of
approximately 40 basis points compared to Q2 of 2013. This margin decline was the result of a mix shift as the lower
margin PBM segment grew faster than the Retail segment, but both operating segments saw their margins improve.
Additionally, margins benefited from the finalization of California's Medicaid reimbursement rates, which I referenced
on our last earnings call. This finalization benefited Retail gross margin by $53 million in the quarter and PBM gross
margin by $16 million. This impact was consistent with the guidance we provided earlier this year.
Within the PBM segment, gross margins increased approximately 35 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to
5.5%, while gross profit dollars increased approximately 24% year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was
primarily driven by growth in our specialty business, favorable purchasing economics and the increase in GDR. We
continue to see these positive margin drivers partially offset by typical client price compression.
Now gross margin in the Retail segment was 31.4%, up 40 basis points over LY. Gross profit dollars increased 5.9%
year-over-year. Pharmacy margins improved in the quarter as we benefited from the increase in GDR and the
finalization of the reduction in California's Medicaid reimbursement rates that I noted earlier. Our pharmacy margins
notably improved even without the impact of this rate finalization.
At the same time, we saw front store margins decline, as anticipated in the quarter, driven mainly by the markdown of
some tobacco products as well as the unexpected bankruptcy of one of our vendors.
Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues improved by approximately 50 basis points from Q2 of 2013 to
11.9%, while total SG&A dollars grew by 6.4%. The PBM segment's expenses grew by 10% and its SG&A rate was
1.5%, an improvement of approximately ten basis points versus LY.
In the Retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales declined approximately 20 basis points to 21.3% while expenses
grew by 5.6%. This reflects the deleveraging effect of generics as well as the impact of Specialty Connect as the retail
segment transitions sales to the PBM segment without a corresponding expense reduction.
Within the corporate segment, expenses were up $29 million to $205 million. This increase was primarily related to
benefit costs as well as strategic initiatives.
Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately five basis points to 6.4%.
Operating margin in the PBM improved approximately 45 basis points to 4%. Now operating margin at Retail
improved about 20 basis points to 10.1%.
For the quarter, PBM operating profit was strong, growing 30.1%, which was higher than expected. Retail operating
profit increased a very healthy 6.5% at the high end of our expectations.
Now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter increased
approximately $32 million from last year to $158 million. The debt we issued in the fourth quarter of LY was the
primary driver of this increase. Our weighted average share count was 1.17 billion shares, and finally our effective tax
rate was 39.2%.
Now let me update you on our guidance. As always, I'll focus on the highlights. You can find the additional details of
our guidance in the slide presentation that we posted on our website earlier this morning.
As we stated in the press release, we are both raising and narrowing our full-year 2014 EPS ranges given our strong
results to date. We currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in 2014 in the range of $4.43 to $4.51,
reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 11.75% to 14%, and that's excluding the gain of approximately $0.04
associated with the legal settlement in the third quarter of 2013. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is
expected to be in the range of $4.16 to $4.24.

While we beat the high end of our guidance in the second quarter by $0.02, we increased the top of the range for the
year by $0.01. This delta reflects a few moving pieces, among them the minor shift in timing associated with the fixed
payment we will receive from Cardinal as well as a slightly higher tax rate. As Larry said, the structure of the final
agreement is a bit different from what we had previously described. So let me explain how the venture works.
There are three ways in which the arrangement can provide value to us. First, as we previously stated, we will receive a
fixed quarterly payment from Cardinal that recognizes the greater relative purchasing volume that CVS Caremark has
today. Under the final agreement, we will receive 39 quarterly payments of $25.6 million beginning in the fourth
quarter of this year, rather than 40 quarterly payments of $25 million which would have begun in the third quarter this
year. There is no change in the overall value of the fixed payments. It's simply a timing shift that more accurately
reflects the operational ramp-up associated with this venture.
Second, there is a new component to our arrangement providing the potential for additional predetermined quarterly
payments from Cardinal to CVS Caremark beginning in the third quarter of 2015. These payments will only occur to
the extent that certain milestones are achieved.
And finally, as we have explained previously, we believe there will be incremental value to our current generic
procurement created through the combination of our purchasing volumes.
So while the fixed payments will now begin a quarter later than originally planned, the overall value of the fixed
payments remains the same, and the potential for incremental value resulting from the venture remains high. So we
continue to be excited about this venture and we look forward to its future contributions.
And with that, turning back to 2014 full-year guidance, we now expect consolidated net revenue growth to be in the
range of 8% to 9%, raising the midpoint by approximately 260 basis points over our prior guidance. We've increased
our top line outlook in the PBM and now expect revenue growth of 13.75% to 14.75%, approximately five percentage
points higher than our prior guidance. This revised guidance reflects our expectations for better-than-expected growth
within Specialty Pharmacy, fueled by a combination of both inflation and new product mix.
Additionally, taking into account our performance in the second quarter, we are narrowing the top line outlook at
Retail, raising the bottom end of the range, and we now expect growth of 1.25% to 2% and consistent with that outlook,
we're also revising our guidance for total same-store sales and now expect growth of between 0.25% and 1%. Keep in
mind that these anticipated revenue growth rates reflect our expectations around the impact from our decision to exit
the tobacco category. Larry mentioned the impact to Q2 comps as we approach our target date to be out of the category
in the fall. We expect the impact to grow.
For the full year of 2014, the impact could be as high as 400 basis points on front store comps. And given what we've
seen to date, we expect front-store comps could be negatively impacted by 400 to 500 basis points in Q3, and roughly
double that in Q4. So when you lay out your models, please keep this in mind.
Guidance for operating profit growth in our segments has also been revised. We are narrowing retail operating profit by
25 basis points from both ends. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 7.25% to 8.5% year-over-year. And in
the PBM, given the outperformance in Q2 and increased confidence in the back half of the year, we now expect
operating profit to increase 12.5% to 14.5%.
As for our tax rate this year, we now expect it to be approximately 39.4%.
With the narrowing and raising of our EPS guidance range, operating cash flow guidance also changes. We now expect
between $7.2 billion and $7.5 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of $200 million. And as I said before, our free
cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion, as we expect capital expenditures to
be slightly higher than we originally planned.
Now in the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.11 to $1.14 per share, reflecting
growth of 5.25% to 8.25% versus Q3 of 2013, again after removing the gain associated with the legal settlement from
last year's results. GAAP diluted EPS from continued operations is expected to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.07 in the
third quarter.

Within the Retail segment, we expect revenues to grow 0.25% to 1.75% versus the third quarter of last year. Adjusted
script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3.75% to 4.75%, while we expect total same-store sales in the
range of down 1% to up 0.5%. As I noted before, if sales of tobacco in the associated baskets are excluded, our
expectations for front store comps in the quarter will be 400 basis points to 500 basis points higher. In the PBM, we
expect revenue growth of 14.25 and 15.25%, driven by continued strong growth in Specialty, mix and inflation. We
expect Retail operating profit growth of 7% to 9% in the third quarter. We expect PBM operating profit growth of 1.5%
to 4.5% in the third quarter.
So in closing, this was a great quarter with strong financial results across the board and as a result, we both raised and
narrowed our guidance for the full-year, and we continue to expect strong free cash flow and to deploy it in a way that
maximizes value to our shareholders.
And with that, let me turn it back over to Larry.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thanks, Dave, and I couldn't be happier with the work of our colleagues, the work that they are doing to provide
good service to our clients and help people on their path to better health while delivering strong results for our
shareholders. And, I think as we've talked this morning and in prior meetings, our unmatched enterprise assets are
enabling us to provide innovative integrated solutions and breakthrough products and as the healthcare environment
evolves, we are uniquely positioned to address the quality, affordability and accessibility challenges in the healthcare
system today. So we're highly focused on the unique opportunities we see for growth and we'll continue to take an
active and growing role in shaping the future of healthcare.
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions. Operator?
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Hey, Larry. So strategic question, when you think about Specialty Connect, how is that
starting to impact your dialogue with potential customers? And with that in mind, how do you think that will impact
your ability to reduce drug spend? And does it become a game changer, in terms of market share on the PBM side with
new accounts?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, well, good morning, John. I'll start and then I think Jon will probably jump in as well.
And I think that we really have a surround sound Specialty program. Okay? I mean, we highlighted Specialty Connect
this morning, and I think that's one important component. But I think our ability to, not just manage the Specialty drug,
but manage the Specialty patient, I think, is what is the real differentiator in the marketplace. And I'll let Jon pick up
from there and talk about the various ways we're doing that.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, so, John, as I talk to clients about Specialty Connect, what they really like is
opening up the access, because Specialty has historically been a mail order only access for their members, with some
retail outlets, but not really that accessible. And as clients become more focused on it, they're really excited about this
capability and they think of it like Maintenance Choice, that, as you know, has been very successful in the marketplace.
And one of our customers is also physicians. So as we talk to physicians, they like the fact that we're opening up
convenience for their patients. And Specialty today has its business with our PBM clients, but there's also a big open
market in Medicare and fee-for-service Medicaid that, again, physicians have the ability to influence where those
members go.

So we expect to grow within our PBM base through clients selecting us because of these integrated capabilities, but we
also believe we're going to get a disproportionate amount of referrals from physicians as well.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. And then, how much of an issue is compliance in that business? And therefore, is
that a significant opportunity on the broader cost side?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: As you look at adherence, when you say compliance, I'm thinking adherence to the
medication. Historically, Retail has performed very much under what traditional specialty pharmacies have been able to
perform at. And with Specialty Connect, we have achieved the same levels of adherence with our Specialty Connect
patients that we have with our specialty pharmacies, because we're able to connect all the clinical capabilities and back
ends of specialty.
I know that is a concern that pharma had when we talked to them, but we've showed them results and have actually
demonstrated an even higher level of adherence, because now patients can select which channel they go to. So we think
we've solved that and it's a real benefit.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for the questions. Larry, I wanted to go back to your comments on prescription
utilization. You touched on a little bit of what you were seeing from ACA and Medicaid expansion. As I look at the
script growth in the quarter, 3.9% exceeding the guidance. It looks like the guide for the next quarter is 3.75% to
4.75%, so a little bit of an acceleration. Could you maybe just parse out a little bit what you're seeing from ACA but
also from the broader market utilization?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Bob, I think the broader market I think we're seeing utilization pretty flat, I think, from
the exchanges. I think as we have previously talked, I think we're seeing more of a benefit coming out of the Medicaid
expansion. I think there's still some uncertainty, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, in terms of when you look at
the exchange population, just how many of those are incremental to health insurance coverage?
So I think we've talked about the fact that we see 2014 as a transition year. As we mentioned earlier, we do believe
there's a modest benefit, more of it coming from Medicaid in 2014, but I think that we certainly see this ramping up as
we move into 2015 and beyond.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: That's helpful. And I guess just a quick follow-up on the formulary changes you commented
on. I think at the Analyst Day, you mentioned that in 2014 you'd save clients about $1 billion. I believe the update
today was from 2012 to 2015, it's $3.5 billion. I guess just maybe if you could isolate the most recent changes, and
what kind of savings those would generate? And then I guess more broadly and more importantly, how successful have
you been in shifting clients to these more restrictive formularies?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Bob, we're not going to provide any more granular information in terms of to the first part of
your question.
I think in terms of the second part, we have been able to manage transition across members as well as physicians in a
very seamless fashion. Recognize that the formulary changes that we're talking about affect a very small percent of our
member base, and that has allowed us to do a lot of, I'll call it seamless transition, in terms of making it a nonevent for
the patient as well as the physician.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: This is Jon. The only thing that I would add is that we expect pharmacy trend,
year-over-year growth of the pharmacy spend, to grow due to continued AWP inflation, increasing utilization that we

just spoke about, and the growth in Specialty. We're seeing clients very open and much more receptive than they have
been historically about narrowing formularies. So we're up to about 95 exclusions now. I'll tell you as we're making
these decisions, and these decisions are made through a clinical filter that's reviewed by our P&T Committee,
[Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee], we are still generating tremendous value for our clients each year, and we
think there continues to be opportunity, particularly in Specialty.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great. Thanks for the comments.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Good morning. I have one question about the front end and then Eric Percher will have a
question.
I was just – I know you've talked about the weakness in traffic in the front end as a function of people consolidating
trips. I was just wondering if you could talk – and of course your own initiatives, but if you could talk a little bit about
what you think is going on both with the consumer, are they in fact, pulling back? And whether you've seen any
changes in the competitive environment, anybody responding to weak traffic?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Meredith, I don't think we're seeing any changes in the consumer. I think that the
consumer continues to be a cautious purchaser of products. At the same time, I don't think we've seen a change in the
competitive environment. We still see an awful lot of promotion across competitors. And as we mentioned earlier,
we're continuing to be very disciplined about, and quite frankly find that sweet spot. Oftentimes we talk about the art
and science in terms of investment spending to drive traffic, but to be able to do that in such a way that we're driving
profitable sales.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: I will just jump in and agree with that, Meredith. I think it's fairly consistent with what
we've been talking about on the last couple of calls, consumers still a bit cautious. Where we really are focused is
health, beauty and personal care. And we continue to be encouraged by our performance in those categories.
Clearly our decision on tobacco drove some changes as you look at our share in the general merchandise business, but
overall, I would say competitors continue to be promoting more than they were last year, and more than we are. So
we're watching that carefully. We're really trying to make smart choices so at the end of the day we're driving profitable
growth.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. And, Eric, you had a question.
<Q - Eric R Percher>: Quickly, on Specialty Connect, are most of the lives that are moving over from the Pharmacy
to PBM open market today? Is that primarily who is served at the Pharmacy. And then the lives that we see in Specialty
Connect beyond the movement over, have you begun to see traction in expanding the program? Or is that over the next
several months?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Eric so the mix of customers that are moving over is a combination of open and lives that
we have. So as we think about growing Specialty Connect it's going to be by driving a higher share of open lives which
we'll do through working with physicians, and it's through new client wins as new clients decide to move to us because
of all of our integrated capabilities, Specialty Connect which is one of those.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Eric, the other thing that I think you'll find interesting, Jon touched on it or made the analogy of
Specialty Connect and Maintenance Choice and what we've seen out of the gate is about 50% of the customers choose
to pick up the specialty script at retail, which ironically is very consistent with what we saw from Maintenance Choice
when we first piloted the program a few years back.
<Q - Eric R Percher>: That is interesting. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Can you give us some additional color on the growth at 90 days at
retail? And where do you think we are in – kind of like in that market shift?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Ricky, we have continued to see accelerated growth in 90-day scripts. I would say it's
growing much faster than the 30-day bucket, if you will, and today it represents about, I think it's 29% of our retail
prescription pie, if you will.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And when we think about the opportunity, is the opportunity for that is 50% to 60%
of the scripts you're presenting kind of like the maintenance scripts? Is that how we should be thinking about it?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: I think you have it right in terms of how you're thinking about the maintenance bucket of
scripts versus the acute side and I think it's reasonable to expect it to continue its growth trajectory as we've seen the
last couple of years.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay and then one follow up on generic inflation: obviously you've done a very good job in
mitigating the impact. Can you share with us your expectations for generic inflation for the remainder of the year and
any thoughts if this is sustainable, a trend that will continue just longer-term?
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, Ricky, this is Dave. We don't really provide a forecast for generic inflation. I'll just
make one comment just from the nature of the generic marketplace. We're encouraged, obviously, with the joint
venture that we've created with Cardinal but also encouraged that we believe strongly that the generic marketplace is
long-term a deflationary market and we believe that we're well-positioned to work hard in that marketplace to lower
our cost and also lower the cost for our clients and the patients that we serve.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Ricky.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So first, I wanted some clarity on the PBM
operating growth in the third quarter. Just remind us what – it's quite a bit less than we saw in the second quarter, so I
was hoping to just get reminded on why we get some deceleration there?
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, Scott, this is Dave. If you recall back to – even to Analyst Day we fully expected that
Q3 was going to be our softest quarter from a growth perspective so this is very much in line with that expectation.
Clearly the cadence of profitability is tied to really two events, is the timing of break-open generics and when they
overlap to LY and secondly, the timing of profitability as we cycle through Medicare Part D. So both of those events
are impacting Q3 and consistent as we thought they would impact Q3.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: That's perfect. And then my second question really goes to thinking about the asset and the
asset turns as we move into the future, not next year but as we move out. It seems like CVS and CVS Caremark is
uniquely positioned to kind of improve their asset turns and with the clinics, with Specialty Connect can you guys take
us out into the future? What will a store, if you even want to call it a store, three to five years look like as we move out?
Do you guys have any thoughts around that? I know it's kind of a pie-in-the-sky question, but I was wondering if you
have any thoughts there?

<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Scott, I think I'll start and others may jump in here. But I think your hypothesis is correct
and it is going to evolve from what exists today. And we've talked a lot about the fixed asset base within the store and
the fact that, that next prescription has a disproportionate flow-through to the bottom line. At the same time we do see
opportunities to extend the pharmacy experience into the front of store, and I think that, Helena has begun some work,
some exciting work in terms of the opportunities that, that creates.
So we're certainly not in a position where we've cracked the code on that or we're ready to talk about it other than the
fact that I do think that you will see something different in the future from what you see today.
<A - David M. Denton>: Scott, this is Dave. I think the most, at least midterm opportunity we have to improve asset
turns, if you will, first is one kind of just the growth of the service model to the degree that we grow services in our
outlets. We do that without deploying a bunch of capital from an asset perspective. And then secondly, as we've talked
about many times, we do have opportunities from an inventory perspective and making sure that we maximize, I'll say,
the supply chain across all of our channels would be important to us over the long-term.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Scott.

Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Great. Thank you. Jon, I was wondering if I could just maybe start with some questions around the
selling season, $5.4 billion of gross new wins. Can you just talk about what people are buying this year? Are you seeing
Maintenance Choice, Specialty? Is there any way that you can give us some metrics around who those new clients are
and what programs they bought for 2015?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Well, Lisa, we're obviously very happy with this year's selling season, and when you
look at the mix of clients, I think it's very balanced with employers, health plans and government business. And I can't
really point to really any one program that has moved up in their priority other than Specialty. But we now continue to
expand our integrated offerings, and many of which are unique, such as Maintenance Choice and Specialty Connect,
Pharmacy Advisor, and MinuteClinic, and all those combined resonate. And then we talk about our ability to be able to
touch members and influence their behavior and impact outcomes, which results in lower prices to the client, that
continues to resonate.
And I think I've probably seen a little more interest in Specialty, which has become the top priority in the marketplace,
and I believe our assets are unmatched. We talked about Specialty Connect earlier, but we also have Accordant, which
is a rare disease management company that we link to our specialty offering, and that treats not just rare specialty
disease states but it treats the comorbidities, and most of these patients have other diseases that they're dealing with.
We've talked in the past about NovoLogix, half the spend in the medical benefit not really being managed, we have that
capability. Home infusion people are very interested in it as well, moving people out of expensive of hospital settings
into their homes, or infusion clinics.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: I guess really what I'm trying to get at is more on the other side, Jon. As we think about 2015 and
things that they've signed up for, how does that impact profitability of this client? So do the majority sign-up for your
specialty programs? Did you see people that were electing to do Maintenance Choice? I'm trying to get at more of the
finance side of it.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: I would say it's pretty consistent with what we've seen in prior years. So with health plans
probably don't take as many of our programs as employers do. We are seeing more uptake in our formulary strategy
than we have seen in the past. Maintenance Choice 2.0, we're beginning to see uptake in the health plans that

Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Can you please talk about the joint venture with Cardinal? And I guess there's some new
aspects to it. Like just at a very high level, what sort of a nature of those incremental milestones might be? And I'm
assuming that if those milestones are met, it would mean more earnings for all parties involved. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, David, good morning. And I guess I'll just start by saying that when we formalized the
JV agreement, we had established some guiding principles that spoke to the goals of the entity: to reduce costs for our
clients, our customers, while making the supply chain more efficient and to create win-win opportunities such that
there's equity and fairness in the value that gets created. So obviously, over the past six months, we've had a lot more
time to dig into the data. And it simply made sense to modify the agreement with those guiding principles that I
outlined in mind.
We're not going to provide any granularity around some of those milestones, but I think we have had a terrific
relationship with Cardinal for many years. I think that that's what led to the JV being created. And I couldn't be more
pleased with how the teams from CVS Caremark and Cardinal have come together in the spirit of, how do we improve
efficiency and drive down costs? And I think we're off to a terrific start.

Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey. Good morning, Larry and Dave, and thanks for taking the question. Dave, I just want to
quick check. I heard one point that you brought up. Did you say you expected long-term generic drugs to be
inflationary or deflationary? Part of that broke up at my end.
<A - David M. Denton>: I'm sorry. Very much deflationary, George.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. And then, maybe delving into the prepared comments a bit more, it sounds like you're
seeing inflation in a small book of the business and then deflation, significant deflation, in the rest of the book. And I
would ask, are you seeing that deflation in acquisition cost? And is that deflation finding its way all the way to the list
price or the AWP price, from your perspective?
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, George. This is Dave. Maybe I'll start. Clearly what we're signed up to do is, our
purpose in life is to work to reduce costs for the clients that we serve and the members that we serve that either use us
via mail order or use us in our retail outlets or use us in various and sundry other matters. And so, when we look at
generic inflation, our focus is to control that and to push down those cost of goods sold at this point in time.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, George, I think as Dave pointed out, overall we see a deflationary nature in the generic
environment, and we're really not going to comment on specific products or AWPs.

having significant selling success tacking MinuteClinic on to health plans [ph] that affect (1:02:37) the zero co-pay
option this selling season. I guess, can you talk about expected growth from MinuteClinic as we look out to 2015?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: I think, as we pointed out this morning, we continue to see significant growth. Some of that is
organic, in terms of the ongoing growth of existing clinics and some of that is being driven by our expansion. We said
earlier we'll open about 150 clinics this year. I think it certainly is a discussion in the selling season. I think that the
ticket-to-the-game metrics are being right on price and service. But we've got a lot of other elements with which we can
offer clients, the MinuteClinic option being one, and one that is getting a lot of attention.
<Q - George R. Hill>: All right. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Good morning, guys, and congrats. If we look at the pacing of wins in the selling season, one of
your competitors was suggesting that, as it tailed off and that as we look into the out year, the momentum of their peers,
inclusive of you, was waning. If we looked at like your hit rate, your win rate, over the course of the selling season, was
it fairly consistent? Did you feel like you gained momentum as you put up some of these big wins? It seems like more
recently, we've seen a number of public names of size. I'm just trying to get a sense for a kind of tone, and how like you
feel like the business had momentum through the most recent RFPs you've been in?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Ross, I would say we're continuing to win in the marketplace. I think this year has been
particularly good, and I think it has a lot to do with everything I was talking about to Lisa with our integrated assets,
our ability to deliver costs has a lot to do with what we do with generics in our formulary strategy and the fact that we
focus on service to both our clients and their members. So, they like our story and we're very happy with the wins that
we've had this year.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: And maybe, Dave, M&A activity has picked up. You guys have obviously been quite selective
and strategic the last few years. As you look at the environment, both in assets here and maybe also abroad, how would
you characterize the pipeline and your intent to maybe deploy a little bit more of the balance sheet? Obviously you've
done a great job on returning free cash, but you've also been historically pretty prudent on the tuck-in side.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, Ross. Obviously, M&A has been a part of our DNA for a long time in our company.
We've been very clear that, as we think about capital deployment, one area to deploy capital is in investing back
inorganically in our business, and we will continue to do that. I would say that, at the same time, we're going to be, to
your point, very disciplined in how we approach the market. If you look at our asset base today, we don't have any
glaring gaps or holes in capabilities at this point in time. But as we said, to the degree that we can bolt-on assets that
make sense, that we have line of sight to both synergies and returns, we'll do that, and I think the market is still active
from that perspective.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Great and congrats again, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Ross.

stop the retail tobacco sales may have helped you win some PBM business? I'm curious whether this has come up
frequently in RFPs and investment finals. Has anybody cited that they chose you specifically because of that decision?
I'm just curious on that. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Steve, I think it's hard to point to any one win and attribute it to the tobacco decision. I can tell
you that it's had a lot of discussion with our clients, obviously recognizing our clients and the fact that they are working
hard to get their members, or their employees, to stop smoking. They have applauded our decision, so listen, I think it's
one of those intangibles, that again, back to my earlier point about, you've got be right on the basics and then, once
you're right on the basics there, I think we have a lot of intangibles that collectively, I think, become something very
meaningful in the client's eyes.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay then. Just one other quick one on the formulary restrictions. Pretty topical this week,
but it seems a couple of years ago, this [ph] cause (1:07:39) would have been a negative PR for CVS back in
2011-2012, but now it seems like these changes are helping you, or at least the negativity seems almost nonexistent
now. So I guess I'm just curious, any thoughts or color you may have on why the psychology may have changed a little
bit among your customers, on the better receptivity to formulary changes now versus a few years ago?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Steve, it's a great question. I think, if we rewind three or four years, I think what we learned
with that decision was, the strategy was right. And I remember talking, as we talked to clients back in late 2011, early
2012, the issue that they had that created the negativity was from an execution, largely the timing of the
communication, that's where we were out of sync. We weren't lined up with their benefit cycle. So I think, once we
made that course correction, which was an easy one to fix, I think that all the noise subsided.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. That's great. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Hi. Thanks, guys. I appreciate all the discussion about 2015, but moving back to the tobacco
decision, is your view that it's still going to be about $2 billion in annualized sales that would be impacted by that
decision, or has that number changed given the fact that you talked about sort of double the 400 to 500 basis point
impact on same-store for the fourth quarter?
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yeah, we're still tracking very much towards that $2 billion. The results we're seeing are in
line with what we expected, and we said early on it would have a $0.06 to $0.09 impact this year and we're tracking
towards that.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: And in terms of the impact on the same-store in the fourth quarter, it seems like that would be a
bigger number?
<A - David M. Denton>: If you just look at what we communicated, we said that in third quarter that the exit at the
tobacco category would be somewhere between 400 and 500 basis points to front store comp impact, negatively
impact. And that, that rate would essentially double as we cycle into Q4 and so that's essentially how you should think
about modeling our progression of that.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Keep in mind that the $2 billion reflected tobacco sales, companion items within that basket,
and that is a full-year revenue number.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Just one left. Do have any guess or forecast in terms of what your share of the
Caremark accounts could be by year-end?
<A - David M. Denton>: Do you mean dispensing share within the CVS Pharmacy? Is that the question?
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Yes. CVS market share with Caremark plans. It was at 31% at the end of last year.
Where does that trend to?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, we don't have that; we don't forecast that and disclose that.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Would it be something you'd give us at the end of the year at the investor day?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Thanks for taking the question. I actually have another question on the exclusion list. It seems
like this time around from what I've read is you kind of adopted more of also using prior authorization versus outright
exclusion. Just curious on how you kind of make that decision.
And then secondly, how do you manage for drugs that you exclude where companies, where the manufacturers then try
to work around that? How do you can communicate with your clients? And how do you stop to make sure that your
plans don't really, that you don't end up actually paying for that or your employers?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, so, Charles, as far as manufacturers working around it, I think that's the beauty of
the exclusion program. They used to try to work around our formulary tiering through co-pay coupons. So once a drug
is excluded, the member would have to pay 100%, so it would be hard for a manufacturer to work around that. And our
strategy around excluding has really not changed. We've always had prior authorizations. We do have the ability if a
physician feels like a particular drug has a medical necessity, that they have the ability to get to that drug but it's a very,
very small percent of patients that have physicians that want to get them on a particular drug so it's really a safety outlet
for them.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great. And then just a follow up just on that in general. It seems like this is an area that not only
yourself, but some of your competitors are starting to really adopt more aggressively. Do you see that this is the next
big tool for you to use and to really help manage costs down? How do you see this – these lists expanding over time? Is
this a big opportunity for you?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: We have the template exclusion that we've been talking about, but we also have more
aggressive formularies that clients can opt into. So the next step-up excludes 170 drugs, and then there's another step
that excludes 300 drugs, which essentially is all generics. So we do see, as we move into the out years, we're going to
be moving towards some of the more restrictive formularies that we think clients are going to be very interested in. So
there's a lot our work and a lot more runway here.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Hi. Could you give us what the Specialty growth was organically excluding acquisitions?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: I don't think we have that. Mark, we can...
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, Mark. This is Dave. I don't know that we really had any significant acquisitions in that
number. Most of that is – other than Coram.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Coram's in there? Right? The...
<A - David M. Denton>: But other than that, but that's a pretty...
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay.
<A - David M. Denton>: I don't know it off the top of my head. The growth rate is still organically significant.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay. And then maybe just specifics on the generics, a little timing on how you look at
the break open market for generics here the next 12 months or so maybe by quarter, where you think we'll get some
better opportunities on generic margins.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, this is Dave. Maybe I'll touch that. I just want to say the generic launch and break
open schedule, you can watch the market. Those launch dates continue to evolve a bit, some move out, some move in
even since what we talked about at Analyst Day. And if you look at it, many of the 2014 launches have been in flux.
And as we look into 2015, I think some of the break open generics look a little bit lower than we originally planned
when we looked back at the Analyst Day in December of last year. But I would say it's still very fluid at this point in
time. We'll continue to kind of assess the situation and give you updates as it becomes pertinent.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: And second half of 2014 versus the first half of 2014, better or worse for generics?
<A - David M. Denton>: Just as we – you've got to think about how we cycle to LY. So if you look at the cycle of our
back half of this year to back half of last year, it's a little worse.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. Last question.

Our final question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank G. Morgan>: Good morning. I was hoping to get a little more color on the PDP guide for the balance of
the year. Is there any chance that there might be conservatism in the assumptions about the auto-assignees or the
choosers you're taking in? And basically give us a longer-term view, how you see next year playing out as well.
Thanks.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, hey, Frank. This is Dave. Maybe I'll start here. I think if you look at it just from a PDP
perspective, the number of lives, the real I guess opportunity to gain lives is early in the year. So I think if you look to
the balance of the year, I don't think there's a material change or opportunity that presents itself in the marketplace.
As we cycle into 2015, I think we're encouraged by what we heard from a benchmark perspective. I think that, although
that's what we've heard, we don't really know what the opportunities are at this point in time. I think we have a very

Okay. And just looking back on Mark's question on Specialty, in our remarks we said specialty growth was 53%. If you
back Coram out of that number, the growth was around 40%, so just bringing closure to that.
