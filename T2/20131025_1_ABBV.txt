Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong third quarter
results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. Our performance
demonstrates the strength and durability of our portfolio, as we delivered these results despite the continued impact of
generic competition on our lipid franchise. Today, we also raised our full year EPS guidance for 2013, reflecting the
high level of execution we've demonstrated this year.
As we embarked on this year, we set forth several key priorities for our business, including, a seamless transition to
operating as an independent entity, maximizing the performance of our current product portfolio, advancing our
pipeline, including our late-stage HCV program and other key assets and delivering operational efficiencies.
As we assess our progress, I believe we have met or exceeded expectations on our strategic objectives. I'm pleased with
the performance of our product portfolio including HUMIRA, which delivered more than 19% global operational
growth in the quarter. This strong growth was driven by several factors including continued robust market growth
resulting from increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies. Market share gains, particularly in
the GI segment where our UC launch is progressing ahead of our expectations. And we delivered this performance
despite the entry of new competitors into the category.
As we've indicated in the past, HUMIRA's broad label and new indications are a competitive advantage and UC is the
latest example of that. We've launched UC indication in a number of key countries and it quickly gained meaningful
market share and we're working to secure market access and reimbursement in a number of additional markets in the
coming months.
Today, in Western Europe, we're currently capturing roughly 25% of the UC market. And in the U.S., the UC
indication has contributed significantly to our strong performance in the IBD market as HUMIRA is now the
market-leading biologic in the GI category. We continue to pursue HUMIRA in several other indications which are
currently in late-stage developments.
Earlier this month, we presented Phase II data in patients with HS, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Our Phase
III trials are fully enrolled and we're targeting commercialization of this indication in the 2015 timeframe. Given the
lack of effective treatment options, we believe HS could represent a several hundred million dollar peak year
opportunity for us.
HUMIRA continues to gain or hold market share across all indications. As I mentioned earlier, our strong UC launch
has helped us attain the number one position in the GI category. We also hold the number one market share position in
dermatology. And we continue to hold steady share in rheumatology despite the entry of new competitors.
We've been very pleased with HUMIRA's exceptional performance this year and we're well on track to achieve our
2013 guidance for the product. Beyond HUMIRA, we also saw a strong performance from several other products
including Creon, Synthroid, Zemplar, Synagis and Duodopa. Though certainly not as high profile as HUMIRA, we've

been pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands.
In the quarter, we also made good progress on other key strategic objectives. We continue to drive operational
efficiencies including gross margin improvement, which Bill will discuss in more detail in his remarks. And we've
begun the process of creating our own efficient back office infrastructure that is more appropriate for an independent
biopharmaceutical company.
In addition to our strong commercial and operational performance, we've also made significant progress on our
pipeline, where we have placed a tremendous amount of focus. As we evaluate our pipeline prospects, including the
number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the healthiest it has ever been. In addition to assets
currently in late-stage such as HCV, daclizumab, elagolix, atrasentan and elotuzumab, we're on the cusp of
transitioning several additional programs into Phase III development, including but not limited to ABT-199 for CLL
and ABT-888 for select solid tumors. And we expect continued pipeline advancement between now and the end of
2014 including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings and new product approvals.
Let me now provide you with an overview of some of the key highlights in our pipeline.
We expect numerous HCV data milestones to be achieved, including the results from our six Phase III interferon-free
combination studies starting later this year and into early 2014. We'll also present data from these studies at EASL in
April and other medical meetings throughout the course of 2014.
We remain on track with our U.S. and EMA regulatory submissions in the second quarter of 2014, and in anticipation
of an early 2015 commercialization, we are actively building the appropriate infrastructure, including medical affairs
personnel and our sales organizations.
We'll present data from our Phase II HCV program in Asia and plan to start our Phase III program in Japan in the first
half of 2014. Japan represents the second largest HCV market globally and we believe we're well-positioned relative to
competitive offerings.
Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we plan to advance our 12-week 2 DDA treatment in this area. We
also have strong commercial presence in Japan which has been in place for a number of years.
We remain on track to start our Phase II studies of our next-generation HCV compounds by the end of this year. As a
reminder, our next-generation assets include a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493, and our new NS5A inhibitor
ABT-530. In preclinical studies, these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity
against key resistant mutants. These assets also support once-daily dosing, as well as the ability to co-formulate.
Commercialization of our next-generation compounds could occur in the 2017 timeframe.
Now moving to our oncology pipeline, we'll see continued dataflow from our Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199. The Phase II
single-agent study in previously treated CLL patients with 17p deletion, will likely read out at the end of 2014.
Additionally, the Phase III comparative study of ABT-199 plus Rituxan versus Rituxan plus chemotherapy in patients
with relapsed refractory CLL will begin in early 2014. The ongoing studies of ABT-199 will continue to collect data
and in 2014 we'll present data demonstrating the durability of the treatment effect. We also expect to present
combination treatment data as well as results from some of our going studies in other cancer types.
A number of our mid-stage studies of our PARP-inhibitor, ABT-888 will also read out in the coming months and
throughout 2014, beginning with data that will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium this
December.
From our neuroscience pipeline in 2014 we'll present data from our Alpha7 NNR agonist ABT-126, which is currently
being studied in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We will also see data
from the second of our two registrational studies for daclizumab in mid 2014. As a reminder that study, the DECIDE
trial, is somewhat unique in that it's designed to show reduction of annualized relapse rates and disability progression in
patients with relapsing, remitting multiple-sclerosis versus an active comparator.

Assuming favorable results, we plan to submit the regulatory application for daclizumab in the second half of 2014. We
will also see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies of elagolix in endometriosis in the second half of 2014.
And finally, we look forward to seeing Phase IIb data in RA from our partnered selected JAK1 inhibitor late next year.
We continue to augment our pipeline through a concerted focused effort on strategic licensing, acquisitions and
partnering activity. We've targeted large and growing specially focused therapeutic areas that enhance our current
franchises and our emerging pipelines. In the recent years, we have added more than a dozen promising assets to our
portfolio. Last month we announced two new collaborations.
First, we entered into a global licensing agreement with Ablynx to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-6 Nanobody
[anti-IL-6R Nanobody] for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Early clinical work in RA
has shown promise, and given the molecule's unique characteristics, we believe there is room for therapeutic
differentiation here. In addition, we entered into a global alliance with Galapagos to discover and develop novel
therapies for cystic fibrosis where there is still a significant unmet need.
In closing, as we approach the end of our first year as an independent company, we feel very good about the progress
we've made executing our key strategic priorities. We're pleased with our performance this quarter, where we saw
strength across our portfolio, including double-digit growth from HUMIRA and growth from a number of other
products. We're taking the necessary steps to build a more efficient organization, as we move to a fully independent
operating environment beginning in 2015, and we've made significant progress advancing our pipeline and look
forward to a number of key milestones in the months ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results. Bill?
William J. Chase
Thank you, Rick. This morning I'll start with an overview of our third quarter performance, and then I'll provide an
update to our 2013 outlook. In addition to delivering strong top line growth in the third quarter, we again exceeded our
earnings per share guidance. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, excluding non-cash intangible amortization
expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.60. Total sales in the third quarter increased
3.6% on an operational basis, which excludes an unfavorable 0.3% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor
and Trilipix, which are experiencing a loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 10.9% on an operational basis. Third
quarter growth was led by HUMIRA, which had global sales of nearly $2.8 billion, up 19.1%. As Rick mentioned, we
continued to see a positive impact from the launch of the UC indication, which has helped us gain significant share in
the global gastro market. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 22.3%, reflecting continued robust market expansion as
well as share gains in dermatology and gastroenterology.
Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 16% on an operational basis, with many markets continuing to grow strong
double-digits. Share gains and continued uptake of new indications are contributing to the growth. International sales in
the quarter also benefited to some extent from the timing of tenders. As a result, we're forecasting slower international
HUMIRA growth in the fourth quarter. AndroGel sales were $248 million in the third quarter, down 11.1% versus the
prior year, reflecting continued moderation of market growth, rebating actions from the second half of last year, and
certain account losses in early 2013. AndroGel remains the testosterone replacement market leader with more than 60%
share and achieved share gains in the last quarter.
As expected, all the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. U.S. sales of Niaspan
were $201 million, down 13.4% due to the launch of a generic Niaspan in mid September. TriCor/Trilipix were $39
million, down 88.3% versus the third quarter of 2012. Though sales across the lipid franchise declined in the third
quarter. They did perform better than we had forecast. We continue to expect full year 2013 sales of less than $1 billion
for our combined lipid portfolio, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion. As we said previously, this decline will be
most pronounced in the fourth quarter when the full impact of Niaspan's loss of exclusivity will be felt.

Global Lupron sales were nearly $196 million in the quarter, up 4.2% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold
a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market.
U.S. sales of Synthroid were $161 million in the quarter, up 22.9%. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and
market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.
For the full year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. U.S. Creon sales were $101 million,
up 9.8%. The launch of our 36,000 lipase unit dose earlier this year continues to positively impact sales performance.
Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority
of new prescription starts. We expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2013.
Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson disease, grew 18.9% on an operational basis this quarter.
Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets.
Moving onto our P&L profile, third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 79.7%, excluding intangible asset
amortization and other specified items. This was above our expectations for the quarter, driven by operational
efficiencies and product mix across our portfolio, including HUMIRA and better-than-expected performance of our
high margin lipid franchise. Adjusted SG&A was 26.1% of sales in the third quarter in line with our expectations and
reflecting heightened investment of our growth brands. Adjusted R&D was 15.2% of sales in the quarter, driven by
increased funding of our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA
indications. Net interest expect was $69 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3%.
Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.11 to
$3.13. This updated guidance contemplates sales somewhat above $18.5 billion, reflecting strong balance performance
across our portfolio offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an
estimated negative impact from exchange of somewhat less than 1% for the full year.
We are now forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 78% for the year, excluding non-cash amortization and specified
items. This reflects our efforts to improve operational efficiencies, as well as product mix including the better than
expected sales of our lipid franchise in the first three quarters.
In addition to raising our EPS guidance, our performance this year has also allowed us to increase the level of
investment behind both our pipeline opportunities and marketed products. As a result, we now expect R&D expense to
be somewhat above 15% of sales reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline. And we now expect SG&A
expense to be approximately 27% of sales in 2013 reflecting increased investment in our key brands including
HUMIRA where we're pursuing opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications.
We are forecasting net interest expense of about $280 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted
tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the year excludes $0.57 per
share related to amortization expense, acquired IPR&D and ongoing separation and restructuring costs. We expect that
earnings per share will be $2.54 to $2.56 on a GAAP basis.
Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect sales approaching $5 billion reflecting a mid-single digit decline on a reported
basis, which includes a negative impact from exchange of approximately 0.5%. Our sales guidance for the fourth
quarter includes continued impact of the loss of exclusivity for TriCor/Trilipix, as well as the full impact of Niaspan
going generic since this occurred late in the third quarter.
We expect the adjusted gross margin ratio for the quarter to be around 77%. We are forecasting fourth quarter SG&A
somewhat below our full-year estimate, and we expect R&D to be somewhat above our revised full-year guidance.
So, in conclusion, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance again this quarter as well as our outlook for the
remainder of the first year as an independent company.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.

Larry Peepo
Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call up for questions, Wendy, we'll take our first question now, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Hi, can you hear me?
<A - Larry Peepo>: I can you hear, David. How are you?
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Good morning. So I have a couple questions. First of all, on hepatitis C, could you
just update us on the top line press release strategy and potential timing, so what studies we're likely to see top line
releases on the front end of the schedule versus for example in early 2014? That's my first question.
Second, could you talk about the hep C pill burden from payer and physician perspectives? It's not clear to me that
payers and physicians will care about the number of pills for 12-week treatments, and I'm guessing that's your
viewpoint as well, but just wanted to hear your perspective on what you're hearing about pill burden for short-duration
treatments and whether payers and physicians will care or not.
And then third, with respect to ABT-126 as an add-on for both Alzheimer and schizophrenia, could you just remind us
when we should expect top line press releases in both Alzheimer and schizophrenia? Thanks very much.
<A - Scott Brun>: David, good morning. It's Scott Brun. So why don't I go ahead and take those? Again, with regard
to the Phase III hepatitis C program, all six studies as you know are fully enrolled and we're very pleased with the
progress that we're making there. We will be releasing data as top line press releases later this year and moving into
early 2014. I don't want to get into the specifics with regard to which studies are going to be released, but certainly,
when you look at all six, each of them is quite large, involving several hundred patients. Again, looking at a variety of
different context from treatment naive, treatment experienced psoriatic patients, so, I think, certainly each study or set
of studies that we release will certainly help to provide some very solid evidence with regard to the performance of the
regimen, but again, look for us to start those releases later this year.
With regard to the pill burden, I think, as you noted, David, with regard to the payers as well as the clinicians that we've
spoken to, cure or sustained virologic response is really king here, and when you consider a short-term regimen,
whether or not you're talking one pill, four pills, really what's going to trump everything is how well is it going to
perform with regard to eliminating the virus? And certainly, with regard to the performance that we've seen so far of
our regimen in AVIATOR, in both treatment naive and treatment experienced patients, SVR12 rates ranging from the
mid to high 90% range as well as tolerability reflected by discontinuation rates for adverse events less than 2%. We
really don't feel that the pill burden is going to be material to clinicians, to payers, or for that matter to patients who are
really looking to eliminate this virus.
Finally, with regard to ABT-126, the alpha-7 NNR, we are looking in Alzheimer disease both as a monotherapy
treatment as well as an add-on to donepezil, and then in cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia, we are
looking – we are evaluating the drug as a monotherapy. We will begin to see data in Alzheimer's very late this year,
and certainly releases would probably be expected sometime within the first part of 2014, the schizophrenia data likely
coming a bit later within 2014.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure. Thanks, David.

Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just firstly, I wonder if you can just give us a bit more
color on the HUMIRA sales, potentially splitting them by the main indications if you can for the quarter. Secondly, on
ABT-199, I was interested just the way you put it in the press release, that it's a large single-agent study. You described
it as with ABT-199 in the 17p deletion patients. Now that's likely to read out by the end of next year. Could that
potentially be an early filing for that specific population? That's my question. And then just lastly, I noticed that share
count was down more than expected during the quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about capital allocation and just
how you're thinking about share repurchases going forwards? Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with the HUMIRA sales breakdown. Scott will cover the 199
question and Bill can talk about capital allocation at the end with Rick, if necessary. In terms of our mix right now, it's
interesting that in the U.S., RA is now in the high 30% range. It's a little below 40% of our total U.S. sales. Gastro is
about a quarter of our sales. Psoriasis right now is about 15% or so of sales and the remainder is kind of in the spondo
area of the psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, those types of indications.
It's similar ex-U.S. I'd say RA is probably in the mid 30% of the ex-U.S. franchise. Psoriasis again is down in that
14%-15% range. Spine ex-U.S. is approaching 30%. And again, gastro is probably about a quarter of our sales. So,
hopefully, that gives you a pretty good feel of how the sales mix up today. So, I would characterize it as a pretty diverse
basket of sales across those four different categories.
<A - Scott Brun>: Jeff, why don't I go ahead and take your question on ABT-199, our first in class Bcl-2 inhibitor. So,
you're right. We're currently enrolling a large study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion mutation,
certainly a very hard to treat population. And if the results from this study look similar to results in this population that
we've presented before with a overall response rate above 80% -- complete response rate of 18%, we certainly think
that there is the potential to be able to move forward with a filing on the basis of addressing an unmet medical need.
Certainly, as Rick noted, though, we're also beginning in collaboration with our partner, a large Phase III traditional
study, that will compare 199 with Rituxan, a chemotherapy-free regimen to a more standard chemo containing regimen.
<A - William J. Chase>: Jeff, it's Bill Chase. You know, we've been pretty consistent on our capital allocation story
this year. First and foremost, this is a business that generates very, very healthy cash flow. The first thing we're going to
do with that cash flow is make sure that we reinvest in the business. You've seen some good progress on the deal front
this year with a number of compounds announced. And certainly, we continue to build out our infrastructure with
capital expense, that sort of thing. So, that's first and foremost.
Second, the dividend is a very, very important piece of our investor identity. We have set the dividend at a very
competitive payout ratio, relative to our peers. We've been pretty clear that we intend to grow that dividend over time,
probably more modestly in 2014, given some of the challenges with the lipid business, but growing it nevertheless. And
I think you can expect to see that payout ratio creep up as a result. After that, we'd like to try to pay down a little bit of
debt. We think that would be the right thing to do given our balance sheet. And then above and beyond that, capital –
cash will build, and that will be a valuable source of liquidity and flexibility for the company.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thank you.
<A - William J. Chase>: We do have a buyback program, Jeff, but that is primarily geared to offset dilution of
compensation programs.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks very much.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have two questions. I appreciate that you're not giving guidance for 2014, but
when we think about the spending levels in 2014, given the need to develop and roll out the pipeline, how would you
compare spending in 2014 to 2013 on a percent of sales basis? And secondly, you've done a good job of downplaying
the 250 filed and pending patents around HUMIRA. Is that how you want us to view the patents estate of limited ability
to blunt potential biosimilars as patents expire in 2017 or 2018? I must admit I'm surprised that the estate has no patents
which could provide obstacles for biosimilars when they come around. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: So, this is Rick, Steve. So let me start with your investment question. We're obviously
going through our planning process right now, so we haven't finalized any investment decisions yet as to how we're
going to proceed forward in 2014. But, what I would say is you should think about it from this perspective: One, as I
indicated in my remarks, we're going to prepare to have a very effective launch of HCV and we need to build that
infrastructure in 2014 to be prepared to launch in the early part of 2015, that's going to require incremental investment.
The second thing is we could have as many as seven or eight assets in Phase III development during 2014, and we're
obviously going to fund those Phase III assets to be able to get them to the market as quickly as possible. So, I think
there will be some increased investment, but we're just not in a position yet to be able to tell you what that looks like.
And so, I think that's how you've got to be thinking about it, and we'll give more guidance in the fourth quarter as to
what that looks like.
The second thing is maybe I'd answer your question a little bit differently. As you look at how we think about
biosimilars, maybe let me walk you through our thought process around, because I think it helps answer your question.
We certainly feel good about the patent portfolio that we have, and I would not interpret it as we don't believe that it
provides a level of protection. Quite the contrary, I believe, it does and will provide a significant level of protection,
and we certainly intend to enforce our patents and make sure no one violates those patents, but we're not going to talk a
lot about specific patents.
But more importantly, I think you have to look at the whole biosimilar situation in a broader perspective, and I can tell
you that we fundamentally don't view the biosimilar market as a very attractive market, and frankly we could get into
the biosimilar market easily. We looked at it actually a couple of times as to whether or not we wanted to get into it.
We certainly have the capabilities from an R&D standpoint as well as a manufacturing standpoint, and we decided not
to get into it for three fundamental reasons. If you look at biosimilars and you really analyze the ability of biosimilars to
perform in this market, I think it raises a lot of questions. Patents are only one of those.
There are three basic areas that we've looked at and made a determination that it's not a very attractive business.
Number one is the predictability of commercial success, number two is the return on the investment versus other
pipeline opportunities that we have, and number three is the risk around patents and other things, as well as the fact that
you don't control your own destiny. So let me walk you through each one, to at least give you our view of it.
If you think about the predictability of commercial success in biosimilars, and you take the anti-TNF market as an
example, it's a difficult market even for differentiated innovative products to carve out much share. I mean, literally, six
or seven products have been introduced into that market in the last six or seven years, and they've all gotten 2% or 3%
market share, so it's a tough market to break your way into, and these are differentiated products.
Biosimilars have no differentiation at all from an efficacy or a safety standpoint. In fact, I could argue with you that
biosimilars, because they don't have a long safety database, they're at some disadvantage from a safety standpoint, and
if they ran noninferiority trials, they can basically say they're no worse than X versus the innovator product. And so
they really have no differentiation. The only way they can compete for market share is on price, and if the innovator
chooses to respond to that in some form or fashion, it's very difficult to build models that suggest that you're going to
get any significant share in this market.
So that really brings you to the second part of the analysis, and that is the return on investment. So if you think about
modest share gains and what kind of pricing you'd have to go out at with a biosimilar strategy, in our analysis it says
you have to make six or eight different biosimilars to have a meaningful impact on the business. When you develop six

or eight biosimilars, the investment to be able to do that, is more than a single innovative product and it approaches
pretty close to two innovative products. So I guess if the only thing you had in your pipeline was this, you might invest
in it. But frankly, when we stack it up against the things that we have, we wouldn't trade off six or eight biosimilars for
a couple of our innovative products, and so we just don't see a good return on investment there.
And then, frankly, then there's the last part that you pointed out, and that's risk in controlling your own destiny. If
you're going to do six or eight biosimilar products, you're going to be walking your way through an absolute minefield
of IP, thousands of patents around all of these products, and you have to make sure that you don't step on any one of
them along the way because that's going to create a big problem for you, because I can assure you, just like us, every
innovator is going to protect their patent position.
The second thing is you're at the mercy of the innovator that if they change the formulation or they change the device
or they somehow innovate the product along the way, then you're at a disadvantage. And so as we look at all these
things, we ultimately don't believe that it is a good place to be, and frankly, it probably gives you some picture into how
we view some of our defense strategies as well as how we view how to compete in this marketplace. So hopefully that
gives you some perspective on it.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: That's great. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Just one on HUMIRA. Again, I appreciate the color you gave on the quarter. Can you talk a
little bit about the payer dynamics there if there's anything specific over the quarter? Or we saw some stuff from
prominent PBMs around formulary decisions, anything that impacted the quarter and also maybe more looking out in
near to medium term, how you see that changing? And then second one just on 199 if I could. I appreciate the
comments around the studies that are ongoing. I'm just wondering when we might start thinking about you looking at
other non-CLL indications. We've seen some excitement from thought leaders about potentially moving this product
into those areas. Thanks.
<A - Scott Brun>: Yeah, why don't we go ahead now, I'll start with the 199 questions. Scott Brun again. So, we
already have some studies ongoing in non-CLL indications such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, and certainly you'll be seeing some more of those data next year. And we continue to look at other
opportunities within hematologic malignancies putting things like potentially AML a well as looking at multiple
myeloma. Plus, we're assessing the potential for the Bcl-2 mechanism to have applicability in solid tumors. So all of
that work, some of it already ongoing, and much to be initiated in the not too distant future.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. And this is Rick. I'll take the HUMIRA payer dynamics. I think, if you look at one
of the strengths of HUMIRA, it has been that payers and governments around the world recognize the value of this
product, and so I'd say we've been in the fortunate position that we have a very strong position from the standpoint of
payers. In fact, in the U.S. managed care environment, the number is around 70% preferred status, meaning you have to
go through HUMIRA first as your first anti-TNF. That dynamic hasn't been changing at all. In fact, if anything, I'd say
it's probably improving a little bit over time, but we don't see any negative dynamics occurring in that area if that's what
you were looking at. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from Ariel Herman with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ariel G. Herman>: Hi. This is Ariel. I'm in for Jami Rubin. I just have two pipeline questions, the first on
ABT-199. How should we think about the potential to do some additional combo studies with GA101 or something like
ibrutinib? And then also with elagolix, can you just help us understand the market dynamics and the potential size for
this product? Thank you.
<A - Scott Brun>: Great. Why don't I go ahead and I'll start with 199. So with regard to additional combos, we're
working with Roche. As we said first of all, looking at combinations with Rituxan as well as with GA101. With regard
to ibrutinib and other new agents on the horizon, we're certainly interested in those types of combinations. And we're
talking about how best to pursue that with regard to the timing of availability of ibrutinib. Certainly with combinations
like 199 and other agents, or even a single agent, there's the potential to really change the way CLL is treated, you
know, moving it from something that requires chronic therapy to a situation where you could have a well-tolerated
combination that could perhaps result in drug-free remissions or even functional cures.
With regard to elagolix, the opportunity – so certainly we're in Phase III in assessing patients with endometriosis, a
very common condition affecting millions of women in the developed world. Certainly the current treatment options
available have limitations with regard to tolerability, because of the very dense estrogen suppression they result in. You
get menopausal type symptoms, like hot flash and bone loss. And with elagolix as a mechanism, you get a more guided
or partial suppression of estrogen which, through Phase II studies, we've seen reduced impact on symptoms such as hot
flash or certainly bone loss. So, we think that combination of the efficacy and the tolerability profile will provide a very
nice option for women when you consider the types of surgical alternatives, such as hysterectomy, which are quite
extreme.
We're also in Phase II for uterine fibroids, a condition that can lead to very heavy, marked bleeding as well as other
symptomatology. And again, with regard to the type of estrogen suppression we're seeing, we feel very competent in
the ability to markedly impact that rate of bleeding and provide women an alternative to hysterectomy, which again
represents the majority of surgical solutions for this condition.
<A - Scott Brun>: Certainly from a commercial perspective, you know, we've talked about the endometriosis
indication being a potential greater than a billion dollar opportunity, and certainly, fibroids could be a significant
opportunity as well for us if you're looking from a modeling perspective.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: This is Rick. I think the key here and what we're working towards is if you can get
sufficient pain suppression in endometriosis and a strong safety profile where this can be used as a long-term more
chronic kind of therapy, it's a very big opportunity, and that is why we designed the trial the way we designed it where
we had two doses that were running through Phase II to determine which one those doses best fits that profile
long-term.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Ariel.

Thank you. The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just had a few here. First, coming back on the question about longer
term spend, as I think about growth in SG&A over the next few years, and this is probably a more qualitative question,
but can you just help me understand how significant the spend associated with the roll out of HCV is going to be? I
guess my question is how much of this can you leverage existing infrastructure as compared to incremental spend? The
second question was on HUMIRA. You mentioned higher spending due to some of – accelerating some promotion
programs there. Can you elaborate a little bit more specifically what those efforts are going to focus on? Is there any
particular indication that's some more promotion sensitive or where you see an opportunity to accelerate share gains?

And then the final question is an HCV one. I know it's early, but can you just elaborate a little bit on the confidence you
have, you'll be able to maintain the initial share you're going to take in this market? As an example, we look at what
looks like some interesting Merck early-stage data in the AASLD abstracts. And if we end up with several players with
all oral, highly efficacious combos, does that translate to a relatively fragmented market in your opinion or is the first
mover advantage share just so significant that it's hard to displace that initial share you take? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. This is Rick. I'll cover the questions. So, if you look at the building out the
infrastructure associated with HCV, I'd say for the most part, it's incremental. There are certainly areas around the
world where we'll have an opportunity to be able to have some synergies with our existing structures, but I'd say for the
bulk of it, you should be thinking about it as incremental build. And, as I said, we're going through our planning
process right now. We literally have not finalized it yet and probably won't finalize it for another month or so, but we're
going to make sure that we're in a position to be highly effective in that area.
If you talk about HUMIRA's spend, one of the things I'd say to you is as we approached the beginning of this year, one
of the things that we knew is that we were going to face some new competitive challenges, and in anticipation of that,
we did some things from an investment standpoint that we thought would put us in a position to be able to defend and
still grow our share. And I'd say if I look at the results nine or ten months into it, we're pretty happy with the investment
that we made there because it has given us back a pretty healthy return and it has allowed us, from a competitive
standpoint, to really deal with new competition in a very effective way.
As far as HCV is concerned, I think as Scott pointed out, a significant part of this is really built around the performance
of the product. We've done a lot of market research, and when you look at prescribing preference of physicians, the first
five, six attributes are all related to performance of the product. Cure rates in different populations. And so as the
competitive environment rolls out and as we get to our second generation product, I think we will then take another
incremental step in this particular disease treatment paradigm that will be difficult to beat. I think it's incredibly
difficult to get performance that's better than this. Or at least what we anticipate, and then it will be all about how you
built your infrastructure, how well established it is, that will make it difficult.
You look again at the anti-TNF market and think how difficult it is for a new competitor to break into that market. And
it's because of both the performance of the product, and the value that it provides and the established infrastructure
that's in place that has a lot of experience at being able to drive those products. And so I think HCV will play out the
same way and I don't think there is enough headroom left that anybody can truly have a very differentiated product
after second generation. So that's how we view it.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Chris.

Thank you. The next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Good morning. First can you talk about the cystic fibrosis product and what excites you
about that? What's the hook there? Obviously that's an interesting market. Second, HUMIRA in the emerging markets.
Just give us a little color there. You had mentioned something about tenders, if you can go into that a little more. And
then third, I know you are working on some early stage HUMIRA combos for like next-gen technology life cycle
strategies. Can you update us on where you are there? Thanks.
<A - Scott Brun>: Sure. So why don't I go ahead, Scott Brun with the cystic fibrosis Galapagos collaboration. So,
certainly with regard to the genetic understanding of cystic fibrosis and the mutations that lead to dysfunction in the ion
channel of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor that lead to the symptomatology. You know, we've seen
introduction of a therapy like Kalydeco that can have marked impact on patients but really it's only applicable to a
small minority of patients. What we are excited about is, can we go ahead and take this even further by addressing
patients with the much more common F508 mutation? Really looking at combinations of two drugs, a so-called
potentiator that helps the malfunctioning channel, ion channel, to work properly as well as a corrector that helps to

affect the folding and the transport of the receptor to the cell surface.
And so we feel that Galapagos has got some very, very interesting science. Even though there's a timing element here,
we won't be entering clinical trials until late next year, we'll use the analogy of hepatitis C, where certainly we did not
begin in the lead, but by leveraging certain scientific insights and taking full advantage of the ability to combine
different mechanisms, we're able to get where we are now. So again, I think that's really what excites us, the ability to
make a remarkable impact on a very devastating disease and to follow on the science that is already out for the minority
of patients.
With regard to, we'll say, HUMIRA next generation, certainly we built a very, very strong foundation with HUMIRA
and rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. And the question is, what can you do as a leader in these areas to
improve upon what the anti-TNF HUMIRA specifically have been able to achieve. And so, we are looking at the
potential to improve efficacy, tolerability, convenience across the whole patient journey within those various diseases.
And we're approaching it strategically with a combination of both internal and external innovations, small molecules
and biologics. So for example, we have a selective JAK1 platform. You're certainly familiar with that tofacitinib which
a non-selective JAK as a consequence has limitations in its ability to dose to really get significant efficacy before you
start running into side effects.
With our Galapagos collaboration, we've got a selective JAK1 inhibitor in – currently dosing in Phase IIb in
rheumatoid arthritis as well as Crohn's disease. And we feel that the ability to be able to dose these molecules higher
without running into JAK2-3 related side effects provides the potential for significant improvement in efficacy in these
diseases.
We also have our own internal JAK ABT-494 that's recently entered Phase II studies and we think that with these two
JAK mechanisms, we have the ability to have a portfolio of compounds that can address multiple disease states in –
again, patients who have various stages of treatment experience.
Moving on, we've got other external collaborations, other mechanisms like our Biotest work in Phase II with anti-CD4
mechanism. We're very excited about the Ablynx deal, that's an anti-IL-6 Nanobody [anti-IL-6R Nanobody]. These
nanobodies, because of their size, have the potential for improved tissue penetration, also the Ablynx Nanobody binds
to serum albumin, which is present during inflammation which will help it traffic to the tissues where you want it to go.
So again, we think there is the potential for differentiation via the currently available IL-6 based therapies.
And then certainly, we're extremely excited about our Dual Variable Domain technology, DVDs which allows us really
to buy specifically target two biologic mediators in disease. We've got ABT-122, which targets both TNF as well
IL-17, which is – have been shown to play a significant role in various auto-immune diseases. And so, again the idea is,
can we improve upon anti-TNFs with this molecule that's currently in early development in rheumatoid arthritis
patients. So really a wide portfolio of various approaches to build upon our current strength in auto-immune disease.
<A - William J. Chase>: Marc, it's Bill Chase. As you acknowledge, we did have some tender activity in the third
quarter and that did lift our international HUMIRA results a bit. The way you got to look at that, this does occur from
time to time in certain markets. When it occurs, it's generally about a 2% to 3% lift. That's certainly what we saw in Q3.
And what we'll try to do and we have been doing is to be transparent to let you know when that's occurring to allow
you to better understand both the quarter that's occurring as well as the next.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Marc. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.

Thank you. Our final question today is from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much. Rick, you outlined very nicely HUMIRA and the various indications.

you, Scott. One is, what's the strategy around other genotypes, genotype 2, 3 in particular. Then lastly, ABT-493, is that
boosted or non-boosted? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Maybe quickly, on the RA market. The RA market has penetration rates that are
still under 30%. So there's still a clearly an opportunity to grow, and we continue to see in most markets around the
world that the RA market is continuing to grow. So it's not growing as fast as some of the other markets, like the GI
market is as an example, but it is continuing to grow.
<A - Scott Brun>: Tony, it's Scott. With regard to our strategy on other genotypes, we are currently doing work with
ABT-450, and 267, which do have activity beyond genotype 1, in genotypes 2, 3 as well as 4. So we're currently in
Phase II with those genotypes, and we'll continue to move forward. But it's really our pan-genotypic ABT-493, 530
combination that we think has the most balanced pan-genotypic activity. To your question, neither 493 nor 530 in the
next-generation requires ritonavir boosting. From what we've seen in ongoing clinical development there,
pharmacologic profiles are both conducive to QD, once-daily dosing without boosting.
