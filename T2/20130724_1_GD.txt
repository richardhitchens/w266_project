Phebe N. Novakovic
Good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of $7.9 billion
and net income of $640 million; we reported EPS of $1.81 per diluted share, $0.04 ahead of the year ago quarter and
$0.19 better than the prior quarter. This was also $0.19 per share better than consensus.
Revenue for all practical purposes was the same as Q2 2012 and significantly higher than the prior quarter. Revenue for
each of our operating groups was higher than the year ago quarter except for Combat Systems which reached a recent
high water mark in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, Aerospace, IS&T and Marine were ahead of the first
quarter. Combat was essentially flat with Q1.
Operating margin was a strong 12.1% with good contribution and sequential improvement across all four of our groups.
Net earnings and earnings per share were ahead of both Q2 2012 and the prior quarter aided by lower interest expense
and somewhat offset – though it somewhat offset lower share count in part by a higher tax rate for the quarter.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2013. Revenues are down modestly against 2012, however, net earnings are up
over 1% and diluted earnings per share are up 9% or 2.7% – $0.09 or 2.7%. In short, we're off to a good start ahead of
our internal plan and ahead of external expectations.
With respect to cash, we had $486 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 76% of net income.
We had $915 million for the first half, still 76% of net income. In Q2, we repurchased slightly over 6.6 million shares
for $513.3 million. Recall that in the first quarter we had $70 million of purchases that cleared and was reported in Q2.
Similarly, we had $100 million of share repurchases in this quarter that cleared in early Q3 and will be reported in Q3
cash flow. For purposes of discussion, if we include that $100 million I just mentioned, we have repurchased over 7.6
million shares for about $584.5 million in the first half. In addition, if we add the Q2 dividend – you might recall that
there was none in Q1 because it was paid in the fourth quarter of last year – we have returned $782 million of the $915
million, over 85% of the free cash flow year-to-date to our shareholders.
Let's turn to the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I also want to give you some general perspective on
outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and then close with our EPS guidance for 2013. First,
Aerospace. Aerospace had a powerful quarter with the highest revenue, operating earnings and operating margins
reported in the last six quarters. We had good contribution from Jet Aviation and Gulfstream's performance was superb.
Just to provide you a bit of color, Gulfstream enjoyed 170 basis point improvement over the prior quarter in G650
green manufacturing that more than offset a modest mix shift. Also, our three large cabin models enjoyed a sequential
330 basis point improvement in outfitted or completions margin, a clear indication of progress on G650 completions.
For the first half of 2013, Aerospace revenues are up $616 million or 19.2%. Operating earnings are up $171 million,
32.4%, a clear manifestation of Jet Aviation's return to profitability and the performance improvement at Gulfstream.
This is all reflected in 180 basis point improvement operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half
of 2012.
This was really outstanding but as I have previously said, we don't expect the third quarter to be this strong for three
reasons. First, we will experience cost increases on several G450 and G550 supply contracts which will compress
margins. Second, due largely to the vagaries of production planning we plan to produce two fewer large cabin aircraft
in the third quarter. Third, we are delivering more green mid-cabin in the quarter, resulting in a mix shift in deliveries
of lower margin airplanes. Our expectation in the fourth quarter is that we will return to Q2 production levels, and
improved learning on the G650 line should offset somewhat the cost increases in the 450 and 550 supply chain.
Combat Systems; Combat demonstrated the disciplined performance of a good cyclical, reporting 14.1% margins on
revenue almost 28% lower than the year ago quarter. Land Systems and OTS had particularly strong margins on cost
reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS was impacted by an additional restructuring charge of $18 million
that was accelerated into the first half. On a pro forma basis, that is not considering the restructuring charge, Combat
operating margins were 20 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2012 and 140
basis points better than the prior quarter. All in all, a strong performance in a tough market environment.

The story for the first half is much the same. Revenues are off 23.6% against last year, but operating earnings are down
only 17.5% on 110 basis points of improved operating margins. As I said, the performance of a good cyclical. In the
second half, we should see an increase in revenue and a boost to operating margins as ELS returns to profitability. Its
restructuring charges are complete.
Marine group. Marine group revenues were higher than Q2 2012 and the prior quarter. However, operating earnings
and operating margins were down 2.7% and 100 basis points respectively. Entirely as a result of the completion of the
high margin T-AKE program in 2012. Nevertheless, operating earnings were up 11.9% sequentially and operating
margins of 10.1% were 30 basis points higher on good performance across each one of our businesses. For the first
half, Marine group revenues are up $127 million or almost 4%, and operating earnings are down $31 million or 8.4%
solely attributable to the absence of T-AKE profit. In the second half, we expect revenues to approach the first half.
Margins should be slightly lower.
IS&T. IS&T is a good news story from a revenue perspective. Revenues were higher this quarter than in the second
quarter 2012 as well as the prior quarter in a tough market primarily with respect to our Army customer. The revenues
of each operating unit within the group improved sequentially.
Operating earnings and margins are down against second quarter 2012 by $28 million and 100 basis points
respectively. But up slightly against the prior quarter. The operating result was driven by poor margins at C4 Systems
primarily attributable to the expenses in the UK business that is now embedded in C4 Systems. We expect stronger C4
margin performance in the second half. The story is much the same for the first half. Revenues are up $29 million, less
than 1% but operating earnings are down $61 million, 13.7% for the reasons I just noted. For the remainder of the year,
IS&T should see a little bit less revenue than we had in the first half with earnings up somewhat and a modest increase
in operating margin.
Let me turn to our guidance for the remainder of 2013. The guidance I gave you at the beginning of the year of $6.60 to
$6.70 per diluted share did not include the impact of sequestration if any. The enactment of the 2013 bill went a long
way toward stabilizing our program funding and mitigating some of the uncertainty for 2013. Looking ahead to the
remainder of the year, we are increasing our guidance to $6.85 to $6.95 of earnings per diluted share. The lower end of
the guidance anticipates our current understanding of the impacts of sequestration in 2013 and a CR for our fourth
quarter. If sequestration's impact this year becomes more draconian than we can currently envision or a CR is
implemented in a more rigid fashion than we can anticipate, we will revise our estimates. The upper end of the range
anticipates that the impact of contract execution from furlough actions affecting our customers is mitigated as the year
progresses.
So in summary, this guidance implies that EPS for the second half will be similar to the first half, in a range between
$3.42 to $3.52 per diluted share. The fourth quarter should be the stronger of the two quarters.
I'd now like to turn the mic over to Hugh Redd, our CFO.
L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Phebe and good morning, everyone. Net interest expense was $18 million for the quarter versus $37 million
in 2012. For 2013 we expect net interest expense of approximately $85 million reflecting the full year impact of our
2012 debt refinancing. At the end of the quarter we had $151 million of net debt, down about $460 million from year
end. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.1% and 31.5% for the six month period. For the full year, we expect
an effective tax rate approaching 32%.
We expect cash contributions to our pension plans to approximate $600 million for 2013 with over half of that to be
contributed in the third quarter. Erin, that concludes my remarks.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please
proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Jason. Yes.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone. Great. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about
Gulfstream and the outlook for the demand, particularly in the mid range area and what you're seeing both domestically
here from a demand perspective as well as internationally?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. Interestingly, our book-to-bill was the same this quarter as a year ago quarter. And
Gulfstream booked orders for each of our aircraft in the quarter. 80% of our large cabin orders were for 450s and 550
models. So if you think about the half, about 50% of our orders on large cabin were 450 and 550. We also increased
sales of our small to mid cabin aircraft over the first quarter. And overall, in the half, orders increased 37% from a year
ago.
The U.S. market by the way, led this order increase. And I'd say in general, our order book is holding up very well. I
like where we are in our geographical distribution. I like having some balance as a way to manage risk and mitigate
overexposure to one market. So we're – our funnel is robust and we are turning interest into orders.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi, Phebe. Hi, Hugh and Erin. Just a quick question on the Aerospace margins and the
impact you outlined in your prepared remarks. Can you help us understand, one, just the magnitude of how this is going
impact the margin rates in Q3 just in I guess, general terms? And then two, help give us some color on why it is that we
have renegotiations that are taking the prices up with suppliers on programs that otherwise I would think are pretty
mature, it would seem somewhat odd to be negotiating prices up on really mature platforms?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, this seems to be an issue or a question that many of you have. But the fact of the
matter is that on the 450, 550, we have renegotiated a series of contracts. And in some instances, we are paying higher
prices as material costs go up and labor goes up. So we need to offset that through performance. I think that that's
basically just the law of economics as we think about our supplier base.
I will tell you that this is not a one-time payment. That the increase will last the life of the contract. So as a result we do
expect margin compression in the second half. And it will be partially offset as we – in fact totally offset as we move
forward and move down our learning curves. Also on both the 450, 550 and 650 and 280. I will tell you that the first
quarter – first half performance and productivity in Aerospace was just superb and well above our expectations. I did
give you some granularity on what's happening with respect to the increases in supplier contracts on 450s and 550s.

We do plan just because of the vagaries in production to produce two fewer aircraft, large cabin aircraft in the third
quarter. And we're going to grow our green aircraft deliveries in the third quarter for the mid cabin which is going to
cause a mild mix shift. So as we come down our learning curves on 650, 280, that pickup will offset in part the higher
supplier cost on legacy cabin models. So while some of you may find it difficult to understand why it is that we have
increasing prices I will tell you that that's often the case despite the maturity of a program. Costs do increase.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: So is it safe to say that the margin rates we saw in Q1 and Q2 are both unattainable in either
of the quarters of the back half?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. I don't think we're going to – we're not going to see those margins for the same
reason I explained.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: As we get the impact of some of these other changes.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: All wholesome by the way.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yeah. Thanks, Phebe.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Phebe, I'm interested in – on the G650. Given the strength you're seeing with
Gulfstream right now, how do you look at the production trajectory for that? Do you see a play soon where you would
start to take rate up to meet demand?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: As you know, we plan our production every year at the beginning of the year or late in the
fourth quarter. And for 2013 our production rate is set. We will look at our 2014 production rate later this year. I will
give you a little bit of color on the 650. We look at our learning curves and productivity on each one of our airplanes
every quarter. And we had a significant improvement in green, and most importantly, completions margin in the second
quarter on 650 as Gulfstream worked through that disequilibrium I talked to you about before, between initial and final
phase production more quickly than we had anticipated.
And if you think about it, as a result of working through that disequilibrium faster than we thought, we saw a step
function improvement in our learning that's just not normal learning. As we move forward we won't see that kind of
learning on a steady-state basis. So I hope that gives you some additional color.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: But one thing I wondered is, in the past we've heard that you're sold out for roughly five
years on the G650, which seemed to imply at least some sort of a rate plan farther into the future. I just wondered,
given what you see in demand out there, if you're feeling the pressure to try and take that up, if you can handle it from
an operational standpoint?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We will set our production rates based on our supply base, what we believe that we can
produce effectively, and the needs of our customers and that's all I'm going to say. For the remainder of this year, it's
set. And we'll give you at the end of this year or beginning of next year, we'll give you some color on 2014, okay?
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Very good. Thanks.

<Q - Yair Reiner>: Great. Thank you, and congrats on the strong quarter.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: A question about CS. The revenue drop off was quite substantial and I think that probably steeper
than we had anticipated. Was there anything in the quarter that maybe didn't play out as you anticipated in terms of
volume? And then a related question; you announced a rather large order from Germany for the EAGLEs. Can you help
us size that contract? Maybe talk about how those vehicles are going to deliver?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. Let me explain our – when I spoke to you on the fourth quarter call, my projections
about revenue at Combat Systems were based on an anticipation of a series of large international orders that have
slipped to the right. I think that I have demonstrated my inability to be an accurate prognosticator of timing on
international orders, so I'm not going to walk back into that. But I will tell you with respect to the international orders,
the circumstances that existed when we first talked to you about them are still extant today. It's simply a slip to the
right.
So as I think about Combat, clearly their first half is affected by the lack of these orders, and there are multiple orders,
slipping to the right, and we have anticipated that they will come in in the latter half of the year. But as you would
expect, the later they come in, the more of an impact they'll have on revenue. I would tell you, however, that we do not
anticipate any material impact on their earnings, in Combat Systems' earnings for the year as a result of that slip.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Thank you. And with respect to the EAGLE contract with Germany?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. So we had a nice win there. But the customer has asked us not to disclose the
funding level so I don't intend to.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Good quarter. Phebe, could you talk a bit about the margin potential
at Gulfstream for the full year? I know you were giving the previous guidance and you haven't updated that other than
to say it's going be down the second half. But I think the prior guidance was about 15.5%, 15.6%. And likewise, as you
look to the EPS guidance for the full year, does that contemplate cash deployment in the second half in terms of share
repurchase?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Answer your second question, no it does not anticipate share repurchases. And with
respect to your first question, we are going to release our Q shortly after the call. And you'll get more color on the
segment by segment guidance.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: But suffice it to say we're going be above in Aerospace about I would guess around 100
basis points.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And cash flow for the year, the net income conversion, do you anticipate getting to a
full net income conversion this year? And if not, is it a temporal issue that goes back in 2014?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We anticipate, given our current plan, a free cash flow of about 90% of net income. And
frankly, our cash will be determined by the timing of the large international orders. But I factored those in, in the
second half. And I'm looking at about 90% – could be higher.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. Got it. Thanks.

[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please
proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning, Phebe, Hugh.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: I wanted to ask you about Combat Systems and understanding what you just said about
prognosticating on international orders but let's talk about Abrams for a moment. And if you could give us an update on
how much longer your U.S. funding lasts and where potential international orders can take that program. And how long
major potential Middle East orders could sustain it?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So let me give you a little bit on Abrams. We continue to see Congressional support
coupled with our international sales as a bridge to Abrams modernization. And that's really how you have to think
about the tank line is that we are currently in a bridging scenario where we will bring in international orders and
maintain the lowest possible level of individual tank units to keep that line open to hold our industrial base viable and
keep the talent in place. So the bottom line is we're almost there to bridging to the future. We talked to – I believe that
the Abrams modernization is now a 2016, 2017 – fiscal year 2016, 2017 event. And we are almost there. We just need a
little bit of help from Congress and the international orders.
I'll tell you something interesting, Congress for almost 30 years has been there to support America's Army in times of
budgetary stress. And I have to tell you that had they not done so in the past I shudder to think what the recent hot wars
would have been like without the Abrams tank.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So Phebe, with the size of this potential order that's out there, very massive. In fact,
couldn't you go above the minimum levels?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Clearly, yes we could but I'm simply telling you what the strategy is. We want to maintain
the minimum levels as our baseline. And then the more volume we get, the better it is for the work force and the
industrial base. And we need to be there for when the U.S. Army needs us again, and they will.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Just lastly since it was your old segment, just could you give us color on what
happened with the DDG 51 award? Is and how – I think that went the opposite of the way it might have gone
previously.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: The lower bidder won five ships. Bath won four with an option. So as you can imagine
we're very focused on our competitiveness at Bath, our cost structure and our build efficiency. We intend to continue to
improve our performance and drive our costs lower because at the end of the day we need to provide stability for our
work force and the lowest ultimate cost of destroyers to our customers with the highest profit margins in our market.
And that is all achievable.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Thank you.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So, Phebe, in the IS&T segment, which is still your largest segment by sales, things seem to
be stabilizing quite a bit after a pretty tumultuous period last year particularly in the second half. Sales have stabilized.
Margins seem to have stabilized sequentially. And you're indicating margins are going be up a bit in the second half.

Also backlog has stabilized. Take a step back. This used to be a 10%, 11% business for a very long period. Now we're
down in the 8% range. As things have stabilized how do you view the opportunities going forward for getting margins
back up to double-digit?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We are, as you can imagine, restructuring our business. And let me give you – in order to
maintain our profitability and increase our profitability. But let me give you a little bit of color on what's really driving
our IS&T at the moment. Our book-to-bill for the group is one-to-one and frankly this is – we've had six consecutive
quarters of greater than one-to-one or close to one-to-one book-to-bill. So it looks pretty stable to me.
You also may recall that at the beginning of the year we reset the plan for IS&T and were focused earnings and cash.
And I expect to see the benefits of that accruing partially toward the end of this year. And then going forward we have
some margin expansion opportunities across all of our businesses.
One of the things that's driving I think our market is that the decline in tactical communications seems to be behind us.
So we've got the revenue – got revenue that's both stable and sustainable. I would also note that for 2013 we have
sufficient backlog to support our outlook. So going forward, we are focused on taking costs out of our business.
Stabilizing our work force. And we're holding our own in a tough – in fact we're more than holding our own in a tough
environment. But this is a margin improvement story over time
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So structurally, given the mix here, do you still think it's a realistic target ultimately. Not
talking short term but ultimately if mix doesn't change from here, to get back to that double-digit?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It's certainly our objective. One of the things that's constraining us right now is a
restructuring that we're doing in our UK business. And once we get through that that will take some of the headwind
away from – or remove some of the headwind that we're currently facing. That's going to take us through the remainder
of the year.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you.

And our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Phebe, six months ago when you took the CEO role, you set out a fairly firm view on
acquisitions. I was wondering if that has changed in any way and whether you see the potential for any acquisitions
going forward. Particularly as we start to see the defense industry consolidating in this budget environment?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me talk to you about that just briefly. I have consistently said that our focus this year
is on operations. That I've got nothing and have had no targets on my radar screen and that M&A is not a focus for us
this year. That said, if we think conceptually about the future, I think it makes sense to maintain a strong balance sheet
with the budget uncertainty we are facing and as you quite rightly point out, we want to have the capability to be
opportunistic with a strong balance sheet in an industry that is likely to experience some consolidation. But at the risk
of being a broken record, I'm working on our operations and I think that the team's results are obvious. So I think that
kind of tells you where we are.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. I mean I guess related to that last question, you certainly have never really run the
business with $3.7 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet. So what is the right number in terms of the cash and if
you in fact are able to get to 90% of your net income that's only going to grow. So at what point does that cause you to
either step up the buy-back or start to think about external growth opportunities?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, again, through this year, I've told you and others that we expect to deploy almost all
if not all of our free cash flow to share repurchase and dividends. Going forward, I've just explained the value
proposition. We'll continue to use our free cash flow in shareholder friendly ways and maintain that strong balance
sheet to give us flexibility. I just think that's prudent. It's prudent in two respects. Because we believe we can grow this
business by being smart in what we acquire number one.
And number two, there's a fair amount of uncertainty. So in a period of uncertainty, you need to keep your powder dry.
But that's not where we are this year. And when we get into next year, we'll begin to talk to you about how we see our
positioning for next year. But right now I got nothing on my radar screen. And we are really focused on our operations.
As you well know we had some work to do and this team is doing it.

And our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Just wanted to circle back on Combat. So, we've been chasing this Combat down for the last
several years. Declining faster than I think guidance has been. The business is now, you take the last two quarters, it's
about a $6 billion run rate business from a sales perspective. Just, Phebe, thinking about the international pipeline
versus what's going on on the domestic side, could this – looking out over the next couple of years, could this drop
below a $6 billion a year business in terms of revenues?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me be a little quarrelsome with you about the predicate embedded in part of your
question. We are not guiding you to revenue. And I think what I've tried to tell you is that we ought to manage what we
can control. And it's not revenue. So our job is to be a good cyclical. Particularly in Combat Systems. And that's to
drive costs lower than revenue declines and we're doing that and we will continue to do that. Going forward, we have a
sufficiently – a very large and robust pipeline of international orders. And when they enter into our backlog will largely
determine what the growth profile on the revenue side is. But we're going to fight our margins and I think that's how
you have to think about it.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So help me understand Gulfstream. I mean, you've said margin 16.5%, which implies a pretty
big step down in the third quarter. How much is this supplier change? For example, what percent of G450
manufacturing costs do these contracts represent approximately? And does this new contract impact start beginning of
the quarter or middle of the quarter, and – so we can get some better understanding of how big a deal this is.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think I've given you all the color I plan to give you on the supplier contracts. I've
told you this is not a one-time payment and I'm not going to parse the margin variances between the supply chain cost
increases and our production rate decreases on our large-cabin and the increases in our mid-cabin. That's just not
something we're going to report on. But we will work our way through that. And what I've tried to do is give you a
sense that the first quarter was very, very strong. And we're going to see some margin compression in the third quarter,
and fourth quarter we're going to improve.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So just when you say you're going be down two units in large biz jets, is that versus the 30
you did in this quarter or the 28 you did last year?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That is versus the first half.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: You'll be down – I thought...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So in other words, in large cabin production in the second quarter we're just – because of
the way our production planning goes, we are producing two fewer large cabin, and that is another factor impacting the
margins in that quarter.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure.

And our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Phebe, I want to go look at this Gulfstream a little different. In the second quarter you had
29% incremental margins year-over-year and the same sequentially. How much of that do you think is due to what you
talked about as your one-time step-down? So what would be a sustainable incremental margin? And I've got a second
one. If you looked at just the 450 and 550 in terms of its book-to-bill in the quarter, was it about one, similar to the first
quarter? Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look, our 450 and 550 orders are very strong as I told you. That's about 80% of our large
cabin orders and for the half, about 50% of our orders. So those two lines are holding up very, very well. You asked
about the incremental margin. We – as I explained to you in the fourth quarter call, we had this buildup in working
capital of green airplanes that we had to push through the snake – this bubble we had to push through the snake – of
completions. And we devoted an awful lot of resources to fixing that problem, and frankly, we fixed it much faster than
we anticipated. Hence my comment about the step function improvement in margins.
I don't think it's prudent to try to prematurely pinpoint what our gross margins in any of our airplanes are going be
going forward – particularly the 650 it seems to be of great interest – or when they will achieve it. But we'll continue to
come down that learning curve both in the green production, and most importantly from my perspective, in
completions. We don't have enough experience yet to know what a running rate, a steady state running rate, is going to
look like on completions on 650. But we are – we have made a step function improvement and we're – I'm very proud
of the Gulfstream team for working through what was a difficult operational challenge.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: But I would think that the incrementals would at least be something north of 20%. They
wouldn't maybe be 29%; is that a fair statement?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: George, I'm just not going to get into the variances with you. I think at the end of the day
– I'm sorry, but at the end of the day just take a look at where our – I've explained the big muscle movements and
where our performance has been and where it's likely to go. But Gulfstream is poised to continue to do very well. This
is like almost all of our businesses. We continue to learn unit over unit and that's important to maintaining your
profitability. That's just operating leverage and I like it.

And our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe, Hugh. Question on – my question really is on
Aerospace on the services side. Phebe, could you just give us some more color on what you're seeing in terms of the
overall services environment both North America and also just thinking about the Jet Aviation business, how that is
performing and what you're seeing on an international basis there? Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. Let me take your – you've got two questions just embedded. First, let me talk about
services and then I want to give you guys a little bit more detail on Jet. Our service revenue was technically down
year-over-year because we sold as you may recall, several underperforming Jet facilities late last year. But with respect
to Jet, their second quarter was better than their first quarter in services and the third quarter so far is also improving.
Service activity was particularly strong in the quarter for Gulfstream. Which posted its – interestingly, its second
highest service revenue quarter in the last six quarters. And the third quarter looks pretty good, too. That's particularly
noteworthy since we had seconded service staff to the completions challenge on the 650. So very, very strong
performance. I would also point out that earnings on service increased a bit over the prior year quarter and in the first
half over the first half of 2012 on lower volume. So I like where we are.
Let me give you a little bit more details on Jet. This is a good news story. Jet was profitable in both Q1 and Q2 of this
year. And each line of their business was profitable and we expect it to remain so going forward. And I thought I might
give you some detail on Jets' lines of business. Their FBO business is at the high end of the market. Service business as
you well know is volume driven but Jet has good margins compared to its competition, particularly for not being an
OEM. But the potentially high margin business is completions where we struggled for some time on our operations.
Particularly in the high value added wide body completions market. So we have devoted a lot of our sales activity and
orders and completions have picked up. So more to come on Jet. They've turned the corner. And they've given – they
were a nice contributor in both Q1 and Q2 to Aerospace. And I anticipate that they will be for the remainder of the
year.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: That's great color. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Hi, thank you. Good morning, Phebe. On IS&T it's certainly done well considering the
environment but can you break it down as best you can. You mentioned the tactical products continuing to be firm and
appear to have bottomed out. So if you – can you give us some direction on what type of growth you're seeing and
outlook for each of the major parts. Whether it's – however you wish to break it up. Tactical products versus IT services

versus ISR, just so we can understand the three major moving parts there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. Yeah. So our IT services business is just under 50% of our revenue. And they're
seeing some really nice revenue increases. Both in their defense businesses, their Fed/Civ exposure and their
commercial markets. Our ISR business is continuing to grow slowly. And they had a very good quarter for margins.
Our tactical communications business was the one that – the one line of business that we have that was particularly
affected by its exposure to the Army. But as I mentioned, that has stabilized. That can be a very strong margin
performer. And as they restructure and embed the UK business into their business, they've got some upside. I will tell
you though again, that the backlog is there. In each one of those three lines of business to support our outlook for the
year.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: And Lucy, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning, Phebe. How are you?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: The – I want to talk about risk because I think you've been consistently talking about
managing it and trying to eliminate it where you can. Sort of two questions related to that. One is, do you have – can
you talk about any red programs and or the process you go about in terms of eliminating them or removing them? And
then second, as you think about this plan that you've articulated for restructuring the business, how much of it is just
going to be a way of life going forward and how much of it's like there's some big milestones and we've accomplished
some things and you can feel satisfied when 2013 is over?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I don't think that a high performing business is ever done trying to improve itself or shoot
for additional operational excellence. So I anticipate that we will continue to look for ways that we can improve our
profitability. And frankly, provide low cost products to our customer, which in a declining market, revenue
environment can be sort of challenging.
With respect to any consolidations, we did announce the consolidation of our OTS and ATP businesses. You didn't ask
this question but I think it's important to understand our margin story for the year. We will cover those consolidation
costs with realized savings in this year with no material impact. What that does for us is position us nicely going
forward for additional margin expansion.
Recall that this is a fairly easy business to – relatively easy business to integrate given that they've got a number of
complementary programs and in several cases the same customers. So I think that that made a lot – that was a logical
thing to do as we were going through our operational reviews. And were looking to improve our profitability and
service our customer, it was a logical outcome.
You talked about – let me just mention one other thing, too. As I noted several times or alluded to, we did restructure
our UK business. And I think that was important to ensure that we can continue to meet the needs of our UK customer.
So we're well on our way to doing that. And, of course, all of these restructurings are difficult.
You asked a question about risks and I think I've given you over time a pretty good sense of how I see the risks overall.
But we have no material red programs. We have programs that we'd like to have perform a little bit better. But our
business units know what they are. I think the best – I think as we've talked about this on the last call, the best antidote
to a budget cut is performance. And I would note that bears eat the sick and the young first. So I am – we are very
focused on maintaining our good execution on each of our programs because without that execution you become more
vulnerable. So I mean, with a $31 billion business and literally thousands of contracts, you're likely to have a few that
aren't performing up to expectation but there are none that are a red program.
