Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. It's also my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2013
earnings call. With me today are several members of our senior team: including, Jim Squires, our President; Don Seale,
Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; John Rathbone, our Chief Financial Officer; and
Marta Stewart who will take over as CFO upon John's retirement on November 1. As per usual, Don, Mark and John
will provide commentary in their respective areas and then we'll be available for your questions.
Norfolk Southern's earnings for the quarter were $1.53 per share, an increase of 23% compared with last year. These
strong results were led by growth in our merchandise and intermodal businesses combined with ongoing productivity
improvements and despite continuing weakness in the coal markets.
Looking at our top line, revenues for the quarter were $2.8 billion, an increase of $131 million or 5%. Merchandise and
intermodal revenues rose $153 million and $38 million respectively, while coal revenues declined by $60 million
compared with last year.
These results are obviously a continuation of the significant changes that we have been experiencing in the markets we
serve. And I am proud of how our team continues to respond. Through coordinated efforts between marketing and
operations, we have been able to handle the growing merchandise volumes with fewer crew starts, thereby enhancing
the strong operating leverage in our merchandise network. We achieved similar efficiencies in our intermodal and coal
networks with reduced crew starts, as Mark will show you.
Importantly, all of these efficiencies were achieved, while maintaining strong service. In fact, this quarter represents the
fifth consecutive quarter in which we have posted a service composite metric at 83% or better. Don will give you all of
the revenue details and then Mark will discuss the execution of our operating plan.
On the expense side, the continued focus on productivity kept our costs in check; and railway operating expenses rose
only 1% on the 4% increase in volume, resulting in an operating ratio of 69.9%. And John will review the financial
results in detail with you in a few minutes.
Now at this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team. And then, I'll return with some closing
remarks, before we answer your questions. Don?
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good morning to everyone. During the third quarter, strong merchandise and intermodal gains
more than offset continuing declines in coal revenue to generate $2.8 billion in total revenue, up $131 million or 5%
compared to third quarter of 2012. Merchandise increased by $153 million or 11%. And intermodal had a quarterly
revenue record of $605 million, which was up $38 million or 7% over last year. Our coal markets continued to be
impacted by weaker market conditions, leading to a decline of $60 million in revenue, which was 9% below the third
quarter of 2012.

With respect to revenue variance for the quarter, total revenue increased by $131 million, primarily driven by 4%
higher volume, coupled with increased revenue per unit in the merchandise and intermodal sectors, which offset
negative mix associated with higher intermodal shipments and lower coal volumes.
As shown on the next slide, revenue per unit for the quarter was up $12 or 1% versus third quarter of last year. During
the quarter, all of our merchandise commodities achieved yield growth with an average of $109 per unit increase or 4%
led by metals and construction, which was up 9%; followed by agriculture, which was up 4%; and automotives up 3%.
Coal revenue per unit declined $129 or 6% year-over-year, due to pricing pressure in the export market and mix
changes in our utility network.
Now turning to total volume for the quarter, shipments increased by 4% due to gains in intermodal and merchandise,
which offset a 2% decline in coal volume. Intermodal volume was up 5%, driven by strong domestic market and
road-to-rail conversions, while merchandise volume increased in all markets, except agriculture, which declined 3%
due to the poor 2012 grain crop. As noted here, our chemicals volume was up 14%, followed by metals and
construction traffic up 9%, automotives up 9%, and paper up 4%.
Drilling down to our individual market segments on the next slide; starting with coal, coal revenue was $641 million,
down 9% or $60 million compared to third quarter 2012. Continued weak demand across the domestic met and
industrial sectors, pricing pressure in the export coal sector and negative mix and reduced demand in the utility sector
all contributed to this quarterly decline.
Stagnant economic conditions in Europe and excess coal supply in the global market continues to impact the U.S.
seaboard market for both thermal and metallurgical coal. And a weaker Australian dollar now down 11% against to
U.S. dollar, since January has driven increase to Australian coal production and exports.
Despite these headwinds, we continue to partner with our coal producers, which helped us generate a 3% increase in
export volume in the quarter. In our utility markets continuing competition from natural gas, excess stockpiles at
southern utilities and reduced demand for electricity, which was down 4% in our service region during the quarter,
resulted in a 2% reduction in utility coal volume. And both domestic met and industrial coal shipments were off 8%
and 5% respectively, as soft demand and excess inventories impacted both market segments.
In our intermodal business, revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $605 million, up $38 million or 7% over
third quarter 2012, driven by 5% higher volume and a 2% increase in revenue per unit.
As depicted on slide 6 the volume gains in intermodal came from both our domestic and international markets.
Domestic volume was up 7%, due to continued highway conversions, while organic growth across our international
accounts boosted international volume by 2%.
Much of our volume increase occurred over our expanded and enhanced intermodal corridors. For example the
Heartland Corridor continues to generate double-digit growth up 19% in the quarter, again reflecting the efficiency and
productivity of double-stack service into the Ohio Valley and points beyond. And as you can see on this slide our
Crescent, Pan Am Southern, and Meridian Speedway lanes continued to generate solid growth as well.
Concluding our review of third quarter growth drivers with our merchandise results, our merchandise services
generated quarterly revenue of $1.6 billion, up 11% with broad gains across all market groups, with the exception of
agriculture, which was impacted by lower corn and soybean shipments.
In our metals and construction business, which was up 9%, higher volume was driven by increases in new aggregates
business and new terminals for sand and gravel, as well as miscellaneous construction materials.
Crude oil continued to drive our growth in the chemical sector during the quarter with an 11,000 car increase over third
quarter 2012, but was down 2,000 carloads sequentially, due primarily to maintenance at a major refinery. Increased
shipments of natural gas liquids, plastics and industrial intermediates also boosted growth in this group.
Our automotive volumes were up 9%, almost double the projected North American vehicle production for the quarter,
as a result of new business and increased production at NS-served plants. And the rebound in the housing and consumer

products markets helped us increase both lumber and pulpboard volumes by 7%, which partially offset a 13% decline
in graphic paper.
Now concluding with our outlook, we see ongoing growth opportunity in intermodal and merchandise, while the coal
market continues to face pricing, mix and global oversupply challenges. In this regard, thermal coal into Europe
continues to be challenged as the API 2 Index continues to hover in the low $80 per ton range. This is a price point at
which U.S. producers are generally at a clear cost disadvantage.
With respect to domestic met and met coal exports, both face excess supply challenges and in the export sector the
weaker Australian dollar and the possible repeal of the Australian carbon tax could place added pressure on U.S.
suppliers. Finally, sluggish electricity demand and excess stockpiles in the south, coupled with pressure from natural
gas will challenge volumes into our utility plants.
On the upside, our outlook for intermodal remains bright as we complete new facilities and launch new services, such
as the South Carolina Inland Port project at Greer, South Carolina, which will convert highway shipments from the Port
of Charleston to Greer for BMW and other customers. This new service begins this quarter and represents our latest
road-to-rail conversion initiative.
Highway conversion and international growth both represent continued opportunity ahead for our intermodal network,
and we will remain laser-focused on delivering superior intermodal service more productively and more efficiently
across our double-stack network.
Wrapping up with our merchandise markets, we continue to see growth ahead in crude by rail as well as plastics and
shale-related liquid petroleum gasses. And frac sand shipments into the shale production region should increase as
hydraulic fracturing technology evolves and requires higher volumes of sand.
In our metals markets, domestic steel production is projected to expand by 4% during 2014. Automotive production
will also continue to see solid growth as North American vehicle production is projected to increase 6% in the fourth
quarter and 3% next year.
In agriculture, the larger corn crop this year will change sourcing from the drought-driven patterns where corn was
being sourced in Iowa and Nebraska moving to our Midwest processors, reverting back to traditional patterns of
shorter-haul shuttle trains from online elevators located in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
We also expect more export grain shipments as a result of this robust harvest. And lastly, our paper and lumber market
should continue to rise with the housing market offsetting weaknesses in graphic and printing paper.
Now I'll summarize. We expect our merchandise and intermodal markets to generate overall volume and revenue
growth ahead, despite continuing headwinds in the coal sector. With respect to yield management, we remain
committed to providing strong service to our customers that supports our ability to price to the market at levels that
equal or exceed the rate of rail inflation. However, the negative mix effect of lower coal volumes and higher intermodal
shipments will continue to be seen in overall revenue per unit trends.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn it over to Mark for our operations report. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don. Starting with safety, for the first nine months of the year, our personal injury performance stands at
1.08. While we've seen an increase in our safety ratio, we're confident we're doing the right things to reduce injuries in
our workplace. Our work force is more engaged than ever before in safety. This is a direct result of our continuing
implementation of behavior-based safety training and processes.
Our operations management team has concluded their training and our 24,000 person work force will conclude training
by year-end. While implementing behavior-based safety training, we do closely monitor our serious injuries, and they
have not increased year-over-year.

Looking at our train incidents, you see a pretty good trend with a slight uptick this year in incidents related to switching
and storm-related occurrences. Train incidents after nine months is at 2.3 per million train miles. Crossing accidents for
the first nine months is down slightly from the prior year at 3.5 per million train miles.
Moving on to service performance, our composite service metric remains at a very high level and continues to show
year-over-year improvement. For the third quarter, composite performance stands at 83.6%, consistent with recent
performance, the gain was led by improvements in train performance. Consistently high service performance drives
network velocity and improves the efficiency of our operation, primarily through improved asset and resource
utilization.
Turning to the next slide, train speed, a primary component of network velocity, continues at high levels, consistent
with the performance we've seen for a number of consecutive quarters.
And moving on to terminal dwell, the other major component of network velocity, we continue to see
quarter-over-quarter improvements. In the third quarter, average terminal dwell was 21.2 hours, a modest improvement
over the third quarter last year.
Moving to the next slide, we provided a comparison of changes in volume by business type and the corresponding
change in crew starts. As this shows, we're seeing consistent improvements in operating efficiencies across all business
areas.
In general merchandise, we saw a 6% increase in volume with a 2% reduction in crew starts; while volumes in
intermodal increased 5% for the quarter, we managed a 2% reduction in crew starts. This was due in part to a 4
percentage point improvement over 2012 to reach 95% of all containers moving in double-stack service. The
improvement in loading efficiency allows trains to carry a higher volume with reduced crew starts. Similarly, coal
volume was down 2%, but crew starts were reduced 8%. Overall volumes grew 4%, while total crew starts were
reduced 3%.
As you can see on the next slide, these improvements are not limited to crew starts. Higher network velocity, along
with other productivity initiatives, continue to drive operating improvements in a number of areas. Against the volume
increase of 4% in the third quarter and concurrent with the crew start reductions that you saw in the previous slide, we
also reduced T&E overtime hours by 11% and saw a re-crew reduction of 12% over the same period last year. Velocity
driven equipment rents were essentially flat, increasing less than 1% with high velocity levels now sustained for seven
quarters. And taking advantage of existing train capacity, carloads per locomotive have improved 7%. We continue to
make improvements in fuel efficiency with gross ton miles per gallon, improving 2% over the same period last year.
Taking these trends back even further on the next slide, you can see that these are sustained improving trends in
operating efficiency. The two graphs across the top show the longer term declining trends in crew starts and re-crews
against an increasing volume trend, down 6% and 51% respectively from their peak in the first quarter of 2011.
On the bottom left, the reduction in T&E overtime hours down 40% from the peak in the first quarter of 2011. And on
the bottom right, the increase in units per locomotive, up 17%, since first quarter 2011.
These and other productivity improvements have come about through improved network velocity, technology
applications, strategic investments in infrastructure, better use of existing train capacity through improved network
planning and a number of individual projects implemented by employee teams across our network.
We expect to see ongoing benefits and are on target to exceed our $100 million in productivity gains this year alone.
And these and other initiatives will continue to drive further productivity gains as we move into next year.
Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to you, John.

Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the third quarter. Starting with our operating results, as Don
described, revenues for the quarter totaled $2.8 billion, up $131 million or 5% as merchandise gains and intermodal
volume growth outpaced coal declines.
For the quarter, railway operating expenses increased $13 million or 1%, a rate well below our 4% growth in volume.
Income from railway operations totaled $849 million, up $118 million or 16%. And our operating ratio improved 300
basis points to 69.9%.
Turning to our expenses, the next slide shows the major components of the $13 million increase; now let's take a closer
look at each of these changes by expense category. Purchased services and rents increased $17 million or 4%, largely
reflecting increased volume-related activities. These increases were partially offset by lower roadway repair cost. Fuel
expenses increased $11 million, due largely to slightly higher diesel fuel consumption.
Turning to compensation and benefit expenses, performance-based compensation and pay rate headwinds were partly
offset by productivity improvements and lower payroll taxes. Recall, our compensation is performance-based. Last year
included a favorable variance of $19 million for incentive and stock-based compensation.
Materials and others decreased $26 million or 12%, driven by favorable personal injury claims development and
reduced materials and supplies and was partially offset by higher environmental expenses. Third quarter's personal
injury costs were $18 million favorable compared to last year.
As I mentioned last quarter, our casualty and other expenses could face moderate headwinds in the fourth quarter, as
last year's results included a $17 million reduction in personal injury-related expenses.
Turning to our non-operating items, other income was down $3 million or 9%, due largely to lower coal royalties
driven by lower coal production. Interest expense on debt was up $7 million, primarily due to new debt issuances,
including $500 million issued in August of this year and $600 million issued last year in September.
Income before income taxes increased $108 million or 17%, primarily due to higher operating income. Income taxes
totaled $266 million and the effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 37.2% in 2012. The decrease was largely related
to an $8 million benefit from state tax law changes enacted in the third quarter of 2013, as well as tax credits from
legislation enacted at the beginning of this year. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year to approximate 36%.
Net income from the quarter was $482 million, an increase of $80 million or 20% compared to 2012. Diluted earnings
per share were $1.53, up $0.29 per share or 23% compared to last year; overall a very solid quarter.
As shown on the next slide, cash from operation covered capital spending and produced $934 million in free cash flow.
In the first nine months of 2013, we distributed $476 million in dividends and repurchased $564 million in shares; $250
million of that activity was in the third quarter.
In total, we have repurchased 7.5 million shares this year, approximately 3.3 million in the third quarter. Share
repurchases and proceeds from borrowings were both lower compared to the same period last year. Our balance sheet is
strong and we maintain full confidence in our ability to generate liquidity through free cash flow and access the debt
markets.
Thank you for your attention and I'll now turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, John. Well as you've heard, we had a very good third quarter in terms of operating performance and bottom
line results. As I said at the outset, we along with the rest of the industry are in a period of significant transition with
respect to our markets, as our traditional coal business continues to be challenged. While merchandise, including new
energy-related businesses, and intermodal continue to expand.

To underscore the magnitude of that transition, if you look at our results this quarter, as compared to the third quarter of
2011, 2 years ago, our coal revenues are down almost $260 million and yet our total revenues are down only some $65
million.
To make up for the loss of so much revenue and operating income in what is one of our most profitable business
segments, we have remained intent on a strategy of growing volume and pricing in our other markets, coupled with
driving productivity and velocity in our operations. While the changes in our markets are far from complete, our 2013
third quarter results including our operating ratio are a clear indication that we are on the right strategic path and we
will continue to focus on execution of all aspects of our plan.
The keys to our success remain to people of Norfolk Southern. They're the best in the business and I'm confident in
their ability to continue to drive even better results for our customers and our shareholders.
And speaking of people, let me close by both personally and on behalf of all of the Norfolk Southern team; thanking
John Rathbone for all of his years of service to our company. John has served 32 years with NS and he has been a
terrific employee and corporate officer as well as a great friend to all of us. John, thanks. And on behalf of all of us,
will you please just stop smiling so much.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to field your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna
International. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on pricing. Specifically, we watched the rail's
narrative on pricing go from market-based to inflation plus 2%, now you've said equal or exceed rail inflation. I'm just
curious in what instances do you decide that equaling rail inflation is an okay hurdle or bogie to set? I'm just trying to
understand the criteria. Is it business where the margins are at acceptable level to go forward? Or how do you just make
that decision as you're parsing new business bids and deciding what is rail inflation plus, versus what is rail inflation
equals?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Matt. This is Don. First, I would emphasize that we have reiterated in past
calls that our ongoing goal is to equal or exceed rail inflation, and also we have not veered off of our strategy of pricing
to the market. That is what drives our pricing. It is market-based. But with that said, we'd look at rail inflation ahead
and for next year for example the RCAF unadjusted is likely to come in slightly higher than 1% and the all-inclusive
less fuel is likely to come in around 2%. And our pricing targets are above both of those.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Got it. So, no change, essentially, is what I'm hearing. I guess, the second question or follow-up
would be related to pricing, there's certainly been chatter, some real, some manufactured, in the market about
intermodal pricing behavior. Just wanted you again to reiterate or frame your views there that you continue to price that
business for acceptable margin level, but essentially what are the hurdles or the metrics when you're pricing new
intermodal business on an organic basis versus highway versus maybe competitive wins? What do you need to see or
what is the discipline you have that we know that the margins in that business ex-operational improvement should hold
the line or get better over time? Thanks.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: That intermodal continues to be a competitive market and we're competing with the highway
predominantly. We were pleased with the 2% improvement in revenue per unit we saw in intermodal in this quarter.
We will continue to price in a marketplace where we can be competitive, generate a sufficient margin for reinvestment
in our assets and our network, and continue to provide the type of service that our customers expect.
<Q - Matthew Troy>: Excellent. Congrats, John.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about fuel during the quarter and if there was any lag
impact, benefit or negative?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: Yeah, the net – there was a $41 million negative lag impact for the quarter. That compares
with last year's quarter of $21 million lag impact.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay. So, it's a year-over-year negative of about $20 million?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: Right. Correct.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay. And then, just following up on the casualty line, it looked a little bit low relative to what
we were modeling. What's a good run rate to use for that category going forward?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: I would say what you should model in on that, and because of that line does have some
variability associated with our actuarial studies and it's one that's difficult to get a – because of all the safety
improvements we've had, we have a lot of benefits associated with that, I'd say, if you look at about $35 million run
rate on that, plus or minus, that should give you a good handle on that.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thanks, Allison.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah, hi there, good morning. Don, I think, in the past, maybe on the last call, you talked a little
bit about coal RPU slowing sequentially, so I guess a sequential decline, but it actually went up. Can you tell us, was
there anything with liquidated damages or anything in there that made that unusual or was it just all mix?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Bill, it was mix-related. We had no material liquidated damages amounts in the quarter; it's a
reflection of increased export shipments over the Port of Norfolk. We had a decline in export shipments over the Port
of Baltimore. We had increased shipments of northern utility coal and decreases in the south, so that's in a nutshell, the
mix effects.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Thank you. And then the follow-up is just on seasonality, so a lot of mix changes going
on in the business as you guys have mentioned. How do we think about how that should affect how margins change
sort of quarter-over-quarter? Is the fact that coal's now a smaller piece of the business and intermodal bigger, should
that mean bigger seasonal swings between things like fourth quarter and third quarter on margins? How do we think
about how that should affect the margins?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Bill, I don't see that as being a seasonal or cyclical impact. What we are seeing is that coal in
the quarter was 18% of our shipments and about 23% of our revenue. We're seeing our participation in other energy
activities, obviously continue to ramp-up and we see that as a sustainable source of volume and revenue ahead. So, I
think instead of cyclicality or seasonality, we're just seeing some substitution and replacement of commodities that

<Q - Bill J. Greene>: So, the mix on a margin basis isn't really that different, given what you've been able to do on the

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question, Mark, on the cost initiative side; you said
that you were kind of trending ahead of the $100 million target that you'd had for the year. I just want to get a sense,
when you take a step back and think about maybe a longer term perspective. As you go through the initiatives, does it
appear that you have sort of equal opportunities as you move into 2014, i.e. are you going to be able to get sort of the
same type of magnitude of changes and improvement in productivity as you move forward here? Or are there any
limiting factors from mix or otherwise?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No, Chris, we are looking for the same trend in productivity improvement and it just comes
from the fact that we have got a pipeline of a multitude of productivity projects that are lined up. Think about things
like LEADER that is less than halfway rolled out; we'll be working on that through all of 2014. Movement Planner falls
into the same camp. And then on top of that, we've got yard initiative projects, we've got local operating plant projects.
These are things that we'll be working on the rest of this year and next year.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay. And just a follow-up on the head count side, and I apologize if you missed it,
could you give us a rough sense of how you expect head count to trend over the next quarter or two?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, we have been methodically reducing our head count; and as you see year-over-year,
just on the operations side, we've reduced about 4% in the last 12 months, 4.1% to be exact. And as we go into 2014,
we're going to continue to make reductions. And again, it'll be incremental, but we're looking at a reduction of at least
several hundred people through attrition throughout the course of next year.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: That's great. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, I think a follow-up for you, Mark, and I've got to say it's impressive performance
on the reduction and crew starts with the volume growth. How do you think about the constraints on that? I know you
touched on this a little bit with head count next year, but if volumes are up another 4% next year, can you reduce crew
starts another couple of percent? That's a pretty wide and impressive gap. Or do you start to hit some train length
considerations or other factors?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, you know, if volumes are up, that'll be great. We'll operate as many crews as we have
to in order to handle the volume, obviously. But with the type of projects we have going on, we will continue to see
some improvement even in velocity, we think, just due to projects such as what's going on in our yards, where we're
doing a better and better jobs getting trains out on time, not having the delays and the re-crews that would otherwise

take place. We've got our Bellevue project that is going to be coming into its own. That builds in efficiencies. So, we're
continually taking time out of schedules. That has an effect of more efficiency, so when you put all that together, we
think we will continue to be favorable on the crew starts side, but again, it has everything to do with volume and we'll
take as much volume as we can get.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then, a question on coal; I don't think that you
specified it, maybe I missed it, but how big was the impact from the liquidated damages in third quarter, absolute level
of damages and the year-over-year? And is that something that kind of goes away fourth quarter or next year? Or does
that persist?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, as we stated previously, there was no material liquidated damages accrual in the third
quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Nice to talk with you guys in the morning.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: We're all wide awake, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Don, you talked in one of the earlier questions about how you think pricing is going to be
above that kind of the imminent inflation numbers that you see out there, but you also talked earlier about negative mix
with coal and merchandise and intermodal. When you factor in mix, do you think that your overall yield should stay
above that inflation number you talked about in that 1% range?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We believe, we're trending in that direction and we also believe that coal is most likely at the
trough in terms of where we will see it stabilize; and hopefully, we'll start to see it improve.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And are you talking about from a pricing perspective? Or a total revenue perspective, when
you say coal at the trough?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The total revenue perspective and a revenue per unit perspective.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Great. And just second question on the Crescent Corridor. So, I'm just wondering what
percent – when you first laid that out for us, there were some pretty big opportunities to take share – what percent of
that corridor do you think you've utilized so far? And do you have any views on kind of how much additional you're
planning for in terms of growth next year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're in the first inning of our growth plan for the Crescent Corridor and we identified well
over 1 million loads in the initial approach for Crescent. And we're on track, but we're in the first inning of that.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Why do you think we're only seeing single-digit growth on that corridor if it's kind of brand
new?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We are being judicious with respect to the business that we're seeking and gaining. We've
made investments in that corridor and our objective is to generate sufficient returns on those investments.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good morning, guys. Wanted to dig in a little bit on the outlook for coal here and get
a sense – your competitor has moved a decent chunk of business or will have by the end of this year to fixed variable
when they look at their coal business. Wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about that and then when you
look ahead to 2014, how much of your utility business is going to be re-pricing where you'd have an opportunity to
re-look at guaranteed minimums in pricing?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: With respect to the first part of the question, fixed and variable. We continue to have dialog
with our major utility customers regarding the concept, but I will tell you that we do not have any of that type of
formula in place today, and also we're finding our utilities to be interested, but not overwhelmingly interested in the
concept. So, we're having dialog, but I will tell you that we do not have any of that price structure in place as of now.
The second part of the question, we have about 5% of our current utility book that we're still having some discussions
and negotiations with. That will be concluded by the end of the fourth quarter and we will give you a report out on the
results of that in the January call.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. And then looking out to 2014, what was that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: 2014 that includes that 5% that we're negotiating on now, and we have no material utility
contracts that are up for renewal next year. We will have escalators in the contracts apply as we have further
contractual terms.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. Great. Just a point of clarification on the call, I think you said that when you looked
at mix that northern utilities were seeing stronger improvement versus southern, which jives of what – I would have
thought, but maybe not in terms of how that played out in RPU. Is that a positive mix for you guys or is that a negative
mix, northern...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That's a negative mix, as we've talked in the past, our northern utility business, the stockpiles
are at target. Southern utilities' stockpiles are in excess of target and our southern utility coal is about 50% greater RPU
than our northern utility coal. And in this most recent quarter, I will tell you that the split of utility north to utility south,
which generally runs 50/50, was 54% north and 46% south. So, we had a negative mix effect within that utilities
market.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. So, the sequential RPU, and a favorable mix, that would have driven that in
response to an earlier question, was pretty much solely then the export side? Or was there something else, because you
guys...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That is correct. Lamberts Point export traffic, which was up, and Baltimore traffic
shorter-haul export down, we had a positive mix effect on export business, which was up 3% in total.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: That's very helpful on a clarification basis. And then last question and I'll turn it over, on
the intermodal side, just piggybacking on what Scott was asking about before, we saw a decent volume numbers
compared to past quarters out of your competitors. Are things more competitive on the domestic intermodal side in the
east than we've seen in a while, as they've gotten up to a 90% on the double-stack and maybe starting to challenge you
guys where you've been more dominant in many of these lanes?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: We see no real change. We're focused on the highway. That's where the freight is moving.
And the highway, the motor carriers are facing hours of service changes, continuing changes with respect to driver
availability, so we still see the overall value proposition for intermodal and the competitive situation essentially the
same.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. My question is a kind of a follow-up on the
intermodal pricing, I believe it was you, Wick, or perhaps Don that mentioned you were trending negative 1% in Q2
and then switched to positive 2% in the Q3. And just throwing it back to you, there was the view that perhaps you had
been using price as a mechanism to fill some of your lanes in the backdrop of a weaker economic environment, what
have you, or to drive truck volume over on to your rail network. Is the shift from negative 1% to plus 2% a change in
pricing philosophy? And was that an accurate assessment back in Q2 and that's changed now? Or was there something
else at play that we should be considering?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I wouldn't read too much into sequential quarter-to-quarter revenue per unit changes. We
don't price a large portion of our intermodal business on 90 day increments; we price it in longer term increments than
that. So fuel changes, mix changes, lane changes, all of that are predominant quarter-to-quarter, but yield is not going to
change in a major way quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And just to confirm here, John, did I hear you say there was an $8 million one-time
tax benefit in the quarter, in third quarter 2013?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: Yes. And that's related to North Carolina reduced our tax from 6.9% to 6% to 5% over a
two-year period, and that's the reduction related to deferred taxes on that recognition and the balance sheet of those
deferred tax benefits that we picked up.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And Don, could you, I don't know if you mentioned the split between met and utility
on your export side in the quarter, roughly?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: All right. It was 79% met, 21% thermal.

<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Can you just jump into that mix shift a little bit and was there
anything that caused that shift over to Lamberts? And on the same vein, any thoughts on the export market into 2014.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Our Lamberts Point Port of Norfolk coal was strong in terms of the quarter for export,
predominantly based on metallurgical coal flowing to China. As you probably recall, we had a couple of press releases

in the quarter. We loaded one vessel with 168,000 metric tons of export metallurgical coal destined to China, which
was the largest coal cargo ship loaded in the Northern Hemisphere. So, we saw met coal out of Central App continuing
to be in demand in China during the quarter.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Fourth quarter [ph] mix (48:50).
<A - Donald W. Seale>: And what was the second part of the question?
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Just your thoughts on the export market into 2014; I guess, now you've seen this...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, it's a mixed bag, it's very murky. The thermal coal, as I've mentioned, is subject to
world forces. With an API 2 in the Europe, that's too low versus the cost structure for U.S. producers.
On the met coal, we see continuing opportunity, but we don't see a robust market. The Australian currency that I
mentioned in my prepared remarks continues to make Australian coal more competitive. And should the new Prime
Minister and government in Australia remove the carbon tax, Australian exports will become even more competitive.
So, we have an outlook on coal that's less than encouraging.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. And if I can get my follow-up on intermodal, Wick or Don, I guess it was an
impressive answer before on the yield side and intermodal. And kind of you're restrained. You're showing on the new
lanes that you're opening in order to get that return that you want on your investment, so what – when do you unleash
that? Is that just J.B. Hunt going in or your large customers going in and selling that? Or are you doing something to
more actively market those lanes to convert that highway traffic, just so we can understand the growth dynamics from
those opening up?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're working with all of our intermodal partners as well as directly having dialog with
beneficial cargo owners, as we normally do. So, we have a high service value in that quarter, and it has great demand
and great promise and potential. And what we're doing is just being prudent in the way we launch it and ramp it up.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Appreciate that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Morning.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: If I could follow-up from Ken's question there on the new range for intermodal, and
along the lines of the efficiency gains, so maybe this one's for Mark, but are you running at ideal densities right now in
those new intermodal segments? And is that some of the upside on the efficiency story for 2014?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We've got plenty of room to grow, if that's the question, in those intermodal segments, all of
them.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, when you first start up those lanes, are you getting ideal densities overnight?
Or is this something that builds up and the profitability builds up as you get market share?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: This is something that continues to ramp over time and there's really two pieces to it. One is
filling up the train size and then as it necessitates, we'll add actual trains to those corridors.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: And from a capacity perspective right now, where would you put available capacity
in your network on the intermodal?

<A - Mark D. Manion>: A lot. I don't have a percentage for you, but we've got a lot of room to grow. And you've got
to think in terms of the fact that over the last, really, I guess, we're going on almost 10 years now where we have every
year methodically, surgically been adding infrastructure improvement to what in the past was chokepoints or potential
chokepoints. So, we're staying ahead of that. And so, between a pretty robust infrastructure to start with as well as
improvements throughout the years, there's a lot of room out there.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: All right. Thanks for that. And Don, real quick on grain, how is the shifting of
sourcing of corn and grain in your area going to impact point of haul in yields?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That's a good question. I'm glad you asked it. As I pointed out, the drought of this past year
forced us to source a lot of grain in Nebraska and Iowa, coming over Chicago, coming to our processors in the Midwest
and even some going into the Southeast. That will revert to more traditional origins with this new robust crop, where
we will source a lot of that corn and – the corn for processing in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, which will result in a
shorter-haul lower RPU going into points like Decatur, Illinois, for example, or Lafayette, Indiana. So, still good
business, just going back to the patterns that are normal.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Thanks for that.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning. On CapEx, I was wondering if you had any early read on what we
could expect in 2014. And also if you could provide any breakdown in terms of the need for infrastructure, equipment,
PTC, et cetera, that would be helpful as well.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, we haven't taken a capital budget to our board yet, so we haven't announced any kinds
of numbers. The capital budget, I think we have talked before, will be roughly order of magnitude of where we are
today. We clearly have a big PTC nut out there in front of us and then we have our typical ongoing needs. We've talked
in the past about we are slowly replacing our coal car fleet, which is becoming life-expired over a period of about 10
years, so we'll see projects like that, but we don't have a good number for you yet and we'll obviously be talking a lot
about that in January when we talk with you again.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. And maybe for my second question, there's clearly been a lot of uncertainty about the
direction in the U.S. export coal market recently and I realize it will be volatile with weather, exchange rates, et cetera.
But longer term, just based on what you're hearing from your customers, do you have a best guess on a normalized
range for the U.S. export market? Do you think it's an 80 million, 90 million, 100 million ton market on an annual
basis?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You know, we wish we did, we really just don't have a crystal ball that's good enough right
now to predict what's coming down the path. We have a lot of confidence over the long term in the strength of our
export metallurgical coal franchise. We serve a lot of high quality metallurgical coal producers and that's coal over the
long-term that we think will always be in demand. But in terms of some kind of ratable number for years, we just don't
know and we certainly don't have very good insight into the long-term prospects for U.S. export thermal coals. We, and
a lot of people, would hope that that's a very bullish proposition, but we just don't know yet.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Thanks. That's all for me. Appreciate the time.

<Q - Tom Kim>: Morning. Thank you. With regard to intermodal, can you just give us an idea where you think a more
normalized growth rate might be for the Heartland Corridor? And then also, what will be an update on or an outlook for
the Meridian Speedway; and again the longer-term opportunity in that particular corridor? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, the Heartland Corridor continues to be robust. We don't expect quarter-to-quarter to
quarter-to-quarter increases of 19%. That would be a compounding phenomenon, but it's going to continue to be a
robust growth corridor for us. We have a suite of services to and from the Port of Virginia that is in great demand
around the world with double-stack service to Columbus, Detroit, back to Chicago. So, that corridor will continue to
grow. Don't think we'll project that type of growth that we're seeing in the third quarter, but it'll be substantial.
The other corridors will continue to grow, again, as we compete with highway carriers and partner with our intermodal
partners and beneficial cargo receivers, to the extent that the prices that we put in and the volumes we gain are
attractive and generate appropriate returns.
<Q - Tom Kim>: With regard to the Meridian Speedway more specifically, I mean, do you see potential for this
somewhat relative underperformance to change? And what maybe strategically, you've been sort of focused on to
accelerate the growth?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I would remind you that the Meridian Speedway is focused more on a developing suite of
services to and from Mexico. The transcon business associated with Meridian Speedway, too, is a more mature
intermodal market. We're seeing a much higher growth rate on local eastern intermodal as opposed to the more mature
transcontinental intermodal market. And Mexico has great potential, but it's just beginning to ramp up, tying into our
new Birmingham hub that we finished at McCalla, Alabama near Birmingham.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. If I can just squeeze in one last question with regard to your general preference between
international versus domestic intermodal. Is there one or a point, like – the difference in pricing? And then, if you had a
choice between international versus domestic, would you prefer one over the other? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We prefer both. The revenue per unit on the international, because it's a private container,
marine container, is lower revenue per unit, but it's attractive business. And since, we're supplying a lot of the domestic
boxes for the domestic intermodal world, it generates a higher revenue per unit; but both are attractive sectors for us.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, gentlemen. And, John, good luck in retirement, sir. If I could go back to the
question in terms of yields expected for 4Q on the ag side, you said it should revert more back to normal. Are you
talking sort of back to that $2,100 a-carload level that we've seen in the past? Or am I going a little bit too low for the
conversion to more shuttle trends?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, I don't want to guide you on the revenue per unit per se, but there will be some other
moving parts that will impact the changes to normal patterns for domestic grain. As I mentioned in the comments, we
see export grain ramping up, because of the large crop this year, and as you know, the export market last year was
non-existent, because of the lack of grain supplies. So, generally our export trains will generate a higher RPU that will
be blended in to mute some of the return to normalized patterns on the domestic grain. So, we'll just have to see how
that comes together, because if we run more export trains than we have planned, which we could, that would have an
impact on any number that I would give you.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. What percent is export versus the shuttle, of the business?

<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, last year, we had very little export grain at all. This year, we will have a fairly
substantial export program. I can't give you the percentage of the total.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Because you'd be predicting the export market, I understand that. If I could jump to my
follow-up question, in terms of the personal injury rates, obviously, it crept up a little bit and there is a negative
comparison in 4Q that you mentioned. When is the next actuarial study on the personal injury rate?
<A - John P. Rathbone>: We do those quarterly. So each quarter, we evaluate those personal injuries, and as Mark
said, when we look at the creep of the injury rate going up slightly, but as Mark mentioned in his comments, the
severity has not crept up. The serious injuries have not changed, so that gives us comfort about our accruals.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. Fantastic. Gentlemen, thank you for the time as always.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good morning, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my question. I had a question about the
stockpiles in the Southeast of the utilities, which have been above normal for a number of years now, would have
thought that by now they would be getting close to normal. What is it that's preventing them from moving in that
direction? Is it fear of liquidated damages? And when do you think that we might expect that they would be brought
down to normal levels, so that your movements into that area would be more of what you would expect to see over the
long term?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, John. The southern utility stockpiles are being impacted by two broad factors.
First, natural gas competition even with natural gas prices increasing from a moderate perspective to about $3.60 per
million BTU, natural gas is still competing in the south at a higher rate than it is in the north, in our view.
Second is electricity demand just hasn't recovered from the recession. It's down 4% in our service territory. So, you put
those two things together and then also the summer weather was just not as warm as it was forecasted to be. It was a
cooler summer. So, those three factors combined, we saw the utility stockpiles at utilities we serve in the south tick up
by about a day coming off the second quarter into the third quarter.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then maybe as the follow-on, over in
Mark's operating area, great improvements have been made there with respect to more productive train starts. I gather
from some of the data that your train speed is reaching sort of steady state and terminal dwell may be reaching steady
state. Is there much room for improvement there? If not, is all of the productivity really going to come from increased
train length going forward?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We think there is continued improvement yet, and it has to do with – we've got a number of
productivity projects out there, but projects such as things that depart our trains out of terminals on time, keep them
from having to be re-crewed, taking time out of our schedules; just various things that increase the overall efficiency of
the train network we think that will have an impact on our overall velocity. So, we think there is still some upside in the
velocity.
And still some improvement yet to be had in our dwell in terminal, because you got to remember, even though, right
now, we've got our dwell down at really what our operating plan is, our operating plan is something that we change, we
tweak as we go forward. And as we reduce our – as we tighten up our train schedules, we change our train plan, we
change our operating plan and that has an effect of reducing the overall dwell that's taking place in terminals. So, we
still see upside in it.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you. Appreciate the answer.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much, and congratulations on a strong quarter. I just wanted to follow-up
a little on Allison's question earlier. We were talking about some of the changes to materials and others line. I think you
mentioned the casualties, $23 million, probably $35 million is a more sustainable level. Can you talk about the other
elements that drove that down about $26 million year-to-year; how sustainable are those?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Most of that came from the reduction, as we said, reduction in favorable personal injury
claim reserves, offset by our environmental expense, which were slightly higher for the quarter. But I think a $35
million quarter run rate on those casualties looks fine on a go-forward basis. But, if you're talking about materials and
other, if you look at backwards on that you'll – if you take an average over a year or two and about $100 million is
about what the quarterly run rate is on that, $100 million, $102 million, something of that nature is what we guided to
in the past on those kind of line items.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you. And then a tax rate question. You mentioned the $8 million related to
the change in the North Carolina rates, but it seems like the tax rate guidance going forward is about 100 basis points
below what we were thinking, 37% going to 36%. Should we think of 36% as kind of the tax rate that we should use
going forward or is there a reason that would be a different number?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: I think it would be back to a more normalized rate, because this year we did have those
unique items. And you'll remember that at the beginning of the year we did have some tax benefits from the research
and development credits that came in and then you have the short-line credits that will likely expire.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: So, when we say normalized, are we thinking 37% to 38% or more 36.5%?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. All right. Very good. Well, congratulations. All my other questions have been
answered. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Don, with the export coal rates
through Lamberts to met, are you seeing continued pressure on that due to the changes in the market? Or is that rate
sort of holding firm as we kind of move through the quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Sequentially, second quarter to third quarter stable. We still see year-over-year compression
that we've talked about in the past. It's not the same market as it was in 2011 or even early 2012.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: But you're sort of holding in?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Holding in is a good way to put it.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: That is great. And then, just as a second follow-up question, is it like, I think the second
year now where we haven't had many utility contracts coming up? And I guess, I wanted to get an understanding.

What's the average duration on the utility customers that you guys have as far as their contract terms?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: They range from three to five years, but I will tell you, our larger utilities are five years.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Large utilities are five years.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Right.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. So, does that imply that we'll see a pick-up in the rate of renewals coming up
next year? Or...
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Not in 2014.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Not in 2014?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. All right. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah, thanks. Would you please share the proportion of coal volume as hauled from each
geographic region like you did in the last call?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah. The Illinois Basin is growing at the fastest pace. It, in the quarter was 16% of our
tonnage. PRB is still around 18% of our tonnage. Central App is still about 38% and Northern App is the balance.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And one other question, a mix question, can you comment on how changes in mix over
the past few years are affecting the ratio of loaded to total miles? It seems like it's been pretty flat in the last three years,
but would you expect a mix that is leaner in coal and richer in intermodal to perhaps present opportunities to increase
this ratio?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, as we transport more crude oil and more ethanol and that type of product that moves in
a private tank car, as you know, all of those movements are 100% empty-returned. We price that accordingly, because
it's a private asset, to return that car set back to the origin. So, when you look at loaded to empty miles in our network,
you will have to take into account the growth of that type of traffic over time.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Okay. So, some of those tank car moves are dominating the increase in intermodal in this
ratio?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, the empty to loaded miles...
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yes.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: ...as a total. Now, if you look at intermodal and drill just into that segment, obviously, we
monitor that very closely and generally our loaded to empty mile ratio is improving.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Hey. Good morning. Hey, Mark, I may have missed it, but can you give us an update of where
you are exactly on the Movement Planner rollout specifically? And has that technology been a driver of the
productivity improvements recently? Or is that more something we see in 2014, 2015?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Movement Planner has been implemented now on 4 of our 11 divisions and we are ramping
it pretty quickly now. We will get it fully implemented in 2014, optimistically midway through the year, but certainly
by the end of the year. And so at this point, I think we are seeing some of the benefits, even though, it's pretty early on
in the game. We're seeing some of the benefits of Movement Planner. We think we're seeing some of our velocity
improvement on account of that technology, but more to come.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay. Perfect. And then Don, just changing gears real quick, do you by chance have the size of
the EMP fleet? And do you have any expectations on whether that pool is going to expand or shrink next year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: As Wick indicated, we haven't announced our capital budget. We will be reviewing that with
our board in November. The EMP fleet overall is in the range of 30,000 units. We do expect it to expand.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay. Perfect. And then just real quick, is there a big difference in ARPU between a private box
and a public pool box?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: If it's a private box, obviously, that's taken into account where we don't have the asset cost
associated with it, so there would be a delta; but I wouldn't say that it's a significant differential in the domestic market.
It's more pronounced on the marine containers, which are [ph] 40-foot TEUs versus 53s (74:03) in the domestic market.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Hostutler>: Thanks.
