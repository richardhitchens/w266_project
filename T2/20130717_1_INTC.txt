MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second quarter 2013 Intel Corporation earnings conference call.
My name is Jamie, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is
being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Mark Henninger, Director of Investor Relations. Please
proceed, sir.
Mark Henninger
Great, thank you, Jamie, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. By now you
should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with that. If you have not
received both documents, they're available currently at our investor website, INTC.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear
brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the
environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for

make our results available on our IR website, INTC.com, about a minute after the market close and no longer distribute
quarterly financial results through a newswire service.
With that, let me hand the call back over to Brian.
Brian M. Krzanich
Thanks, Mark. It's great to have a chance to speak to you all on my first earnings call as CEO. The last two months
have been exciting for me. I've spent the majority of my time meeting with customers, employees, and my executive
team. I've heard a wide variety of views about our industry and Intel, how we're positioned, where we're strong, and
where we can improve.
I've had the opportunity to share my vision and strategy for our company and lay out my expectations as we move into
the new era with an updated set of priorities. Those conversations were even more enthusiastic and more confident than
ever about our opportunity as a company. Intel has unmatched assets in process technology and architecture, a powerful
brand, and talented employees that are producing some remarkable results. Let me give you a few highlights from the
second quarter.
There were several significant milestones in Mobility. First, we unveiled details about our next-generation Atom
architecture, code named Silvermont. The Silvermont architecture will deliver up to a 5X reduction in power at the
same level of performance or up to a 3X improvement in performance over our prior generation of architecture.
Silvermont is unique in its ability to span the market's appetite for computing, from ultra-mobile devices to the data
center, and it supports both Windows and Android. The Silvermont platform will underpin our products for tablets,
two-in-ones, and desktops as well as our phones and microserver products for the data center. The products will be Bay
Trail, Merrifield, and Avoton respectively.
Then at Computex, we launched the Haswell family of processors, which deliver the biggest improvement in battery
life in Intel's history, making no compromises, high-performance two-in-one devices that make all-day battery life a
reality. Haswell along with Bay Trail will power the more than 50 different two-in-one devices in the pipeline,
including the very first fanless Core designs.
During the same week at Computex, we also announced a landmark tablet design in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. The
Galaxy Tab 3 will use an Atom SoC and our LTE solution, signaling important progress in the tablet space.
The data center strategy is continuing to pay dividends. Our cloud and storage business each grew their revenue more
than 40% year over year. Networking grew more than 20%. And the high-performance computing business won 98%
of all new systems entering the top 500 list. In fact, the number one system on the top 500 was all-Intel for the first time
since 1997, using a combination of Intel Xeon CPUs and Xeon Phi accelerators.
And finally, our investments and expertise in process technology continue to be the foundation of our industry
leadership, with 22-nanometer defect density and throughput times at record low levels and 14-nanometer on track to
enter production by the end of the year. Together, these accomplishments highlight to me what's possible when we
focus our resources on the right objectives and we hold ourselves accountable for results.
At the same time, I understand that we've not always lived up to the standard that we've set for ourselves. Intel was
slow to respond to the ultra-mobile PC trends. The importance of that can be seen in the current market dynamics. The
traditional PC market segment is down from our expectations at the beginning of the year while ultra-mobile devices
like tablets are up. Even more important, there will always be another next big thing. It's our job to continue to scan for
emerging trends, unlocking, participating in, and shaping these nascent markets. Doing that will require some changes
at Intel, which we have begun.
Just a few weeks ago, I announced a significant reorganization. The changes we made flatten the organization, improve
decision-making, and will contribute to a culture of even greater accountability. These elements are critical in the fast
paced ultra-mobile environment.

In addition to the organizational changes, we have made several strategy and priority changes that will allow us to
focus and win in that environment. These changes will drive a greater emphasis on our Atom-based products, bringing
the full weight of our process and architectural leadership to the Atom family. We will move Atom even faster to our
leading-edge silicon technology and focus on the SoC integration of key components like graphics, communication,
and other devices. This does not mean we will lessen the value or leadership of our core product family, but rather
make Atom an equal player in technology leadership for the ultra-mobile space. Both product lines will be driving
Intel's future.
Some of the changes we're making are subtle, and some are more transformational. In general, you're likely to see us
making moves and adjustments in the market before you hear us talking about them. We will, of course, have a
substantive update at the investor meeting in November.
What I can say now is that all of the changes are focused on value creation. Our company has a strong record of cash
flow generation and returning that cash to our owners. I recognize that we are the stewards of our owners' capital, and
that tradition will continue.
I'm excited about what lies ahead. Intel is a company with extraordinary assets at its disposal, and I'm looking forward
to making the most of those assets in an environment where the pace of innovation and market transformation is faster
than it's ever been.
With that, let me turn it over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through our second quarter financials and our expectations as we
head into the back half of the year. Then we can get right into Q&A.
The second quarter results came in as expected. Second quarter revenue came in at $12.8 billion, up 2% from the first
quarter. The Core business came in as expected, but we saw some softness in our baseband business. At a segment
level, the PC group grew 1% sequentially, and the Data Center group grew 6%.
As expected, inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly, as customers began building
Haswell-based PCs, but inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages based on uncertainty
heading into the back half of the year.
For the third quarter of 2013, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the
second quarter, which is at the lower end of the historical range as a result of our expectation that our customers will
continue to operate with lean inventory levels exiting the third quarter.
Moving to gross margin, second quarter gross margin at 58% was in line with our guidance and up two points from the
first quarter as a result of the qualification for sale of additional Haswell products and higher volume. As expected, the
reduction in excess capacity charges in the second quarter was offset by an increase in 14-nanometer startup costs. For
the third quarter, we expect gross margin to increase three points to 61% as we qualify our Bay Trail product line for
sale, increase our volume, and start to see factory startup costs come down.
For the second quarter, spending was in line with expectations at $4.7 billion. For the third quarter, we're forecasting an
increase to total spending of $100 million. The reclassification of spending on process engineers from cost of sales to
R&D increases our spending, but we expect this will be mostly offset by spending reductions across the company.
These spending reductions allow us to reduce our spending forecast for the year to $18.7 billion. Operating income for
the second quarter was $2.7 billion, with earnings per share of $0.39.
Taking look at the balance sheet, total cash and investments ended the quarter at $17.4 billion, up slightly from the first
quarter. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $5 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately $1
billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets, and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.

While our first half financials played out as expected, the overall PC market segment for 2013 is expected to be weaker
than we forecasted at the beginning of the year. Our expectation is now that revenue will be approximately flat to last
year. As a result, our gross margin forecast for the year is now 59% versus the prior forecast of 60%. Additionally, we
have reduced our forecast for capital spending by $1 billion, to $11 billion.
We have an unprecedented lineup of products coming to market in the second half of this year across all the segments
of our business. Haswell delivers a historical increase in battery life across a diverse lineup of ultra-mobile form factors
like two-in-one convertibles, tablets, and other touch-enabled devices. In the second half, we will launch Bay Trail,
which will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablets and PCs.
In our phone business, we are on track to ship multimode data and voice LTE baseband solutions as well as our
next-generation applications processor, code name Merrifield, by the end of the year. In the data center, we have new
microserver and Xeon class products coming to market in the second half. This leadership product portfolio is built on
an extending manufacturing lead which gives us the world's highest performing, lowest cost, and lowest power
transistors. Building on this leadership further, we are on track to start production on our 14-nanometer process
technology in the back half of this year.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right, thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we'll ask each participant to
ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Also, we are experiencing some network interference, so I'll ask all
participants to speak slowly and clearly. And if we're not able to hear you, we will ask you to repeat the question.
Jamie, if you could go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Glen Yeung from Citigroup.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thanks for letting me ask a question. The first one is on the second half of the year and your
outlook there. If I look at your guidance for the year and your guidance for Q3, the implication is 7% sequential growth
in revenues for the fourth quarter, and I wonder. That's obviously high relative to historical norms, like numbers we
saw back in the early part of the last decade, and I wonder what gives you the confidence there? Is there something
about the mix? Obviously new product, but is there also something about the mix maybe between data center and
client?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes. Hi, Glen, this is Stacy. I would characterize – I guess I'd say this, it's a little early to get
that specific about Q4. At this point, I would expect seasonal, which is a little less than what you said, but still gets us
into that kind of flat year-on-year revenue growth. And I think the tale for us will really be written in the back half of
Q3 when we start to see how our customers are putting in place inventory in anticipation of that fourth quarter selling
season.
And right now, our view on that is fairly cautious. We expect that they will continue to run lean inventory levels, but
the reality is we won't know that until we get into late August, early September. That's when you'd normally start to see
them putting in the supply line. That also aligns with other things in the industry. And so we think that's when we're
likely to really get a sense of Q3 and the momentum into Q4.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: All right, thanks for that. Okay, and the next question is for Brian; first of all, Brian,
congratulations on your new role. The question is now that you're in that role for a couple of months and, as you say,
you've talked to customers, today Intel has very good products in mobile and tomorrow will have arguably the best

products in mobile, and maybe they do today. But I wonder in your discussions with customers if you think that that's
enough, if the customer base is now open to accepting an x86-based processor in what has traditionally been an ARM
market, or does it matter?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Okay. As Mark said, it was a little hard to hear you on our side. We're having some
network issues, but let me try to answer your question. The question is can x86 go into these ultra-mobile markets and
how do the customers view that? And my answer would be they are more than willing to accept it. The fact that x86
works on both Android and Windows is a real advantage to our OEM base. They look at that and say that they can have
one architectural design, one set of products, and use both operating systems. So it's a unique feature that we are able to
provide.
It has more been a focus by Intel of actually going in and designing for those markets and moving our products in there.
You really see that with Haswell and Bay Trail, Haswell on the Core side and Bay Trail on the Atom side really being
designed for those ultra-mobile products. We talked about Haswell producing the first fanless Core products out there
in the market in any kind of real volume; and then Bay Trail really being designed for the much lower price points that
you see these tablets and even down to the entry-level tablets. And so the fact that it's x86 is an advantage actually
because we've been able to produce both Android and Windows on our product now.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Great, thanks so much.
Operator
The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. Brian, first of all, how should we think about ASP trends in the PC
segment? I think you are applying 3% sequential declines in Q2, and you're guiding to another 50 point gross margin
hit from lower ASPs in Q3. Why are you not seeing more of an uplift from the rollout of Haswell?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: This is Stacy. I'll take that one because it was in the CFO commentary that I put out. You should
think of it as mix shift for us in share at the low end of the market. I think if you look at our first half results, you'll see
we came in pretty much in line with what we thought during a time where the TAM was somewhat weaker than we
thought. I think the offset there, the plug is that we gained some share at the low end. And so we have a bit more mix at
the lower end, and then due to share win that particular segment of the market.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks, Stacy. And as a follow-up, why are we not seeing more benefits from the decrease in
14-nanometer startup costs? Like when I look at the uplift we should expect this time, they're not as much uplift as we
have seen in prior cycles when the startup costs have decreased, and I think your guidance implies a sequential gross
margin decline in Q4. If you could just walk us through the puts and takes, I would appreciate that.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, I'm sorry, we are having networking problems, so let me make sure I got your question.
You're asking simplifying, what are we seeing in terms of the startup cost trend relative to prior, and what are the puts
and takes for Q4? Is that what your question is?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Yes, relative to gross margins, that's right.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Relative to gross margin, sure. So the startup cost trend is directionally the same as what we've
seen in other generations. It will be the same shape, generally the same impact on gross margin. So you see the peak in
startup costs in the second quarter. They'll come down some in Q3, and then we'll get a bigger benefit in Q4, and then
they'll come down a bit more in the first half of next year. So it's a comparable trend.
In the fourth quarter, the puts and takes – so let me just do the gross margin progression across the year. We were at
56% in Q1. We hit our forecast in Q2 of 58%. We're expecting a few points of increase in the third quarter to 61%. And
then as I think about Q4, I think we have a couple of tailwinds. So I would expect volume to be up some. We should
get some good news associated with startup costs. And then the offset in Q4 is going to be we should be well into the
build of Broadwell, so doing the build on the pre-qualification material. So my sense is we'll have an increase in

inventory write-offs in the fourth quarter, and that offsets some of this good news.
Net-net of all that, I expect gross margin in the fourth quarter to be at or maybe a little bit higher than where we are in
Q3 and hit that forecast in another 90 days. And just so we don't get lost in code names, that product is our lead product
on 14-nanometer, so that aligns with being in manufacturing in the back half of the year on 14-nanometer.

The next question comes from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Thanks, guys. Hey, Brian, you said in the press release and the spiel up front that
you're taking in a wide variety of views from customers and people with the company and stuff like that. Could you
just give us your opinion on what has surprised you and maybe how your view has changed on what you think has been
important out there?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure, so I don't know if anything really surprised me. I think the things that were positive
for me is that our customers especially, they want Intel to get into this expanding ultra-mobile market. They're looking
for Intel to be stronger and have a better and more capable product lineup in there. And they're excited about the
products that we have coming, Haswell and Bay Trail. So the key message that they've been giving us is we really want
you there. We see the products coming. We want even more and we want a faster lineup following those. And so you
heard in my speech today and in the earnings release that we're really putting a much, much stronger effort on Atom
and driving our SoC integration and pulling it forward to the leading edge. So I'd say that was the major point or major
comments I got back from our customer base.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Thanks. And then as my follow-up, so you guys are guiding for some decent growth
here in the second half of this year. If we go back to last year, you were essentially flat in the second half. So can you
just give us your sense of what's driving the confidence that things are going be better for you guys in the second half
of this year versus the second half of last year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, I'd say it's a couple things. And I'd also say what we're guiding for Q3 is sub-seasonal
growth off of an okay Q2 but not a gangbuster Q2. So I don't think it's a wildly optimistic forecast.
In terms of the tailwinds that I see, first and foremost is the product cycle. Haswell is great product for ultrabooks and
two-in-ones. And as Brian said, with Bay Trail coming to the marketplace, we're going to be hitting price points in the
touch-enabled segment of the PC market that we've never touched before, and we'll be able to do that profitably. And
we'll start to gain share in tablets. We've got our first big tablet wins out in the marketplace. And with Bay Trail we
think, again, we enable other designs to come to market at price points that are going to make nice year-end consumer
price points.
The second tailwind that I'd say is we expect generally an improving macroeconomic climate as we go into the back
half. I think that's aligned with most economists. In the first half, the U.S. was a little bit stronger than we had thought
starting the year. China was a little bit weaker, but generally I'd expect an improving macroeconomic environment in
the back half.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Thank you.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Brian, although early the initial
read we're getting on Bay Trail with your partners is pretty positive, I think that driving a concern in the investment
community with whether or not Bay Trail is going to be so good that it starts to cannibalize Haswell. And so I guess I'd
like to get your thoughts on how you can segment the market properly. To what extent do you think you're a slave to
market forces? And to what extent do you think you can bring applications that are MIPS intensive into the ecosystem
and secure the Core business, even as you try to get more aggressive in Bay Trail and Atom?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So first, let me tell you. Our view right now on Bay Trail is that we don't believe it
will be cannibalistic in that nature. We believe what it really does is allows us to get into these markets that we're not
in, in a big way today. And that, as Stacy said, are these sub-$400, sub-$300 in some case, clamshells and
touch-enabled convertibles and two-in-one devices. And tablets, $199 and below, some you're going to see even lower,
below $150 and much below that as we go through the holiday season. So Bay Trail really first and foremost we
believe gives solid performance, solid battery life relative to the competition in price points and markets that we're
simply not in, in a big way today. So we look at it mostly as an expansive.
The other thing that I think is a point is Haswell, as we said, is the largest battery life improvement in Intel's history
along with great performance. And it's providing products that have Core-level performance that will be fanless for the
first time. So we still believe that there's a strong drive for performance in segments of this market that look for
high-def video performance, gaming, all the things that if you actually look at a lot of the tablet usage even, people are
doing more and more. And definitely in these two-in-one and convertible devices, people look for that kind of
application. So we believe that Haswell allowing us to go down into those better price points and lower power will give
us the performance option to keep people up into those regions.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: If I can just add a couple of data points on that in terms of what we've seen over the last few
years. First off, to reinforce what Brian said, there still is a big gap in terms of performance and features between the
best of Bay Trail and the Core i3/i5/i7 segment of our product line. And if you look at the last three years, even in a
time where the market has been relatively weak, Core i5/i7 volumes have been very healthy. And if anything, we've
seen a larger mix overall to Core over that time period. So it says there still is this healthy segmentation in the
marketplace. Where Bay Trail will play, it will start to expand us into markets where we don't play today. And because
of the cost structure, we think we can do it with more dollars per unit than we would be able to do if we were going
after that segment, say, with Celeron or even with some of the low end of the Pentium roadmap. So it's a powerful
product from that perspective, John.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: At the end of the day, the market will go where the market goes, and better to have a
product like Bay Trail that we can play no matter where it goes rather than miss that market, which if you look over the
past was more the case.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: That's helpful, guys. And then as my follow-on, Stacy, several years back you put out a
long-term gross margin target of 55% to 65%. I think for most of the time since you put that target out, you've been
operating near the higher end of that range. I'm just curious. As you start bringing Bay Trail, Merrifield, put a renewed
effort into the Atom space, should we think that the next three years that that range is going to be more directed
towards the lower half, or are there other puts and takes within the gross margin range?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: As you probably anticipate, I'm not going to get pinned down inside the range. I'm still very
comfortable with the 55% to 65%. I think this second half is a great proof point. We're going to be – from Q1 to Q3,
we're going to quadruple our tablet volume. We're running at a 61% gross margin at the company level. As Brian said,
the market is going to go where it's going to go. We've got some great products that give us a cost structure to go after
them profitably, and I'm still confident in that gross margin range. And we'll talk more about the specific segments
when we get to the investor meeting.

<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
Operator
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First on the annual revenue guidance, your prior
guidance had total revenues up in the low single digits as well as total units up in the low single digits. With the new
guidance of relatively flat revenue, does that essentially imply flat total units? And if so, how important is the Bay Trail
launch and Bay Trail volumes to actually achieving that type of a unit target?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Apologies, Stacy. Let me restate your question and make sure I'm answering it because that was
a little garbled in the middle. And it's not your fault, we're just having some issues on our part. I think what you're
asking me is defend my flat revenue forecast and give you a sense of what's going on in client versus other segments of
the business and, in particular, what's going on with units. Is that where you were going?
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Yes, that's it. And then if the guidance does actually imply flat units correlated with your
revenue, how important is gaining Bay Trail volume in the back half to achieving that type of a unit outlook?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, okay. Let me go there. So first, I'd say we would actually expect that overall compute
units, so tablets up through PCs, that they'll be down some this year, and that's consistent with a flat revenue forecast
for the company. So let me just walk you through, and I'll just start with what you've seen from Gartner and IDC of
their view of the year.
We're pretty aligned with those numbers in terms of our view of the classic PC market. But to get to then our units, you
have to make some adjustments to that. So first off, in their classic view of PCs, that would not include some of the
ultra-mobile devices, i.e., the Microsoft Surface Pro. So you would add that in to get to our PC Client Group units. We
think we're gaining some share in tablets, so that's a little bit of an offset. Netbooks for us is declining pretty
significantly. That's not in the PC Client Group segment. That's in the other IAG [Intel Architecture Group] segment.
And then as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, we think we gained some share, so that also gives us a little bit of
help. But when you net all that out, you'd say our units and our revenue for the PC Client Group is down year over
year. It's just not down as much as the headline number that you see from Gartner. So you start there.
And then the offsets to that, the places where we're growing is Data Center Group, which we think grows in the low
double digits. If you do manager math on that, it's 20% of our revenue, so that adds a couple points of growth to the
company. NAND is probably worth a point on its own. They look to be having a good year. You have some other
smaller things that you net that out against a PC Client Group that's down a bit and you get to flat for the year. So just
in rough math, that's how I'm viewing the different segments. Does that answer your question?
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: No, that's very helpful, and as my follow-up, if I could carve into the Data Center a little
bit. So you are still – it looks like you're still looking for low double-digit growth in this business. That seems to be
unchanged from the last couple of quarters. Does that not imply a very significant ramp both quarter over quarter and
year over year, in the ballpark of 15% to 20% sequentially as well as year over year in the second half?
Can you give us some – I guess, where your confidence comes from that you're going to get that kind of growth in the
Data Center in the second half? Is it all macro, or is it something else? What drives that?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. This is Brian. I'll answer that one. Yes, we're still confident in the second half growth
of our Data Center business overall. As we mentioned, we're seeing strong growth in the cloud, the high-performance
computing, our networking, and our storage, and we think those continue through the second half of this year. What
was down, as Stacy mentioned, was the enterprise data centers were down a bit in the first half. We think as the
macroeconomics continue to improve through this year, that picks up a bit. So when you put that all together, we

believe that absolutely; our view is that we can continue through this year with that low double-digit growth.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: The enterprise had to have been down more than that, right? You said that hard drive or
storage and networking and all this other stuff was up 20% to 40%. I think your total Data Center business in the first
half year over year is just flat to up a little bit. So that enterprise piece had to have been down quite a bit year over year
in the second half. So you're saying you're going to see a very significant reversal of that trend in the second half?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, from a wonky finance standpoint, realize there's also a prior-period comparison thing
going on. In the first half of last year, we were in the steep part of the ramp for Romley. In the second half of this year,
we'll be launching other versions of Ivy Bridge into the data center. So the short answer of your question is I would
expect some pretty steep quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year comps in the back half of this year. That is what we're
planning for.
<A - Mark Henninger>: And, Stacy, we're going have to move on from there.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
Operator
The next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Mark Henninger>: We can. Thanks, Ross.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. The first question is for Brian. On that focus on the ultra-mobility side of things, can
you talk a little bit about what that implies for the OpEx for Intel? The OpEx is elevated as a percentage of sales versus
where it has been historically, mainly on the R&D side. My understanding is the majority of that spending is for the
mobile effort. Is your effort to expedite that process likely to mean more OpEx to deliver those better results? And
maybe a follow-on to that is when do we get to either results on the top line happening or you rationalize some of that
OpEx? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure, so let me start. The simple answer is no, we're not going to increase our OpEx
spending. And in fact, what we really have been focusing on is managing that as well. What you're going to see, and
remember; as we move our architecture more and more to an SoC, a lot of the work we do bridges between Core and
Atom. And as we pull Atom forward onto the leading-edge technology, again, that allows a lot of the architectural work
to be in alignment and be shared amongst the two products. So we believe that we can move faster on Atom and into
this ultra-mobility space without having to change or increase our OpEx. So absolutely, that's the current model that
we're working under.
When will you start to see it? Some of these changes have started a while back. You see Bay Trail coming out towards
the end of this year. It's a product that is on that Atom core that is truly industry leading. We talked earlier about a lot of
the benchmarks coming out showing it very strong against the competition, if not leading the competition in many of
the metrics. And so we believe that you'll start to see some of this just naturally over the next six months as Bay Trail
ramps up and gets into production. We're going to have a series of products after that, and you'll see more and more
acceleration. So don't think of this as a one-time shift where you'll see a digital move. Look at it as a constant pushing
of the accelerator down and the thing just gets faster and faster as time goes by. And so you'll just see more and more
strength of that Atom line as time goes through here. And it will be just you'll look back and say wow, it's obvious that
the Atom line has truly become strong and they've got share in the tablet space.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: If I could just add to that and give you a little bit of sense of where we're trying to go. You I'm
sure noticed we brought down the overall spending forecast for the company. We know that we're running hot in terms
of spending as a percentage of revenue. We've been very consciously making investments in that space. What I've seen

of Brian in his tenure is he's very focused on driving that efficiency and bringing it down. We'll come down a few
points between where we were in Q2 and the end of the year in terms of spending as a percent of revenue. And the
expectation is that we can come down more next year.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. And I guess...
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Go ahead.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: No, go ahead.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: My point was just going to be to reemphasize what Stacy just said, is that my answer for
why OpEx won't go up is just take a look at what we've done moving into Q3 and efficiency and structure that we put
in, both the reorganization that we did and flattening in decision-making, and just the cost savings that we've already
put in through efficiencies in both the OpEx and the CapEx that you saw. We expect that same level of efficiency to
keep moving forward, even as we make this transition. So to me, those are not separated. Those go hand in hand
actually as you become more efficient.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks for your patience with the audio. Ross, do you have a follow-up question?
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Yes, I do. Switching gears again for BK, but on the foundry side of things, I think Paul
described it that you're no longer crawling on the first quarter conference call. I know that's a business that's near and
dear to your heart given your prior job. Can you give us some benchmarks that we should watch for to deem the
success or lack thereof that Intel plans to have? And generally speaking, can you explain how your strategy in foundry
may be any different than the prior CEO?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. You have to remember that even when you sign up a foundry customer, it's 18 to 24
months, sometimes even longer, 30 months before that foundry customer is able to start producing product, especially
when they move from one foundry to another as they do go through their design cycle and their product qualification.
So you should think that even the customers that we've already signed up that you've heard about in the press, those
revenues and that impact on Intel's bottom line is still a ways out. And any changes we'd make in strategy or additional
customers we'd make now will have that same timeline.
I think, again, Paul said it right. You want to crawl, walk, run, not necessarily because that's what we should do in order
to manage it. It's more you really want to make sure that the systems and the customer support models that you have are
in place to handle the volume that you're really taking on. And since we haven't been a foundry business all our life, we
wanted to go and make sure we really knew what we were doing there. We are moving from I'd say that crawl space to
at least the walk space.
I think that the philosophy we have moving forward is that we're going to treat every one of these customers that come
to us and come talk to us about foundry opportunities individually and look at them from a strategic standpoint, what
size of business they bring, and whether their products can really take advantage of our process leadership. And so we
don't take a look at this as separating out the dos, we wills or won'ts. We're taking each customer individually and
looking at them as an opportunity and what is the right thing for the shareholders, bringing value to the shareholders
with this technology that we have.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Thank you.

The next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much. You mentioned moving Atom even faster to the leading edge. Can you
give us some detail as to when we might see 14-nanometer Atom products in the market? And similarly, you talk about
14-nanometers going into production end of this year. So does that mean the first 14-nanometer Core products will
launch in the first quarter of 2014?

<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Okay, so let me – you asked a couple questions. We're not going to give changes to the
roadmap or any kind of product schedules here. What will happen as a result of this strategy, we'll try and bring those
updates to our investor meeting that happens in November.
As far as our 14-nanometer Core launch and just our general product launch, I think what we said so far is the first half
of 2014, and we're not ready to give any specifics beyond that.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I gave you a pretty strong hint with the fact that we'll be taking pre-qualification reserves. You
can sense that we're well – and those are going to be material, so we'll be well into production in the fourth quarter.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Excellent. Thanks, Stacy, and just one other. Is the lower CapEx plan due to lower spending
on 14-nanometer and 10-nanometer, or lower on 450-millimeter, or both?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: It's a variety of things, David. As we said on the call, our view of the overall market is less now
than it was when we started the year. I think you've seen us trying to be very responsive to changes in demand and get
the balance right. And so as our view of the market changed, we saw some opportunities for things that we thought we
were going to put in place this year that we no longer have to put in place. And it's across the board; it's no one thing.
Similar to what you saw in Q1, when we found opportunities to drive more reuse, here we're finding some
opportunities to push some capital out of the year. Some of it is 450-millimeter, not based on schedule changes but it's
just based on some efficiencies that we were able to find and shortening the time it takes us to install certain things and
that kind of stuff. Some of it is M&E for 14-nanometer. Some of it is space, but just a variety of small things that added
up to $1 billion.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, David. And, operator, we have time for two more questions.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Great, guys. Thank you very much for taking the question. Just to follow up on the CapEx,
does the new $11 billion forecast still include a full $2 billion for the new shell, or is that some of what has gotten
pushed out?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Specific on the 450-millimeter, that's a 450-millimeter question, Jim?
<Q - James V. Covello>: Yes, that shell that you guys had articulated, there was an extra $2 billion in the CapEx that
was related to that 450-millimeter shell.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: That one's down a little bit, but not a lot. It does change my round. I was rounding up to $2
billion, and now it would round to $1.5 billion. But in the scheme of the $1 billion changes, it's not the largest driver.
It's not even that large of a driver.
I think it's interesting when you deconstruct the CapEx and you just get down to the level of CapEx that's in place for
current run rate, you take out the 450-millimeter. You can take out some of the capital that's being spent, not
necessarily for our current production, but things like IT and labs. You take out some the greenfield space that we've
built in place, and you get down to a run rate of CapEx in support of a current business that's in the mid-$50 billions,
$55 billion or so in revenue, in that range. That is I think a nice healthy level, a nice sustainable level. And I can run at
that level and generate a 60% gross margin. So it feels pretty good from that perspective. And as we said, we're
continuing to try to balance the CapEx relative to the business size.

<Q - James V. Covello>: Sure. And if I – I'll use my follow-up on the CapEx as well. So it's great to see the CapEx
come down from the $13 billion originally to the $11 billion today. The first half spending is $4.9 billion, so that would
still imply pretty far below the $11 billion. Obviously, that shell, maybe a little more of that shell comes in the back
half, so that would be some of the increase in the back half CapEx. But can we get any hope that potentially even $11
billion is a number that there's some downside to?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So first, the linearity, yes, more of that shell, most of that shell, frankly, is in the back half the
year, so that shifts the linearity. And you also see the 14-nanometer spending going up in the back half. So it's a back
half loaded year.
I think, as I said earlier, we will continue to look for the right balance between capital and demand. But I want to stress,
when you really deconstruct our CapEx at $7 billion to $8 billion of capital being spent to support a business that's in
the mid-$50 billions in revenue, it's the right level of CapEx. I'm very comfortable with that. It's not putting in a bunch
of incremental capacity, and it's a level that I can sustain a gross margin that's in that range that I've been talking about,
right at 60%.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Thank you very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
Operator
The next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Hi, good afternoon. A few years ago, when Atom first launched, I think you had mentioned that
Atom was slightly lower gross margin but same or slightly higher operating margin than the corporate average. Is that
still holding with the new product that you're launching?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: This is probably a better conversation for the investor meeting. And keep in mind that Atom
spans from servers to the PC segment of the market now, where we're enabling these $299 price points to phones to
tablets. So it's worthwhile to have a deeper discussion about the different segments.
As we articulated earlier, generally when you're looking at the predominance of our volume, the core business, when
Atom is price-point replacing a Celeron or a Pentium, we're doing it at a better margin dollars per unit than we were
selling Celeron into that space, and we're enabling lower price points. So from that perspective, it's a great product. It
lets us fight on the front foot and go after markets profitably that we struggled to go after before. I'll save the rest
probably until the investor meeting.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Okay, that's useful. And then on this call there has been obviously a good amount of discussion
about your diversification into ultra-mobile. If we look at the core business, the ramp of Haswell and ultrabooks
obviously hasn't been enough to bring back PC unit growth this year. Should we have the view that PC is basically past
the peak, continues to decline, and if not, what challenges do you see going forward and why what hasn't worked so far
could work later in realizing PC growth going forward?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So let me – we had a hard time hearing that one because of the break, the networking
problems we're having on this end. Let me try and repeat it and make sure. I think part of your question was – the basic
of your question was PCs have continued to decline. You've introduced Haswell. You're still forecasting a back half
decline. What gives us confidence that we'll be able to turn that around or make any change in that? Did I capture your
question correctly?
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Yes, that's correct. Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I'll answer first and Stacy can jump in. My answer would be simply Haswell has been not a
single product launch, so let me first start with Haswell. We launched the quad-core products in the second quarter. As
we go into the third quarter, the dual-core products, which go more into those lower price point regions is actually

going out to the market. So it's a staggered launch, which is a little bit different than we've done in some other products.
So we're just now really starting to see the ramp of Haswell into the consumers' hands.
I think it's really way too early to say here's where Haswell is. And you're just going to see as we move into the second
half, these fanless devices with Haswell. As we move forward, Bay Trail and 14-nanometers as we move into next year
will – you can imagine will drive prices and battery life and the number of fanless devices up even more. So that would
be my first answer.
The second answer I'd tell you what's different moving forward, again, we've talked about this, is Bay Trail. Bay Trail
is going into some of these same classic PC devices that you see today. The clamshells, where they've got
touch-enabled clamshells coming down into the $300 range. You're going to see convertible clamshells where you can
detach or flip and it acts as both a tablet or a PC in the sub-$400 range, right around $400. And as we move into next
year, those price points will continue to drop. So the fact that PCs, especially with Bay Trail, are going to move down
into this let's call it $200 to $400 range is going to shift that market we believe as well. And that's different than what
has been out over the last few years. So you've got fanless Haswell. You've got Bay Trail coming in, all those things
allowing devices that haven't been allowed in the past with our designs.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Thank you very much.
