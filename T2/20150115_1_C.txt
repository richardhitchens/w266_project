factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings
including, without limitation, the Risk Factor section of our 2013 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $350 million for the fourth quarter
of 2014, or $0.06 per share. These results include the impact of $3.5 billion in legal reserves and repositioning costs
which is we had disclosed in December. While these charges had the biggest impact on our results, we also saw a
challenging end to the year with macro uncertainties and falling oil prices resulting in a more difficult market
environment than we had expected particularly in the last few weeks of December. At the same time, our Institutional
Banking franchise continue to show solid revenue growth. In Consumer Banking, our U.S. franchise performed well,
and we showed modest growth in international Consumer even as the global economic growth remained uneven. In Citi
Holdings we were profitable again this quarter and reduced assets to below $100 billion for the first time, driven by
ongoing runoff in asset sales.
While the overall results for 2014 fell short of our expectations, we did make significant progress towards our
priorities. And while some of the steps we took were painful, I believe they allowed us to put our franchise in a position
to have a successful 2015.
We're doing everything we can to maximize the benefits of our repositioning costs. And throughout 2014, we worked
hard to improve our efficiency and reduce our cost base. We reduced our head count by almost 10,000 people; closed
95 operation sites; shrunk our branch network by over 10% while increasing digital uptake by consumers; simplified
our product offerings; and increased customer satisfaction as measured by Net Promoter Scores.
We sold our Consumer businesses in Spain and Greece and took important steps towards the exit of OneMain. And in
October, we announced plans to exit 11 consumer markets, and have already signed two agreements regarding the sales
of our Japanese retail business, and our Consumer business in Peru. These steps are part of our process to build one
Global Consumer Bank from a confederation of local banks.
Our Institutional Banking business performed well throughout the year as we focused on serving our core clients. In
Investment Banking, we gained share with our target clients across most regions, generating strong revenue growth.
And despite the low interest rate environment, Treasury and Trade Solutions grew revenues as well, as did our Private
Bank. While our Markets businesses were impacted by volatility towards the end of the year, we'll continue to take
steps to make sure that they are sized correctly for the environment we see going forward.
After reviewing certain Institutional businesses, we have decided to exit several noncore transactions businesses, in
order to further decrease our expense base and improve net income. These businesses will be reported out of Citi
Holdings going forward.
For the first time since its establishment, Citi Holdings was profitable for the full year and we reduced its assets by
16%. By utilizing $3.1 billion in DTA, we exceeded 2013's utilization by $600 million and have now utilized $5.6
billion in the last two years. Despite significant legal challenges, we were still able to generate $11 billion in regulatory
capital in 2014, bringing the total to $31 billion over the last two years.
During the year, we managed our balance sheet carefully. We grew our loan book in Citicorp and improved both our
net interest revenue and margin from 2013 levels. We made Citi a safer and stronger institution in several ways. We
invested in our risk, audit, and compliant functions. We reduced our risk asset profile by asset sales and business exits,
and we maintained a highly liquid balance sheet while improving the quality of our deposits. Our capital, leverage, and
liquidity ratios each increased over the course of the year.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a critical priority. During the year, we invested in and strengthened our
capital planning process by focusing on risk identification and scenario design, improved our models and we fostered a

deeper engagement with our businesses. Last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve, and we
believe the submission reflects the progress we have made. We're fully committed to sustaining and building on these
gains.
As recent events have shown, there's no reason to think that the environment in 2015 will be any less challenging than
the one we faced in 2014. While the recovery in the U.S. is gaining momentum, aided by lower energy costs; Europe is
a continuing area of concern, with Russia and Greece facing the most immediate pressure. And while most emerging
markets continue to grow, their economies remain the most vulnerable to external factors. That being said, we feel
good about how we're positioned and to meet the challenges. This is an important year for our firm, and we're
committed to reaching our efficiency and return on asset targets.
John will now go through the deck, and then we'll answer your questions. John?
John C. Gerspach
Okay. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to highlight a few items from the fourth quarter
of 2014 – 2013 that affect the comparability to this quarter's results, as shown on slide three. On an adjusted basis we
earned $0.06 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $0.82 in the fourth quarter of last year. This decline in EPS
mostly reflects higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges versus last year.
On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $346 million, or $0.06 per share,
including the impact of $3.5 billion of legal and repositioning charges. Revenues declined slightly on a reported basis
to $17.8 billion, but were up 2% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses
grew 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the higher legal and repositioning charges. Core operating expenses
were flat, including a benefit from the impact of FX translation. Cost of credit improved from last year. And our tax
rate was significantly higher this quarter at 72% reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals.
On a full year basis, revenues and core operating expenses were fairly stable versus last year. Legal and repositioning
charges were significantly higher than the prior year, as we worked to resize our operations and address legal issues. As
we said in December, we believe we have put a significant portion of our outstanding legal matters behind us. Cost of
credit was a tailwind, driven by lower net credit losses. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans decreased
slightly year-over-year to $645 billion, as 3% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind-down of
Citi Holdings. Deposits declined 4%, as we reclassified $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in Citicorp
given the sale announcement last month. And deposits continued to decline in Citi Holdings.
On slide five, we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In Consumer Banking, revenues
were flat sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year, driven by North America. Institutional revenues were down from last
quarter, reflecting a difficult market environment and seasonally lower activity, but improved slightly from last year.
And Citi Holdings revenues were down quarter-over-quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower
losses on the redemption of debt. On a constant dollar basis, Citigroup revenues grew over $300 million, or 2%, from
the prior year.
On slide six, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related expenses were over $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter,
and repositioning costs were roughly $650 million. Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11
billion increased in constant dollars both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting increased regulatory and
compliance costs including those related to our enhanced capital planning process. Higher volume-related expenses and
certain onetime items partially offset by efficiency savings.
The quarter-over-quarter increase of roughly $200 million was mostly comprised of an adjustment to accruals for
certain non-income taxes such as VAT, higher external legal and consulting fees, higher business volumes in a number
of areas, and higher levels of expenses related to ongoing compliance and regulatory efforts resulting from an
acceleration of hiring and related spending originally planned for the first quarter of 2015. All of this increase from the
prior quarter reflected expenses that were either nonrecurring or already baked into our expected 2015 run rate.

Performance-based incentive compensation was down from the prior quarter; however, this benefit was largely offset
by changes to assumptions related to the recognition of deferred compensation. And on a full year basis, core operating
expenses were roughly flat as repositioning savings, reductions in Citi Holdings, and other productivity initiatives fully
offset the impact of higher regulatory and compliance and growth-related costs.
On slide seven we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. On a reported basis, Citicorp revenues of $16.5
billion declined slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while core operating expenses grew 2%, driven by higher
regulatory and compliance costs, growth-related expenses, and certain onetime items I just described, partially offset by
ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. Credit costs improved modestly year-over-year and the
tax rate was significantly higher in the quarter, reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals. On a full year basis, the
decline in net income mostly reflects higher legal and repositioning costs, partially offset by an improvement in credit.
In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter, with roughly $160 million in net income compared to a loss of
over $400 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with
$98 billion of assets, or 5% of total Citigroup assets.
Before I go into more detail on Citicorp, I'd like to provide an update on our strategic actions in Global Consumer
Banking and describe some additional actions we are taking in the Institutional Clients Group. Starting with Consumer,
last quarter we announced plans to exit our Consumer operations in 11 markets, plus our Consumer finance business in
Korea. Since then, we have executed agreements to sell two of these businesses: our Japan retail operations and our
Consumer business in Peru. And we have active processes underway in the remaining markets.
As we previously indicated, we will report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter. In 2014,
these businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenues and a loss of $36 million, with the loss primarily attributable to
repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans.
In addition to these actions in Consumer, we also plan to exit certain businesses in ICG, including Hedge Fund Services
within Securities Services, and our Prepaids cards business in Treasury and Trade Solutions. These represent noncore
businesses where we do not believe we have the scale to generate appropriate returns. We are working to exit these
businesses in a timely and economically rational manner with a minimal impact on our clients. In aggregate, the
businesses generated nearly $460 million of revenues and a loss of over 80 million in 2014. However, roughly half of
the operations' pre-tax loss for the year was driven by repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans.
We will also report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter.
Turning back to the fourth quarter, on slide 10, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant
dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting modest volume growth offset by spread
compression and regulatory headwinds in certain markets. Average loans grew 4% from last year, card purchase sales
grew 3%, and average deposits grew 2%. However, revenues were down sequentially driven by lower investment sales
revenues in Asia, reflecting weak investor sentiment and seasonality.
Core operating expenses, excluding legal and repositioning costs, grew 2% as the impact of business growth and higher
non-income taxes was partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs were up slightly year-over-year and
by 10% sequentially, mostly due to loan loss reserve builds in Latin America due to portfolio growth and seasoning.
We incurred a charge-off of roughly $70 million this quarter related to our homebuilder exposure in Mexico. However,
this charge was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release, resulting in a neutral impact on overall credit costs.
Slide 11 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Retail
Banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 25% from last year, including a gain of roughly $130 million from the sale of
certain on-balance sheet mortgage loans. Excluding this gain, revenues grew 13%, reflecting continued loan and
deposit growth as well as abating spread headwinds.
Branded Cards revenues of $2.1 billion were flat versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in
spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans, reflecting a continued run-off of promotional rate balances.
And Retail Services revenues declined 3% from last year, primarily reflecting higher contractual partner payments
driven by higher yields and improved credit costs. Underlying drivers for Retail Services remain positive as average

loans grew modestly and yields improved year-over-year.
Core expenses declined year-over-year but grew modestly from last quarter, driven by seasonal marketing expenses and
other episodic items. Repositioning costs were higher this quarter mostly reflecting actions to rationalize our branch
footprint. We continued to resize our North America Retail Banking business in the fourth quarter, all while continuing
to grow deposits, loans, and assets under management. Over the past year, we have sold or closed over 130 branches in
North America and we have announced plans to sell or close an additional 60 branches in early 2015.
By the end of the first quarter, roughly 90% of our branches will be concentrated around New York; Boston;
Washington, D.C.; Miami; Chicago; L.A.; and San Francisco. We are focusing on our most productive branches in key
urban areas and on growing high-quality deposits. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth
quarter, checking account balances grew 11%. Today our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $200 million,
up 17% from just a year ago.
Slide 12 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, Global Consumer credit trends remained
favorable in the fourth quarter. In North America and Asia, credit remained stable to improving. And in Latin America,
as I described earlier, we incurred a roughly $70 million charge-off related to our homebuilder exposure in Mexico.
That was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release. Excluding this charge-off, dollar losses were flat to the
third quarter in constant dollars, and the NCL rate would have improved to 4.7%.
Slide 13 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer Banking. We reduced our core expenses by roughly $160
million from 2013 to 2014 even while absorbing $100 million of incremental expenses related to the Best Buy portfolio
acquisition. This core expense improvement reflects the significant progress we have made with head count reductions,
product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior
year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Including roughly $900 million of legal and
repositioning charges over the past year, our total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking was 56%. And pro
forma for the announced market exits, the total efficiency ratio would have been 55%.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 14. Revenues of $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter were flat to
last year and down 17% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion grew slightly from last year and were
down 5% from the prior quarter. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year and
flat sequentially on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 6% from last year and 2% sequentially, as
growth in high-quality deposits and fees more than offset a decline in trade balances and spreads.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 7% from last year on lower equity underwriting activity and
down 15% sequentially, reflecting the comparison to a very strong third quarter. Private Bank revenues of $666 million
grew 11% from last year, driven by higher volumes and growth in investments, and capital markets products.
Corporate Lending revenues were $431 million, up 9% from last year, reflecting growth in average loans and improved
funding costs; and down 2% from last quarter driven by fair value marks on loans. Total markets and Security Services
revenues of $3 billion declined 9% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $2 billion were
down 16% from last year and 33% sequentially, reflecting challenging market conditions as well as seasonally lower
activity versus the third quarter.
The fourth quarter started with a volatile environment in early October and ended in a similar way, with uncertainty
around Russia and Greece as well as falling oil prices in the last weeks of the year, driving increased volatility, wider
credit spreads, and less liquid trading conditions. Overall, our currencies business navigated well, with stable revenues
year-over-year and a moderate sequential decline from a strong third quarter. However, we saw significant revenue
decline in spread products. In particular, credit and municipal products, as we continued to support our clients in a less
liquid, more volatile market.
Our G10 rates business was also down versus prior periods, mostly driven by the uncertain macro environment in the
latter part of December. Equities revenues of $471 million declined 3% year-over-year and 38% sequentially, both
driven by EMEA. Outside of EMEA, our equities revenues increased 24% year-over-year with broad strength across
products, and declined 18% sequentially on seasonally lower activity. In Securities Services, revenues grew 4%

year-over-year on increased client balances and activity, and were down 4% sequentially, reflecting the impact of
pending strategic exits.
Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over last year and were flat sequentially, as lower compensation
expenses and the benefit of FX translation were offset by higher repositioning costs as well as higher external legal and
consulting fees. Credit costs grew to $163 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting an episodic write-off as well as a
reserve build, driven by the overall economic environment.
On Slide 15, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat
to the prior year, as lower core operating expenses offset higher legal and repositioning charges. Including roughly
$700 million of legal and repositioning charges, our total efficiency ratio was 59%, and pro forma for the announced
strategic actions, the total efficiency ratio would have been 58%. Our full year comp ratio was also flat to 2013 at 29%.
Slide 16 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined year-over-year, driven mainly by lower revenues
from sales of available-for-sale securities as well as hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher legal and
related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CCAR process.
Assets of $329 billion included approximately $80 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $197 billion of liquid
investment securities.
Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $98 billion at quarter-end, with over 60% in North America
mortgages. Total assets declined $5 billion during the quarter and $19 billion year over year, driven by asset sales and
runoff.
On slide 18 we show Citi Holdings financial results. Total revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter were up slightly
year-over-year, mainly driven by higher gain on asset sales, and lower cost of funds, and down 20% from last quarter
on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt. Citi Holdings expenses
continued to decline, driven by the lower level of assets, as well as lower legal and related costs. And credit costs
continued to improve as well. On a sequential basis, net credit losses increased as continued improvement in mortgage
losses was offset by the impact of seasoning in the personal loan portfolio, as well as credit losses due to corporate loan
sales. However, higher net credit losses were more than offset by a higher loan loss reserve release. Mortgage net credit
losses were entirely covered by reserve releases in the fourth quarter.
On a full year basis, 2014 was an important turning point for Citi Holdings, as we achieved profitability while
continuing to wind down the portfolio, and moving past our legacy legal issues. We sold our remaining western
European retail operations in Spain and Greece, significantly reduced our mortgage exposures, and positioned the
OneMain business for exit.
On slide 19 we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 292 basis
points in the fourth quarter reflecting lower cost of funds, and our full year margin was 290 basis points, up from 285
basis points in 2013. Looking to the first half of 2015, we expect our net interest margin to remain more or less flat to
full year 2014 levels.
On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 10.5%, driven by
a pension-related reduction in OCI and an increase in operational risk RWA. Foreign exchange movements had no
impact on the CET 1 ratio during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 6%, and
our tangible book value declined sequentially to $56.83 per share driven by changes in OCI.
To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for 2015. We remain committed to delivering on our financial
targets, including a mid-50%s efficiency ratio in Citicorp and a return on assets of at least 90 basis points for Citigroup.
We believe we can reach these targets through a combination of several drivers. First, we continue to believe we can
generate low- to mid-single digit revenue growth in Citicorp.
Citicorp's full year revenues in 2014 were broadly flat year-over-year, but in many ways, this understates the progress
we're seeing across the franchise. In North America Consumer, we saw 3% growth in the second half of the year,
excluding certain one-time items. As we moved past the difficult comparisons in mortgage refi volumes, loans and

deposits continued to grow, and spread headwinds began to abate. In International Consumer, we also grew revenues
by 3% in the second half of the year, even as we saw a slower global growth and absorbed significant regulatory and
spread headwinds that we see abating somewhat in 2015.
In Investment Banking, we saw good momentum again this year, growing wallet share with our target clients and
generating strong revenue growth year over year. And, our momentum in Treasury and Trade Solutions and the Private
Bank was also evident as we progressed through the year with continued volume growth translating into stronger
revenue performance. In total, our current expectations for continued volume growth, and somewhat abating headwinds
provide good line of sight for revenue growth in these businesses, which account for over three-quarters of Citicorp
revenues.
And in Markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment, with the goal of continuing to
gain wallet share with our target clients. Going into 2014, we knew we would face difficult Markets comparisons in the
first half of the year, which was certainly true. But in the back half, total Markets revenues broadly stabilized, even
with continued challenging market conditions.
Second, we believe we can drive a meaningful reduction in total operating expenses as a result of continued expense
discipline to offset higher regulatory and compliance costs, the full realization of cost savings from the actions we took
in 2014, and a significant reduction in legal and repositioning costs from the levels we saw in the past year, although,
on legal, as we have said before, nothing is certain until the matters are resolved. Higher revenues and lower operating
expenses would naturally result in positive operating leverage in Citicorp.
We expect credit costs to increase in 2015, driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases. And our
tax rate should be in the range of 31%. We believe that Citi Holdings will stay at or above breakeven on a full year
basis, and we expect to keep balance sheet discipline, staying at or below our current size. We expect the combination
of these factors will help us deliver on both our efficiency and ROA targets in 2015.
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. John, I was hoping you could try to give us a sense of how much
of the one-time items you had in the fourth quarter core expense figure of the $10.9 billion core operating expense. You
mentioned a number of items that were either pulled forward or that you characterized as one time-ish. Can you give us
a feel for how much that might have been of the $10.9 billion core expense number?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, let's focus on the $200 million – because we basically – the guidance that I – that we
mentioned as of the end of the third quarter would have been that we would have expected the operating expenses in
the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. We saw about a $200-million rise, which I gave you some of the component
pieces. I'd say that somewhere between 50% and 75% of that $200 million-plus would be non-recurring, so – call it
two-thirds is nonrecurring.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And that includes the CCAR expense? Some of the CCAR expense?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Some of the CCAR expense – in the fourth quarter – overall, in the second half of the year,
we incurred CCAR expenses of about $180 million, and roughly two-thirds of that should be non-recurring as well. But
that's split, John, between the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And any sense...

<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm sorry, I – two – John, John, back up. Two-thirds of that should be recurring. One-third
of that is non-recurring, of the CCAR expense.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. But that's part of – those expenses are in the $10.9 billion, that jumping-off
point of the fourth quarter expense number, correct?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. You know what, John, maybe – what may be simpler is if I took you through the –
where we stand with delivering the repositioning saves. That might get you closer to where you're looking to – to try to
get to.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And if you think about our repositioning expenses, over the last nine quarters, we've taken
roughly $3.1 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions that we announced back in December of
2012. We expect that the – all of those actions should produce about $3.4 billion of annual savings. Roughly $2.7
billion of those benefits are already included in our fourth quarter expense run rate, or maybe, said another way, the
fourth quarter expenses are lower by about $700 million, resulting from the cumulative impact of those actions. So,
these savings will continue to accrete each quarter, and we expect the vast majority of those remaining benefits to be
reflected in our expense base by the fourth quarter of 2015.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So if we actually tried to talk about it in terms of the $10.9 billion, you're
running right now exiting the year just under $44 billion in core operating expense, you hope to have that number lower
in absolute dollars in 2015 with these savings building?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You know, John, again, we're committed to delivering that efficiency ratio in the mid-50%s
for Citicorp.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And as we said before, we think it takes some low- to mid-single digit – low single-digit
revenue increase. We need to deliver on these expense initiatives. We've got the path to get there. I don't want to get
into an absolute level of expenses.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And, John, in terms of the repositioning, unlike the legal costs, the
repositioning, as you and Mike have said, are 100% in your control. So, do you expect to have any repositioning in
2015, and should it be a lot lower? Could you give us any kind of sizing perspective on any additional repositioning we
should expect in 2015?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm not – I would never use the word like, we won't have any repositioning, because we're
constantly looking at the business. But it certainly shouldn't be at the level you saw in 2014 where we had in Citicorp,
something like $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion worth of repositioning costs. What we said, John, when we set up those
efficiency targets, don't forget, is we said we thought that in a normal year, we'd have about 200 basis points of our
revenue consumed by legal and repositioning. So, we certainly aren't looking to run repositioning anywhere near the
level – in 2015 anywhere near the level that we ran it at in 2014.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks, John.

<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Hey, Jim. Good morning.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: ...I guess is on the strategic actions. There's a lot of moving parts there, and you mentioned, I
guess, number one, that you expect Citi Holdings to remain at breakeven or better next year or 2015. But we have –
you're adding businesses that have been losing money. There's a – pretty clear that you guys are look to sell OneMain.
Is all of that contemplated in that comment? How do we think about that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's all contemplated in that comment.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Perfect. And then, can you help us a little? We can all take our own guess on what
maybe the capital gain could be in OneMain or anything else, but with all these actions, is there any kind of a way to
think about the RWA reduction potential coming out of OneMain and – as well as the strategic changes?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: OneMain has about $9 billion worth of GAAP assets in it.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Obviously, it's higher than that on an RWA basis. But I don't want to get into the capital
accretion that might come from a OneMain exit as we get closer to that because, again, that's going be dependent upon
which path we go down. We're obviously working a dual path exit strategy for OneMain. And so, let's think about
which path we actually go down, and then we'll be able to talk about what the implications are.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one last sort of bigger picture question. You guys obviously are
a global company that's been, I guess, a source of some fear in the market. How are you feeling about the international
aspect of your business, the economies there, and given what we're seeing with the volatility outside the U.S.? Has
anything changed? If you look at consumer revenues in International, they're still positive, but they slowed a little bit
versus 3Q, maybe that's just seasonality. You're still expecting growth. What do you see as the risk to that expectation
of growth outside the U.S. and how are you thinking about it?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think the balance of where growth is going to come from, with the move in oil has
probably or most certainly shifted over the last couple months. And so, I think what you've seen is revisions in terms of
many of the developed economies up, and some of the emerging economies, and in particular, those that are most
dependent on oil export as a big part of their economy. I think when you take the aggregate of those two and add them
together, you can look at the growth rates being projected, that we're projecting higher growth rates in the global
economy in 2015 than we had in 2014.
I think when you think of – or as we think of the potential winners and losers and how that impacts our business, I
would probably break the world into – or countries into one of three buckets, those where there's a clear benefit from
the reduction in terms of oil prices, those where there's a clear detriment or headwind that comes as a function of lower
oil or energy prices, and then there's a bucket in the middle where it probably becomes a bit more complex, and that is
where you've got different combinations of where economies overall benefit, yet you have governments that are quite
dependent on oil export for revenue generation against their budgets.
And so clearly, when you look across the world today, the big beneficiaries are the U.S., they're Europe, they're China,
Japan, India, and you could take that list forward. You look at those that are probably most negatively affected,
countries such as probably Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria. The countries that I mentioned in terms of
being positive probably account for an excess of 65% of our revenues, and you could measure that in 2013 or 2014. If
you look at the countries that are most negatively affected, those countries probably constitute somewhere 2% or less
than 2% of our revenues. But, that being said, I think we all have to recognize that it's going to create unevenness. It's
going to create some uncertainty. It's certainly going to create volatility, and I think we all need to be mindful of that.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Great. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Hey, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Matt.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: If I could follow up on the low- to mid-single digit revenue growth, just trying to
better understand how you get there. I guess if the NIM's relatively stable and the balance sheet's flat to down, and
obviously net interest income is about 60% of revenues, how do you get, call it, 2% to 4% revenue growth when half of
the revenues or more than half of the revenues aren't really growing?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, you've got that revenue momentum already in the second half of the year, Matt. So,
when you're looking at it, you need to focus on the second half of the year and the momentum that we've gotten. So,
every one of those businesses has both interest-earning revenues and also fee-earning revenues, and we're seeing
growth in those businesses in both the NIM – both the NIR, the net interest revenue, as well as the fee components.
Some of it, when you take a look at the full year numbers, that's going be masked a bit, don't forget, when you take a
look at non-interest revenues, a lot of that impact year-over-year has been going to come from the mortgage refi boom.
When you take a look at mortgage refi, that's fees, those gains that we would have gotten are in 2013 in the first half of
the year. They didn't replicate this year, so year-over-year, our fee-related revenue from that is down, I don't know,
$700 million or so. So there's a lot of those types of items that are just buried in the results. But we're focused – we
certainly are looking through the full year comparisons and looking to what we see in the businesses today as we're
operating them.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, can you remind us how the foreign exchange
movements impact, I guess, you said it doesn't impact regulatory capital, it does impact tangible book. Just remind us if
that's the right way to think about it. And then why is there a mark? Why is that something that you can't hedge?
Because it seems like what happened last year, the dollar strengthening is something that might continue.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, Matt, we do hedge. So let's start with P&L. P&L – and we've had these discussions
over the years, and – now there's a slide in the back of the earnings presentation, I think it's slide 26, that actually talks
to – which is it?
<A - Susan Kendall>: Slide 28.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Slide 28. Sorry, slide 28. I was off by 2 slides – that actually shows you the impact of FX on
the various line items. So, the dollar strengthening or weakening or different currencies strengthening and weakening
has an impact on our revenue line, our expense line, and our cost of credit line. However, as you can see, in no
individual quarter does it really have what I would consider to be an outsized impact on our pre-tax earnings. And in
fact, this quarter, even with all the volatility, the net impact was close to zero. So that's P&L.
When it comes to capital, we do hedge our capital that's invested in foreign currencies, but we hedge it with a view
towards protecting our CET 1 ratio. And that's why – when you look at how foreign exchange movements occur, they
not only impact your capital invested, they'll impact your assets and they'll also impact some of the assets that you
have, such as the intangibles that serve then as direct deductions against your regulatory capital base.
So we factor all of that into a hedging program that gives us fairly good results. In this quarter, with all the movement
we had, the combination of our hedging program, and then the natural hedges that we have, resulted in a zero impact on
our CET 1 ratio. However, because we do not hedge every dollar of capital, you will then have an impact through OCI
on tangible book. But if I'm going to run the company with an eye towards where do I have exposure, I want to protect
my CET 1 ratio. I don't want to run an FX position through that ratio. And so, in a quarter where the dollar strengthens,
we may take a reduction on tangible book, but I protected the ratio.

If I go the other way, if the dollar weakens – and we have had quarters where the dollar is weakened, then I may really
enjoy the impact that it has on my tangible book, but it's going to destroy my CET 1 ratio. And, as you know, that is
one of the key measures of regulatory strength that we have. So we think that it's really important that through our
hedging program, we focus on that CET 1 ratio.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. No, that's very helpful going through all the detail. Appreciate the color.
Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thank you. Good morning. My question is very much a CCAR-related one. I think to
paraphrase, Michael, you have said in the past that you recognized that a qualitative pass with a very, very
ultraconservative capital return ask would not really be a win in your eyes. And I'm sorry if I paraphrased you
incorrectly, and go ahead and correct it. I guess the question is, having now been through the process for this year and
done the submission, is that still the way that you feel about it?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think, Guy, we are aiming for, we're looking for, we've worked towards what, we would
want to be an unqualified pass both qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. I think as we've said all along, that capital
return is something you work towards over time. But again, we think that our capital ask is the appropriate one, and
when all the results come out, we'll obviously let you be the judge of it. But we felt giving everything that it's
appropriate and it's right.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And is there any change in the way that you would sort of answer that question versus
what you said, say, at a conference last month?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: No.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. I guess the only other question that I have today is in, in light of the weakening in
certain emerging markets and you were very good about giving us a sense for where your revenues come from in terms
of markets that are more and less affected by energy prices, but generally, given some of the weakness that we're seeing
in more of those markets, what have you done on both the credit side and on the trading risk side, if anything, to say,
increase the level of scrutiny and protection?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think you saw back, beginning with GIPS and I think, as different challenges around the
globe and the macro economy have presented themselves, I think we've come out and tried to be very transparent with
what our exposures look like. I think in this environment, you can imagine, we continue to watch Europe closely,
clearly Russia, and we can speak to some pretty significant reductions in terms of risk in Russia. John and I had both
mentioned Greece earlier. And clearly, with what I described as those economies that come under pressure either from
the broad perspective of just big exporters of energy and suffering that impact, or those where governments are
extremely dependent on the revenues from energy to fund public and social programs, we obviously have a very close
eye towards those, and we think we're watching from a risk perspective very closely and monitoring that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Want to follow-up to that, which is...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: So, want to follow up to the question we just had on, just the outlook for economies
where they're a little bit weakish. I know you mentioned earlier in the call Europe, EM, could be a little weakfish, even
though they're beneficiaries of oil pricing. And obviously, you have a solid presence in those markets. So if the top line
is coming in weaker than you think in some of those economies, do you have room to manage expenses down a little
bit more? I know you outlined you hit the targets at year-end 2015 on the expense ratio, but just wondering where you
might be able to pull some resources out if the top line disappoints.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Betsy, as we've said, we're committed to hitting those targets. We think we've got some
level of flexibility obviously, to the extent that we see either certain countries or certain businesses underperforming
what the expectations are. And if our view towards the targets change at any given point in time during the year, we'll
have that discussion with you.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And then, you mentioned at the beginning of the call about the concept of
moving away from a confederation of banking organizations to a true global organization. Is the steps to get there what
you outlined last quarter, which is just exit the 12 consumer businesses, or is there more to do?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: No, I think we said as we did that, as we looked at the exit of the 11 consumer businesses,
that the remaining 24 businesses, we thought were the right mix of businesses in the right places with the right client
demographics. And so, we feel that the consumer portfolio is at a point in time today where it is the right portfolio, the
right mix.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Just want to be clear on that. And then lastly, there's some action taken today
by the Swiss central bank. I just wondered how you're thinking about that action and how it impacts your business.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think there's a couple ways we think about it. One is a move of that magnitude – and you
hear a range of potential standard deviations moves, but it's big. And clearly, those types of one-off moves affect the
markets in a couple different ways. One is there's P&L ramifications from the trade. I think there's also longer-term
ramifications from just people being surprised. There's talk out in the marketplace of some of the high-frequency
traders suffering a fair amount of pain on that. We'll see how that plays itself out. And we've seen in these pockets of
one-off volatility, that it actually causes people to potentially pull back from the market, and we see volumes abate as a
result of those. We'll see what this move does, but I think, clearly based on market reaction, it came as quite a big
surprise.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. Being from a competitive perspective, there might be some opportunities for
you, or no?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think there could. But we are, as you know, a big player in foreign exchange. Our business
in the fourth quarter actually performed quite well. We think we're well-positioned, and if some of that pain is out there
and people can't find their way around it or through it, I think we've got the ability to step in and potentially take share
or potentially do more business as a result of that.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I think if we take your target of a 90-basis point ROA in 2015, that would imply that Citi
would beat consensus expectations for 2015. So I think that's a way of saying the market doesn't believe you. And if I
could just go down a couple issues, especially after page one of your press release said 2014 was disappointing. So
first, on efficiency, just to be clear, John, you have $700 million more of restructuring benefits to go. Would that be in
2015 or over a couple of years?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. Well, Mike, not every dollar that will be in 2015, but the vast, vast, vast majority of it
will be in 2015.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And is that why you guys are confident? I mean, these are big moves in global consumer
efficiency, from 56% down to 49% to 52% in 2015, and ICG from 59% down to 53% to 57% also in 2015. I mean what
– you're reiterating that guidance today. What gives you confidence in addition to those restructuring benefits?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, as we said, it will take – there's some revenue lift baked into at least, our initial
expectation. But again, it's low single-digit revenue growth, so we're not – I don't think, overreaching for that. But 2014
was such a noisy year. And we did – it was impacted by $11 billion worth of legal and repositioning charges that I
think, sometimes that masked some of the progress that we actually made. If you look at 2014's results, let's take it on
the operating results. And we had pre-tax earnings of – $18.6 billion of pre-tax earnings. Now again, when you take a
look at the Citicorp level of legal and repositioning charges that we had, that is over $6 billion of legal and
repositioning charges that impacted Citicorp's results. That's about 900 basis points of Citicorp's revenue.
So if we had been able to hold legal and repositioning to what we would consider to be the more normal level, say, the
200 basis points that – of revenue that we would have mentioned previously, if you adjust for those two things, take out
the $6 billion, substituting the 200 basis points, the Citicorp efficiency ratio in 2014 would have been 59%, and the
overall ROA for Citigroup would have been in the mid-80s basis points. So it's not that we are that far away from the
targets, again, if you normalize for the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had this year. And therefore, we
think that given those levels, the 59% efficiency ratio in Citicorp, and say, the mid-80s basis points ROA for Citigroup,
the combination of the steps that Mike talked about earlier, the low single-digit revenue growth, the continued delivery
on the expense reduction actions, the careful attention to the balance sheet, all of those things should get us – and
keeping Holdings at or above breakeven should be enough to get us to both the goals that we laid out.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: That probably begs the question, you said you had $3.1 billion of repositioning charges over the
last nine quarters. You had another big hit in the fourth quarter. How much more should we expect of these
repositioning charges?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We don't expect to be talking to you next year about significant levels of repositioning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. As it relates to Project Rainbow, which does tie into efficiency, and also going from a
confederation to a global firm, how far away are you guys in having your systems connect and finishing Project
Rainbow, which really stretches back a long time?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Mike, we are – I think as we've talked on these calls and some of the forums before,
Rainbow is due for delivery in completion. And again, it's not a one-and-done. We've been continuing to bring
countries on, but it's a 2016, largely a 2016 completion date.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, again, the math works, we can all work this out on paper, but then it comes
down to execution. And, Mike, especially after what you called a disappointing 2014 or results below expectations, is
this the right team on the field? And I ask that because there have not been really, major management changes despite
some of the shortfalls, and we know what those were, but how do you think about the team you have on the field?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I feel very good about the team on the field. As you and I have spoken, we've spoken before
on the CCAR. At the end of the day, that's my responsibility. And I look at these other things that we're trying to work
and put behind us, from legal issues to continuing to shape and exit businesses, and use repositioning to drive costs out
of the firm, I think we've got the right team that's focused on delivering on our targets and delivering on behalf of our
shareholders.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. I appreciate the earlier answer when you spelled out the different markets and revenues
associated with the beneficiaries and losers in the oil tug-of-war. Just curious, how different would those percentages
look if we talked about it as a percentage of exposures versus revenues? Do they match up, or are they pretty different?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: It's interesting that – I've pulled these a while back, but if you look, I talked about the four
countries I spoke to, Saudi, Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria, which at the end, constitute – and again, you can go back
and look over a number years, pretty consistently somewhere 2% to just under 2% of our revenue. They actually, in
each of those years, as I went back and looked, as a percentage of our end-of-period loans, are actually slightly below
those percentages on a year-end basis or end-of-period basis. So again, those countries that I just talked about would
probably have end-of-period loan balances of less than 1.5% of our outstandings.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Great. Thank you. Just a quickie on CCAR. Did you remediate all the MRAs from last year? I
know that was one of the contributing factors from the prior year. So, I'm assuming you had a play book that they said
fix all this stuff. But were you able to address all of the MRAs?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We certainly worked to address all the MRAs. The Fed will be the ultimate judge as to
whether or not the MRAs were, in fact, remediated.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. In other words, it's not a black and white answer. So I've asked this of the other banks,
so I do want to get your color on your disclosure on energy-related exposures is very broad. I think it includes
petroleum, energy, chemicals, metals. Can we talk more specifically on what you would deem oil-related, and how it
breaks down in terms of investment-grade, non-investment grade, collateralized, things like that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, Glenn, we're going provide more in-depth information on this topic at next week's
Fixed Income Investor Review. We'll lay things out for you pretty clearly. But, just to get the conversation started,
we've got roughly $60 billion of combined funded and unfunded ICG exposure to energy companies. That's including
those classified as energy in that conglomeration that you mentioned, PECM, as well as energy-related clients in other
disclosed segments, and that $60 billion amounts to about 11% of corporate ICG exposures. So, right, so that – just to
give you a frame of reference. And as with the rest of our book, the exposure is predominantly investment grade,
certainly over 80%. And as we keep on saying, it's reflecting the focus that we have on large multinational
corporations, including the global integrated energy companies.
From a geographic point of view, the – about three-quarters of the exposure is in developed market. And the largest
exposures there would be in North America and the UK and roughly 35% of the exposure represents funded loans. So
the ICG has just over $20 billion of funded exposure to energy and energy-related companies. It represents funded
exposure, now I've moved to funded exposure. And that represents roughly 3% of our total funded loans. And again,
about 80% of the funded loans are investment grade. So that gives you a fairly good overview, I think, of the portfolio.
Again, $60 billion investment grade, predominantly investment grade, 80% investment grade, three-quarters of the
book in developed country, most of that North America, UK

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Definitely helpful. I appreciate it. Last one. You commented in FICC, FX was pretty good
given the volatility. Rates I think was pretty good in general. And those two businesses are bigger piece of business for
you. In your comment, the softness is in credit and munis, as – l paraphrased, facilitating client flow in times of stress. I
know this is a hard one, and I know you're not alone here, but I thought with your business mix you might had better or
less down performance in FICC given your mix. Is facilitation – were there large losses associated with that in this type
of environment? Or is it a volume thing? Or how much can we attribute to inventories? I was just scratching my head a
little bit on how [ph] that tripped (01:07:37) the weakness?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, the biggest impact that we had year-over-year, Glenn, really is in the spread products
business. So – and that really is a result of taking marks on inventory positions that we've got to support the customers.
And again, I don't think, as you just said, I don't think that we're alone there. We do have probably a slightly different
mix than many of our other competitors. But even within there, we've got a fairly large muni book, probably a little bit
larger than what some of the other banks would have. And so that certainly adds then to the results that we're getting
out of the spread products.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I appreciate all of the answers. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good afternoon.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: I'm following up – sorry. Following up on the question there from Glenn on exposures with
oil, when we look at the last few years in like DCM volumes in the energy business, it looks like you guys have a bit
more – bigger market share there. Is there any reason why that wouldn't be a bit of a headwind for your DCM business
here if we assume that there's a slowdown in energy-related issuance?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Some of these things will certainly have impact. I'd say global energy has certainly been a
robust area for the last four years. And clearly, our Investment Banking franchise, as with other institutions, has seen
significant growth in episodic business as a result from that sector. And you're going to have some impact for lower
commodity prices and lower equity valuations. That is certainly going have an impact on equity offerings and IPOs.
But energy is a broad business and some sectors are going be impacted more than others. And so we continue to see
robust activity in some sectors where we're a leader and I think you'll see the upstream in the energy services sector
certainly see significantly less activity. So we'll just see how the whole mix continues.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. All right. Thanks. And then shifting gears to Mexico. There was some noise and
speculation color in the market on Banamex and the fact that there would be a bunch of bidders for it and such. Is the
reason for that noise because you all were having dialogue or is this just from some companies that are hoping to bid
for an asset if it happens to come on the market?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: We rarely comment on things and in that case we felt compelled to go out and comment
and say that we are not a seller of Banamex. And I don't think we can be any more clear about that on these calls and in
the forums. I've spoken directly to it and the importance of the franchise and why we're so constructive on our position
in Mexico and why we think Banamex is the right way to express that in Mexico. So we think a terrific franchise.
We're committed to it. And we think there's very good things ahead coming out of that business.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: That's clear. Thanks. And then...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, Brennan.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: In equities, right, I know you guys called out the weak cash revenues in EMEA, but was
there anything else behind the equities weakness? And also, more broadly, is there maybe an updated plan for the
equities business? Because it does seem like there's a pretty regular stumble in that business whether it's derivatives or,
in this case, EMEA or what have you. How do you feel about it currently and where do you want to take it in the next
couple years?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We're committed to the equities business. And this has been a business that we have spent a
lot of time working on. And I think outside of EMEA, this quarter, we've actually got performance that shows the
progress that we've made. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, excluding the performance in EMEA, the rest we
had 24% revenue growth year-over-year. In every other region, North America, Latin America, Asia, all saw
double-digit growth. So it's not that there's just one region that's driving the action here. This is a good franchise. We
have an issue with our equities franchise in one region. And we have certainly begun to take actions there. We've made
management changes beginning in the late second half of 2014 and we do expect that region to be a much better
performer in 2015.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: And given the fact that it was so strong in other regions, were there some sort of risk
management or facilitation losses there? Or was it purely just volume driven?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No it's a combination. We had volumes and we had strong performance in some of our
equity derivatives business. Asia had a very good performance in equity derivatives this year for one in the quarter. So
did Latin America. So it was pretty broad based good performance. Again, the one difference would be – the one
exception to that would be in EMEA.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then last one for me, you gave some helpful color on the fact that ICG expenses,
you took down the incentive comp but there was an offsetting assumption to the deferral – deferred comp piece. Could
you maybe give a little bit more color on those changes? Was that tied to repositioning that you guys are planning or is
it a change in the timing of the deferral schedule? Are you shifting to more cash-oriented comp? What's driving that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, it's a combination of factors as so many other things are. And as you go through the
year, you make assumptions both on the absolute – the dollar level of deferred comp that you're going to have. And
don't forget, every country has got some slightly different rules. We also need to make assumptions based upon the
level of forfeiture that we'll have coming out of deferred comp as people leave. And we've got – we had slightly less
turnover this year in the non – outside of the actions, of course, that we instigated. And so we had to change the view
that we had towards the forfeiture percentages and as well as the absolute amount of deferred comp that we were going
have. And so all of that we cleaned up in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. Thanks for the color.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Hi, everyone. This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just – starting out just on credit,
where do you guys see your net charge-offs going in 2015? And what would be the drivers of that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I don't want to get into individual line item forecasts. Obviously, what we said in the
prepared remarks is that the cost of credit is likely to increase. That's going to come from a combination of both. We're
likely to have slightly higher NCLs, I can't tell – just as we continue to grow the book. It's not because we see credit
quality weakening anywhere. And we continue to benefit this year from loan loss reserve releases and that is certainly
likely to lessen next year. So the combination of those two items will largely cause an increase in our actual reported
cost of credit. But we don't see any diminution in the credit quality of the portfolio.

<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And just switching over just the Volcker Rule in trading, Volcker
Rule has been here since July. Are you guys seeing your traders maybe being a little more cautious so they're not doing
any prop trading? And just a follow-up to that is where do you see the Volcker Rule impacting liquidity in the fixed
income markets?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think – Steven, it's Mike. We haven't been a proprietary-skewed institution for a long
time. And so I would say no, that we really haven't seen those impacts. That ours is predominantly a client-facing
organization. I think ways that you're going see – and I think we've already seen it manifesting itself probably comes in
the form of liquidity. That there's just things we're not in or there's just types of trades we're not going to do. And in
times of market disruption, I think the buy side finds it quite difficult to find liquidity in certain types of assets or in
certain asset classes. And I think that's a reality of some of those changes.
And so again, we've talked a bit about we're probably going to see heightened periods of volatility as a result of that
and I think you're going to see more price fluctuations around certain types of asset classes, as I think bank and broker
balance sheets have become more refined and defined in terms of what they do, and I think that just manifests itself in
just less liquidity.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Great. Thank you. And just last question, can you remind us in your Citi Holdings, how
much of your home equity book goes to full amortization of the principal and interest in 2015 and 2016?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We will update those disclosures when we publish the Q. But it's roughly $4 billion of
HELOCs that become fully amortizing in 2015. And then I think there's $5 billion that go fully amortizing in 2016 and
again in 2017.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Okay. Great. And just looking back at – in 2014, even though that's not that large, but have
you guys seen what the early credit metrics have been on the home equity book?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The – you mean as far as the home equity loans that have gone to full amortization or just in
general?
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Correct. Yeah, just the full amortization portion.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Just the full amortization portion.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Yeah.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: They've been fairly consist with the results that we've been – that we've gotten for that over
the last couple years; slightly higher levels of delinquency, slightly higher NCL rate. Everything is either on track with
or slightly better than the assumptions that we have built in to our loan loss reserves model.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Great. Well, that's all our questions. Thank you again.

<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Yeah. I had a quick question on the revenue growth target that you gave out there for
Citicorp. I mean what's the trading revenue growth assumptions that you have built in to those targets? I mean, if
trading revenues decline year-over-year, can you still hit that revenue growth target?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: What we've said, at least I think I said in the prepared remarks was that our trading markets
will perform in line with the market. And so we're not giving any view towards what trading revenues will or won't do
in 2015. So we're expecting, as we said, we had basically flat revenues on those businesses in the second half of this
year compared to the second half of last year. We'll see how 2015 goes.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. And then just one thing in the North America Cards, I mean, you've mentioned for
a couple quarters now that the run-off of promotional balances has been a headwind. Is there any way you can size
what that promotional balance is as a percentage of the total or maybe, say, like when do you expect, actually what
quarter, kind of that headwind to abate?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, we haven't talked to that publicly. And I – quite frankly, I don't have those numbers
right in front of me right now anyway. It's not going to continue forever. But I just don't have it. Sorry.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: John, I just wanted to clarify something that you had mentioned relating to the efficiency
target, 55%. One of the things that after making...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, Steven, Steven, Steven?
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Yes?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Mid-50%s.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Mid-50%s, okay. I suppose after applying all of the adjustments that you had talked about
and relating to the strategic actions on a pro forma basis, contemplating some of the restructuring benefits, the majority
of the $700 million that you alluded to, I still get to about a mid-single digit revenue growth number. And I suppose is
the growth – the low single digit that you were referring to, is that off of the reported revenue base from this past year?
Or is it a pro forma revenue base which should include some revenue attrition as you exit some of those noncore
businesses?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It would be a low single digit growth off of where we performed in 2014. You can pro
forma – I'm not going to go into every – I can't help you with your model, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: I mean I guess it's – the low single digits seems reasonably conservative, but if you have all
the pro forma actions that are taken to drive that improvement in the efficiency target, it feels as though the revenue
growth actually needs to be a little bit better than that. I just wanted to confirm whether that was the appropriate way to
think about it or not?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, we – no, I don't think so.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then just one more for me on a topic that's garnered some attention in the press
relating to the growth in your derivatives book, at least through the first nine months of 2014. I actually wanted to just
inquire as to whether you're managing that – how – I guess, how much more growth you can support or whether one of
the important considerations we should have is the potential risk that the growth in derivatives book over the last nine
months could potentially move you into a higher G-SIB bucket based on the inputs that have just come out from the

Fed?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, all very good questions. But first, let's start with the fact that what everyone's been
focused on is not the growth in our book but the growth in notionals. And notionals, as you well know, really are not
any sort of measure really of risk or necessarily of counterparty engagement, net counterparty engagement. It's a
reference sum on which then other things are calculated. So we have been working to compress the trades. And what
you'll see, when we publish results at the end of the fourth quarter, is a reduction in the reported amount of gross
notionals. So the notionals that we had at the end of the third quarter, I believe, were about $65 trillion of notionals, and
that's being reduced now to $60 trillion.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Actually, that's really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.

reductions that are currently in the fourth quarter run rate from the repositioning exercise were $700 million. That's not

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes. Just one quick one for me. As the full CCAR process is now behind you, do you feel
that the feedback that you got, the specific feedback that you got on the steps you have to take in order to remedy what
the Fed is looking for in the qualitative side, was it more robust and specific this year versus last year's process?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think, first, Erika, I would say that the CCAR process is never behind you, right.
That the CCAR process is just part of what we do and how we run the firm. So we, in essence, put a submission in. But
the process continues and obviously us wanting to continue to improve and continue to embed. I would say that we had
terrific engagement from the Fed at every level, from our on-site team to the horizontal work teams to Washington.
And so I think that the communication was quite good. And again, at the end of the day, our submission is our
submission, but we feel like the communication is good and we felt that we knew what it was we needed to do. And
obviously, we felt like that we've accomplished what it was we set out to do, but more to do as we go into the future.
And I think, as I said in my opening remarks, I feel good about our submission.
