With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported first quarter results that were in line with our
expectations. Ongoing earnings per share were $0.42, which is at the high end of our guidance range, and sales
increased 3.5% operationally led by a strong performance in our Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses. We're
confirming our full year 2013 ongoing earnings per share outlook, which is for double-digit growth at the midpoint of
the range. We're delivering on our current growth expectations despite a mixed global economy.
Developed markets globally continue to be challenged by 2012 austerity measures and weak economic conditions and
that impacted our results this quarter as we saw sales decline low single-digits, before exchange, in these markets. We
planned for that and expect to see some improvement in the second half of the year. And while most developed market
currencies were relatively stable, the yen weakened significantly, representative of the efforts by some governments to
stimulate weak economies.
At the same time, emerging markets continue to be a significant opportunity for us, one where the demand for
healthcare and nutrition is growing rapidly, and where Abbott is well-positioned to benefit from the favorable trends
that are taking place in these markets. This quarter more than 40% of our total sales were in emerging markets. In the
first quarter we saw particularly strong growth in China, India, Russia, and Vietnam, with sales in eight key emerging
markets up 18% before exchange. As we accelerate growth across these countries, we expect to expand our emerging
markets sales to more than 50% of Abbott's total sales over the next several years.
Before Tom and Brian discuss our results in detail, I'll briefly comment on our strategic priorities as they relate to first
quarter performance.
As I just discussed, driving above market growth across emerging markets is a key priority. Our sales across all of the
emerging markets were $2.2 billion in the first quarter, increasing 15% with strong results across our major businesses
including Nutrition, core diagnostics, and vascular devices. In Nutrition, emerging markets sales represent 45% of total
Nutrition sales and increased more than 20%. We have broad global reach today with our pediatric and adult brands
and we prioritized a group of key markets to deliver on our future growth targets. This includes multiple countries
where we're expanding our current leadership position, such as Vietnam; where we're shaping new markets, such as
India; and where we're aggressively expanding our geographic reach, such as China.
By 2015, we expect to more than double our presence in China, which is the largest and fastest-growing nutritional
market in the world. We're executing well against that goal through the first quarter of this year. We're also making
progress with the expansion of global capacity to support the continued strong global demand for pediatric and adult
nutrition. Our three new facilities in China, India and the U.S. are expected to come online later this year or early next
year.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, we prioritized 14 emerging markets where the demand for healthcare is rapidly
expanding and where we are building our presence to drive above market growth. Sales of these key emerging markets
represent approximately 50% of EPD's sales, and this quarter increased nearly 9% led by growth in Russia, India and
China. We anticipate our key emerging markets to deliver double-digit growth for the full year as we continue to
build-out our local product portfolios and expand in-country in these markets.
In Medical Devices, vascular devices delivered 20% emerging market growth, while medical optics and diabetes care
delivered mid-teens growth. Medical Devices growth was driven by continued strong performance of our TECNIS
brand of cataract intraocular lenses and our market leading vascular technology. In our diabetes care business our
emerging-market strength was driven by share gains in several key markets, including China.

In Diagnostics, more than 70% of our sales occur outside the United States with a growing portion in emerging
markets. In core laboratory diagnostics, these markets represent nearly 40% of sales and we continue to outpace market
growth in our priority markets; again China, Brazil and Russia. We've seen continued strong demand in the core
laboratory for our industry leading systems, including ARCHITECT. In China, this business again grew nearly 40%.
Our second priority is to continue to drive share gains and market expansion through new product launches and brand
enhancements. In Nutrition this quarter, we completed 19 new product launches globally, on track for approximately 70
by year-end. This includes the first international market launches of our new Similac next-generation formula and the
continued global rollout of our infant formula tolerance line. These innovations contributed to our 21% growth rate in
international pediatric nutrition. In the U.S., we launched a new line of ZonePerfect bars, as well as innovations across
our Similac brand to maintain our leading infant formula share position in the hospital and retail segments.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, we completed more than 45 new product launches across 16 geographies. This
included new formulations of core brands that broaden our key therapeutic portfolios in gastroenterology and
neurology.
In Medical Devices, we continued the rollout of Absorb in international markets and in January, initiated our Absorb
U.S. pivotal trial. Also in January in the U.S., we launched our new drug eluting stent system, XIENCE Xpedition and
are on track for a midyear approval in Japan. MitraClip, our structural heart device for mitral regurgitation increased
double-digits internationally. In medical optics, we launched a new cataract intraocular lens in Japan, which now gives
us access to 70% of the market where we were not previously competing. We also expect to launch our TECNIS Toric
IOL in the U.S. shortly. In diabetes care, we're on track to initiate our pivotal trial by year-end for our next generation
sensor that we expect to first bring to the European market by the end of 2014.
And in Diagnostics, we continue to broaden our ARCHITECT menu with several new tests. We also launched our
next-generation automation solution that improves efficiency and workflow amid increased testing volumes.
Development work continued on six new system platforms across core laboratory, point of care and molecular that are
expected to launch over the next several years. These new systems add new features that are important our customers
such as speed, scalability and shorter turnaround time.
The third priority I'll highlight is margin expansion. Our operating margin in the first quarter was in line with our
expectations and we remain on track to deliver approximately 100 basis points of expansion for the full year. While
we're focused on margin improvement across our businesses, Nutrition and Diagnostics are driving much of the
improvement this year. Nutrition operating margin increased significantly over the first quarter 2012, on track to
improve at least 300 basis points for the full year. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our target of 20% of sales
by 2015, as we implemented a number of planned actions last year and expect to continue our progress in 2013. In
Diagnostics, operating margin also improved over the prior year as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives
in manufacturing and supply chain. We're on track to reach our 2015 operating margin target in this business as well,
which is to exceed 20% of sales.
So in summary, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. And as we continue to execute on our key
business priorities we expect to deliver on our double-digit ongoing EPS growth target for the full year.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom to review our first quarter results and the 2013 outlook in more detail. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. Before we review our financial performance I'd like to mention that yesterday we furnished an 8-K
detailing the 2012 quarterly income statement for new Abbott on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with
appropriate reconciliations. With that in mind, our review of results for the first quarter of 2013 and our outlook for the
second quarter and full year 2013 will reflect comparisons to the 2012 ongoing baseline in the 8-K.
So for the first quarter of 2013, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $0.42, at the upper end of our
previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter were in line with previous guidance with operational growth of 3.5% and

1.8% growth on a reported basis, which includes an unfavorable impact of 1.7% from foreign exchange. Sales growth
was driven by strong performance across a number of products and businesses, most notably Nutrition and Diagnostics,
along with strong growth across all of our businesses in emerging markets, which grew 15% on an operational basis in
the quarter.
The first quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.8%, somewhat above our forecast due in part to the timing of
exchange effects on this ratio. In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&A
expense was around 32.5% of sales, both in line with expectations.
Turning to our outlook. For the full year 2013, today we're confirming our ongoing earnings per share guidance of
$1.98 to $2.04, which reflects double-digit growth over 2012 at the midpoint of the range. Regarding sales, for the full
year 2013 we continue to forecast operational growth – that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange – in the midto
high-single digits with a somewhat higher forecast for Nutrition, offset by somewhat lower expectations for vascular.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on our full year reported
sales. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55%, consistent with guidance
previously provided. We also continue to forecast ongoing R&D 6% to 7% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of
somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year 2013. Overall, we continue to project expansion of our full year adjusted
operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013, consistent with previous guidance.
We continue to forecast net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013, non-operating income of approximately
$20 million, and around $50 million of expense in the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L. Finally, we continue to
expect an ongoing tax rate of around 21% for the full year 2013, consistent with guidance previously provided.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2013, we're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.45.
Our operational sales growth in the second quarter is expected to be in the mid-single digits. At current exchange rates,
we'd expect roughly 1% negative impact from exchange on sales in the second quarter, while at these exchange rates,
we forecast reported sales growth approaching mid-single digits. We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio at
around 54.5% of sales in the second quarter, which includes a negative impact from exchange of nearly 1%. We also
forecast ongoing R&D at around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of somewhat under 32% of sales for the
second quarter.
So in summary, we're off to a good start in 2013, delivering at the upper end of our ongoing EPS expectations and
confirming our 2013 ongoing earnings per share guidance. This outlook again reflects strong performance as we
continue to build Abbott to deliver reliable top-tier performance in the years ahead.
With that, let's turn to Brian for the operating highlights by business.
Brian Yoor
Thanks, Tom. This morning I'll provide an overview of the first quarter 2013 performance for each of our businesses
and we'll also review our second quarter 2013 sales outlook by business. My comments will focus primarily on
operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.
Let's start with our Nutrition business where global sales increased 9% in the first quarter on an operational basis driven
by 15% growth internationally. International pediatric sales grew 21% operationally driven by uptake of new
innovations in Similac formula, continued strong double-digit growth of PediaSure and above-market growth in
emerging markets as we continue our geographic expansion. Adult nutrition sales increased 6%, led by continued
strong growth of Ensure and Glucerna. As the global leader in adult nutrition, we continue to shape this market as the
world's population ages.
In the U.S., first quarter nutrition sales increased 2.1%, in line with our expectations. U.S. pediatric sales were driven
by continued strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand, partially offset by a slight decline of infant formula sales.

While we continue to have a leading share position in the U.S., we experienced some unfavorable year-over-year
impact due to lower WIC volume. First quarter U.S. adult sales were driven by share and category growth of our
market-leading Ensure brand somewhat offset by lower than expected retail category growth.
As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect our global Nutrition business to grow high-single digits on an
operational basis, again led by strong international sales growth as we continue with our portfolio innovations and
geographic expansion to drive share gains in emerging markets.
Moving onto Diagnostics. In core laboratory diagnostics, operational sales increased nearly 6% in the first quarter.
About 80% of our core laboratory diagnostic sales are generated outside the U.S., where we saw nearly 9% operational
growth in the quarter. As Miles mentioned, we also saw strong emerging market sales growth led by China and Russia,
which grew 40% and 35% respectively.
We delivered on several new product approvals in the quarter, expanding our ARCHITECT platform menu by
launching six new tests and launching our next-generation automation solution designed to help laboratories improve
efficiencies and workflow. We will continue to broaden our menu throughout this year and continue to invest in the
development of our next generation platforms.
In molecular diagnostics, worldwide sales increased nearly 2% on operational basis in the first quarter, in line with our
expectations, led by strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by market conditions in Europe.
In point-of-care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased more than 17% on an operational basis, as we continued to
expand our leadership positions in the United States.
For the second quarter, we are forecasting our global Diagnostics business segment to generate mid- to high-single digit
operational sales growth with continued strong growth from core lab and point-of-care diagnostics and accelerated
growth in molecular diagnostics.
I'll now review our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, where sales in the quarter increased just over 1% on
an operational basis, consistent with our previous guidance. In EPD, we are focused on 14 key emerging markets which
include India, Russia, China, Brazil and 10 additional key markets. These markets comprise nearly 50% of EPD sales
and grew approximately 9% in the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect emerging markets to comprise an even
larger portion of EPD sales over time.
As expected, growth in other markets, which include developed markets such as Western Europe and Japan, and other
emerging markets, was negatively impacted by European austerity measures and the Japan NHI pricing actions taken in
2012. We expect to accelerate operational sales growth in EPD over the course of the year, as the impact of austerity
and pricing actions subsides and as we execute on a number of product and geographic expansion initiatives. With
respect to the second quarter, we expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our Established Pharmaceuticals
business.
And finally, Medical Devices, which includes our vascular, diabetes care, and vision care businesses. In our vascular
business, worldwide sales increased 6% on operational basis, including the expected noncommercial revenue decline
related to the Promus agreement, as well as the negative impact of Japan 2012 NHI pricing actions. Excluding Promus,
sales declined 2.5% on an operational basis. International sales, which comprise more than 60% of total vascular sales,
increased 4% operationally. Sales in the emerging markets represent 25% of vascular sales and grew 20% in the
quarter. Recent international launches of our XIENCE Xpedition drug eluting stent and bioresorbable vascular scaffold,
Absorb, coupled with contributions from my MitraClip and strong growth in emerging markets are the key drivers of
our international performance.
Last month at the American College of Cardiology meetings, we announced positive long-term results from the Absorb
trial indicating that our bioresorbable vascular scaffold provides unique benefits not possible with metallic stents. These
benefits include increases in vessel over time, reduction in plaque and improved vessel function.
U.S. vascular sales in the quarter declined 19% driven by the expected decline of certain royalty revenues and soft
market conditions including price.

Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2013, we expect our global vascular business to be relatively flat on an
operational basis. We expect to improve our performance over the course of this year with the continued uptake of
XIENCE Xpedition in the U.S.; the expected launch of XIENCE Xpedition in Japan; continued emerging markets
execution; and continued penetration of our new products, MitraClip and Absorb.
In diabetes care, global sales in the first quarter were relatively flat on an operational basis, in line with our
expectations. Outside the U.S., growth of 3% was driven by share gains in key emerging markets, which grew double
digits in the quarter as well as the continued uptake of our FreeStyle InsuLinx meter. In the U.S., we saw continued
share gains in the hospital and retail segments offset by marketing pricing pressures and lower Medicare mail order
purchases.
Moving to the second quarter in our diabetes care business, we project sales to be relatively flat on an operational basis.
As we have previously discussed, while we are forecasting strong growth in key emerging markets, the 2013
implementation of CMS, or the competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact our U.S. sales this year.
In vision care, global operational sales increased approximately 2% in the first quarter. Cataract sales, which represent
about 60% of our global vision care sales continued to outpace the market in the quarter, led by above market growth of
our TECNIS brand of intraocular lenses. We expect continued strong growth in our cataract business with several
important launches this year. These include our recent launch of TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan, which provides Abbott
access to the largest segment of the Japan market, and the expected upcoming U.S. launch of our TECNIS Toric lens.
We also saw continued strong performance of cataract business in the emerging markets with more than 30% growth in
the quarter. For the second quarter in our global vision care business, we expect low single digit operational sales
growth.
So in summary, our results were in line with our expectations and we remain on track to meet our full year forecasts.
We delivered strong performance in both Nutrition and Diagnostics this quarter while also executing on a number of
new project launches and geographic expansion. And we expect accelerated growth as the year progresses.
We will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. I think it's okay, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Morning, Miles. If I think about the company – I thought by the
way you guys, I thought, did an excellent job in laying out in the press release, which is; you had a lot of different
details than you've had before – there's, you've got 40% of the company in emerging markets. It's growing 15% this
quarter. You've got the other 60% in developed markets that was down like 3% this quarter. If we think about the
acceleration in the total company over the balance of this year, is it the developed market piece gets better if you think
about in aggregate, or is it the emerging markets piece? I think I know the answer but I just want you to flesh that out a
little bit.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well it's a little bit of both. I would tell you that a little bit of improvement in developed
markets goes a long way. But the emerging markets for us are showing pretty strong growth. And I would say even a
bad day in an emerging market looks a lot better than a developed market right now. So when we look at some of these
emerging markets, and even at the very strong growth rates we see there, they're a little slower than what we may have
historically seen in the last couple of years. So I think it kind of depends. Unfortunately, they're not all binary and
separated; they're linked, they're somewhat interdependent. And I would say we're seeing the roll through right now in

the developed markets of the actions – austerity actions that have been taken, obviously, in the last year-to-15-months,
and I think that's going to be with us for a while. I know the senior management at Johnson & Johnson commented a
little bit on that yesterday and I thought their comments were quite eloquent about that, quite correct, that it's going to
take a while for this to roll through and for businesses or companies to lap the actions we've seen in the developed
markets. But a little bit of improvement there, as I said, goes a long way.
At the same time, the emerging markets are still very robust and strong comparatively speaking, and frankly, even in
the absolute.
So I think all of us, we look at our various businesses, it's really, as you point out, a two-part story: it's developed
markets, emerging markets and they're pretty different. And so the tactics or the things that we put in place in any of
those markets are different; we're expanding as rapidly as we can where the growth is; and we're finding better ways to
be efficient and compete more effectively and frankly compete for share in the developed markets. So I think at the end
of the day, while we've given guidance that we expect to be mid- to high-single digits, depending on how long the
economic conditions persist, we'll be toward the mid. And if it begins to improve, we'll start to move the other way.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Well let's take EPD, because I think that's probably the business where there's
probably the biggest range of views on the growth profile that business. And if you look at it this quarter, and then what
you're expecting over the balance of the year, you've got your emerging markets piece which is posting good growth,
not double digits, but pretty close. And then you've got your rest of Europe, which has been declining, there's been a
drag. So if EPD gets better over the balance of the year, is that because you start to lap some of those cuts that occurred
in Europe last year? Or is it because emerging markets accelerates?
<A - Miles D. White>: Again it's a little bit of both. We definitely get better as we lap some of last year. The
developed market part of EPD in some ways has been more strongly hit than any other businesses – or that business in
developed markets has been more strongly impacted because of just the direct impact of price cuts in Japan or Europe.
And then of course you've got the yen on top of it. But – and we've got a pretty significant business in Japan there. So
we've got a disproportionate index on the developed markets in EPD, so I think as we lap that it gets better. But at the
same time, as you pointed out, the growth rate of EPD in the emerging markets is about 9%, and frankly I expect that to
improve in the latter half of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And then one last follow-up for Tom. The gross margin commentary for the
second quarter, you're expecting a step down from 1Q to 2Q despite having probably $200 million in incremental
revenues, is that just because the first quarter was just higher than it normally would be because of FX hedges?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, we just had – the timing of the flow through of the exchange really just kind of
helped the first quarter a little bit and it'll be a little bit of an offset in the second – or the last three quarters of the year.
I think the big – the key message on gross margin is, as we look at the full year, we're right on track with what we
thought we would have as we talked about back in January. So it's really just a timing thing, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Perfect. Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you'd comment a little bit about maybe
what's going on beneath the surface on SG&A? There's a lot of, probably, activity in emerging markets and maybe talk
about some of the investments you're making there versus what you're doing in the developed markets to just facilitate
the longer-term growth first? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. Rajeev, this is Miles. I think that's a pretty good summary right there. We're definitely
expanding in the growth markets around the world, both in head count and promotional spending, and so forth, to
support that growth. And we're doing that at a prudent rate. We're also tightly managing the sales and marketing

expenses in markets where we're not going to get the return or aren't getting the return.
I would also say a little bit of what's going on there, and you'll probably see this play out over the remaining quarters of
the year, we're putting an awful lot of emphasis on our G&A. It's not that we want to spend less or invest less in our
sales and marketing support of our businesses or investment in businesses, but I do want to run the company at a very
efficient level from a G&A standpoint. And so we put a lot of emphasis on how we are performing in all of our, call it
overhead or support functions around the world. Doesn't matter what country you're in for that one, or what business.
And we're looking at any kind of duplication between our businesses and corporate and so on.
Now that we've got a little different configuration of the company without the proprietary Pharma business, it gives us
some opportunity to look pretty closely at a lot of our support spending in G&A. That's not something we can do in just
a quarter, but over the coming quarters we'll definitely be putting some emphasis on that.
So – and is it enough that you could see that play out in the SG&A? Yes.
If the question is driven more toward 'gee are you too tight on SG&A?' I'd say, no we don't feel like we're starving
SG&A. I think not at all, actually. If we have the opportunity to invest more where we know we can get the return and
grow, we're deathly doing that. There's a certain pace at which you can do that and a certain quality at which you can
do that, and we're mindful of that. But we want to make sure we put that investment into the growth of the businesses.
And I'd say the same with R&D. You look at the profile of R&D this quarter and it looks like it might be slightly down.
That's really a timing issue. We don't like to shift or reduce any kind of R&D spending at all, provided it's productive.
So we like the notion of investing more in R&D and we like investing it well. And we don't want to make our bottom
line based on what we do with discretionary spending in SG&A or R&D; that bottom line needs to be driven by core
performance at the gross margin level. And that's why we're putting so much emphasis on the gross margin
improvement in the businesses, which is going quite well. That not only is good for the investor at the bottom line but
affords us more investment capability in R&D and SG&A. I know it's a long-winded answer, but there you go.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: No, that was very helpful. Thank you. And I guess one quick follow-up on the product side. I
was wondering if you could talk about the Absorb product in Europe and what you're – maybe a little bit more granular
on what you're seeing there in terms of uptake and how you expect that to broaden out over the coming quarters?
Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well I'd say the uptake is taking a little longer to ramp than we might like, but it is coming
along pretty nicely. We're confident that this is going to be a workhorse stent for us over time. And I think the initial
trial and positioning of the stent has people trying it. And you might even say in its initial launch it looks like it's going
to a very high niche. On the other hand, that's the starting point, to get some experience with physicians and doctors; it's
our intent to drive it into what I would call a very common workhorse use.
And the pace of that is steady. I think we're always going to be impatient and wanting to drive it faster. For a little
while it was about having the range of sizes, we solved that in a number of our markets. So I expect that to continue to
perform pretty well.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Oh, good morning. Miles, I thought I'd come back to one of the bigger growth drivers in
Nutrition and two specific points, then maybe a follow-up. There's been a lot of talk intra-quarter about the Hong Kong
ban; it's pressured some of the peers in this space. What is Abbott's positioning on the impact that the Hong Kong ban
would have, if any, on the business?

And I guess the second follow-up would be Ensure, I think a business that people are not focusing as much on,
obviously a launch late last year. How are you thinking about Ensure and the opportunity in China?
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. You know what I'm going to let Brian or Tom answer your Hong Kong question because
I think, frankly, the answer is we're not having an impact.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Right.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah...
<A - Miles D. White>: But we'll give you more granularity on the impact we're not having.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah, David, I think – this is Brian. We had a great quarter as you can see in Nutrition and that is
driven by strong growth in China. That dynamic is not our dynamic, and I know you and I have discussed this a little
bit. We're not as over indexed in Hong Kong as our competition. If you look across Hong Kong and China our shares
are relatively the same, so we don't see this dynamic impacting us but clearly it is an impact on the industry if they
make restrictions of product that can cross the border there.
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd say our growth rate in China is pretty robust and we're not seeing that impact. Frankly, our
growth rate in Hong Kong's pretty good too.
<A - Brian Yoor>: And your second question was?
<Q - David R. Lewis>: On Ensure, Miles, is it too early to start thinking about how big the Ensure opportunity could
be in China?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well we're thinking about how big it might be. I'm not sure I can quantify it for you but we
think it's a fairly significant opportunity and we're investing to frankly drive and create that market. And I think there's
– how would I put it? I think it should be a terrific opportunity for us; it's a market that I think demographically and
from a culture and a use standpoint is perfect for Ensure. We're currently, as you know, investing in capacity for our
liquids in the United States. We'll probably – and we'll enter that market first with our powder versions of Ensure, and
then we'll transition to liquid; we'll add on to our plants or one of our plants in Asia to give us the capacity to
manufacture in or near market for Ensure.
That's one where we're very confident of the opportunity. I think almost any projection we put together will be wrong,
but I know it will all be good. So that's one we look forward to running at as fast as we can, I would tell you. I think it's
a big opportunity.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, that's very clear. And just maybe a quick follow-up for Tom. Tom, if you think about
the roadmap you laid out on the roadshow for Nutrition margin expansion, now that we're sort of three, four months
post that, where do we sit now in terms of where we stand? Are we on plan? Slightly ahead of plan? Potentially
behind? And then what are the kind of the key guideposts in terms of either manufacturing capacity or cost reduction
initiatives over the next several quarters we should be focused on?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: We're ahead of plan. When you look at the first quarter, when you see the Q come out,
you're going to see a really good operating margin for this business. I think you have to be a little careful with that and
we really need to look at this on a full-year basis because in last three quarters we are planning some investments in the
business and we are starting up the plants that Miles talked about. And so I wouldn't straight-line the margin you see in
the first quarter out to the full year, but as Miles indicated in his remarks, year-over-year, for the full year we expect
300 basis points of improvement in the operating margin this year alone, which gets us very well on the track towards
the target he talked about. So we're ahead of plan and that business is really clicking on all cylinders when it comes to
the margin expansion.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up I guess on MitraClip. Given that you
guys have had the panel, what are your expectations just in terms of whether you're optimistic that the FDA will
ultimately approve the product or whether we should just expect to see perhaps some of the other studies before
granting full approval? And then if you could also update just on the performance and sales level in Europe too, that'd
be great.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. I guess, Kristin, what the first thing I'd tell you is we're pleased that we got a favorable
indication from the panel that was recently held with the FDA. But I have found over time, it's never good to speculate
about what the FDA may or may not do, or may or may not think. We're hopeful and we're working as constructively
as we can with the agency regarding the U.S. But I don't find it useful at all for us to speculate or put the FDA in a spot
or whatever; we want them to work constructively with us and I think the best I can say is we can't predict it and we're
not in a position to really comment much further than that.
And then I guess with regard to Europe and the 30 countries that it's available in today, we're pretty pleased with the
performance. The – it's been planted in 8,000 patients and we've had a good performance with it. It's growing quite
nicely in the markets where we're marketing it and growing at a very nice, healthy double-digit rate. We'd certainly like
to bring it to the U.S. for patients who are at high risk and have no other option and we'll just see how that plays out.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then any kind of high-level thoughts just on capital allocation, M&A strategy
here, now that the spin-off is compete?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well Tom loves it when you ask about capital allocation, so I'll let him take that.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Hi, Kristin. As we entered the year, it's similar really to the way we viewed this even
prior to separation. You know it's a balanced approach: e pay a healthy dividend, we believe in a growing dividend; we
execute on share repurchase each year and we did some of that in the first quarter and plan to do that this year; there is
some degree of cash build-up and some potential of moderating on the debt level. So it's a balanced approach. And the
cash flow of the company is good; we've projected $4 billion this year, that gives us a lot of options. And it's more of
the same as we progress through 2013.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with the U.S. The
international performance was very strong but some of the U.S. businesses came in a little weaker than we expected.
Maybe if you could talk about whether there were fewer selling days in the quarter that might have had an impact? And
the three businesses that would be helpful to get some color from you on are vascular, adult nutritional and core lab.
And then I just had one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah, Larry, this is Brian. I mean there were some impact on the selling days. That's something
we've not stressed in the past calls, but it definitely impacted our Nutritional business to where those sales would've
been a little bit higher as well as the vascular side even to a little bit to an extent. You saw – clearly in the U.S., I'd
probably start with where the pressures are on the vascular side that you're seeing. And with there, we have seen some
market pressures; we've seen like nearly a 10% decline in this market, primarily pricing related, and we are down a
little bit on a share year-over-year basis. However, we are gaining share sequentially, as if you look through the fourth
quarter to the first quarter where our share has picked up about a couple of points. And again Xpedition I would say is

early is its launch in the U.S., and so as we discussed before we expect some continued share gain in the U.S. and for
that business to pick up as we move throughout the year on vascular.
<A - Miles D. White>: Larry, I would add to that for you, I think if you compare just on share in that business versus a
year ago I think we're down about two points best as we can tell. On the other hand we're on an uptick, because we
launched Xpedition just after the first of the year, so I would expect that to pick up. The pressure on vascular, very
heavily a market pressure. And part of it's competitive and pricing in the market, and part of it's just utilization.
I would tell you one of the benefits we have here, looking across all these businesses, because we have the diverse
portfolio we do and we're in so many countries we get the benefit of comparing the performances of different
businesses across those different geographies. And I would tell you that as we look at the U.S., Japan, the European
Union, Canada, et cetera, the developed markets, and look across the various businesses, whether it's vascular or
diagnostics or any of these businesses, it's pretty uniform the growth rates and the market growth rates and frankly the
business growth rates and pressures that we see.
You can see the pressure or the economic conditions in the retail markets for our Nutrition business, you can see it in
the hospital markets, you can see it in frankly any segment of the markets, the pharma markets and so forth, they're all
pretty similar. And what we take from that, I mean obviously we know how we're doing and we know how some of our
competitors are doing and so forth, but we take from that there is an underlying, call it economic malaise, or weakness,
that's pretty consistent across the developed markets. And it's not unique to the U.S., it's not unique to Europe. It
manifests itself in some different ways depending on how the products are paid for or by whom, whether it's patient pay
or government pay or third-party insurer payer, or so forth. But overall they're pretty similar. And the conditions are
such that you've got that headwind in literally all of the developed markets. And one way or another we're seeing it in
each of these businesses.
Conversely in the emerging markets it's just the opposite, and they are almost uniformly all pretty robust. They're a
little more volatile, a little less predictable. You've got some currency swings here and there and so forth, which is why
it's great to be in a pretty broad portfolio of emerging markets and not over indexed in any one. But the fact is,
consistently across the board, they're pretty healthy growth rates in those markets. And I would say that the unique
distinctions among them pretty much blend out across them, whereas there's a lot more consistency across the
weakness of the developed markets. Tom?
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: That's helpful.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Just to answer your question on core lab, Larry, we outline this in the earnings release,
but there was a kind of a comp issue in the blood banking business and we had a really strong, unusual order last year
that was really non-recurring. So I would not trend out that first quarter and you should see better performance in the
U.S. on core lab.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. Thanks, Tom.
<A - Miles D. White>: Did we answer everything you asked there, Larry?
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: You did. Thank you. Let me just ask one follow-up of Tom. Thanks for providing the
2012 quarterly numbers. It's the first time to get to hear your perspective on those numbers. And just two things stood
out to me. One is the gross margin came in at about 55%, that's what you're guiding to this year. And the tax rate was
about 25% last year and you're guiding to 21% this year. So just curious on the gross margin, why no improvement in
2013? And second, just wanting to understand the tax rate, obviously a great improvement from 25% to 21%, but just a
little bit of color on how you can achieve a 400 basis point improvement and maybe where it can go from here?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Sure, thanks Larry. The gross margin is actually on an underlying basis improving across
this business. We have about a 1% exchange headwind because of lag effects and hedges and the like comparing 2012
versus 2013. So – and we said, we talked about this on the fourth quarter call that we'd be flattish in gross margin but
underlying is improving and it's just kind of a tough year from an exchange comp perspective. So I think that's pretty

consistent with what we've said before.
Regarding the tax rate, there are a couple things. When you look at the tax rate in this baseline, clearly it's a carve out
or a residual of a carve out of, we ran the whole company the way we ran it, and we repatriated for the whole company
and this is was what shook out relative to the Abbott that we're now running. So it's just – that's one thing to keep in
mind. And really the two things that are causing the improvement over that carve out, if you will, is the tax law changes
that were enacted and, as you know, at the beginning of the year. For the whole of 2012, we were unable to recognize
any of the benefits associated with that, and there were certain provisions of that, that were – went beyond the R&D tax
credit that were helpful to the company. And we are seeing a shift of income to a better, lower tax jurisdiction, shall we
say, which is kind of a mix effect in income, which is helping us to run at the 21% rate this year.
So those are the reasons. And I guess the other thing I'd just note is, when you compare year-over-year progress in our
growth, tax is helping it for sure, but if you just call that aside and look at operating growth, we're still growing at that
double digit level, which is again the way we've built and what we hope to sustain the growth profile of this business.
So that's the explanation on the tax rate.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thanks very much guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Hi, good morning, everyone, thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could spend
a little bit more time on the U.S. Medical Devices. Certainly we can appreciate some of the challenges in the coronary
stent market as it relates to pricing and overall utilization. But what I was hoping you could just expand upon is where
you think we are in, with respect to volumes? PCI volumes have been down now for several years, I think there was
some perception that that was sort of cyclical; it's turning out to seem a little bit more secular. But how should we think
about your U.S. vascular business going forward?
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah, David, this is Brian, here. I'll start off here and then perhaps turn it over to Miles or Tom for
more perspective. But we have seen on a year-over-year basis the PCI's to your point on volume being down
approximately 5%. And we're still continuing to see pricing pressures on a year-over-year basis almost as much as 7%.
You know you kind of weight these things out with the other dynamics of the market, that was the 10% that I was
talking about being down year-over-year. I'd say, sequentially, we still are seeing some modest decline even
sequentially, in these price in PCI as well. I mean if you look at some of the news that was out there, and Miles
mentioned this, it's all out there in terms of the healthcare space with some of the health management associations been
reporting that there's certain utilizations that have just kind of flattened off. And we're still continuing to see that
pressure. So for us in the U.S. it really is going be about the share in momentum and gaining back, as Miles mentioned,
with respect to the Xpedition launch.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: But obviously, it's very similar to what we've been talking about throughout this call. It's
really a tale of two markets. You know developed world's a little more challenged, but the emerging markets grew 20%
in the quarter in this. And we're seeing double-digit PCI growth in some of the Asian, in a number of the Asian
markets. So between this, MitraClip, Absorb progress, Xpedition launch and the like, there's a portfolio of growth
drivers that we believe are going to help level out this business and start it back on the growth path globally.
<A - Miles D. White>: David, I think the other thing I'd point out – I mean I think Brian sort of covered it – is, first of
all, there are two dynamics going on here. One is the PCI volume and one is the price. The quarter compares to a
quarter a year ago. We also look at the most immediate past quarter, the fourth quarter, in this case, of 2012. So if you
look at the current trend or the current sequential trend, the difference you see versus a year ago has slowed
considerably, so as PCI growth, down 5%, now on a sequential basis quarter-to-quarter it's barely 1% down. So the rate
at which it's declined would appear to be slowing, moderating, whatever.

But it isn't recovering. That part's true. It's not recovering. And the same I could say for price. Price hasn't taken a lot of
pressure over the last three, four, five months, but it certainly did versus a year ago.
So we look at it both ways. What's the case versus a year ago and how's it trending right now? And I'd say both of those
factors, at least as impact have kind of flattened. Modestly, slightly down maybe, but pretty much flattened. But it isn't
recovering. So it's a pretty – as you said, it's just – it wasn't temporary. It seems to be hanging in there.
I think that's true across a lot of the hospital segments frankly. And I think hospitals today are even more aware of fixed
budgets if not declining budgets. And they're putting a lot of pressure on utilization and/or price, procedures, et cetera,
as they try to deal with 'hey we've only got so much to spend and we're trying to allocate it as best we can.'
<Q - David H. Roman>: That's helpful. And then maybe on the emerging markets piece. Obviously another very
strong quarter and you called out some of the highlights in key segments. So what I was hoping you'd just spend a
couple seconds on is how you view the competitive dynamic stacking up across your biggest businesses? And where –
is most of your growth coming from building new categories that didn't really previously exist in markets? Are you
taking share? How does local stack up? I know in China for example, there are sort of a decent cadre of local stent
manufacturers but your numbers continue to show quite a bit of strength. Maybe just help us frame out the competitive
impact versus the new market development impact in those regions?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think first of all, it's very heavily new market, new growth and that's why those markets
are growing. As the healthcare systems expand, as the medical practices expand, as incomes expand and so forth, you
actually see the evolution of two or three, sometimes four kind of pricing tiers and segments. You would – there's often
a, call it a high-end niche, there's a mid-market, there's a lower tier and sometimes a very low tier. All of them are
growing and you see a migration of that mid-tier to the upper tiers in some cases. In a lot of cases the multinationals
and/or exporters that are not local manufacturers in those markets are in those upper tiers and trying to move down and
the local manufacturers are in the lower to mid tiers trying to move up; we see that in almost every business we're in.
But I would tell you in spite of the fact there's multiple competitors, whether local or multinational and pretty healthy
competition amongst us all, we're all being driven by a heavy tailwind of growth and expansion and utilization in those
markets as their healthcare system expands. So, you can track in a lot of cases, and we're careful when we look at this
internally not to get too excited about our growth if we're not taking share. You know, we want to be paying attention
to whether or not we're winning in these markets and in the competition. It's wonderful to have the growth, but at the
same time we're mindful that your competitiveness is measured in your share as well. So I would tell you that the
emerging markets are very, very much a tailwind of growth but at the same time, we're all mindful of the competition.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Maybe lastly on EPD. I think one of things that you had communicated on the fourth
quarter conference call was some expectation for a moderation of pressure in Europe throughout the course of the year
given some of the austerity measures that were in place last year, perhaps sort of stabilizing this year. Any visibility on
that at this point? Or is that something that we sort of have to wait and see how that plays out over the course of the
year?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah, I'm afraid it falls into the wait-and-see category. No I'm not seeing it yet. It's something
we expect in the second half of the year, but no, we're not seeing it yet. I think what we're seeing right now is the
flow-through of the measures taken in the past, as I said, 12 months, or 2012. There were lot of pricing actions taken by
governments and we're seeing that flow through the business now in the comps. And I would expect to see us lap some
of that and see it moderate in the second half of the year. But we haven't seen it yet.

<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, Miles. Good morning, Tom. Maybe I'll start off on the diabetes side. You're
clearly doing well in emerging markets, U.S. softer outlook, I assume in part due to the new U.S. reimbursement, lower
reimbursement CMS reimbursement for diabetes test strip. Just – can you give us your perspective on some of the next
drivers in diabetes? Is this sharp reduction in test strip reimbursement reflected in the numbers? And maybe remind us
of the Medicare, non-Medicare mix in the business; in U.S. business?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well in the U.S., first of all, I would say it's one of those rare circumstances where you're glad
you're share is not real high in a particular segment. And I realize it sounds like some rationalization, but we're not – we
don't have a real high Medicare share, and we have one of the lowest shares in mail order. So the CMS competitive
bidding that has been put in place in the United States is going to have an impact on all manufacturers, but it's frankly,
relatively speaking, less on us because we're not highly indexed there.
The business itself has segmented and focused on the high testing or frequent testing insulin-dependent user for quite
some time, and that's a more robust segment where we've been steadily, incrementally gaining some share. We've
targeted our R&D efforts on next-generation sensors in testing on those users that are looking for more than just a test
strip and a test; they're looking for a lot more information management, a lot more ease of testing and so forth.
So I will tell you that the product lines that we have in development in that business today, which I think are very
innovative and will have tremendous value for those patients, are steadily moving along. I was just recently out in
California meeting with a group for a day, and I'm very pleased with what I see there. I think that we've targeted a
segment of the market that is a lot less, say, cost sensitive and much more performance sensitive around what their
testing and information gives them. And I'm thinking that the business is certainly positioned in the right place going
forward here over the coming years.
Today it's a very tough competitive commodity-like market for the Type IIs and the less frequent testers, and in the
U.S. Tom?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Rick I'd just say that when we went through our planning process last fall, I mean it was
very clear what was coming in competitive bidding and the business, and our plan totally factored in pretty much what
has played out in the bidding process. So we're well covered in our guidance for the evolution of the U.S. market here.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good. And on the EPD side, you've talked about launching new and different formulations of
existing drugs and registering current drugs in the portfolio in new, additional geographies. Can you update us there
and your progress there, and what we should be looking for on those fronts?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. As I mentioned in my remarks, there were 45 of them, that came through in the first
quarter. There have been hundreds of submissions made to the various regulatory bodies around the world. And one of
the things we're finding is that those regulatory bodies are capacity constrained in their ability to process registrations
in a number of countries. So it's slower going than we than we might hope, but we're making progress. And it's
something that each of our local regulatory people is working through with the various regulatory bodies in each
country. But we're making progress with it. And as we do it's gradually expanding the product lines.
One of the things we're trying to do is prioritize into those registrations that are higher volume, higher likely usage and
so forth ahead of those that are less so, to fill out our product lines. Trying to get the priorities straight. That's not
always easy to do with the regulatory body because their interests aren't necessarily the same as our interests. But we're
making progress there.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: And just last, Miles. I hate to always ask you about acquisition plans. It's hard to resist since I'm
asked – almost the first question I get asked every time I speak about Abbott and just, I guess, your latest thoughts on
strategy and focus. I get asked about your priorities U.S. or O-U.S., one business or another. And maybe talk about the
pressure you feel or don't feel to move forward on that front? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah. I guess I'd answer it a couple of different ways. I don't feel any particular pressure,
because I think there's a balance between the things you might like to do strategically or look at versus the pricing or
the values in the market or whatever the case may be. And you know, we like to think, I'm sure very business and

competitor out there likes to think that we are prudent stewards of shareholder dollars and that we make prudent deals
and so forth when we do. Our track record's been pretty good that way. But we're mindful of that.
And I think it kind of depends. There have been some areas of the business that we've wanted to expand, obviously,
and I think I've commented in the past, we're looking at quite a wide variety of potential things in the device businesses
to expand our device footprint and platforms and so on. But it kind of depends where and when they're ready, and/or
we like what we see at the value we see, et cetera. So I'd say we're always active there.
We were not so active last year, because first of all I think a lot of things weren't ready, and secondly we were pretty
focused on all of the activity with regard to the separation. But having the separation activity behind us, we're able to
turn our attention now to what some of those things may be, but it doesn't mean we're sort of out on a buying spree
either. I think we tend to be pretty selective. We always balance it versus the value of the business and what we can do
with the business, and the capacity of our businesses to observe additional new things to do, because whether it's big or
small, it takes a lot of effort to put it into your portfolio and drive it appropriately. So I'd say we're actively looking
there.
We're not trying to – I'd say in the device businesses and so forth, we're not sort of U.S. versus not U.S., or overseas, or
whatever. I think, as everyone in this market can tell, it's often faster to be in the markets in Europe than it is in the U.S.
these days, and I think that's fairly apparent. But that doesn't mean you only buy ex-U.S. [non-U.S.] businesses or look
at licensing products ex-U.S [non-U.S.]; the U.S. is still a very important market for us, and it's one in which we have
ambitions to keep growing, and in our device the businesses. So there's no distinction geographically there at all.
In our EPD business, that business is not in the U.S., and it has no intention to be. So any interest we have in properties
there that might expand our geographic footprints would all be ex-U.S. [non-U.S.] And again we follow that pretty
regularly. But I have to say, the valuations and things that we've seen in a lot of cases haven't made sense to us. So
we're careful about that.
And then in Nutrition, I'd say our Nutrition business has some interest in some things. I would characterize them as
relatively small, and given the growth rate of the business, I don't think there's any need there. It would have to be a
particular opportunity we thought had robust potential, because with the way the business is performing, you don't want
to over distract it with an acquisition or integration when it's been hitting on all cylinders like it is.
So I'm sure that kind of describes the waterfront there; I'm intentionally not going to be specific with you about what
we may be looking at. When we were doing our roadshows last fall I did get a lot of questions on it from investors and
analysts, and I always get specific questions about specific businesses or specific segments that I realize our investors
have other investments in and are trying to triangulate on interest in. But there's nothing I've been asked about that we
haven't been following or looking at closely, or studying, or looking at in some fashion. I think one of the things that
makes any company successful in the M&A or licensing area is that you've done your homework, and you've been
doing it over time, so that when you finally decide to make a move with something, you've had a lot of diligence and
you know why you want to do it and so forth, and you're ready. And I will tell you that that's always been our practice,
to kind of be on top of whatever portfolio of opportunities there might be for us.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Appreciate that, Miles.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Okay. Ilan we have time for one more question?
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Oh, hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up on the use of cash.
Tom, you highlighted the dividend end as well as some debt pay down. But what about share buyback? So is that
something, a focus? And how should we think about shares outstanding? And then I had one more follow-up on the use
of cash.

<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I did mention it when I gave my recap there: share buyback has always been part of our
mix of use of cash. We bought a fair amount of shares in the first quarter, and it's something we continue to look at as
we progress through the year. So absolutely it's an important part of the mix for us, it's a good way to return cash to
shareholders and obviously with the view we have about the long-term of this company it's a good investment for our
shareholders. So absolutely it's part of the mix and we did execute on a fair amount of that in the first quarter.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Is there a target for shares outstanding by the end of the year?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I wouldn't say that. I mean sometimes that fluctuations with the stock price fluctuations
and the impact on diluted shares but what we have is a target for deploying cash into share buyback and we executed on
a fair amount of that in the first part of the year here.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay and just as a follow-up, I would assume that most of your cash is now sitting outside
the U.S. So if that's correct how does that impact – and this is specifically for Miles – how does this impact your M&A
thoughts? I would think more targets would therefore be outside the U.S.?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well I don't necessarily target the businesses by – or the interest strategically by where the cash
is. We first look at the strategic fit of any given business of interest to us with the businesses we're in or what we can do
with it. And obviously we look at returns and all the obvious and important financial metrics that we ought to look at.
And then depending on our access to cash or where that business may be, we have that as a consideration. But I would
tell you we don't start with it as a constraint and we don't start with it as necessarily as the determining factor of where
we ought to be hunting or looking. And our interest outside the U.S. is because frankly that's where the growth is. And
it's an awful lot of growth and we want to feed that growth. So to the extent that we can invest in that growth, we do.
And therefore in some ways it's very convenient to have a significant portion of cash outside the U.S. to support that
growth.
Now having said that, there are things that we also are interested in that are in the U.S., and device business in
particular tend to be U.S.-centric at least as a point of residence, and we don't feel like we're particularly constrained or
unable to react to the ones that we're interested in to acquire; we have found it possible to manage our cash and our
returns appropriately. So while I would say that it would be nice if the U.S. government in its efforts with tax reform at
some point would find a path to allow companies economic repatriation that would certainly be in everybody's interest.
But right now it's not determining where we focus our M&A activity.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, great. Thanks for the color, Miles.
