David I. Goulden
Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you've all seen our financial
results for the quarter. Q3 was very much a tale of two cities. On the positive side, we achieved almost all our strategic
and operational goals in the quarter and there's a lot to like. But on the less positive side, there were two big challenges
we couldn't overcome which had a direct impact upon our financial results for the quarter.
Third quarter 2013 revenues were a little over $5.5 billion and earnings per share was $0.40. This revenue was below
our expectations for the period by approximately $250 million, principally driven by two major factors both of which
impacted storage product revenue. The first was a very late timing of orders in the quarter. The second was U.S. federal
government spending. I'll walk you through each of them.
For the past several quarters we've seen caution in customer spending leading to increased scrutiny and extended close
cycles and this continued in Q3. The result was another very back end loaded quarter. Specifically, more storage
product orders than we expected came in on the very last day of the quarter which, as you know, was a Monday making
fulfillment to these orders in Q3 extremely difficult. As a result, storage product orders we receive that we didn't ship in
the quarter were $100 million higher than we expected.
Now turning to the second factor, many storage product orders from the U.S. federal government that were expected to
close in the last weeks of the quarter did not due to less than expected year-end budget money and unexpected
re-prioritization of these year-end budgets ahead of the federal government shutdown. This accounted for
approximately $120 million of revenue shortfall against our expectations.
To put some perspective around this, after relatively flat first half storage spend with us by the U.S. federal
government, Q3 spending was down significantly year-on-year on what is the biggest and most important quarter for
U.S. federal spending. Together, these two factors accounted for the vast majority of the Q3 revenue shortfall versus
our expectations and this revenue shortfall directly impacted our EPS results for the period.
While we're disappointed with our reported results in the quarter, our confidence in the success of our strategy over the
longer term is as strong as it's ever been. You might be asking what was driving this confidence? Well, there are a
number of things.
First was the trend in our storage product bookings growth rate. Excluding U.S. federal, storage product bookings
growth accelerated in Q3 to the high single digits, the highest rate we've seen all year. This was true globally as well as
for each of the Americas, EMEA and APJ. This positive development in demand bodes well not only for EMC but for
the storage market as a whole.
There's also what we accomplished in the quarter key strategic areas of our business including our Emerging Storage
business, our service provider partner program, VCE and VMware all had accelerating year-on-year growth once again
in Q3. Pivotal continues to execute well on its roadmap collecting lighthouse wins and preparing for the launch of
Pivotal One this quarter, and the successful launches of ViPR, our new data domain platforms and our next-generation
VNX in Q3 further enhance our value proposition for our customers.
Finally, we are confident simply because of what our customers are telling us. We stay close to and listen to our
customers and they are demanding ever greater value from their IT spend. The good news is that our technology goes a
long way towards making customers more efficient and they respond to our relentless focus on continuing to deliver
this value. This dedication to customer's success is a hallmark across EMC, VMware and Pivotal teams indispensable

to our strategy and a key driver of our market share gains, which we believe continued in Q3.
The take away is that while global IT spending continues to be lackluster and the situation with the U.S. government
has not made things easier, our portfolio of offerings combined with our business model put us in an advantaged
position to help customers transform their IT to fully optimize cloud, big data and trusted IT.
Looking at our results in more detail, year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter was 5% to $5.5 billion and 6% in
constant currency. In spite of this quarter's challenges, our information infrastructure and information storage
businesses grew and growth of Pivotal and VMware accelerated. All four of our major geographies grew as well with
North America up 3%, EMEA up 8%, its highest growth rate this year, APJ up 8%, 12% ex-Japan, and Latin America
up 13% from last year's third quarter. Our BRIC+13 emerging markets grew at 19%, also its highest growth rate for the
year.
Our storage product revenue shortfall in Q3 hurt our gross margins. On a consolidated basis gross margins were down
40 basis points from Q2. The higher mix of VMware revenue in the quarter helps but not enough to offset the impact of
a reduction in volume from last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat versus Q2. We continue to invest in
key areas across the federation including ViPR and XtremIO and EMC II, the software-defined data center vCHS and
end-user computing at VMware and building the platform for next-generation application developments at Pivotal.
Our tax rate was slightly lower than in Q2 effectively offsetting the impact of non-operating expense on non-GAAP
EPS, which came in at $0.40 for the quarter. Free cash flow in Q3 grew 26% year-on-year to $1.4 billion bringing our
year-to-date free cash flow to $3.7 billion, up 6% against the comparable period last year. Free cash flow is an
important driver of our shareholder returns and in May we enhanced our capital allocation framework to enhance our
direct returns to shareholders. By directing half of our U.S. based free cash flow ex-VMware to dividends and
buybacks returns to shareholders grow as the business grows over time.
As part of this new framework, we were pleased to pay our first ever quarterly dividend in Q3. We also repurchased $1
billion worth of EMC stock in the quarter, and this brings our buyback to $2 billion for the first nine months of the
year, more than halfway to our $3.5 billion share repurchase target for the 18 months ended June 30, 2014. We also
spent approximately $400 million on acquisitions in the quarter, ending Q3 with $17.5 billion in cash and investments,
$8 billion of which is in the U.S., excluding VMware. $1.7 billion of this will be used to settle our remaining
convertible bond in January.
Looking across the federation to get a better understanding of what happened in the quarter, let's begin with the EMC II
business, starting with storage, which grew 1%. While we expected growth in our high-end storage business to
moderate in the second half of this year as we annualized the refreshed VMAX, the disruption to our federal
government business added significantly to this headwind. VMAX continues to present unique value propositions to
customers and added net new customers yet again in Q3. Year-to-date, we've added more new VMAX customers than
for the comparable period last year. The 10-K and 40-K continue to exhibit the strongest results and flash penetration
on new systems continues to climb, reaching 70% in Q3.
Our innovations on VMAX make a difference with customers, such as a large telecom provider in Europe. This
customer was looking to consolidate onto best-of-breed infrastructure for their storage-as-a-service offerings and
selected VMAX to displace two competitors and serve as the platform of choice for their customers. As this example
illustrates, the reasons for selecting VMAX are as compelling as they've ever been: scaling mission-critical workloads
with the best reliability and availability, VMAX meets requirements that other offerings cannot.
Our unified and backup recovery portfolio grew 3% in Q3, impacted by the fact that the significant majority of this
quarter's higher than expected unshipped orders were in this business. Our unified storage business benefited from the
very successful global launch in September of our next-generation VNX. The press, industry analysts and most
importantly, our customers and partners, received the new VNX with enthusiasm. This was evidenced by their rapid
transition to the new systems, where almost 35% of the new VNX orders in September were for the next-generation
VNX and by the end of the quarter, this mix had reached about 50%.

This rapid uptake is not surprising, as the new VNX represents a breakthrough in unified storage, delivering over four
times the performance of its predecessor across file, database and virtualization workloads. Key to this breakthrough is
the new MCX software, which enables the VNX controller to take full advantage of Intel multi-core processing power.
By uniformly distributing data services across all cores, customers avoid the controller bottlenecks that can hamper the
performance of other mid-tier systems. This is especially important for maximizing the potential of flash in the array
and the new VNX is optimized for flash, which is clearly important, as approximately two-thirds of the NextGen VNXs
sold in the quarter included flash drives. This is a significantly higher rate than the previous VNX family.
Our Backup and Recovery Systems business did quite well in Q3 despite a higher than expected level of unshipped
Data Domain orders exiting the period. BRS growth was driven by our Data Protection Suite, together with our recently
refreshed line of mid-tier Data Domain products, which accounted for approximately 75% of mid-tier Data Domain
orders in the last week of the quarter.
EMC is the world's largest data protection company and we believe we continued to gain share because we have the
broadest best-of-breed portfolio of products. The new Data Domain systems are four times faster, 10 times more
scalable and almost 40% lower cost than the prior generation, enabling customers to consolidate all backup and archive
data onto a single protection storage platform.
This is why one New Jersey-based health insurer looked beyond their longtime backup software vendor to EMC in Q3.
The incumbent could not scale to complete backups for their virtual machines within the scheduled backup window.
EMC Data Protection Suite, combined with Data Domain, not only got the job done during the backup window, but did
so with an integrated solution that lowered the customers' total cost of ownership.
Our Emerging Storage business grew 66% in Q3, demonstrating how EMC is innovating in ways that enable customers
to quickly and easily drive value as they build out their cloud and big data environments. Within Emerging Storage,
Isilon continued its strong growth in Q3 and added a record number of new customers in the quarter. Isilon continues to
expand in its established verticals as well as in broader enterprise use cases that are beginning to leverage scale-out
NAS architectures. For example, demand in healthcare and financials grew well over 50% year-on-year in Q3 for
Isilon.
Also of note in Q3, Isilon saw triple-digit growth in big data analytics, mostly for enterprise Hadoop implementations
where Isilon's scale-out architecture is a natural fit. Several of these wins were achieved by teaming with Pivotal, an
early sign of the power of our federated model. For example, a large mobile service provider in Southeast Asia was
looking to capitalize on its customer usage demographics. The majority of this data was unstructured, but needed to be
analyzed alongside CRM and back-office data. This drove the customer to seek infrastructure that could offer both
performance for Hadoop analytics as well as enterprise grade data services. With Pivotal for the analytics and Isilon for
the storage, the customer will now be able to create an enhanced personalized experience across their mobile services.
As this example illustrates, Isilon's enterprise features are a growth driver and we will be adding more enterprise class
features with our next generation of OneFS, which is on track for release this quarter.
Atmos also contributed to growth in the Emerging Storage Group in Q3. Atmos is an object storage system that is
being increasingly used by large web scale providers and next-generation application developers for its simple scalable
globally distributed architecture. In fact, it was with a web scale customer that Atmos won its largest deal ever,
shipping almost half an exabyte for this single customer so far this year. In Atmos, EMC offers one of the few
commercially available object storage systems and we believe our share in this market far exceeds our block and file
market share.
In 2014 our next generation Atmos systems will come to market as part of Project Nile which we discussed in some
detail at our September launch events.
Revenue from VPLEX continued to grow at well over 50% year-on-year as it has done for the last several quarters. The
global nature of businesses today and their drive to maximize system utilization are increasingly dictating a need for
continuous operations around the world. This is exactly what VPLEX, often in combination with RecoverPoint,
delivers. Using this combination, businesses can now run mission-critical applications in truly active, active data center

configurations enabling better utilization of their information infrastructures.
Our Storage business continues to benefit from our differentiated strategy leveraging flash technology across the entire
storage infrastructure. Flash has a significant role to play in our hybrid storage systems, which are increasingly
optimized to take advantage of flash. For many workloads, hybrid arrays offer rich data services, low latencies and the
most economical price points. Our recently announced next generation VNX is an outstanding example of this.
However, some workloads require sustained low latency regardless of whether the array is idle, busy, empty or full.
This is the domain of all flash arrays and the reason why last year we acquired XtremIO. XtremIO is architected in a
fundamentally different way than both hybrid arrays and any other all-flash array.
These differences include true multi-controller scale architecture delivering consistent and predictable performance for
any workload with any level of array utilization over any period of time, deduplication that is always on and always in
line, metadata that's always stored in memory to minimize rights and allow near instantaneous cloning of virtual
machines and flash optimized data protection, which is both faster and dramatically more efficient than traditional
arrays.
I want to be clear that XtremIO is the only all-flash array architecture with all these in mind and this represents a key
advantage for EMC and our customers. XtremIO will GA this quarter and we're confident it will be very successful.
My review over the last few minutes of EMC storage offerings illustrates the broad spectrum of technology required to
run a set of highly diverse workloads. It also speaks to the complexity of the underlying storage infrastructure and this
is why we're so excited about ViPR, which GA'd last month.
EMC ViPR delivers software-defined storage and consists of two distinct components: the ViPR controller and the
ViPR data services. The ViPR controller reduces complexity in today's storage environment by abstracting and
standardizing the management of EMC and non-EMC arrays. Because of this, the storage infrastructure can be highly
automated and accessed through a self-service portal enabling IT departments to offer simple, public cloud-like
experience for application owners.
ViPR data services provide new storage functionality in software on top of existing EMC arrays, non-EMC arrays and
early next year, commodity storage. Initially, ViPR provides a new object storage software implementation supporting
both Atmos and Amazon S3 interfaces.
We believe large web scale content depots and next-generation application developers will increasingly rely upon
object storage because of its simplicity, cost and globally distributed nature. Object storage will also play a major role
underneath big data analytics systems based upon Hadoop and for this reason we will be adding HTFS access to the
ViPR object storage later this year.
Turning now to security, our RSA Security division grew 11% in Q3 benefiting from year-on-year revenue expansion
in both major lines of business. Within our Identity and Data Protection business, secure IT returned to growth.
Revenue growth accelerated for our Security Management Compliance business with growth coming from both Archer
and our Security Analytics Suite. As customers begin to allocate more of their security budgets beyond static
prevention and toward intelligence driven security based on context and analytics, RSA is well positioned to meet these
needs.
Revenue from our Information Intelligence business declined in Q3 as a number of deals were pushed out of the
quarter. When budgets are tight, spending on business process improvements and collaboration become less of a
priority. We did see continued progress in the quarter with our Vertical Solution Sets, Energy Plants and Facility
Management and Life Sciences in particular.
We also continue to see momentum for the Syncplicity Sink & Share [indiscernible] (21:12) business. We acquired
Syncplicity about a year ago as a very early stage company and we're seeing dramatic growth from customers large and
small. Syncplicity was recently cited as the leader in the Forrester Wave and was recognized as one of the top 10 most
secure apps in the cloud by Netskope.

VMware's revenue growth accelerated again in Q3 as customers transform to mobile cloud era of computing.
Customers' uptake of non-standalone vSphere solutions expanded with over 40% of VMware's license bookings in the
quarter coming from areas beyond standalone vSphere. Knife and Automation license bookings were once again
VMware's strongest growing product category in Q3.
VMware is laser-focused on delivering unique customer value in three strategic growth areas; the software-defined data
center, hybrid cloud and end-user computing. In Q3 VMware announced three new and key technologies; vCloud
hybrid service, virtual SAN storage and the NSX network virtualization platform. It also announced an entire refresh of
its industry-leading vCloud Suite and announced a new desktop-as-a-service offering using the technology from the
Desktone acquisition. Record attendance at VMworld in August in San Francisco and in Barcelona last week of more
than 30,000 people combined speaks to the broad and growing appeal VMware offers to customers wanting to
transform their environments for the mobile cloud era of computing.
Pivotal, our new company, continued to make significant progress in Q3 towards its goal of building a new application
development platform comprising next-generation data fabrics, application fabrics and a cloud independent
platform-as-a-service. Pivotal's recent acquisition of Xtreme Labs adds an important dimension to its efforts as Xtreme
Labs advances in mobile application developments are highly complementary to the expertise of Pivotal Labs, the agile
development services unit within Pivotal. Xtreme Labs' list of clients is impressive including several newer web scale
companies as well as organizations like Deutsche Telekom, Viacom and the NFL.
Enterprise customers are seeking a data-centric and modern development platform on which to build their
next-generation applications for both web and mobile. Pivotal's first version of its platform, Pivotal 1, is on track for
availability before year-end. Pivotal's leading efforts in this space are capturing the interest of many. Their inaugural
Cloud Foundry conference last month was sold out an attracted five times the number of attendees it had targeted.
Additionally large household organizations including GE and IBM are lining up to collaborate or co-innovate on the
open-source Cloud Foundry project.
As we look across our federation of businesses we see a number of benefits to our model. First and foremost this model
is best for customers. It offers our customers horizontal solutions and more choice than they get from others to prepare
them for the third platform of IT. Second, this approach fosters excellence. It leaves each business free to focus and
build the products, go to market capabilities and ecosystems necessary to win. Finally, with all three businesses
together within one federation, interests across them are aligned. As part of a single entity our businesses share a vision
to leverage cloud, big data and trusted IT to maximize control, efficiency and choice.
Since 2009 we've been promoting the many virtues of cloud infrastructures and because of this long-standing
conviction, today we offer some of the industry's leading technology to support cloud deployments. Over the last
several years we've also been developing innovative go to market models that optimize the delivery of these
technologies and accommodate a variety of customer preferences. These initiatives are proving to be very successful.
Let's start with converged infrastructure and VCE. Demand for Vblocks in the period grew well over 50% and at a
higher rate than in Q2, outpacing the market for converged infrastructure which is one of the fastest-growing areas in
IT. Customers seeking speed to deployment, ease of operations and reduced complexity turn to Vblocks. This was
validated by a recent report from IDC which indicated that compared with [indiscernible] (25:39) components, VCE
customers realize five times faster deployment of new services and a 96% reduction in downtime while shrinking
annual data center costs by up to 50%.
VCE is setting the pace in terms of technology leadership as well. This quarter the company launched two new Vblock
specialized systems targeted at high performance database and virtual desktop environments as well as new Vblocks
incorporating our new VNX platform.
There is another large segment of customers who value simplicity, agility and speed to deployment and offer choice
provided by reference architectures instead. This was evidenced by the continued strong growth of VSPEX. We
expanded our base of installed VSPEX by over 45% in Q3 bringing the total number to more than 5,200. This is
excellent progress for a solution that's only been in the market for a year and a half. Partners love it because it offers

them another way to add value and customers love it because it's easy to purchase, deploy and operate.
Finally, a growing number of customers are opting for off-premise solutions to augment their current IT investments.
For more than a year now, service providers have been our fastest growing vertical market segments and this trend
continued in Q3 as revenues from this program were up well over 50% year-on-year.
This rapid growth comes from the expansion of the program to include new partners as well as from existing partners
as early partnerships continue to gain traction. A great example is our alliance with Atos, which we first announced
early last year. This alliance structured around their Canopy cloud services company has been so successful that we
recently expanded our partnership. Atos will continue to standardize the majority of their cloud and managed services
hosting platforms on EMC, VMware and VCE technology.
In summary, taking into account the market leading assets within our portfolio built around the mega trends of cloud,
big data and trusted IT as well as the energy and innovation with which we are delivering this technology to our
customers, we are confident that our long-term strategy is the right one.
Turning now to our outlook for the full year, we do not expect to recover the Q3 federal shortfall in Q4 so this flows
through to our outlook for the year. We're also slightly revising our demand outlook for Q4 taking into account recent
reductions in GDP and IT spending forecast for 2013 and the ongoing uncertainty around U.S. federal spending. Of
course we do expect a solid increase in Q4 IT spend relative to Q3.
For the full year we now expect EMC revenue to grow 7% to $23.25 billion, and non-GAAP EPS to grow 6% to $1.80
per share. We continue to expect free cash flow to grow by 10% to $5.5 billion. Our confidence in achieving these
results comes from a number of factors including last quarter's $100 million in higher than expected backlog that we've
already shipped, our increased storage product bookings momentum, a full quarter effect of the new VNX, ViPR and
Data Domain products, the general ability of XtremIO, VMware's continued momentum, and the success of our
ongoing market initiatives, including VCE, VSPEX and our SP partners.
Going forward, we're confident that we'll continue to grow and gain share because we have the right vision and
strategy. We have an enviable market position and portfolio. We have a leadership role in important new technologies
and across the federation, we have the team to make it happen. All of this together puts EMC in a unique position to
help customers and partners transform their businesses and be successful.
With that, I'll turn it over to Joe. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, David, and my welcome and thanks to everyone joining us for today's call.
I have very mixed feelings and emotions about our Q3 results. To be clear and for the record, I'm disappointed that we
missed our Q3 revenue and EPS expectations and I assure you that the EMC management team shares my
disappointment.
On the other hand, I feel extremely good about our strategic position, about our products and service offerings, and
with the way our customers and new prospective customers are giving us permission to play in our target markets in
cloud, big data and trust. We are focused on building a platform for new cloud, big and fast data applications,
delivering on the promise of the software-defined data center for the new cloud era, providing our customers a portfolio
of information storage and protection solutions with unparalleled depth and breadth, and we are focused on ensuring we
deliver trusted IT.
We feel good that we continue to grow faster than most of our larger IT peers. As David said, excluding federal,
demand and bookings growth accelerated across the major parts of our business. In particular, our newer high growth
businesses did extremely well.

Pivotal's big data analytics solution showed strong momentum and growth. Growth also accelerated in VMware and
within RSA Security, our security analytics and our Archer GRC Suite grew over 35% year-on-year. In our VCE joint
venture, year-on-year growth exceeded 50%, an acceleration over Q2. And our Emerging Storage offerings, Isilon,
Atmos, VPLEX and flash, grew over 65%.
Going forward, we will also include our software-defined storage offering, ViPR, and our new all-flash array XtremIO
in this category starting now in Q4. And by the way, Q3 marked the 15th consecutive quarter in which we posted
year-on-year organic revenue growth. I would like to thank my talented colleagues at EMC, VMware and Pivotal
around the world for their hard work and dedication.
David explained our shortfall this quarter, and I would like to give you my perspective on the two factors he discussed.
First was a higher level of storage product backlog than expected. To provide a little color and more detail, on the last
day of the quarter we initially expected to receive approximately $100 million in storage product orders. In actuality,
we received almost three times that amount. We were able to process and ship some but not all of these orders. This
resulted in a backlog that was $100 million greater than planned, and thus the corresponding $100 million Q3 revenue
shortfall.
Clearly, we worked hard to get orders in earlier, and I assure you our sales teams were incented accordingly. But
customer caution and their scrutiny of IT purchases continued, and more orders than expected were released to us on
the last day of the quarter. The good news is that in total, we did get the storage product orders we expected in Q3, with
the notable exception of those from the U.S. federal government.
Moving on to our U.S. federal business, I would like to point out that the vast majority, approximately 70%, of our
federal storage product revenues are transactional in nature, which means they are booked, built, shipped and billed
within a quarter. In other words, our federal business is mainly project-based and transactional in nature, as opposed to
being more multi-year program based. And with the government dealing with the budget impacts from the sequester
and the effects of the pending shutdown, these types of transactional orders were the ones most negatively impacted in
Q3. To put a number around this impact, our U.S. federal storage product business was down over 40% year-on-year in
Q3.
By the way, normally, because of the federal September 30 fiscal year end, Q3 represents several times the order
volume of any other quarter. The good news is that the demand for these storage infrastructure products did not go
away, nor was it lost to another IT vendor, but because of uncertainty around the federal government funding this new
fiscal year, it is unclear when the spending demand will result in actual orders to us.
As we look forward, we now believe that overall IT spending growth for 2013 will come in a little below 3%, with a
solid increase in IT demand in Q4 versus Q3. Against this backdrop, we expect consolidated EMC to grow at 7% – 5%
excluding VMware this year, which would put us in good stead relative to many of our large cap IT competitors.
Thank you for joining us, and I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just want to clarify a couple of points. David, first of all on the – sequentially
in the fourth quarter if I take VMware out of it your guidance for 25% sequential growth which I think is the strongest
sequential growth you will have seen in a decade ex-the VMware business. And just to be clear, is that just all because
of the orders that have been pushed out from Q3 to Q4 and you're not really assuming anything much in the end
environment with your customers to actually improve? That's one question.
The second question I have is kind of linked to it. The gross margin relative weakness versus expectation this year has
meant that the information storage segment of your business isn't expanding gross margins anymore. Has that story
about your ability to both increase share and expand gross margin there largely played out now and you can't do both?
How can you convince us that something more structural whether it's cloud related or otherwise isn't pressurizing that
business maybe more than you would've thought six or nine months ago? Many thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: All right, Kulbinder. Thank you. I think that quantifies as two questions but I'll take both of
them. So the first one, Q4, yes, you're right to point out that obviously from a reported point of view that's going to be a
fairly increased sequential growth rate. There are a few factors that come into account. First of all, we are giving you
our best estimates of Q4 and as you know from our full-year guidance because we will benefit from the $100 million of
backlog coming out from Q3 we've essentially taken a little bit off the top of the prior Q4 guidance reflecting a slightly
weaker economy that we're seeing.
The important thing is the factors that impacted us in Q3 do not impact us in Q4. Specifically in Q4 the federal
government business is a very low percentage of our total bookings, unlike Q3, and also the backlog factor is less, in
fact it's almost a non-issue in Q4 because we carry larger backlogs out of Q4 just because of the nature of the size of
Q4. We don't optimize our factories to try and ship all of the Q4 backlog.
So if you normalize Q3 for the factors that it did impact us in Q3 – i.e. the backlog and if you normalize for what would
be a more normal federal performance, the seasonal progression from Q3 to Q4 is much more in line with seasonal
norms and of course we're still expecting a strong budget cycle in Q4 with IT spending seasonally ahead of Q3 and then
we also mentioned that we are expecting to see a continued strong storage product bookings to support that number.
We talked about the fact that we have seen our storage product bookings growth rate accelerate in Q3 and then in Q4
on top of that benefit of the run rate we have coming out of Q3. We've got the additional benefits of things like a full
quarter of the new VNX, a full quarter of the new DD and the first quarter of shipping XtremIO. So those are all the
factors that come into the Q4 numbers.
In terms of gross margin, obviously the gross margins were most impacted by the shortfall in storage product revenues
this quarter. As we mentioned, 220 of the overall 250 miss were directly related to storage product revenues that of
course carry a very high incremental gross margin because all our fixed costs are already covered and the impact of
$220 million less of storage product revenue on our entire income statement is fairly meaningful.
So if you normalize, I understand that's a normalization calculation, but if you normalize our gross margins for storage,
for EMC infrastructure, for consolidated – for the $220 million we'd be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, roughly flat
year-on-year and the operating margins in fact would be up in both cases.
So we don't think there's anything structural happening to our business. We're still very pleased about the potential for
continued expansion in the gross margin and the operating margin in storage as we go forward.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Kulbinder. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. Obviously there's nothing you can do about the weakness in the Fed and I
didn't actually realize 70% of your business was transactional in nature there, so that's an interesting statistic. Thanks.
But with respect to the inventory situation if you look at $1.4 billion up both sequential and year-over-year, can you
talk about how that jives with the fact that you did have a lot of orders coming in at the end? Would anticipate you guys
could probably pre-build a lot of those orders in prep for a pretty big back-end loaded quarter and orders coming in on
the last day? So can you talk about how you can pre-build and if that was the case and you shipped a couple hundred
million the last day of the quarter, why inventories went up as well? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, Brian, let me take that as well. Yes, obviously we were able to ship a large number of
the orders we got on the last day, but as we explained, not all of them and we had planned inventories for essentially
$100 million less backlog and we planned to have the inventory for the federal orders that didn't come in. So those
directly impact our inventory.
We also, of course, were playing around with some product transitions both on the VNX and on the Data Domain side
so we were covering our position a little bit on product transition. We didn't have any issues with product shortages,
which is good, because we were able to plan around those transitions.
So the manufacturing inventory and the situation kind of tied directly to how we saw the quarter end play out and then
the final piece of the overall inventory picture is we had a little bit of a buildup in engineering or R&D inventory in
support of some of the new products that are in the pipeline.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Brian. Evan, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Next we have Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Yes. A clarification and a question. On the clarification, what was the VNX and Data Domain
growth rates during the quarter? And the question I have is on the high-end you declined 8% year-to-year following
growth of rates of 10% and 5% for the prior 2 quarters. What do you think is going on in the high-end? Is it just a
secular shift away from the high-end to the midrange or was it impacted mostly by the federal? And what do you think
the high-end growth rate should be secularly going forward?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Shebly, let me take that one as well. The biggest impact compared to our expectations in the
high-end this quarter was the reduction or the lack of federal orders and that had a direct impact upon the high-end
growth rate. A little bit of the backlog or the orders that we didn't ship was in the high-end but the biggest factor was
the federal, which is why it was below our expectations for the quarter.
You can see that obviously the high-end is very much a function or very much impacted by product cycles. To your
earlier point we had a very strong first-half in the high-end as we were still in the first year of the product cycle. Q3
was the first year we had a kind of lapping or an annualization of the new VMAX so we expected some softness in the
second half relative to the first half.
We still think that the opportunity there for the high-end to grow in the range that we talked about at the forum which is
in that 1% to 3% range and nothing we've seen recently would change our viewpoint on that.
And then relative to the first part of your question, you asked about the growth rates of VNX and DD, and the growth
rate in VNX picked up during the quarter with the transition into the new product. The growth rate in DD remained
strong and both of those were impacted by the additional orders we couldn't ship.

To the prior question, we can do much more pre-building of the Symmetrix orders than we can pre-rebuilding of
mid-tier orders. They tend to come in with less defined configurations, mainly through the channel partners so the
majority of the buildup of the unshipped inventory, the majority of $100 million impacted the VNX and mid-tier bucket
and absent that we'd have been very pleased with the growth rate.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Shebly. Next question, please.

Next you have Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks. Last night VMware gave some color about 2014 outlook. I know it's a bit early and you
tend to do that mostly in your January conference call but, Joe, is there any chance you can give us some of your initial
thoughts about how – what's the framework we should think about from a macro standpoint, storage spending or some
of the opportunities and risks that you see in that timeframe?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I hate to tell you what everybody knows but obviously the federal government, we kicked the
can down the road to January and early February, and I think a lot is going to depend and I can tell you, in traveling
around the world, matter of fact as I finish this call I'm heading on a plane to go to China, as I head around the world I
can tell you that all eyes are on the U.S. So if you can answer that question for me I'll give you my best guess.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Very good.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Ittai. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Just a question on the bookings acceleration that you saw in the quarter, David, up high
single digits I think you said. If you can talk about how the bookings linearity compares to what you normally see in
the third quarter and whether the acceleration is more a function of easy comparisons from last year which Q3 was
weak or whether you're really calling for more of an inflection point in storage demand? And if the latter, what's
changed that's driving the acceleration?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yeah, sure, Brian. Obviously a number of parts to that question. Relative to the acceleration,
as I mentioned, the good news was that again we had to take federal out of the picture because that was the kind of one
area where we did not meet our expectations from a bookings point of view but if you exclude federal and you look at
the storage product bookings, we saw the highest growth rate we saw during the quarter in both the Americas, EMEA
and in APJ so we felt strong about that. Obviously a little bit of that was against a compare but to see that pick up in all
three theaters we saw as a very encouraging sign.
Relative to the calendarization, it was a back-end loaded quarter, as we mentioned, similar in total in terms of the
calendarization to what we saw in Q1 and Q2 of this year obviously with it being a Monday as opposed to a Sunday
close in the prior couple quarters we planned to kind of get more of the orders in the final week and less on the last
Monday. Obviously the numbers of orders we got on the last Monday were more than we expected but were probably
less than we would've got in on if you like a Thursday or Friday of the prior quarters.
So those are the factors. In terms of the overall pick up, I think what we're seeing, a lot is the strength of our portfolio.
Obviously we are doing well, we think, relative to the market in all the sectors that we play in. We talked about what
was impacting the high-end. We feel good about our transition in mid-tier but you've also got to look at how really
exceptional growth we're getting in that new Emerging Storage bucket. 66% is I think higher than anybody else out
there. Also bear in mind that's now a fairly large chunk of revenue, close to $400 million in the quarter growing at 66%.

And the fact we have a breadth of portfolio is enabling us to go to customers and talk to them about all the different
workloads in their business and say we have a portfolio that can actually handle all of them, including your second
platform apps and your third platform apps, and that story really resonates well with enterprises, it resonates well with

Next we have Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Going back to the back-end loaded linearity in the
quarter and for that matter the last three quarters, can you talk a little about the initiatives that you're putting in place or
more recently have put in place to try and diminish that back-end loaded quarters which has clearly been an impact on
the margin trajectory particularly in the storage business?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yeah, so, Aaron, there are always things that we can do to improve that linearity and we are
all over it and specifically I and my team are working this very aggressively. We are going to be facing midweek
quarters for a few quarters going forward now. Less of an issue obviously for Q4 because of what I mentioned in terms
of our backlog that we carry but will be something we're going to look at going into 2014 and the way we're going to
address that is a number of different areas one of which is really spending a lot more time with our customers to explain
the mutual benefit of getting orders in just a few days before the end of the quarter as opposed to on the very last day,
but we're all over it and we'll continue to work the opportunity.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Aaron. Next question, please.
Operator
Next in queue we have Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Sort of in line with that, how should we think about working capital in light of the
economy and the product launches? Because if you've had very back-end loaded quarters, specifically, what can you do
on the working capital side in this environment? Should we actually think about a new normal in the various metrics of
the cash conversion because of the environment we're in? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Maynard, obviously there are a number of things going to working capital. The biggest one is
our cash conversion cycle and our collections were really very strong this quarter. We collected over $6 billion and you
can see that reflected in our DSO's down to 49 days. So that's the biggest thing we can do for our cash conversion
cycle. There will continue to be some pressure on inventories as we manage through the quarter and we manage
through the transitions, but as I said, we are looking at those opportunities as well. We continue to optimize in terms of
how we're building out the factory processes. We continue to optimize our engineering labs in terms of shared service
and things like that. So we have continual programs that we're driving very aggressively in the business to optimize the
working capital cycle but, again, I'll come back to my first point, collection is the biggest factor.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: I'm just wondering, though, if you changed any of your target metrics or metrics within DSO
or turns or things like that, just given the environment and how we should think about that?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Specifically, no. We still are targeting DSOs around that 50 day level, obviously some
quarters a little bit higher, some quarters a bit lower. We're still targeting our inventory turns in the six to seven range
and again, we have a lot of programs in place to make sure we can achieve those. There are also things we can do to
optimize in the factory despite the back-end loaded quarter, and there are some things we can still do to optimize the
amount of inventory we keep in our development labs.

Next in queue we have Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. David, for you please. You're ending the year, based on your 2013 outlook,
with operating income about 25%, which is up about 10 basis points year-over-year – a little bit more than 10 basis
points. Can you provide some perspective on how we should be thinking about that number in particular as we're
looking at 2014?
And then just a clarification. Could you also just tell us how much federal government was as a percent of revenues for
the September quarter? It just seems like a pretty material shortfall. I'm just wondering what it was September quarter?
Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure, Keith. Let me handle both of those. So, relative to your second question, and obviously
the impact of the federal government was most prevalent in storage product bookings. So let me put it in that context,
because obviously we do other things with the federal government, including VMware and there's some services lines
in there as well. But for the whole year, if I look at the federal government, it represents less than 5% of our storage
product bookings, but as Joe said, Q3 represents a multiple of any other quarter during the year. So obviously, it
represents a fair amount over the 5% in a Q3, and a fair amount below the 5% in any other quarter, which is where you
get the impact you saw in Q3.
Relative to your question on the income statement, you're right. We're now projecting to have operating margin
improvement in 2013 of about 10 basis points. Obviously that's directly impacted by less storage product revenue than
we were calling a quarter ago and as I mentioned, it has a high incremental gross margin, which is why you see the
margin profile coming down from 25.5 points to 25 points.
Within that margin picture for the year, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat, again impacted by the fact that we
don't have that 220 plus -ish of storage product revenue. We expect to pick up most of our leverage this year from the
operating margin line. Going forward next year, we think there's opportunity for improvements in both lines.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Keith. Next question, please.
Operator
Next in queue we have Alex Kurtz with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. David, just thinking about Q4 again and the increase in the
sequential growth rate. Q4, from what I can understand, is always a very back-end loaded quarter, so I was just
wondering how you discounted that into your guidance here, knowing what just happened in Q3 and maybe how you
think about that across different geos? Maybe it's going to be less pronounced in the U.S. for whatever reason and you
feel more confident about hitting that sequential growth rate. But just any more color on the back-end loaded nature and
sort of how you bake that into your guidance?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yeah, sure, Alex. Again, when we look at Q4, fundamentally we haven't changed it very
much at all from what we were calling last time has been a very minor change but fundamentally, let's say there's no
material change. And then to put that into context of what happened in Q3, let me just remind you, the factors that
impacted us in Q3 are not a factor in Q4. Let me just explain why.
So we just explained on the last question, thank you Keith for the question, that the U.S. federal government is actually
a very small part of our Q4 expectations. As Joe said, we're not factoring any budget flush at the end of the year, or any

significant revival into our Q4 expectations from what didn't happen in Q3, but there's always some potential. Right
now, nobody knows what's going on down in Washington relative to federal government spend.
The other fact that impacted us in Q3 relative to our expectations was the backlog coming out of Q3. As I mentioned,
that's not a factor in Q4 either because we carry higher backlogs going out of Q4 so even if Q4 became more back-end
loaded than we expected from an order point of view, that wouldn't impact us.
So basically things that impacted us in Q3 are not impacting us in Q4 and the reason why we feel confident about our
Q4 guidance is when we look at the opportunity out there, we kind of look at what the sales teams are forecasting, the
amount of pipeline we're looking at, we look at the new product cycle. Fundamentally, we're saying we're broadly on
track for Q4 as we expected and the factors that hurt us in Q3 aren't a material factor.
We have, as I mentioned in my comments, brought the Q4 guidance down by little bit excluding the backlog and it's
really related to the macro. If you look at the June/July quarter for example, consensus economic forecasts for U.S.
GDP growth were 1.9%. Now they're about 1.6% and that's having a bit of an impact upon IT spending forecasts.
Because of that, we've taken a little bit of our expectations out of the Q4 budget flush. But having said that, we're still
expecting a strong budget cycle in Q4 and we're expecting IT spending to be seasonally ahead of Q3.
So hopefully that gives you a feel, Alex, and those are the factors that go into it.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: That helps. Thanks, David.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Alex. We have time for one more question, and then we'll have some
concluding comments from Joe.

Our final question today comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. Joe, you mentioned you're actually getting on a plane, I guess tomorrow, and
heading over to China. Maybe if you could comment on how you all are doing out there? Some other companies it
seems like might've been impacted for a number of reasons and I believe your China business is actually smaller. Is it
growing well and then if you could also comment on the possible, I guess, pull back from the government on U.S. IT
companies because of security issues, that would be helpful.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Yeah, we don't break out China separately, but we are growing nicely in China, and as David
said in our BRIC+13, which is basically our emerging markets group of companies that we track, and it's a little bit
more than 13 companies. We just started that kind of acronym a while back. You know, we grew 19% year-on-year in
Q3. So we're doing quite nicely and China is doing well for us.
The – you asked to comment about the security aspects facing China, and there's nothing really to add that you don't
know. I mean obviously there's concerns both ways and I think rational people are having discussions and we've got to
continue. It's an opportunity for us in our security business and it's not something I want to specifically comment on.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Thank you.

With that, I want to again thank everybody for being with us today. We really do appreciate it. I want to emphasize that
we are definitely disappointed that our revenue and non-GAAP EPS didn't meet our expectations. That said, as you can
detect from our comments, we are very excited about our future as evidenced by the fact that excluding federal our
bookings rate in Q3 accelerated across EMC, Pivotal, VMware, and gave us, we believe, proof that our strategic focus
