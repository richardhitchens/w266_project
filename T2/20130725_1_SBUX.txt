With that, let me turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn and welcome to everyone on today's call. I am very pleased to share with you the extraordinary third
quarter results that Starbucks reported today. Starbucks global comparable store sales grew 8% in Q3; 9% in each of
our Americas and China/Asia Pacific segments, driven by a 7% increase in traffic and representing Starbucks 14th
consecutive quarter of comp growth in excess of 5%. Our revenue in Q3 increased a full 13% over last year to a record
$3.7 billion.
Operating leverage and our continuing emphasis on increasing efficiency and controlling costs drove our operating
margin up 150 basis points to a record – Q3 record of 16.4% and an operating income of up 25% to a Q3 record of
$615 million. Together, these factors contribute to a record Q3 EPS of $0.55 per share, 28% over last year's third
quarter, and the second highest EPS of any quarter in Starbucks' 42-year history. Particularly noteworthy, are that these
results were delivered in the face of challenging economic and consumer environments in many of the 62 countries
around the world in which we operate.
At our December 2010 Investor Day Conference, I laid out a strategic vision that contemplated Starbucks leveraging all
of our unique assets, our robust and growing pipeline of innovation, what has grown into over 19,000 store global
footprint, our fast growing CPG presence and our best-in-class digital, card, loyalty and mobile capabilities to create a
flywheel effect whereby each asset would leverage and enhance our brands and customer experience, elevating the
relevancy of all things Starbucks and driving increased profitability.
I left the conference recognizing that this would have to be executed in a way that would be fully appreciated after the
conference. The results we announced today demonstrate the success of both our vision and our strategy for achieving
it. Continued innovation in our core coffee and beverage portfolios, solid progress against the reinvention of our food
platform and an increasing ability to leverage and translate Starbucks brands and strong U.S. revenue growth into
revenue and profit growth in multiple markets and channels around the globe, all contributed meaningfully to our
record Q3 results.
No single Q3 metric exemplifies the success of our strategy more than our 7% increase in global traffic. For the first
time in our history, we are bringing customers into our stores all around the world and across all day parts, with
complete offerings of innovative beverages and both indulgent and healthy foods to satisfy their evolving need states.
Today, Starbucks global retail footprint, complimentary channels of distribution and unique and powerful digital assets
puts us in a class by ourselves, and we are just getting started with further integration and expansion of our flywheel
and the introduction of disruptive and transformative food and beverage industry innovations and technologies around
the world in the months and quarters ahead.
I'm going to provide a high-level overview of segment performance in Q3 and then turn the call over to Adam
Brotman, our Chief Digital Officer, who will discuss our world-class digital and loyalty assets and share of what is
about to come in terms of digital, then Troy will take you through our Q3 financials and fiscal 2014 targets in detail,
and we'll close with Q&A.
Let me begin with the Americas. Starbucks American segment is firing on all cylinders, with 9% comp growth driven
by continued beverage innovation and increased food attachment, resulting from the success of our transformed and
reinvented food program. Our strong summer refreshment line-up, including the new Valencia Orange Refresher and
the limited time offering of Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino is being extremely well received by our customers
and exceeding even our most optimistic expectations.

In Q3, we significantly expanded our La Boulange baked goods platform, truly delicious and differentiated La
Boulange branded products are now available in over 1,000 Starbucks stores across Northern California and the Pacific
Northwest. When you try La Boulange, you will understand why we're seeing both an enthusiastic customer response
and substantial lift in incrementally compared to the baked goods that La Boulange is replacing. And we are now on
track to bring La Boulange food to more than 2,500 of our stores by the end of September, including stores in New
York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.
We are also deep into the strategic development and integration of Teavana. Tea, as we've shared with you before, is a
$40 billion global category, and we're leveraging all of our unique internal assets, including our knowledge in creating
best-in-class retail experiences and handcrafted beverages to create a premium tea experience for our customers just as
we've done for coffee.
You will see all of these strengths come together this fall as we open our first re-imagined Teavana street front store on
New York City's Upper East Side and evolve the Tazo tea concept store in Seattle under the Teavana brand. Over time,
many unique handcrafted Teavana tea beverages will also find their way in Starbucks stores.
Turning to EMEA, I'm very pleased to share renewed optimism that we are on our way to delivering sustained
profitable growth in our EMEA region. Our EMEA team is bringing market-specific food and beverage innovation
across the region and working hard to enhance our customer experience in each of our nearly 2,000 EMEA stores.
While early, we feel the results are beginning to show. The 2% comp store sales increase that EMEA posted in Q3 was
the segment's first comp store increase in six quarters. In the UK, the largest individual market within our EMEA
segment also reported positive comps in Q3.
Turning to China and Asia Pacific regions; our China/Asia Pacific region continues to be at the very forefront of
Starbucks global expansion initiatives, and we are now on plan to surpass 4,000 stores in the region by the end of 2013.
Noteworthy are that our strong 9% increase in China/Asia Pacific comp store sales in Q3 included 8% traffic growth, a
doubling of our Q2 traffic growth, and that increased operating leverage enabled China/Asia Pacific to deliver some of
the highest margins in the company.
We will also open our 1,000th store in China by year-end, and remain on track for China to become Starbucks' largest
market outside the U.S. in 2014. We continue to invest ahead of the growth curve, to build out our in-market
operational and management capability in China, and to successfully execute against the plan calling for strong comp
growth and further margin expansion well into the future.
Moving to channel development and emerging brands. Channel development and emerging brands will be a significant
contributor to our future growth as we expand to – as we continue to expand customer occasions outside Starbucks
stores, leveraging our flywheel strategy. I'll touch on just a few particularly noteworthy developments and
opportunities. We continue to strengthen our leadership position in the $8 billion premium single cup category, a
segment that has grown nine times faster than the overall coffee category during the past year and now accounts for
nearly 30% of total coffee sales in grocery. In May, we announced an extension of our long-term strategic partnership
with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters that will enable Starbucks to add many more K-Cup skews and gain additional
share in the U.S. and abroad. And in Q3, we shipped our one billionth K-Cup, a significant milestone in the 20 months
since we had our first shipment.
While packaged coffee competition down the grocery remains fierce, the price decrease we took in the third quarter has
allowed us to be more competitively positioned in our CPG coffee portfolio, and we believe the price decrease
positions us to build share and maintain our leadership position in the months and quarters ahead.
Finally, on Tuesday, we announced a very exciting new agreement with Danone, a world leader in fresh dairy products.
For the past several years, we've been committed to evolving and enhancing our customer experience through the
introduction of innovative wholesome and healthy products in our stores. Our new multi-year relationship with Danone
will enable us to leverage our acquisition of Evolution Fresh business and brand, elevating our existing yogurt offerings
and bring out our health and wellness strategy to life, not only in Starbucks stores, but also down the grocery aisle,
leveraging the Evolution Fresh brand name on multiple product categories, including the initial acquisition of the juice

business.
Our evolving portfolio will include the exclusively formulated Evolution Fresh inspired by Danone ready-to-eat Greek
yogurt in our retail stores and Evolution Fresh branded CPG products co-created by Starbucks and Danone. These
products will begin rolling out to Starbucks stores in North America in the spring of 2014, reach grocery channels in
2015, and reach global distribution over time.
In conclusion, Starbucks coffee company today exists within a universe of one, and our Q3 results demonstrate the
increasing relevance and power of our brands, the strength of our management and operations around the world, the
success of our multiple go-to-market strategies, and our increasingly deeper connection to a fast-growing, global
customer base. But our values in the one-on-one direct emotional engagement we have with our customers and our
Starbucks partners around the world remains at the core of our business and our brand.
And because the level of innovation and expertise that we're bringing to our already best-in-class digital and loyalty
capabilities has never been greater and dwarfs the capabilities of any competitor, I've invited Adam Brotman to join us
on this call to discuss his team's contribution to the flywheel strategy and how we are leveraging our success in the U.S.
to create a truly global, unified, comprehensive digital loyalty platform.
Before I hand it over to Adam, I just want to take a moment to recognize the world-class Starbucks leadership team, the
strongest group of leaders this company has ever had that has made the results we reported today possible. And of
course we could have never delivered our remarkable Q3 results or the 13 consecutive quarters of record results before
without the daily contribution of over 200,000 Starbucks partners around the world, who wear the green apron and
deliver the unique Starbucks experience to nearly 70 million customers at over 19,000 stores in 62 countries around the
world each week.
On behalf of the entire leadership team, I thank you for all you do every day. Adam?
Adam B. Brotman
Thanks, Howard. As Howard said, there are a number of factors that contributed to the strength of our U.S. business in
Q3. From a digital perspective, we spent the past several years building an engine of digital touch-points with our
customers that not only allows us a deeper relationship with our customers, but also pays off with incrementality for
our business.
Let me talk for a moment about the growth we are seeing in a variety of key digital, card, loyalty and mobile programs.
In our third quarter, we saw 30% year-over-year growth in total dollars, loaded on Starbucks cards in retail North
America and nearly 100% year-over-year growth in dollars loaded on our cards via Starbucks mobile apps and web
properties and the Starbucks Card continues to represent nearly one-third of all U.S. in-store transactions.
We also saw over 30% year-over-year growth in total dollars spent in our stores from My Starbucks Rewards, or MSR,
loyalty members in the U.S. And this momentum in loyalty is not just in volume. We have also expanded integration
between MSR in our CPG channel, as well as with our Teavana stores.
Regarding mobile, our momentum as the leading retailer in the mobile payment space also continued its rapid growth
in Q3. I'm pleased to report that now more than 10% of all transactions in our U.S. stores are made with a phone.
Mobile devices have become an increasingly important part of the customer experience at Starbucks, as the fastest and
easiest way to pay in our stores, and we will continue to bring more innovation to this space.
As we've been building capabilities and customer enrollment in our card, loyalty and mobile initiatives, we haven't
taken our foot off the pedal at all when it comes to Starbucks presence on the web and social media. We continue to see
huge traffic to our Wi-Fi network and our web pages, and earlier this month, we passed over the 4 million Twitter
follower mark, and we continue to leverage Instagram, Pinterest and our global Facebook following to engage with our
customers every day around our brand and topics of interest to these customers.

Our internal measures tell us that these various digital initiatives have added demonstrable impact to our U.S. business
in Q3 with the promise of even greater growth in the months and years to come, and we are not resting on any of our
previous successes. We currently have a robust pipeline of developments in each area of our digital ecosystem, and we
expect to deliver a number of improvements and innovations to our existing programs throughout the last quarter of FY
2013 and well into FY 2014, as well as introducing new concepts and new platforms.
I'll give you one example of that today. I'm pleased to announce that Starbucks, in partnership with Duracell Powermat,
will expand the trial of wireless charging for our customers' mobile devices in select Starbucks stores in Silicon Valley.
This effort's [indiscernible] (15:58) initial test of this technology in certain Boston stores, earlier this year. The
installation of multiple wireless charging Powermat surfaces in our stores will allow our customers to recharge their
smartphones quickly and effortlessly. This is the kind of improvement to the digital experience that our customers
expect from Starbucks and the kind that we will deliver at scale moving forward.
Turning to the international front, we continue to be committed to leveraging the success we've had in the U.S. in
digital around the globe. Over the last month, my team and I spent time in China and Europe, and we'll visit Latin
America and Canada in the coming months, and the purpose of these trips has been to determine how we can accelerate
deployment of our foundational digital platforms in all of our key global markets, and by no means had we had a cold
start in terms of accelerating our digital strategy globally.
In China, for example, we already have 2.5 million My Starbucks Rewards members, and that's without a mobile
payment platform or eGifting in place. In Q3, we also made mobile payment available through apps on Android and
iOS to Starbucks customers in our Hong Kong market, and we are already seeing strong response from that. In fact,
these iOS and Android apps became the number one free application in the Hong Kong app store within less than a day
of having launched them.
Once the full breadth of our digital plan comes fully online in CAP and EMEA, to complement what we're doing
elsewhere, the potential for digital to create similar incremental impact to our business in those markets is as strong, if
not stronger, using digital than anywhere else in the world. I truly believe that no other retailer is as far along as
Starbucks in terms of building an end-to-end digital customer experience across a variety of digital touch-points, both
in-store and out-of-store, across channels and now across geographies. We are truly only just getting started.
I'm going to turn it over now to Troy to go through the Q3 results in more detail. Troy?
Troy Alstead
Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter results we announced today are a testament to the
continued efficiency, diversity and overall strength of our business. We grew revenues by 13% with every segment
contributing to that growth. We grew global comparable store sales by 8%, with each region accelerating compared to
last quarter. We expanded operating margin by 150 basis points, with margin expansion in every segment.
Starbucks Card loads grew 30%, with 24 countries now contributing. Joint venture income grew 23% with both store
and CPG partnerships contributing. All of that together produced earnings per share of $0.55, our best third quarter
ever, growing 28% over last Q3. Over the next few minutes, I will provide more context on our outstanding third
quarter performance, as well as update you on our fourth quarter projections. Then I will provide our initial outlook for
fiscal 2014.
Consolidated net revenues in the third quarter grew to $3.7 billion, 13% higher than a year ago. The growth was largely
driven by global comparable store sales growth of 8%, including 7% traffic growth and a 1% increase in average ticket,
also contributing revenues from 1,558 net new stores in the past 12 months, including 355 Teavana stores.
Operating income grew 25% in the third quarter to $615 million. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to
16.4%. While lower coffee cost continues to be a benefit to us, contributing 60 basis points this quarter, leverage on our
strong sales was the biggest driver of the margin improvement. As an illustration of the strong operational effectiveness
of our teams across the globe, our store operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues continue to dip near

all-time lows. As evidence of the deep cost discipline our partners have embraced, the continuous improvements we've
made with labor scheduling and productivity and the scale we are now achieving in many of our smaller growing
markets.
The very strong operating performance in Q3 resulted in higher performance-based compensation expense, which
along with a discretionary $10 million donation to the Starbucks Foundation drove G&A expenses higher in the quarter
across the operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses.
Now I will take a moment to speak to the results of each operating segment. First in the Americas, the performance
delivered in the third quarter was broad based, exceeding even our own expectations and was nothing short of
phenomenal. Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 12%, driven by comparable store sales growth of 9%, with 7% coming
from increased traffic and 2% from higher average ticket.
While we experienced moderate slowing in the month of June last year, comp growth last Q3 was still a strong 7%.
Despite this challenging comparison, the Americas region levered strength across all day parts and all geographies to
grow at its highest rate in six quarters. Like the Americas region overall, the U.S. grew comps by 9% in the third
quarter. Contributing to the comp growth was strength in beverage innovation and promotions, with the combination of
the Macchiato platform, limited-time Frappuccino offerings and the still new Refreshers beverages, adding a combined
four percentage points of comp growth.
Operational improvements leading to continued growth in labor productively also drove higher comp growth in Q3.
Our peak hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. in the U.S. again showed strong traffic trends, as did drive-thru stores, where our
focus on enhancing the customer experience, while improving speed of service is paying off. Food again contributed
towards the growth in the U.S. business, adding two points of comp growth in the quarter as our lunch offerings
continue to expand in popularity.
And while Howard mentioned the enthusiastic response our La Boulange bakery items are receiving, it's important to
note that this quarter's comp growth contribution from food is not impacted by La Boulange due to the still early stage
of the rollout. Operating income in the Americas region of $619 million grew 24% in the quarter as we continue to turn
strong top-line growth and even higher bottom-line growth. As a result, Americas operating margin expanded 210 basis
points to 22.3%. Strong sales leverage, combined with lower commodity costs of 30 basis points were the main drivers
behind the improvement.
In addition to the strength in the U.S., Canada and Latin America each had great quarters as well. Canada also grew
comparable store sales at the highest rate in the past year and a half and Latin America delivered significant top-line
growth and margin expansion in the third quarter. And while I'm discussing Latin America, I want to point out the
news of a week ago that we've agreed to sell the remaining 18% of our equity in Argentina and 82% of our equity in
Chile to our fantastic partner, Alsea. This will enable further growth in these vibrant markets and will enhance
profitability for both parties. This transaction will close in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate realizing a $0.03
earnings per share gain in Q4 as a result.
Moving now to the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, where the third quarter results continue our measured,
steady progress towards long-term profitability. Revenue in the EMEA grew 2% to $287 million in the third quarter, as
growth in licensed store revenue was nearly offset by lower company-operated store revenue. The licensed store
revenue growth was primarily the result of the addition of 125 licensed stores over the past year, combined with strong
growth in existing licensed stores. The company operated revenue decline was a result of a declining
company-operated store base from closures, as well as the sale of a number of company-operated stores to licensed
partners as part of our store portfolio optimization last Q4.
Comparable store sales grew 2% in Q3 with 5% growth in traffic, partially offset by a 3% decline in average ticket. We
are encouraged by this for a number of reasons. It is our first quarter of positive comp growth in EMEA in the past year
and a half, and our highest quarter of traffic growth since early 2011. Comp growth improved in our largest
company-operated markets in EMEA compared to last quarter, reflecting a broad-based contribution to the
acceleration. In our largest EMEA market, the UK, comp growth was positive in every month of Q3, with particular

success coming from the launch of Origin Espresso, new pastries and salads in some stores, and growth in the My
Starbucks Rewards program.
The average ticket decline in the quarter was partially due to fewer items per transaction, which we believe is a
reflection of broader current spending patterns in Europe combined with modest discounting as a result of promotions
and the rewards program. EMEA operating income grew from $1.6 million last Q3 to $9.3 million this year. Operating
margin expanded in the quarter as it has in every quarter thus far in fiscal 2013, this time by 260 basis points to 3.2%.
This was largely driven by the team's deep, continued focus on cost management, as well as the impacts of the mix of
our store portfolio moving to a more heavily licensed model. In fact, 42 of the 43 net new stores opened in EMEA Q3
were licensed stores.
We anticipate that both the cost focus and portfolio mix shift will be an ongoing driver of margin expansion on a
year-over-year basis.
In China and Asia Pacific, the third quarter brought an acceleration of top-line growth with significant translation to the
bottom line. Revenues of $234 million were 29% higher than last Q3, driven by a combination of 523 net new stores
over the past year and 9% comparable store sales growth. The 9% comp growth was entirely due to increased traffic,
driven by a combination of new locally relevant products and strong growth in core offerings. And like in the
Americas, the contribution to the strong comp growth was broad-based across the region.
There are so many great examples I'd like to give of the success we're seeing across Asia, but Japan stands out this
quarter as a real highlight. Sales growth in our joint venture markets is not included in the reported comp. However, I
want to call out that comparable store sales in Japan, normally a more moderate, steady grower, rose by double-digits.
We saw tremendous success with local innovation there, while at the same time delivering strong execution in
operations and the store experience. While emerging markets received many of the headlines, Japan represents around
one-third of CAP's operating income, with China contributing a third, and the rest of the Asia Pacific markets making
up the remaining third. Our partnership in Japan is critical to our performance in the region and we are delighted with
the direction of this market.
In the third quarter, we opened 119 net new stores in CAP, including the 61 net new stores in China, 25 in South Korea
and five in India, where we now have 16 incredible stores. Our discipline around site selection in CAP is continuing to
generate very attractive returns on our new stores, and our pipeline for Q4 and beyond is strong. 119 net new stores this
quarter were up slightly from last Q3, but down from the first and second quarters of this year. This is simply due to the
timing of openings, as we have a busy fourth quarter planned and we continue to target 600 net new stores in CAP for
the full year.
Operating income in CAP in the third quarter grew 38% to $85 million. Operating margin expanded 250 basis points to
36.2%, with sales leverage, strong performance from our joint venture operations and 50 basis points of favorable
coffee costs contributing. Quarterly margins in CAP are significantly impacted by the pace of new store openings in the
particular quarter, and the margin expansion in Q3 also partially reflects the relatively fewer new stores in the quarter.
However, given our acceleration of new stores expected in the fourth quarter, and the resulting investment required, Q4
margins in CAP will remain our best in the world, but will likely decline compared to the third quarter.
Channel development also contributed to our consolidated revenue and operating margin growth this quarter, albeit at a
bit slower pace. Revenues of $336 million in this segment were up 6% over last Q3, with both the CPG and foodservice
businesses growing at that pace.
Premium single cup, including C cup, VIA continue to drive the revenue growth in CPG, adding $29 million versus last
Q3. There were a few important milestones reached in the third quarter, aside from the billionth K-Cups, VIA and
Verismo continues to drive the revenue growth in CPG adding $29 million versus last Q3.
There were a few important milestones reached in the third quarter, aside from the billionth K-Cup shipped and our
extension of the partnership with Green Mountain that Howard mentioned, we saw our share of K-Cup dollar sales in
U.S. food, drug and mass channels hit an all-time high in the quarter at 14.9%. While the overall premium single cup

category grew by a very healthy 46% over last year, Starbucks sales growth of K-Cups at 51% outpaced overall
category growth. And we have a significant innovation right around the corner that we believe can continue to drive
share gains in this rapidly-growing category.
The growth in revenue due to premium single cup was partially offset by softness in packaged coffee, which was
impacted by significant broad-based competitive price declines and by the list price reduction we took in May. Our
price reduction was not fully reflected down the aisle for much of the third quarter, but has now made its way on to
most grocery shelves. Due to the new price positioning, the innovation in premium single cup and a growing
international business, we expect revenue growth in channel development to be stronger in the quarters ahead.
Channel development expanded operating margin in the quarter, with operating income up 14% over last year. Lower
coffee cost provided a gross benefit of 320 basis points this quarter, partially offset by the margin impact of the list
price reductions on packaged coffee.
Finally, let me address the results of our other segments. All other segments is comprised of our emerging brands,
including Teavana, Evolution Fresh and Seattle's Best Coffee as well as our digital ventures business. Revenue in these
other businesses grew to $108 million, more than doubling over last year. Teavana, which was not in our base last year,
contributed $51 million of the increase. Evolution Fresh, while still small, also contributed, growing 21% over last Q3.
We continue to increase share and velocity in grocery channels, and our new state-of-the-art juicery began production
in June, which will enable us to meaningfully expand availability of Evolution Fresh juice in both Starbucks stores and
CPG channels. We've already gained a nearly 6% share of Western U.S. super premium juice sales, and look forward to
gains coming from both greater distribution and increasing awareness.
Turning now to our financial position; our balance sheet has never been stronger, and our financial discipline tighter
than it is today. Given current favorable market conditions, we anticipate issuing $750 million in additional long-term
debt over the next quarter or so to provide us with financial flexibility for general corporate purposes. We lost the
benchmark interest rate on this issuance in the early part of Q3, when rates were approximately 80 basis points lower
than they are today. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate our capital needs and may increase our debt, if
we need additional liquidity, and see the right returns for more leverage. As we think about a target leverage range, I
would note that we are comfortable with our current S&P rating of A minus, so our future leverage would likely be
targeted around that rating.
Now, before I move into the outlook for 2014, I want to provide an update on how we expect to finish fiscal 2013.
First, let me say again, the third quarter just completed really was a phenomenal quarter by every measure, particularly
the 9% comp growth in the Americas. For the fourth quarter, we expect very good results, but we do not expect that 9%
level of comp growth from the third quarter to continue into the fourth quarter. Q4 is likely to return to the strong levels
we reported in the first half of fiscal 2013 in the range of 5% to 7% global comp growth.
We anticipate continued strong revenue growth of 10% to 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by that strong global comp
growth. We're targeting an approximately 100 basis point improvement in operating margin in the fourth quarter versus
last year. With increased confidence in the strength of revenue growth and operating margin expansion, we expect
fourth quarter earnings per share in a range of $0.59 to $0.60. This includes the $0.03 gain we will recognize in Q4 on
the sale of our equity in Argentina and Chile that I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we're targeting earnings per
share in the range of $2.22 to $2.23, which includes a combined $0.06 gain on the sale of our equity in Mexico in Q2
and Argentina and Chile in Q4.
Commodities will continue to benefit us in the fourth quarter, as we expect a gross $0.02 earnings per share benefit,
partially offset by our recent pricing actions down the grocery aisle. Conversely, we expect an unfavorable foreign
exchange impact of approximately $6 million in Q4, driven by a weaker Japanese yen. And with regard to the Kraft
arbitration, we've had no further update on anticipated timing of the resolution.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, we are anticipating another year of exceptional growth. We expect revenue growth of
10% to 13%, driven by global comparable store sales growth in the mid single-digits, 1,400 net new stores globally,
and accelerated channel development growth. The acceleration in new store openings in fiscal 2014 will come from the

China/Asia Pacific region, where we anticipate a net 700 new stores. We're targeting 600 net new stores in the
Americas and 100 in EMEA, consistent with growth in fiscal 2013.
Full year consolidated operating margin is expected to improve by 150 basis points to 200 basis points in fiscal 2014,
as we continue to drive leverage on strong revenue growth and operational efficiencies throughout the business. We
will provide segment-specific targets when we report our fourth quarter results in late October. We are anticipating
higher interest expense due to the debt offering I mentioned and a moderately higher tax rate. And finally, we're
targeting earnings per share in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 in fiscal 2014. This represents growth of 18% to 22% over
fiscal 2013, excluding the $0.06 impact of equity sales in Latin America in 2013.
Contributing to the improvement will be another year of tailwinds on coffee costs, currently expected at approximately
$0.09 to $0.10 net for the year. We have well more than 80% of our coffee needs locked for FY 2014, providing us
with great visibility into this benefit. The $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit reflects the gross coffee impact, partially offset by
the recent pricing changes in CPG as well as routine investments in the business.
The results we presented today and the guidance we've laid for next year are the products of our continued deep focus
on operational excellence, on relevant innovation and rigorous financial discipline. We're confident in the trajectory
ahead for many reasons, including a diverse set of significant growth drivers, a strong tenured management team, the
best collection of store operators in the world and a proven growth strategy that drives powerful returns on capital and
leverages the success in our stores for growth in other channels.
Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Your line is open.
<Q - Sharon Zackfia>: Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, Troy, I'm going to take the easy question. I guess the comment on
the comp trend, not continuing that you saw in the third quarter, is there anything you're seeing specifically or anything
you'd like to comment on?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Thanks, Sharon. No. That is not a message whatsoever about early trends in the fourth quarter at
all. We're not making any comments about current quarter trends, as usual. That is simply a message that the 9% comp
growth in the U.S. and the Americas in the third quarter was really a breakthrough quarter. It's phenomenal, as you
know, on a system size of ours. A number of fantastic things all came together in that quarter to contribute to that kind
of level of comp growth. And so as we look at Q4, as we look at fiscal 2014, we expect very strong, very healthy, very
consistent same-store sales growth more in line with what we saw in the first half of the year, and that's just recognition
of product innovation, the loyalty program, the great experience we're providing to our customers in the stores.
<Q - Sharon Zackfia>: Perfect. Thank you.

Your next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Hi. Great. Thank you. I mean you mentioned foods impact to this quarter and achieving that
without La Boulange, so I was hoping to take this opportunity to talk about how significant La Boulange has been in
your early tests and what we should really expect to see from a customer receptivity point of view for the breakfast and
the lunch products as we go forward into 2014 and 2015? And of course, I asked this in terms of your comp guidance
into 2014, which is obviously lower than what you just achieved, it seems like food is at least one thing that could be
significantly more accretive into 2014 than it was to 2013?

<A - Troy Alstead>: Let me have Cliff speak to food in particular what we're seeing in La Boulange now, and I'll
come back and talk with you about the comp guidance for next year.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, John. You know our strategy on this, John, was that we were going to acquire La
Boulange to enhance the customer experience and leverage food as part of our future growth strategy, and I'm delighted
to say in every market we've introduced La Boulange so far has been extremely well received. The product is fantastic
and we're seeing really, really encouraging results.
So the strategy is being justified, and we are now through 1,000 stores by the end of Q3, and every market we open,
we've seen great reception, particularly around the pastries, the croissants, which is the core product of La Boulange,
and it gives us every confidence that we're on the road to fantastic food platform. We'll start with breakfast, we'll then
enhance lunch, and the opportunity to enhance the current experience for the customers and gross sales is really strong.
Looking forward to 2014 and 2015, then I'm extremely optimistic that this will be a platform for growth, and as we
realize the results in the coming months, we'll share more in the coming quarters.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And, John, specifically the guidance on 2014, what I would tell you is we have very good
confidence in our ability to very sustainably continue to drive healthy comp growth for our stores through innovation in
our stores, through productivity enhancements, through the loyalty program, and yes, through new things such as the
La Boulange, which as Cliff mentioned, in our experience so far in our stores has just been nothing short of
phenomenal and we are quite confident that as La Boulange rolls throughout the system, it will be a layer of comp
growth for us in the system.
Now, with that said, as you well know, comp growth doesn't trend as a percentage. You've got to re-create it every
single quarter and every single year with new innovation, with great experiences, with new frequency among our
customers, and so we firmly believe that innovation such as Evolution Fresh, such as Teavana coming into the stores,
such as La Boulange and enhanced food program, all those things and many others are what allowed us to speak with
confidence about our ability to drive consistent, healthy comp growth into the year ahead.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Actually I'd just sneak two because I'd like to ask Adam a question. Just
whether it's possible to have a global Starbucks Card and perhaps you're well on the path to that. It wasn't clear from
your comments.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Thanks, Joe. It's a great question, and we are looking at ways that we can improve the
ability for the card to travel across regions. It's not always possible in every case, but where it is we're looking to do
that. And we already have some regions where the card can travel and where it's not, we're continuing to look into ways
so we can improve that.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Okay. And then, Troy, can I ask a question on the China/Asia Pacific region? Just talk
about the variables in the performance during the second quarter, which looked a little light on the operating income
growth to this quarter which looked terrific.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Joe, I'll address that specifically, and it relates really to two or three things, but in particular, in
any one quarter in China/Asia Pacific as we are experiencing the kind of returns and growth that we are in that part of
the world and in China in particular, we continue to make investments into the infrastructure and to supply chain, into
our stores, and in some quarters those investments will just be a little bit higher and more disproportionate that they are
in other quarters.
So for example, in the second quarter, we had a higher growth rate in new store openings in that quarter over the
previous year, than we did in the third quarter, and that's just a timing of the pipeline and when it comes to bear. In the

fourth quarter ahead of us as I mentioned in my comments, we'll once again have an acceleration in the number of new
stores in the quarter. Those new stores in any one particular quarter put meaningful pressure on the margins just in that
quarter.
They become very profitable very quickly and begin contributing but there's margin pressure when you open that many
stores in a particular quarter and we definitely experienced that in the second quarter, and we experienced a bit less of
that in the third quarter. And that explains much of that differentiation that you're seeing. I'd also remind you, and we
pointed this out on our second quarter call a quarter ago, and that is the second quarter of the previous year, fiscal 2012
had some unusual entries in it that made the year-over-year comparison difficult. So, I'd ask you to go all the way back
to that to really get the comparison.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you.

Your next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer Company.
<Q - Brian John Bittner>: Troy, you said in your comments that in 2014 you expect a nice acceleration in the CPG
segment sales. I'm just wondering what would be the main driver of that? And also, when are you going to possibly pull
the lever on entering some international markets?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Brian, let me have John Culver speak to the first part of your question, and then we'll come back
to the second part.
<A - John Culver>: Hi, Brian. This is John. Thanks for your question. Now really what we've done over the last
quarter is really lay the groundwork for sustainable growth going forward in packaged goods. And I want you to be
clear that we're very confident and committed to delivering aggressive revenue growth, double-digit growth in FY
2014. We believe that for a couple of reasons. First, obviously we've taken a list price reduction that Troy spoke about,
and with that, we are seeing that show up in the stores down the aisle.
We've also introduced My Starbucks Rewards, which better positions us to continue to build customer acceptance and
customer loyalty, and really, we see tremendous opportunity to accelerate the premium single cup agreement that we
have with Green Mountain. And what we've seen in the past quarters is that the Starbucks share has grown faster than
the overall – I'm sorry, Starbucks growth has grown faster than the overall premium single cup category, and with the
recent announcement with Green Mountain, we're going to be able to increase the number of SKUs that we offer going
into next year by three fold. So, tremendous opportunity relating to premium single cup.
As it relates to international, we're just laying the foundation around international. In the quarter that just ended, we
opened four new markets. We now do business in 25 markets out of the 62 markets around the world, so tremendous
opportunity to continue to expand there. We have many new products and innovations that we have planned yet to
come, and we continue to invest in building out capabilities from a people and from an infrastructure standpoint, and a
great example of that is Jeff Hansberry, who over the last three years has built the channel business for us here in the
U.S. is now positioned in Hong Kong and squarely focused on the China and Asia Pacific region and the opportunities
that exist in that part of the world for the channels outside our stores. So, great opportunity for us in the future.
<Q - Brian John Bittner>: Terrific and just a quick capital structure follow-up. What would the leverage range be to
keep a triple or a A-minus rating?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Well I'm not going to put, Brian, a pretty good range around that yet. I think as we go forward
and we talk a bit more about leverage, we complete this debt offering that I mentioned today. We'll talk a bit more
about that, but I think you could look at the S&P ratings. There's guidelines around leverage that they publish and that'll
give you at least an initial viewpoint on where we might be targeting.
<Q - Brian John Bittner>: Great. Awesome. Classy quarter, guys. Thank you.

Your next question is from Matthew DiFrisco of Lazard.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you. Just had one clarification and then a question. I think you said, Troy, you
compared China/Asia Pacific segment margins to sequential – on a sequential basis. Can you just I guess confirm that
in 4Q you expect similar year-over-year margin expansion for that region?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Matt, what I was actually saying was not that. That we expect the fourth quarter to not expand
quite like the third quarter did, and that's simply due to the timing of new store openings. We'll open significantly more
new stores in the fourth quarter in CAP than we did in the third quarter. And so again to my response earlier, I think to
Joe, in a region like China/Asia Pacific where we're making significant investments to accelerate growth, that includes
infrastructure and people investments, it also includes the short term, very short term margin pressure that comes from
an acceleration of new stores in any particular quarter. In Q3, that impact was quite low. It'll be a bit higher in Q4. So
my comment was simply to make you aware that our expectation for margins in the fourth quarter are a bit lower than
they were in the third quarter.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Okay. I just wanted to – I didn't hear if you said you were implying expansion, though, but
just less expansion on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yes. Less expansion than the very strong 250 basis points of expansion that we experienced in
Q3.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you for walking me through that. And then, Adam, I had a question with respect to
digital. I was wondering, where do we see or when do you think you'll have the opportunity to potentially maybe even
go across channels? It's been a tremendous success, obviously, in making your traffic very stable and superior than
your peers in the store, in your Starbucks stores. How about maybe even using that to try and drive trial traffic and new
product trial traffic in the channel development or in the CPG channel, specifically ranging as you have, obviously, a
whole cupboard full of new products coming out, Teavana, Evolution Fresh, et cetera, through the CPG channel. When
do you think – how do you stage that? Do you put the products out there first or do you use that as sort of a launch pad
as well using the digital?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Thanks, Matt. It's a good question because we actually have good news to deliver there and
we are already started doing that. For example, we have begun the rollout of integrating our digital loyalty program,
MSR, with channel in the United States with the ability to earn stars when you buy packaged coffee down the grocery
aisle. We've just started that and we do plan on expanding upon that in the future.
Secondly, we have fully integrated My Starbucks Rewards, our mobile app and our card program with Teavana, and
you can actually go into Teavana stores and use your Starbucks Card and earn loyalty points in those branded stores as
well. So those are two examples where we've already started, and those are good examples of what we plan on doing
more of in the future.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I want to add one thing. This is Howard. Your question isn't only about digital. It's about
leveraging the capability of our CPG business off of the tailwind of our core retail business once we build the brand
and loyalty. So a great example is the acquisition of Evolution Fresh replaced Naked Juice in Starbucks retail stores.
We've seen a significant lift in terms of sales there. And as a result of the [ph] approved source (49:15) of that brand
inside our stores, we're now shipping Evolution juice to across hundreds of supermarkets across the country, including,
as we sit here today, we are shipping nationally Evolution Fresh juice to Whole Foods.
And I don't think we would get that opportunity if we didn't have [ph] approved source (49:36) every day of validating
the Evolution Fresh brand inside Starbucks. So when I spoke in my remarks, the flywheel effect is not only on the
digital opportunity to leverage it across channels and concepts, as Adam mentioned with Teavana, but also product

proud that Whole Foods is going to be listing Evolution Fresh nationally.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Excellent. Thank you very much for all that detail.
Operator
The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you. Also just one clarification and then a separate question. In terms
of the clarification, Troy, I think you when you talk about the fourth quarter, the comp being more in the 5% to 7%
range, just wondering specific to the fiscal third quarter, you had brought up that, I guess, trends had slowed last June
into July, I think we all recall. I was wondering if you can size up the sequential maybe trend through this quarter, just
end it on a – at least on a two-year basis to kind of flush out the noise from last year. Was it stable through the quarter?
Because we're definitely hearing from other peers that things have slowed down June and into July, so I'm just
wondering how you read the two-year trend through your fiscal third quarter? And then I had a question on China.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yeah. I'll – to your first question, Jeff, I'll – I'm not going to make any comments about in-quarter
trends. I would remind you that despite what was slowing that did impact us last June that we have spoken about
previously. Q3 of last year was still a very strong 7%. That's a challenging comp growth to lap at any point in time, and
so all the better reflection of the 9% we delivered in the third quarter. Now as we move into the fourth quarter, given
what we expect in the market and our ability to continue to drive innovation through the stores, we once again expect
very healthy comp growth, but again, I won't speak to any current quarter trends and I won't speak to any trends about
the third quarter or the monthly results within that.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Troy, can I pick up on that? I sense that perhaps some of your taking away any concern we
may have about comp growth, so let me just hit that straight on. We've had 14 consecutive quarters in a row of 5% or
greater. Our peer group or those people who reported before us, you saw that they – the comp growth they reported was
low single-digits.
For us to have a 9% comp growth in United States of America, given what's going on in this country, is unparalleled
and unprecedented. It would be irresponsible for anyone at Starbucks to share with you that we intend to express to you
today that we can repeat that at 9%. So the better part of valor is for all of us to say to you, we are extraordinarily proud
and stunned that we're able to achieve a 9% comp and would be irresponsible to share with you that we can do that
again in Q4.
Now, having said that, our expectations of ourselves that we're going to deliver a healthy comp growth in Q4 that our
investors will be proud of. So let's get off the comp number because it's not the issue. The issue is we are building a
great, extraordinary, enduring company, and the comps are going to follow that.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Understood. And then just separately on China, we're hearing from peers and just
broader macro data kind of slowing, whatever, GDP growth and retail sales growth. Obviously, you put up a strong 9%
comp. Just wondering, at least on a two-year basis it's a modest slow down. I didn't know if there's any – whether you'd
attribute that to just the law of large numbers where sustaining that kind of double-digit run rate would be somewhat
impossible or whether you think there's some macro impact or whether maybe avian flu had any impact on your trends
this quarter or is it just the system getting much larger and therefore the double-digit pace difficult to sustain?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Yeah. We'll have John Culver take that question.
<A - John Culver>: Hey, Jeff. This is John. First off, our Q3 results were very strong, and on top of the numbers that
we were able to deliver, as Troy mentioned, we were able to make investments in the business as we've been doing
over the last several years to take a very long-term view on China, and how we want to grow our business in a very
focused and very disciplined way. The 9% comp for the quarter was driven mostly by traffic. 8% of that was traffic. So
we continue to see new customers and existing customers coming into our stores and continuing to experience

Starbucks' unique ways.
We also see that a lot of the innovation that we're bringing into the stores, whether it's what Adam spoke about around
My Starbucks Rewards and the Starbucks Card, or whether it's the local products that we're offering, are resonating
with the customers. For instance, in the quarter, we ran a promotion on – around the dragon – around Dragon
Dumplings for the Dragon Boat Festival. This was something that was new that we hadn't done in previous years and it
drove incrementality into the business. So very pleased with what we're seeing in China. We continue to remain very
focused and disciplined in how we want to grow this business, and again, we are optimistic that we can continue to do
it the right way and in a way that continues to elevate our brand.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: And perhaps just to add a little bit to that, if you don't mind, John, with now approaching
1,000 stores in China, that market for us is progressing to a size and scale where we believe we have the opportunity,
just as we've done for many, many quarters now in the U.S. to deliver stable, consistent healthy comp growth through
great experiences in stores, through product innovation as John mentioned. So, China is now becoming a large market
for us. Significantly more opportunity ahead and we believe we can continue to drive average unit volumes and comp
growth within that market.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Understood. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you. A question for Cliff actually. Troy gave us the details on the third quarter of
Americas and U.S. comp, including the beverage innovation, and especially as it relates to those Macchiato,
Frappuccino and Refreshers, can you give us a little detail? Is this driving new customers? Is this bringing new folks in
for different occasions? Or is this increased frequency of morning folks coming back in the afternoon? And then a
sub-sector or a sub-part question to this, are you also finding that – are you able to drive more packaged coffee,
whether that's K-Cup, VIA, and other packaged coffee sales in the store? It seemed like there were some good
promotions for that for in-store purchases this quarter. Did that also help contribute to the comp? Thanks.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, Keith. And really, really pleased with the way the beverage growth is contributing to
overall comps. The good news is we're seeing increased comps on all day parts. And I think our innovation around
beverages, particularly around Refreshers, gives us that opportunity to serve morning customers in the afternoon, as
Refreshers really does complement that afternoon day-part. Our ice tea is complementing our lunch platform. So there's
great innovation there.
And I also think it makes us very relevant when you get the seasonal changes that we experience in the summer, and
the refreshment platform has shown up really, really well. So it's not only providing additional occasions for existing
customers, but it is making us relevant to new customers in different day parts. And that is, as Troy said, it's all parts of
the country, it's all day parts. So it's extremely healthy.
With packaged coffee, that has not been a significant driver of our comp. It really has been beverage, it has been food,
and that has been the main drivers this year which, for us, is the healthy part of our business. It is, as with the CPG
channel, we are seeing the customers really adopt single serve in a big way. And whether that's a very small platform,
whether that's our K-Cups, whether that's our VIA, we are really well positioned to accommodate and serve our
customers as they change their habits to adopt much more single serve in that sector. So it is playing its part, but it's the
beverage innovation and really our ability to increase the number of customers we're serving at peak, with our
operational discipline and our customer service that is driving the healthy comps in this quarter and going forward.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thanks, and very, very impressive performance, folks.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, Keith.

The next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: Can you guys talk more broadly about your food plans in the coming years, beyond just
upgrading the bakery case with La Boulange? And what else should we expect from you on food at breakfast, lunch
and dinner, and where is the limit with respect to what you can versus can't do in food, given your store operating
model?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Michael, thanks for that and thanks for the opportunity to talk about food. The acquisition
of La Boulange was this opportunity to really enhance the experience and really get good-quality food, which we
needed to be relevant in the marketplace and also to develop food that matches our coffee. And I'm really pleased with
where we started with La Boulange. We are really growing our capability, and we're showing that we can deliver
world-class products in Starbucks stores. This is really early days for us because as you can imagine, we're having to
learn the way to operate food within our store environment, and obviously it's going to complement the coffee, but we
make sure we do not slow down speed of service. And the first 1,000 stores has been an amazing learning opportunity.
We are also, with La Boulange capability, able to respond quickly to adapt recipes and to evolve our product offering. I
just think we're at the beginning. We've got a capability not only around breakfast. We are able to start testing some
lunch ideas. We have an evening's innovation that we're testing in our stores, and all of these just bode well for the
future. And we over the last five years have developed the testing capability to make sure when we bring things into the
stores that it is operationally a good feeling and a good experience for our partners behind the bar; that they are proud
to deliver the product to the customers, and it enhances this overall customer experience.
So we just see that we're in the early days, not only here in the U.S., but I can imagine the recipes and the ideas we've
started in licensed stores, and it will go into other parts of the world, and this is a global capability that we're going to
develop, and it will be matching our beverage capability that we've had for the last 30 years.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: And just really quick, the debt you're taking on, you mentioned for general corporate
purposes, are there any specific calls on cash we should be thinking about other than repurchases?
<A - Troy Alstead>: No. Not at this point in time. There is still a – the arbitration results yet to be announced. We
have, as I mentioned, no new news on that whatsoever, but that certainly is in our minds. Just prepare for it regardless
of what that answer is. And then beyond that, no specific messages on use of capital at this point.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. Troy, historically you've made a bunch of investments every year that run through the
P&L. Can you – or are there any numbers you can provide for preliminarily on 2014 investments and what they relate
to? You also didn't, I think, address capital spending in the release. What's your capital spending budget for 2014? And
then finally, I know you said the net effect of green coffee less these things was $0.09 to $0.10. So what's the gross
benefit of coffee for 2014, if you would?
<A - Troy Alstead>: John, the – our planning cycle in our company is really in the beginning now and some of that
work is done, but much of it is in the couple months ahead of us yet, as we finish up this fiscal year and just remember,
we're not even in the new fiscal year yet. So our final capital spending plans of course are well underway but they're
going through the normal scrutiny and planning and discussion that we would always put them through, as are all of
our investment plans for the year. So no messages for you at this point in time on any of those things. Those are all
things that I will detail for you in our call late October, as I do every year. But suffice to say, the broad-based targets I

provided today in terms of margin expansion and in terms of earnings per share are numbers that we feel quite
confident in being able to deliver even with those investments that we have.
Now, when it comes to coffee, yes, I spoke about the $0.09 to $0.10 as a net benefit so that you would have clarity as to
what we expect to deliver of that benefit to the bottom line, as primarily net of the CPG price actions we've taken
recently. And then other normal course investments, and again what that size of those are influx at this stage, so I won't
provide detail on them now, nor will I provide specific detail on the gross coffee benefit, particularly because we still
have part of the fiscal 2014-year a bit open in terms of price locking at this stage, but the gross benefit is somewhat
higher than that $0.09 to $0.10 net benefit that I spoke about.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Howard, I was wondering if you would talk to us about your
vision of, as these stores come together with the digital experience and food, beverage, innovation on key and
innovation and evolution of the platform you have today. What does that translate to in terms of domestic growth
opportunities and global growth opportunities? And then, Adam, if I can do a follow-up with you as well, I think it's
been great color around technology and it's very disruptive in the fact that it's channel agnostic. I looked into how you
use it, and it is a little bit manual. I'm wondering if you ever envision that becoming more automatic? Thank you.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Want to go first?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Sure. Nicole, it's a good question because one of the things that's allowed us to get such a
big lead in the mobile payments is that we did not try to, for example, go right to the cloud, right to some sort of tap to
pay, although we do plan in the future on implementing whatever is state-of-the-art and most convenient to our
customers, but where we've done a barcode, where we've done other things has given us an ability to be nimble, be fast,
and it's just given us the lead in the space.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Okay. In terms of your question about the multiple formats and growth opportunities, let
me begin with saying that the lens that we've used to decide whether or not to acquire these companies was first and
foremost to try and check the box and answer the question in the affirmative, does this acquisition enhance the
experience inside our retail stores. So obviously in listening to Cliff talk about La Boulange, we certainly have been
able to do that in terms of what food is representing in the thousand stores and what's going to come nationally.
Secondarily, the acquisition of Evolution has given us a health and wellness brand and a platform to build well beyond
juice and take that into the CPG category. And thirdly, Teavana, a little bit different. We bought 300-plus stores in
malls that we thought we could bring our creativity and our competency to that category and do for tea what we did for
coffee in a number of ways. Beginning, as I said in my remarks, and we'll open up a re-imagined flagship store in every
side of Manhattan in the fall and that will be beginning of demonstrating the integration and our capability of theatre
and romance in handcrafted tea beverages, hot and cold inside that Teavana store. And that'll be the template to then go
back into Teavana stores and do that in their stores. And then over time, you'll begin to see Teavana handcrafted
beverages inside Starbucks as well as very high-quality, super-premium loose teas.
So the integration of Teavana into Starbucks, the integration of La Boulange into Starbucks, the integration of juice in
our stores, but the Teavana opportunity I think is at least a thousand stores in North America. And the opportunity that
we saw during the acquisition due diligence for Teavana was much greater outside of North America, given the
propensity of people consuming tea in parts of the world where we're very strong, specifically Asia Pacific. So I think
this is the early days of these growth channels for us. But as I said in previous calls, no one should lose sight of the fact
that in the last two years, the Starbucks stores that we've opened have been some of the best-performing stores in
almost a decade in terms of average unit volumes and sales to investment ratio.

And we have no plans whatsoever to slow down on the U.S. opportunity, including the success that Cliff and his team
have had in drive-thrus, which has added significant incrementality. So I think we're in a very unique position to offset
any slowdown in the economic environment and continue with the pace we've had in both our core business and take
advantage of the acquisitions we've made to leverage inside and outside of our stores.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on excellent results. Troy, I just, or maybe
Howard, I just wanted to come back to the question on the debt placement and the thought that you need additional
liquidity, given how much cash is already on the balance sheet and how much free cash flow you're generating. I'm just
wondering, is a big acquisition part of the near-term strategy? Or is that a possibility? I think you mentioned at the
Analyst Day back in December that you were going to absorb what you already have. But just wondering if the
thinking there might have changed over the last six months or so.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I would say, this is Howard. I would say, candidly, with the three acquisitions we've made
over the last year and a half or so and the opportunities we have to integrate those acquisitions inside our stores, take
advantage of them globally, I would say that we have enough to digest in the near-term. And there's nothing, candidly,
in our sightline that would suggest that we're involved and engaged in anything that we're going to acquire. And, Troy,
do you want to add?
<A - Troy Alstead>: And, David, I'd say, really to my comments, with respect to debt, we've long recognized that
there's opportunity with an extremely conservative balance sheet to bring a bit of debt on to the balance sheet. And,
frankly, the market conditions have been very good for that in the last several months, as you know. So that, combined
with just as we look to the future and think about our cash around the world and how that continues to grow, we've
made a determination this is the right time to get into the markets with bringing a little bit of debt on. And that's really
what's behind it.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I would say also, we've worked with our board and I think we've reached a consensus to be
fairly opportunistic, given the pricing of this kind of money.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Once you get past the Kraft settlement,
would this be a signal then that you could become more aggressive with the dividend or buybacks? Is that the idea?
<A - Troy Alstead>: David, that's always a possibility. I'm not cautiously signaling that today. But I will tell you, as
you know, every year we go through an evaluation of our cash flow, of our capability of our plans ahead and of our
dividend and the payout ratio and how active we are in repurchases. So that's an ongoing evaluation. It's certainly
something we'll look at as we end this fiscal year and move into the next fist equal year. And then we'll come back and
I expect we'll have more to tell you about that when we get into the October call.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: JoAnn, we can take one more call?
<A - JoAnn DeGrande>: Yep. Thank you, Howard. We will take one more call and we'll follow-up with those of you
left hanging on the line.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: We're looking for a good question in the last call.

<A - Howard S. Schultz>: A lot of pressure, Andy.
<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Howard. How about – we're going to harken back to another company in the industry this
week that talked about some throughput issues as a bottleneck. Love to hear your perspective as the operating side of
the business has come such a long way just in terms of kind of where you stand in terms of labor investment or some
examples of how you're handling the increased values and comps and complexities in the U.S. store footprint.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I think Cliff and his team of operators deserve all the credit in the world, and I'll give it to
Cliff to answer the question in specificity. But let me frame it for you. We are serving more customers today in our
U.S. stores than any other time in our history. And that is happening for a number of reasons. The peak periods we
become – we have become much more effective and efficient at being able to move our customers through in a
satisfactory way.
But the clear difference is the day part and need states that we are satisfying that really was not in existence five years
ago. That's a credit to the operators, the product innovation and specifically what's happening on mobile because the
mobile platform that Adam talked about earlier, which is growing at rates that are just unbelievable and put us in a
position where we have more transactions on mobile than any other retailer in the world, is also creating speed of
service and efficiency and also satisfying our customers in ways that they have not been satisfied before. But the real
credit in all of this goes to Cliff and his operators. Cliff?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, Howard. I want to thank you for leaving me space to answer that question. Andy,
thank you. The work that we're doing every day in our stores is the work of serving our customers, and we're really
focused on the products we develop, on the way we bring them into store, the testing capability that we've never had
before, and we have an incredible team of people. The teamwork that is out there today is far better. Everything we're
doing around the environment to set our partners up for success is critical. And I really just want to thank our partners
for their hard work each and every day. They're doing an incredible job. They are more productive than they've ever
been. That said, we still see opportunities as a team to continue to grow capacity at peak.
And the innovations around day parts, whether it's beverage, whether it's food, whether it's juice, whether it's
combination in the future, all of those give us the real potential to continue growing and we'll continue to do that work.
Technology will support it, whether it is the digital platform. We have some exciting things in the pipeline. So thanks
very much, Andy.
<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Thank you.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, Andy.
