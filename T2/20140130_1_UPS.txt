Good morning and welcome to the UPS fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; and
Kurt Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Jim Barber;
President of U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.
Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the
company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2012 Form
10-K and 2013 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
Although there were no adjustments to fourth quarter 2013 results, there was a mark to market pension adjustment that
reduced fourth quarter 2012 diluted earnings per share by $3.15. As a result, in our remarks today, all quarterly and full
year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss UPS's free cash flow, which
is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call, along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and
adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website. Finally, please ask only one question so that we
may allow as many as possible to participate on today's call. Thanks for your cooperation.
Now, I will turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks and good morning. I would like to start my comments today by saying UPS fourth quarter results fell far short
of our expectations. However, I do want to reinforce that the core business strategies of UPS remains sound and
appropriate for the future. Given the compressed calendar between Thanksgiving and Christmas, UPS knew this
holiday season would be one of the most challenging ever. Shipments produced by e-commerce significantly exceeded
even our most optimistic forecasts, as more and more Americans shopped online. In addition, we experienced a much
later peak day than expected as purchasing decisions by consumers shifted closer to Christmas. The surge in volume
and inclement weather strained our network, causing delays. We took extraordinary measures and deployed additional
people and equipment, placing a greater emphasis on service and cost. Yet, we did not meet the service standards that
UPS historically does at Christmas. Moving forward, UPS will make the necessary investments and operational
improvements to ensure we effectively manage peak demand in the future.
Looking at U.S. Domestic fourth quarter results, clearly, we are not satisfied. At UPS, we conduct a thorough review of
peak performance following Christmas. And this year, I can assure you we've identified a number of areas to improve,
and in a moment, David Abney will take you through them.
Turning to the international segment, UPS experienced operating margin expansion on strong growth in export volume.
In Supply Chain & Freight, challenges in Forwarding negatively impacted results. Reflecting back on 2013, let's start
on the economic front. U.S. business activity was constrained by political uncertainty in Washington. Now, on a
positive note, Europe began to emerge from recession. Also cross-border trade improved from 2012 but Express
shipments out of Asia remained sluggish.
Looking specifically at our business, two themes were prevalent in the marketplace. First, e-commerce continued to
evolve at a rapid pace not only here in the United States, but around the world. And second, customers put greater
emphasis on cost rather than time in transit. UPS has and will continue to adapt our business model and service
portfolio to meet their needs. Throughout the first three quarters, UPS adjusted to these market dynamics. We managed
our network efficiently, producing operating profit growth and margin expansion. Clearly, in the fourth quarter, we did
not anticipate the magnitude of volume growth and results suffered.
Looking at 2014, economists around the world are forecasting a slightly brighter outlook. In the U.S., projections call
for stronger GDP, up 2.7%. While in the euro zone, GDP is expected to grow 1.2% off a relatively flat growth year in
2013. The outlook for Asia calls for continued solid growth with China expanding in line with last year, about 7.5%.
More importantly, global exports are projected to slightly outpace global GDP. Another prospect for economic

development is the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement passed just last month. It will expedite the movement of goods
globally by decreasing red tape and promoting more efficient supply chains. While areas remain where additional
progress is necessary, this agreement is proof that debate and compromise can produce tangible results. History has
shown that economic development benefits from free trade and more should be done to encourage it.
As I stated at the opening, I am confident in our core business strategies. In the area of operations technology, UPS is
ramping up hub modernization efforts. We are seeing the benefits from telematics and route optimization. And as a
result, the company is expediting the rollout of ORION. These investments will help UPS become more efficient and
responsive to customer needs. In addition, we are accelerating how UPS data can be used to improve our application of
analytics across the network. These models not only have application within our operations but also across our entire
business. Serving end consumers around the world, B2C is a critical part of both our heritage and our future, and by far
the most rapidly changing. We've led the industry with innovations such as UPS My Choice, UPS Access Points, and
omni-channel solutions. While we've accomplished a lot, there is still much more to do.
Regarding industry-specific solutions, we have enhanced our healthcare capabilities, such as the introduction of UPS
Temperature True Saver and UPS Proactive Response. In addition, we will add to our already 6.4 million square feet of
healthcare distribution space with several openings planned worldwide in 2014. In emerging markets, in order to focus
on the potential of India, the Middle East, and Africa, we structurally separated those markets from Europe in 2013 and
established a dedicated team to focus on growth, and expect to see increased investment by UPS in the next year.
Before I turn it over to David, I would like to thank UPSers around the world for your exceptional efforts under some
very difficult peak season conditions. The lessons learned from peak will enable UPS to improve the customer
experience, network efficiency and capacity management. We recognize and hold in the highest regard the vital role we
play in linking 1.1 million shippers to their 8 million customers every day.
Now, I will turn it over to David.
David P. Abney
Thanks. As Scott mentioned, UPS has been working around the clock to determine how to improve peak operations and
service performance, ensuring we do not have a repeat of 2013. I am leading a team of senior UPS executives with
deep experience in all areas of the business. We have identified areas for improvement and will make the necessary
adjustments to our operating plans. This is the first step in an ongoing process.
Let me begin by providing insight into the major issues that impacted our operations, which can be categorized into
three main areas. First, e-commerce shipments far exceeded peak projections, starting with a strong cyber week.
Typically, volume slows the following week, but this year, it continued to rise. In fact, on eight days during December,
U.S. delivery volume exceeded our previous company high, which was set in 2012. Additionally, delivery volume per
day during peak was up more than 14%, a growth rate almost twice what we planned. Second, last-minute promotions
by online retailers drove extraordinary volume growth leading up to Christmas. This helped create the latest peak day
ever for UPS, six days after it was expected.
Another indication of the growing acceptance of e-commerce, there were more than 70 online retailers promoting
guaranteed next-day delivery on purchases made as late as 11:00 p.m. on December 23. And finally, weather events
throughout the country, especially in the Southwest, further contributed to network disruptions. Operations in Texas
and Oklahoma were shut down for 3.5 days following the ice storms there. Stranded volume became a priority. And
UPS responded, deploying over 1,000 team members to the area. Ultimately, we had a plan that was based on a very
optimistic level of e-commerce shipment growth, but actual results came in significantly higher. When a network is
stressed to those levels, it becomes vulnerable. Add to that a wave of last-minute online orders along with significant
weather disruptions, and processes started to break down and errors occur. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.
Now, let me share how we will prevent this from happening again. We have identified four key areas that UPS must
address before peak season next year. First, UPS volume forecasting methods were challenged. The paradigms for

planning no longer apply due to the rapidly evolving marketplace. The first step will begin with increased collaboration
with high-impact customers to further develop predictive models that incorporate changing consumer behavior in sales
promotions. With a better understanding of the impact these customers will have on our network, UPS will be prepared
to make the necessary adjustments.
That brings me to the second issue we need to address: UPS network capacity. We're in the process of identifying ways
to enhance the throughput of our network. We will make the appropriate investments, such as facility expansions,
process automation, job simplification and the acceleration of technology implementations. For example, we plan to
expedite the progress of updating our legacy buildings with automation to streamline the sort process. This multi-year
undertaking will pay dividends for years to come. In addition, to improve the efficiency of our delivery network, we're
expediting the rollout of ORION. This technology has improved UPS routing efficiency. As a result, we are
accelerating the rollout and we plan to have 45% of driver routes using the technology by the end of 2014. To do this,
we are adding approximately 200 additional dedicated resources to the ORION team, bringing the team head count to
almost 700.
One final element of capacity management is to better manage the impact certain customers have on our network
during peak. The goal is to ensure we can meet both the customer expectations and our financial objectives. A third
area for improvement is the timely and accurate visibility of shipments. As more customers work with UPS to optimize
their supply chains, a growing number of trailers are dropped at our facilities with limited visibility to their contents.
We will collaborate with customers to obtain package visibility on all trailers before arrival. This will improve UPS
tracking and exception reporting and is critical to provide accurate visibility to our customers.
Lastly, improved communication with our shippers and receivers is needed. UPS must enhance our processes and
standards necessary to ensure timely and accurate communication, especially during periods of peak demand and
network disruptions. Along with improved visibility for our customers, new package exception codes will be rolled out
to improve tracking messages, ultimately providing more clarity on shipment progress. In addition, proactive
notifications will make it possible for our customers to adjust their plans.
So clearly, our entire team is intensely focused on using the learnings from this past season to ensure we are prepared
for 2014. We recognize that the UPS brand is a valuable asset to be protected. The steps I just mentioned will allow
UPS to build upon our reputation for reliability and service quality.
Now, Kurt will take you through the details of the quarter and guidance for 2014.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Thanks, David. As already noted, fourth quarter results fell short of UPS expectations. For the first time in years, UPS
did not achieve the typical benefits that we've seen from operational efficiency. As evidence, compensation and benefit
expense increased 7.5% on a daily package volume growth of 6%. Also additional costs were incurred to react to the
unprecedented level of volume growth as we attempted to meet service commitments.
Now, I want to review the business segment results for the quarter. In the U.S. Domestic the challenges that David
reviewed were detrimental to the segment's financial results. Operating profit declined $178 million, and margin
contracted to 12.9%. The U.S. incurred unplanned expense this quarter to handle the volume surge. This included
hiring and training costs, overtime hours, and additional weekend operations. Thousands of extra ad hoc trailer moves
drove purchase transportation costs up. In addition, with 85,000 seasonal employees, UPS productivity declined,
driving a 6.2% increase in direct labor hours. Clearly, we didn't operate as smoothly as we normally do. The estimated
impact of the peak season efforts increased operating costs by $125 million to $150 million. Also, revenue was lowered
by approximately $50 million, and service refunds for missed delivery commitments.
UPS did experience strong daily volume growth of 5.6%, led by our Deferred and Ground products. Revenue per piece
declined 1.3% as base rate improvements were more than offset by lower fuel surcharges, a 34% growth in UPS
SurePost and the service refunds that we mentioned. During the period, the benefits of our route optimization efforts,

though, were obvious as miles driven increased a little more than 2% compared to the daily volume growth of 5.6%.
Looking now at International results, the segment demonstrated continued momentum during the quarter with revenue
gains of 5.3%, driven by 8.8% package volume growth. Operating profits rose 7.6% to $537 million, and operating
margin expanded 30 basis points to 15.9%. Operating profit growth would have been up over 12% when excluding
negative currency comparisons. Export daily volume jumped 9.5%, the largest year-over-year gain we've seen in some
time. UPS experienced robust demand in Europe, driven by e-commerce, capitalizing on the capabilities of our recently
expanded hub in Cologne.
In addition, trans-border daily volume increased over 18% during peak. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 8.2%
with Poland, Italy and Canada leading the way.
Now, turning to Supply Chain & Freight. Total segment revenue declined by 5.8% directly related to our freight
forwarding business unit. Operating profit was flat overall at $171 million as improvements in distribution were offset
by declines in Forwarding and UPS Freight. Operating margin overall expanded 30 basis points to 7.4%. UPS freight
forwarding revenue declined as International Air Freight experienced decreases in both tonnage and revenue per kilo.
On a positive note, our brokerage in ocean forwarding groups both demonstrated good growth and improved
profitability.
In distribution, mid-single digit revenue growth resulted from improvements in healthcare, retail and UPS mail
services. Operating margin expanded slightly as the business unit continues to absorb cost for technology and
healthcare facility expansions.
UPS Freight LTL revenue increased 2.3% as a result of increased LTL tonnage and pricing improvements. Revenue per
hundredweight increased by 1.6% this quarter as pricing remained stable.
Now, for an update on our cash flow for the year. UPS generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow during 2013, converting
over 120% of net income to cash. This was after making capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion. Also
during the year, the company distributed over $6 billion to shareowners, including dividends of $2.3 billion and share
repurchases of approximately $3.8 billion.
Looking now at 2014, UPS expects to make share repurchases of $2.7 billion. This will result in over 2% net reduction
in outstanding shares and reflects the company's long-term philosophy of returns to shareowners. Capital expenditures
are expected increase to $2.5 billion.
Our allocation of investments will be meaningfully different this year, with much less devoted to aircraft. This will be
offset, though, by additions to vehicles and operating technology as well as over $500 million of increased investments
in capacity expansion and hub modernization.
The combination of a slightly improved economic environment and our execution of UPS core business strategies gives
us confidence in our 2014 guidance of earnings per share growth of 11% to 16%. We expect a tax rate of 36% in 2014,
higher than reported in the first half of last year.
Regarding guidance for the segments, U.S. Domestic average daily volume is expected to grow between 3% and 4%,
moderately above 2014 GDP estimates. Revenue should improve at a slightly faster pace than volume. Increases in
base rate prices will remain steady between 2% and 3%. However, they will continue to be masked by customer
preference for non-premium products, including continued growth in UPS SurePost.
Operating margin is expected to be around 14%. Due to higher discount rates, total pension expense will be reduced by
approximately $180 million. The majority of this will be reflected in the Domestic segment. However, the savings for
this segment will be offset by higher healthcare costs. In addition, implementing the network improvements that David
described will increase cost by well over $100 million, while providing a payback for years to come.
We expect the positive momentum in the International segment to continue in 2014, with export average daily volume
growth between 4% and 6%. Revenue is expected to improve at a slightly slower pace than volume as non-premium
export products continue to outpace premium. Operating profit is forecast to grow between 12% and 14%.

For the Supply Chain & Freight segment, UPS expects mid single-digit annual revenue growth. Operating profits are
expected to grow at a low-teen rate with margin expanding to approximately 8%. In the first quarter, though, revenue
and profit growth will be relatively flat to last year, due to the challenges in our International Air Freight. As we look at
the first quarter overall, earnings per share growth will be slightly below 10%, due to the higher tax rate and the
continued headwinds in Supply Chain &Freight.
In summary, the outlook for 2014 at UPS is positive as improving global economic conditions and the explosive
growth of e-commerce provide optimism at UPS. We are going to take the challenges that we faced in the fourth
quarter to serve as a springboard to improve our service levels and our productivity going forward. As a result, UPS
expects earnings per share to grow within a range of $5.05 to $5.30.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey, Scott. I wonder if you can just continue down the path on the guidance.
Obviously, when results were previewed earlier this month, you were looking for 10% to 15% earnings growth. I
acknowledge it was a preliminary number. Now the range is being taken up slightly, but the buyback is being reduced.
You are making infrastructure related investments, which I think are appropriate, but when we do think about, it looks
like the core assumption is greater than expected. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? It sounds like the
cadence is for accelerating improvement through the year, but can you talk about the decision to take the full year
guidance up even with the buyback that is coming down slightly for 2014?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. As we dug through and took a little closer look at the momentum of the business units,
sharpened our focus on the investments we were going to make and took a hard look at that, it looks like a very
competent range that we've got. I will make one comment, though, and that is that the buyback is in line with what
we've been communicating. Clearly, 2013 was a catch-up year because we had held back in 2012 on repurchases but
that $2.7 billion gets us right into line with the $8 billion or so that we had committed to three years ago. So at least for
the numbers we provided and I think communication that buyback is right in line.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Ben, I would add also that I think things we felt good about 2014 is we see strength in all three
segments. It's really been since 2010 that we saw balanced growth at all three segments. We have had some weakness
in cross-border trade in 2011 and 2012. We see that improving in 2014. Supply Chain & Freight is going to show good
growth in Domestic. It has performed quite well the last several years with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2013.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Helpful. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hey, Tom.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: So I understand, obviously, it's a little bit disappointing in terms of just that there were
some of the operational issues. But it is a high-class problem to have that much volume coming in and I suppose you
could say, well, maybe there is a silver lining in terms of highlighting to customers that there are constraints on the
network and perhaps the value of your network. So I guess what I want to ask you is do you think this provides an

opportunity to get more value from the customers in terms of pricing? And if so, what type of timeframe would it take
to see that come in?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: So, Tom, I think David did a pretty good job of walking through how we're going to approach
next peak. But clearly as a team, we are going to evaluate many options to ensure we don't have a repeat of the 2013
peak. Now, I'd say it's safe to say that we're going to evaluate every alternative out there. We haven't made all the final
decisions as of this point in time that we know we need to manage the impact customers have on us during the peak.
But the overall objective for us is we have to meet customer expectations and we have to meet our financial objectives.
So over the next few months, we will make more decisions in this area.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, and clearly, Tom, the top priority is adding capacity and investing in this growth business,
so we're happy to do that.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah. I mean, is there any impact on the pricing dynamic? Or I'm really – I guess I'm
really trying to ask about pricing and whether there's any positive effect on pricing from what happened.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, I think something we're going to evaluate is as we – we're really early on in this process.
David is leading this committee to evaluate next peak. Everything is on the table and that will be one of the things that
will be on the table to look at.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hey, Brandon.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: I want to talk about what looks like to be a pretty good outcome in your
International segment. And if I look at your guidance, I actually think you are guiding to up margins for International.
So can you talk about how the mix has changed on the export front and within the continent in Europe, and what you're
doing to drive those better profit outcomes, or at least expectations for better profit outcomes in 2014?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Clearly, as we've been saying the last couple quarters, we're seeing improving
momentum each quarter, it's gotten stronger and stronger, and as we get past the currency headwinds, we are looking
for great things to come out of the International segment. So I'll have Jim Barber fill you in a little more on Europe and
what's going on there.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Okay. So, Brandon, I think the core underlying response has to be that that network in
Europe for us continues to perform very, very nicely. You heard in some of the opening comments, the expansion of
Cologne. We could see the benefits of that through peak season. We have also continued to enhance the ground
network and quite frankly put some new solutions in the market for some of our global customers that are really driving
the growth today. That's a lot of what underpins some of the growth you see today and then we will evaluate going
forward what's next. But effectively, that network in Europe continues to mature and pay long-term benefits for all the
investment over the years. So we absolutely see that continuing and you can see in some of the countries where the
investments we make some two, three years ago continue to pay off today. So we are very bullish on that.

<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good morning, guys. Kurt, when you mentioned the guidance for Domestic, you
talked about $100 million of extra costs. I am assuming that's OpEx. Could you talk a little bit about the nature of that
and whether that's going to be kind of a one-time addition for the year as you're rolling out ORION, and then it might
come back a little bit? Or if it's going to be just an added level of spend within the operation to keep the network a little
more resilient.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, certainly, the lion's share in 2014 will be operating expense that's involved in the rapid
expansion and one-time costs. So we don't see this as a major structural cost addition, but clearly there are some things
we're going to do teeing up the teams, having 700 people deploying ORION and other things are going to accelerate
both costs but should provide great benefits in the years to come.
Maybe I could have Myron talk a little bit about ORION and why we are doubling our bets on the pace of rollout on
that.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Hey. Good morning, David. As you heard David Abney alluded to earlier, we actually saw a
great benefit from ORION at peak season. While ORION grew almost 6%, our miles driven were down to 2%. So
we're going to ramp up our ORION team and move the total number of drivers deployed from just over 10% to up to
45% for this year.
Along with that, David also alluded to hub modernization project, which actually kicks off this coming Friday in North
California. So we are looking forward to this investment yielding dividends for years to come.

Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Scott, I guess I want to come back to Tom's question on the pricing. I guess when you
talked to before about better managing certain customer impacts on the network, just given that you've kind of kept
stressing the financial objectives, if we're going to see e-commerce continue to push that peak season later and later and
obviously December 23, it sounds like that's about as late as you can physically get with your physical network. Why –
is the answer – the answer have to be that you raise pricing incrementally until that peak day to alter customer behavior
to move it earlier in the season? Or is there something else you can do? I guess I just want to understand that does it
have to be price, or are there other things you can do to handle that level of an increase at a last minute?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah. Clearly, Ken, it doesn't have to be price. So we're going to look at all the alternatives.
Obviously, we're trying to move shipments forward doing earlier pickups. It is something that will help us. We, as you
would expect, spend a lot time with customers since the peak season working with them. The omni-channel is
becoming more prevalent every day. I've work with several – we've all worked with several brick-and-mortar people
who were evaluating next year perhaps instead of having their big sale on the 23rd on the website, people will do it in
the store. They will allow people to go into the store and pick it up, so in other words, you get 50% off in store, 40% off
on the website. There is a variety of alternatives out there that could change it.
We know that there's still going to be an issue. I mean, every year there is going to be e-commerce is bigger at
Christmas, so we have got to adapt our systems. So I think it's all the above. Alan, you may want to add something?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. I would just say that there is tremendous amount of planning that goes on between us
and certainly our largest customers, but we are going to need to take that to a whole new level to ensure that we are
keeping our promises and they are able to keep theirs. So I think you heard from David earlier and what our customers
are looking for right now is commitment and insurance that we will take the necessary actions to ensure this won't

Our next question will come from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Kurt, can I ask you for a little bit more color on how to think about the impacts in the fourth
quarter from each one of these items? So when we think about the challenges from the peak and the resources you had
to deploy last minute and the weather, if you try to tease it out, what do you think the right level of earnings would have
been? Would it have been the original guidance? Or is the mix here sort of going to repeat? Because I am not sure how
to think about what core earnings is. I feel like things got better, but maybe the costs have to repeat in ways in the
fourth quarter that we need to keep in mind as we model going forward. So any color around kind of how to think about
those buckets would be helpful.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Bill, certainly, it's something we've looked at very closely and we did have a significant
amount of excess cost somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. Plus, as I mentioned in my prepared
remarks, about another $50 million of service refunds that lowered revenue. So we certainly would have been within
our guidance without those conditions. And when the network gets stressed and there is that much of an increase after
years of fairly modest growth, clearly, some weak areas showed up and that did snowball for us.
So, clearly, the fourth quarter was a tough one for us. If you look at the October, November, October was pretty much
on target. We did see November a little below our plans but I think that that's primarily the issue of the later
Thanksgiving and the fact that the holidays started later. In fact, if you recall, I even mentioned in our last quarterly call
about both the risks and the opportunities of a compressed peak season and for better or for worse we ended up seeing
opportunity with tremendous compression of demand but the risks of operations, especially with some of the incredible
ice storms in the Southwest that was really the worst area for us.
So we're putting this one in the history books. I think you heard David give a sense of our absolute determination to
learn from this and to create flexibility and capacity. We are substantially increasing our investments in our facility
modifications. Myron mentioned hub modernization, that's something we are very excited about. The technology has
come a long ways and we can, we think, very effectively retrofit a number of our buildings. In fact, maybe I could have
David talk just a little bit about the technology and why we are feeling like this is a great time to invest in it.
<A - David P. Abney>: Yeah. And this technology is something we've been utilizing. The difference now is that the
capacity, so the speed of the technology and the footprint is such that it will now fit into our existing footprint. So real
excited about that. Myron mentioned the first one in North Bay in California, but there will be others that will be
progressing right behind that one. But there's other things we're doing to increase capacity too. We're automating more
of the small sorts and increasing input capacity in some of our main transit hubs and we're doing facility expansions,
some that we already have in the books and we're just speeding up and a lot of job simplification where we can do next
generation small sort or short hauls where it takes some of the intellectual capital out and it allows us to make changes
more as this peak when we had some of those fluctuations and changes we had to make.

Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just on the back of the last question, just trying to think about
the core operating of the business or core operations and profitability of the business, post what we saw on the fourth
quarter of last year, does the dynamic of profitability within B2C change at all when you think about what ultimately
the volume potential of this segment of your business could be? Does that skew things either more positively or
negatively when you look out? It would seem, based on the guidance with all the puts and takes, that maybe there is an
assumption of slightly less profitability in B2C. But just want to make sure I understand that.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, I think generally, we feel good about the direction of B2C. I think you've seen the
progress UPS has made over the last two or three years in improving the margins in the B2C business. We're going to
continue to use this technology to help improve intensity in the area of B2C. So I think this is an outlier of what you
saw in December of this year. Again, we have been through over 100 successful peaks and this is an outlier. You will
not see another one of these hopefully in the next 100 years at UPS. We have a lot of intensity there. But I feel good
about the direction of B2C and what we are doing with technology to improve the profitability there.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. And certainly, it's not only about B2C. I mean we're investing and creating a wide array
of capabilities for healthcare, for technology, you name it. And a lot of the investments we've made to create flexible
network are paying dividends there. So as always, we've got a great array of different customers and the B2C clearly
was a challenge in December, but we feel pretty good going forward that the mix of business will be profitable.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: I'm just trying to walk through the cadence of how things have transpired over the last
couple of quarters and now making sense of where we are. So I mean, back half of last year, it was clearly a story of
profitability being masked by pension and currency. It sounded like when you were giving your guidance that that
healthcare slipped in there as a problem. I know that you guys took steps to mitigate some of that increased inflation
that you were expecting in the back half of last year. So I'd be curious how that's playing in; and obviously, this
difficult peak also played in. So I guess I am trying to get a sense of what you think underlying growth looks like for
2014 when you strip some of that stuff out. Are you just being conservative in terms of the underlying growth of the
overall business? Because it puts you well below run rate when I do all those puts and takes.
And then when I think about the decisions that you made last peak and how those inform earnings growth this year, it
feels like we are going to have another year where you choose servicing the customer over profitability in terms of
capping volumes to make sure that shareholders get the growth that they need as well. So I'm just trying to understand,
I mean, maybe 2015, you guys are good at what you do; you are able to translate that into very profitable growth and I
think that's what a few of the questions before were trying to get at. But it doesn't sound like you are confident in that
for 2014. So, I know there is a lot there. I am just trying to get a better sense of how you feel about the cadence of the
next kind of 24 months here.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Great. No. You've given me a wide array of choices to pick which question I am going to
answer, Justin. No, I think we are seeing 2014 as a year in which we are going to absolutely address the issues that
popped up in the fourth quarter, so that is job one. There is no question. We are going to spend extra money

operationally. We are going to accelerate investments and we are a little cautious about exactly how the next peak turns
out. It is another compressed holiday season although we get one extra day.
On the other hand, we are not in any way anticipating or forecasting a major problem. So is the balance right now more
on reinvestment and refinement of the network? Absolutely. Hopefully, all of this will come together and we will have
great results going forward, but we are happy to reinvest right now and accelerate some things that have been on the
drawing board. And as a result, yes, 2014 is a little muted in the domestic side anyway compared to where it might
have been, but that will be a passing phase.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah. As I reflect back on 2012 and 2013, frankly that the primary headwind excluding pension
expense and currency was International Air Freight. We had some challenges, cross-border trade was – grew less than
GDP last year, a little bit better in 2013, the Forwarding side, International Air Freight and Forwarding was weak due
to too much capacity. We started to see those things level out in 2014, so I feel pretty good. As I said earlier, I feel
good about the balance that we see good domestic, we see good international package and we see good Supply Chain &
Freight performance in 2014. And 11% to 16%, again, is back up in our long-term target area where it should be, the
margins are kind of what we told you a couple years ago in our long-term targets, but we have room for improvement.
Unfortunately, we can't keep all the pension benefit this year because of healthcare costs.
<A - David P. Abney>: Yeah, just one thing I want to react to, Justin, and this is David Abney, but I want to speak
from the cross-functional team and we are still early in the process where we've made a lot of progress in identifying all
of the contributing factors and we are also are much further along than I thought in putting the answers together of what
we need to do to ensure that 2014 is not going to be a repeat of 2013. So I thought I heard just a little indecision in your
voice about how we would do for 2014.
We believe – we don't believe, we are very confident that we have a plan put in place that's going to take care of the
volume on 2014. We're not hoping that maybe it comes indifferent, but it's not only about capacity, it's about increasing
our forecasting methods with our customers. It's about improving visibility and it's about the communications back and
forth with our customers. So the overall plan and, as Kurt said earlier, there will be some operating costs into this year
but it's going to pay dividend in years to come and when you increase the funnel, increase the capacity then that takes
care of a lot of challenges that could come in the future.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the answers, guys.

Our next question will be from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So I wanted to ask about the buyback expectations. I know it's in line with what you guys have
been talking about and it looks like you're using about 100% of the free cash flow for buyback and dividend. But I
guess I am just wondering why you don't feel comfortable being more aggressive in starting to eat into that $6 billion
plus of cash. I guess, is there something big you're saving that for? And, Scott, are you any more or less hopeful about
finding a better place for that cash this year?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, Scott, I do think that we've been consistent with our distribution policy, and again, we're
going to have a big shareowner distributions in 2014. As you said, over 100% of net income is the plan. But we still do
see opportunities to reinvest in the business. As I talked about earlier, there's lot of opportunities for us in the healthcare
arena, in emerging markets, as we go forward in the B2C area. So I think there will be a mixture of acquisitions as we
move forward.

Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I hope you're surviving the deep freeze of Atlanta.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: As a matter of fact, I've a story to tell you. I slept in the floor of a hotel lobby the night before
last, so pretty glamorous being a CEO.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Wow! Kurt, I think as you talk about some of your network enhancements for this year to
deal with the growth of e-commerce, it sounds like a lot of infrastructure enhancements. So I think you indicated you
guys weren't really going to invest in your aircraft fleet. Does that mean as we get into the peak season you will
continue and maybe rely more on outsourced providers of aircraft during the holiday season? Am I thinking about that
right?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, it will be a slight increase but we did take a number of 767s this year completing our
multiyear purchase. So we are in great shape as far as air capacity. We always have to rely on third-party to top off the
excess demand during peak. And so that won't be dramatically different. But, no, we are in great shape. We have got,
by far, the youngest fleet in the industry. We will, at least for the medium, the next several years, don't anticipate needs
for any aircraft purchases. So that's part of why we are in such good shape cash-wise and are happy to now begin to
reinvest in some of this hub modernization and automation.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And they have the old saying, you don't build a church for Easter. That's a little bit the way it is
for airplanes for December 23. You really can't buy an airplane just for one day. But we'll manage, we'll manage it
properly, we'll lease aircraft where necessary and we'll make sure we have proper capacity.
<A - David P. Abney>: With those eight additional 767s, the number of leased aircraft was not a primary factor at
Worldport. It was much more about unload doors for trailers that were coming in and that is something that we can
certainly correct.

<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Hey, we spent a lot of time, obviously, talking about the Domestic challenges and a little
bit of time in terms of all the opportunities in Europe. Obviously, some of the network adjustments seem to keep going
on in terms of like Asia to U.S. Do you guys feel that you're well balanced there? And as we get maybe a little bit of a
slowdown in the kind of emerging markets that everybody is worried about recently, does that impact at all your vision
on global trade and how you allocate your resources or where the growth comes from?

<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Sure. So I guess, ending with the last question we talked about the network and to this
question, they are very linked responses. First of all, we like our assets that are out there but when you get back to some
of the opening comments about Bali, what's going on now and where these trade agreements are going to take us. One
of our obligations is to be able to take a look at these networks. I am really specifically talking about Asia now and the
Americas and to align those to where the puck is going. So it doesn't necessarily mean new assets, but it might mean
redeploying them in different ways based upon what the consumers are telling us and our customers from across the
globe. So we are in the middle of that piece of work right now. We are very happy with our networks and the way they
are performing. You can see that in some of the results, but we also think we have to keep one step ahead based upon
where these trade agreements are going and some of the decisions these countries will make in the next couple of years.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And I think the fact that as you look at 2014, solid growth is projected for the developing world
– developed world, I should say, for the United States and Europe. And I think that that also bodes well for UPS. We're
looking at almost an 0.8% increase as consensus for the U.S. this year and the global economy the same. So I think as
you get into a more stable, I just wouldn't call it a robust economy yet, but a more stable economy. And seeing Europe
and the U.S. strengthen is going to help us a lot. We're interested. We're going continue to invest in emerging markets,
a big part of our future. But for the short and medium term, the developed world growing faster is good for us.

Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the time. Most of my
questions have been asked and answered more than once; so thank you very much. But I just have one thing I wanted to
understand. When you talk about having to hire people at the last instant, I am not sure I understand the timing of that.
Like when do you bring on those additional people to handle the extra volume? I mean, I sort of think that the 1,000 or
so people you moved to the Southwest came from other parts of the company. But as you got closer to the peak, how
do you – where do you get those people from? Or how does that work? So could you just explain that one to me?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, certainly, hiring that number of people in the span of a month and a half or so is a big
challenge especially when we have to react late. But Myron can talk a little bit about the joys and challenges of
bringing on such a large workforce.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Helane, it's like a delicate ballet. We are constantly assessing where the volume is and bringing
our resources to meet those challenges. As has been talked about many times, we actually added 30,000 people above
where we planned.
And let me also allude to the fact that we believe that our operating strategy is sound, and remind you that through the
first three quarters of last year, we were able to balance average daily volume with ours and have the appropriate
spread. So we are bringing on these people as needed and it's a challenge because you had a 16% increase in our peak
day over last year, but we believe that those are good peak season jobs. We got all the required people in place on time,
but was thwarted by the significant storm that we saw, not only in the Southwest, but the Midwest and the Northeast.
So I think we are in good shape.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes. And, Helane, on the economic impact of that, there is a point of diminishing returns in
trying to bring that many people on and have them be productive quickly clearly was one of the drags in the quarter,
especially when we had to get so much more just because of the volume increase. But those are great jobs. Many of us
started the company as Christmas hires, myself included.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Me too. Although I'm not with you anymore, I did do that in college.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Great. Hopefully, we worked you hard.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Yes, I would say so.

<Q - David G. Ross>: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Hey, Dave.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Wanted to just talk a little bit about rising healthcare costs. You mentioned they're going to eat
up most of the pension benefit expected for 2014. Wanted to see if that $100 million rough increase in healthcare costs
is expected every year through the new labor agreement, or if it's one-time for some reason. It can't be all due to any
back problems Scott comes with from sleeping on the floor.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, that's not work related anyway. No, the biggest impact is, and we've talked about this in
prior calls that certainly the rollout of some of the additional parts of the Affordable Care Act is adding over $100
million for us, and so that's the biggest one-time issue. And of course, there – healthcare inflation is an issue that is
certainly a concern, and for many of us and that's been an area also that's been discussed in our discussions with our
employees. But the biggest impact is there's one-time additional expenses with the added cost per head and some of
those things that's driving up costs for an employee-intensive company like UPS.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And this year, we saw more – in 2014, more of it because of things like the reinsurance fee per
employee...
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: ...that you didn't see last year. So I think it won't be quite as dramatic as you move forward.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Okay, so one-time step up in cost but not just kind of one-time costs are going to go away next
year.

<Q - Tom Kim>: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask with regard to your net exposure to foreign currencies and if
you could share a little bit about the UPS sensitivity to a potential 10% change or swing in those currencies. Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, we are actually pretty well hedged for 2014. So for the major currencies of the euro, the
pound, the Canadian dollar, we've got spreads in place pretty well with the floor not too far off where the markets are
today and some upward potential. So that is a different story than last year. One area that present some challenge,
though, is some of these emerging market currencies are showing quite a bit of volatility. So that is a little bit of a risk
to us, but it is likely to be offset by the benefit in the developed markets that we're seeing.

the U.S. Domestic. You mentioned $125 million to $150 million added costs; that's a weather, incremental hires,
seasonal hires mix and then the $50 million of service refunds. And then I think you just answered, the $100 million is
above that. So is what's implied in your guidance that you're going to have about the same seasonal staffing next year?
And just if we could hone in a little bit more on that, please. Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, we do not expect to have to hire that many people. I mean part of that was the catch-up and
the challenges of some of the unexpected volume. Looking at the peak for next year, there is one additional day in the
period, Christmas is a day later, so the volume that builds up over the weekend and the late surge will be a little
smoother. So we will, hopefully, we do hire a lot of employees because of good robust demand. But as I said, there's a
point of reduced benefit as some of the stresses hit the network that caused us to hire more people than was optimal. So
we'd expect to have less hiring this year unless there's just incredible growth beyond the current expectations.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. And that increase is predominantly ORION, the $100 million?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: For the added cost for this year, it's the acceleration of ORION. It is some of the operating
changes as we're automating buildings. It is a number of things. IT expense will also be involved as we make some
investments, especially collaborating with customers to get detailed package information even on trailers that haven't
reached UPS yet. So it's a laundry list of things that we'll be working on to enhance our capabilities and ultimately
make us more productive and streamlined.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks for taking my question. Based on the acceleration of the ORION rollout, is it fair to
assume that you can complete the full implementation to all of the U.S. drivers by the end of 2015? And I was
wondering if you could give us some broad parameters for how to think about the cost savings once the initiative is
fully rolled out? For example, if you said each driver was able to drive one less mile per day per year, what would that
mean for annual cost savings? Just trying to get some broad strokes on that.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yes, the timeline, there'll still be several more years. So we'll be ramping well through 2016 for
the full rollout of ORION. It is a major undertaking. In general, as a ballpark number, saving a mile per day per driver
generates about $50 million of reduced operating expense for the company. And as we get a little further along, then
we'll fill you in more on the very specific experience that we're seeing because we're getting better at doing it and the
benefits are kicking in quicker. So this is a net investment year, though, as we ramp up and next year will also be a year
with significant velocity. So it's a little early for us to lock in on any specific external targets, but so far so good on that
front.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, fantastic. Thank you.

<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning. Could you please share some insight into freight forwarding, what happened this
quarter versus the market and maybe make a similar comparison as to the outlook for 2014? Thank you very much.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Sure. I'll have Jim talk about that.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: So if you look at forwarding, a couple of quarters ago, I talked about a concentration in a
couple of verticals as well as military. We said we needed to change that obviously in a business like UPS doesn't
change on a dime and so we take a prudent approach to that. We've worked through that for the last couple of quarters.
We feel like the first quarter, as the opening comments alluded to, will be the wraparound for us. Two through four will
be nice growth quarters for us in both tonnage as well as revenue quality. So we've been working through this. I would
say that's on the International Air Freight side, but there's o three other pieces to that business that we feel like are
performing very nicely, that being the North American forwarding piece, the brokerage piece, and our Ocean Freight
business that we built for a couple years. So we feel like we're turning the corner on it along with the small package
side and you'll see that as each quarter rolls out in 2014.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Any specific guidance in terms of growth versus market, how do you expect your positioning to
change compared to last year?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Well, I would only say the guidance we put out is pretty solid, and we'll stick with that
and each quarter we'll kind of update as we go.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. We are looking for mid-single digit revenue growth for the segment in aggregate and
margins of about 8%. So we've got a lot of good stuff going on. The ocean is performing very well and we're helping
customers find that balance of ocean and air forwarding so that you should see more good stuff coming from that.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Overall, the headwinds from industry overcapacity, would you see that easing? Or how would
you see it trend compared to last year?
<A - Andy Dolny>: Yes, this is Andy. We have to move on. We have others on the line so we're running out a little
time here. So we'll save that for our individual call.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you.
Operator
And we have a question from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you. Another question on cash deployment. You basically have one times your
EBITDA and debt on the books maybe a little less. Historically, $6.5 billion is not the right amount of cash for you
guys to keep on the books; it is probably closer to the $2 billion to $3 billion range. I heard the answer, we're thinking
of making some acquisitions. But the number of acquisitions I can think of that require that much cash is a very short
list. Why aren't we thinking about continuing the share repurchase or continuing to plow more of this cash back to
investors?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, Jeff, we continue to talk about that and the balance sheet, we do show about $5 billion at
year end of 2013. So we did deploy quite a bit of cash as we've said over $6 billion to shareowners last year. We'll
continue to look at that. Clearly, we're here to do what's right for investors and customers and we'll continue to look at
that. We are basically fulfilling our commitment of returning at least 100% of net income to shareowners. And the
discussion of whether to accelerate that, when to accelerate that clearly is something that we talk about frequently. So
for now, we'll keep doing what we said we'd do in living up to our commitments so you guys can anticipate and there
will likely be times when perhaps we get even more aggressive.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Thank you.

I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dolny.
Andy Dolny
Yeah. I'll turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Andy. Before we go, I want to just take a minute to recognize one of our team members who was participating
on our final earnings call. Andy Dolny has announced his retirement after almost 32 years as a dedicated UPSer. Those
of you on the call have come to know him in his Investor Relations role over the last several years. I know that I speak
for the rest of our team in thanking Andy for his wonderful service to our company. He keeps our meetings quite
interesting and he always represents the investors' perspective well.
Andy, all of us around this table and obviously UPS will miss you and we thank you for your contribution. By the way,
Andy will be in the office for the next several weeks and I am sure he will be in touch with most of you before he
leaves.
With that, thanks so much for listening to the call today and we will talk to you next quarter.
