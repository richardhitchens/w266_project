On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global
Commercial Operations; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research and Development; and our CFO, Paul Clancy.
I'll now turn the call over to George.
George A. Scangos
Okay. Thank, Claudine. This is a very strong quarter for Biogen Idec. I believe it represents the beginning of a new era
that includes increased economic participation in TYSABRI, the launch of TECFIDERA and the anticipated launch of
three additional products next year. The revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion, up 21% and non-GAAP earnings
were $2.30 per share, up 26% compared to the second quarter of 2012.
Those great results stem from the revenues from our entire portfolio of MS products, including AVONEX, TYSABRI
and now TECFIDERA. AVONEX continues to be a very strong part of the business, we're still early in the launch of
TECFIDERA, but AVONEX appears to be holding up well in this new competitive environment, and we believe that
the interferon franchise will be strengthened even more next year with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY.
Although TYSABRI had a somewhat challenging quarter in part due to the introduction of TECFIDERA and also the
financial dynamics that Paul will discuss later in the call, we believe that the efficacy of TYSABRI will result in
increasing usage in the future. Believe the recognition of the importance of treating MS aggressively and early, the
increase in understanding the risk stratification, the high-level of efficacy, and the potential of TYSABRI and other
indications all bode well for its long-term growth and we're optimistic about the future of TYSABRI.
The launch of TECFIDERA in the U.S. is going very well, which we believe reflects a broad recognition among
physicians and patients that this is a unique product. According to IMS, TECFIDERA outperformed all other MS drugs
in the first three months after launch. We believe that the excitement about TECFIDERA stems from a combination of
factors, including its product profile as an oral therapy with strong efficacy and solid safety, our reputation in an
understanding of the MS market; and very strong execution on the part of our U.S. commercial organization. We
overcame some early logistical challenges that resulted from the unexpectedly high early demand, and we now believe
that we're on a very solid trajectory and are excited about the future of the drug.
So in the U.S. we're off to a great start and recent approvals in Canada and Australia just add to the momentum.
TECFIDERA is an exciting product that we believe has the potential to shift the paradigm of treatment for MS patients.
So now let me comment briefly on the EU situation. As you know, on May 30, we announced that our plans to launch
TECFIDERA in Europe have been delayed to allow us to make TECFIDERA's entitlement to regulatory data
protection clear at the time of launch. At the time, we said that we believed that we were entitled to regulatory data
protection and we continue to believe so. Our process to clarify regulatory data protection is moving along, but it's
taking a little longer than we thought it would when we made the announcement on May 30, and it's difficult to
handicap the precise timing or the potential outcome of our efforts. So, we recognize that any delay of a valuable
therapy like TECFIDERA is frustrating for patients, for physicians, our shareholders. We'd like to be more transparent
about the process. We believe that would not be in all of our collective interest and could impact our ultimate success,
and so we're not going to give any more details at this time.
We do have patents covering TECFIDERA in the EU and we believe that they're strong. However, in Europe, it's more
difficult than it is in the U.S. to obtain injunctive relief that would prevent others from free riding on our investments,
while we enforce our IP. Consequently, we believe that it is important to launch with both intellectual property and
regulatory data protection and we're working to achieve that outcome.

So let me now move on to our other products. In the second quarter, we also made excellent progress toward the
potential launch of three additional therapies over the next year. Our PLEGRIDY marketing applications were recently
accepted by both the FDA and EMA. If approved, we believe PLEGRIDY could provide patients an efficacious
treatment option with less frequent dosing and an innovative auto-injector, which may position it as a preferred
interferon treatment option. We believe that the first-line injectable products, including the interferons in Copaxone
will increasingly compete on convenience as has been exemplified by the success of the AVONEX PEN. PLEGRIDY
may have the potential to become the leading drug in this class. We expect PLEGRIDY to launch in the middle of next
year in the U.S.
We've also been focused on the registration of our long-lasting, recombinant hemophilia product candidates,
ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE for the treatment of hemophilia B and hemophilia A respectively. We believe that our
innovative biologics have the potential to transform hemophilia care by addressing the biggest unmet need for these
patients, which is a reduction in the frequency of IV injections. We believe that each of these products offers a
substantial value proposition for patients and has the potential to provide improved and a reduced treatment burden.
Both are under review by the FDA, and we anticipate product launches in the first half of next year.
Although hemophilia is a new therapeutic area for Biogen, we believe that we're well positioned. We expect to be the
first to market with highly differentiated, long-lasting products. We bring great expertise in biologics manufacturing,
Process Sciences and specialty markets commercialization and we've built a hemophilia organization comprised of
many individuals with years of experience in the treatment of hemophilia. So although the company is new to the field,
our employees are not. They know the field and the field knows them. With the anticipated approval of these products
next year, we believe that we're prepared to bring important new therapies to the many patients who need them.
So, I'll now turn the call over the Tony Kingsley to discuss in detail the commercial results this quarter.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thanks, George. Our commercial performance during the second quarter was strong. In Q2, we were successful in
driving our longer-term goal of growing total MS patient share across our entire franchise. Q2 was the first quarter of
TECFIDERA commercialization in the U.S. and we've been very pleased with the launch to date. The U.S. commercial
organization planned and executed very well.
As expected, there was significant physician and patient excitement about the TECFIDERA product profile. In
addition, we believe the three-month launch delay caused by the PDUFA extension and extensive media coverage led
to heightened market awareness, which further increased demand for the product at launch. This pent-up demand
accounted for a meaningful portion of the uptake observed during the quarter.
In the upcoming quarters, we expect TECFIDERA new prescription volume to remain healthy, but will moderate to
more closely reflect the underlying patient start and switch dynamics of the MS market. Over 3,500 physicians have
prescribed TECFIDERA to date; approximately a quarter of TECFIDERA patients were not on prior therapy, while
approximately three quarters switched from other disease-modifying MS therapies. The source of switches appears
roughly in line with the market shares of MS therapies.
Early in the U.S. launch, a high number of JCV antibody positive TYSABRI patients switched to TECFIDERA, but
more recently switching from TYSABRI has been more in line with market share. We believe that physician and
patient reports of their experience with TECFIDERA have generally been favorable, while as expected flushing and
GI-related tolerability issues have been reported. From our discussions with prescribing physicians, we believe these
issues are largely viewed as manageable and we believe that very few patients so far have discontinued therapy because
of tolerability.
So after a very strong start, we continue to believe maximizing TECFIDERA performance over the longer term will
require strong and sustained commercial effort in what remains a very competitive market, and our focus has been on
two areas; physician awareness and streamlining patient access. Our physician awareness efforts have been robust as

our sales force has achieved its early goals of driving significant reach and frequency in physician calls to communicate
TECFIDERA's product profile, and the early breadth of physician prescribing speaks to that.
We also continue to work to improve patient access to TECFIDERA. As we expected, many plans have been
aggressive with placing usage restrictions on TECFIDERA, including prior authorizations and step edits, which creates
delays in getting patients started on drug and short-term frustrations for both patients and physicians' offices. Our
managed markets teams are in active discussions with payers to continue to improve formulary access.
On the government payer side, TECFIDERA was successfully added to the federal health care programs and is
available through Medicare Part D, Medicaid and the DA. However, each Part D plan and state has its own process for
updating its formulary.
Turning to AVONEX, we were pleased with AVONEX Q2 performance. For the quarter global AVONEX revenues
increased 2% versus the prior year. Globally, AVONEX gained market share year-to-date within the injectable class,
driven by strong commercial execution as well as continued interest in the AVONEX patent as convenience continues
to be a key differentiator in the injectable segment.
Moving to TYSABRI; second quarter global end-market sales decreased by 2% versus the prior year. As I mentioned,
in the U.S., a significant number of higher risk TYSABRI patients transitioned to TECFIDERA, which slowed
TYSABRI growth despite the fact that we believe we are continuing to generate solid demand. During the quarter,
approximately two thirds of the patients who discontinued TYSABRI stayed within our franchise and started
TECFIDERA. This creates another issue that we are well aware of and prepared for. Given that well over 1,000
higher-risk patients have transitioned from TYSABRI to TECFIDERA, we expect to see a number of cases of PML in
these patients just as has been observed in TYSABRI patients who have switched to other therapies.
We believe that our competition will try to make an issue out of this, but we believe the physician community expects
it. Our Medical Affairs team is having discussions with physicians, and we believe we are ready.
In the EU, we observed some softness in TYSABRI growth due to oral competition. Continued strong commercial
focus on TYSABRI's high-efficacy and differentiated product profile, coupled with risk stratification, remain very
important the success of this product.
Overall I'm very pleased with the execution of our commercial team and believe our MS franchise is well positioned
for continued success. We had said we believe TECFIDERA will become the leading oral treatment, and we've now
seen TECFIDERA's trajectory exceed all previous MS launches. As a result, we believe our MS franchise now has the
leading market share, both in the U.S. and globally. We know future success is not assured, so we're focused on
continuing our strong commercial execution and preparation for our upcoming launches.
I'll now turn the call over to Doug to discuss our recent R&D activities.
Douglas E. Williams
Thanks, Tony. This has been another productive and eventful quarter for our R&D organization. We presented data at a
number of medical meetings on our diverse late-stage and commercial portfolio, while advancing our early to
mid-stage pipeline. We believe our pipeline is maturing nicely, and with three potential new product launches in 2014
and multiple pivotal and proof-of-concept readouts expected behind those, our underlying drivers of growth continue to
look solid.
Our two product candidates for hemophilia, ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, are hopefully our next products to reach the
market. We, along with our partner Sobi, presented over 30 abstracts and gave 10 oral presentations on these products
at the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Meeting, reinforcing the value proposition that we believe
each of these products may potentially bring to patients. New data highlighted efficacy and safety findings, including
the control of bleeding during and after surgery and the treatment of acute bleeding episodes.

Data were also presented on the ability to assay ALPROLIX levels in patients, potentially enabling customized patient
dosing regimens. We anticipate data from our ongoing ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX pediatric studies in 2014. We
believe positive data from these pediatric studies should enable product submissions with the EMA and the opportunity
to seek expanded labeling for pediatric populations with the FDA.
During the quarter, we also presented additional new data on TECFIDERA at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis
Centers meeting, confirming that the majority of flushing and GI symptoms were mild to moderate in nature, and
demonstrating that aspirin has the potential to be effective in diminishing flushing-related adverse events.
In addition, a recently published Journal of Neurology manuscript examining subgroups from the Phase III DEFINE
study demonstrated that TECFIDERA was consistently effective across a broad set of patients with different
demographic and disease characteristics.
It's also been a busy quarter for TYSABRI, as we continue to focus on TYSABRI's powerful efficacy as its key
differentiating factor and the JCV assay as an effective patient management tool. At the European Neurology Society
meeting, we presented preliminary TYSABRI-related data showing that JCV antibody index levels correlate with PML
risk in certain patients with no prior immunosuppressant use. The index is a reflection of antibody titer, and certain
patients with higher titers appear to have increased PML risk. This research may allow further refinement of the PML
risk stratification tools already in broad clinical use and may allow better management of TYSABRI patients.
We also submitted an application for marketing authorization for TYSABRI in Japan, and we anticipate approval in the
first half of 2014. Enrollment of the Phase III ASCEND trial evaluating TYSABRI in SPMS was also completed in the
second quarter.
We continue to make progress with our mid-stage pipeline and expect three pivotal readouts over the next three years;
daclizumab in 2014, TYSABRI in SPMS in 2015, and potentially SMNRx in 2016. During that timeframe, we also
expect to have meaningful data readouts from our early-stage programs, including neublastin for neuropathic pain,
STX-100 for IPF, BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease, anti-CD40 ligand in SLE, anti-TWEAK in lupus nephritis and
anti-LINGO in acute optic neuritis and relapsing MS. So we believe we're on track to continue to bring new important
medicines to patients in areas of high unmet need and further ensure that we have major value drivers going forward.
I'll now pass the call to Paul to discuss our financial results.
Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Doug. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.06 in the second quarter. The differences between our
GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings presentation. The primary differences include $79 million
related to the amortization of acquired intangibles, $5 million in fair-value adjustments for contingent consideration and
$2 million related to stock compensation expense. This was partially offset by the tax impact on these items. Our
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the second quarter were $2.30.
As has been the case over the last couple of quarters, we experienced a couple of puts and takes within the P&L. Of
note was the benefit of approximately $82 million of revenue related to TECFIDERA inventory, which added
approximately $0.20 to our diluted EPS. And we made progress towards settling our TYSABRI pricing dispute with
the Italian National Medicines Agency or AIFA. I'll talk in more detail about these as I walk down the P&L.
Total revenue for the second quarter grew 21% to $1.7 billion. Q2 AVONEX worldwide revenue grew 2% to $774
million, as unit volume was flat versus prior year. In the U.S., AVONEX revenue grew 3% in Q2 to $479 million. U.S.
unit volumes decreased 5% versus prior year, partially attributable to patients transitioning to TECFIDERA. And U.S.
inventory at wholesalers for AVONEX ended at approximately two weeks this quarter.
Internationally, Q2 AVONEX revenue was $295 million, a decrease of 1% compared to prior year. International
AVONEX unit by increased 3% versus prior year. Foreign exchange and hedging impact had a minimal impact this
quarter, although compared to a gain of $10 million in the second quarter of 2012. TYSABRI worldwide in-market

sales were $387 million in the second quarter, down 2%.
I'll point out two items of note. First the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by channel swings, and second, the
international TYSABRI revenue situation was unfavorably impacted by the additional expense related to AIFA.
Second quarter in-market U.S. TYSABRI revenue was $218 million, an increase of 3%. Q2 U.S. unit volume decreased
5% versus prior year. Recall, during the first quarter of 2013, we increased inventory levels in anticipation of the asset
transfer from A-LONG to Biogen Idec. This equated to in-market revenues of approximately $26 million, increasing
Q1 and depressing Q2.
Q2 international TYSABRI revenue was $169 million. Earlier this month, we agreed in principle, with the pricing
committee of AIFA to settle all claims related to the ongoing pricing dispute. This settlement is subject to approval by
the Italian National Authorities and the AIFA Board, which we expect later this year. The result, from an accounting
perspective, is that we have a charge in Q2 to revenue and anticipate a benefit later this year.
Specifically, TYSABRI product revenues were negatively impacted this quarter as we recorded a liability of
approximately $20 million for a portion of this settlement. Recorded this adjustment as the likelihood of making up
payments to settle AIFA claims was now probable and the amount could be estimated. Given the standards for revenue
recognition, the remaining portion of the settlement will be recorded upon approval as a net benefit to revenue. We
anticipate recording this revenue benefit of at least $80 million in the fourth quarter.
Now moving to TECFIDERA; second quarter TECFIDERA, its first quarter on the market, was strong as we reported
$192 million of revenue. While we don't plan to provide TECFIDERA patient numbers, I do want to note that the IMS
data to-date has been a good representation of unit demand this quarter. In the quarter, TECFIDERA results include an
inventory build as approximately $82 million of revenue remained in the distribution channel at the end of the quarter.
Wholesalers and specialty pharmacies built inventories in anticipation of patient demand to ensure patients experience
limited disruptions in drug supply. Absent this inventory build, it was still a very strong quarter for TECFIDERA, as
we estimate revenue generated from underlying patient demand was approximately $110 million.
FAMPYRA revenue was $17 million, while FUMADERM revenues were $16 million. U.S. RITUXAN sales were
$811 million in the second quarter. Our profit share and expense reimbursement from the U.S. business was $271
million for the second quarter. In royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $18 million.
This resulted in $289 million of revenue from unconsolidated joint business in the second quarter. Royalties were $38
million and we recorded $11 million of corporate partner revenue in Q2.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $231 million or 13%
of revenue. This increase relates to the TYSABRI contingent payments, as well as 100% of the third-party TYSABRI
royalties, which are now booked through cost of goods sold. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was $327 million or 19% of
revenues. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $430 million or 25% of revenues, an increase of 43% over last year,
driven by increased costs associated with the TECFIDERA launch. Other income and expense was an expense of $10
million. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 24%.
In the second quarter, our weighted average diluted shares were $239 million and we ended the quarter with $775
million in cash and marketable securities, bringing us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which were $2.30
for the second quarter.
Now turning to our full-year 2013 guidance; we're increasing our guidance largely the result of the strength seen early
in the TECFIDERA launch, modestly offset by the impact on our other MS therapies. We now expect total revenue
growth of approximately 22% to 23%. As George mentioned, given the prolongation and uncertainty of the EU
process, we do not expect TECFIDERA EU revenue to be meaningful in 2013. For TYSABRI, our prior guidance had
assumed an AIFA settlement in 2013. We're pleased by the recent decision and expect to record a revenue benefit of at
least $80 million in the fourth quarter of this year.
Moving to the expense lines of the P&L; we anticipate cost of goods sold to be between 13% and 14% of sales. R&D
expense is expected to be between 21% and 23% of sales. Our balance of year R&D forecast continues to include up to

$75 million earmarked for potential new business development opportunities, and up $35 million anticipated upfront in
milestone payments in the second half.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 24% to 26% of total revenue. We continue to see 2013 as an
investment year in SG&A, building out the commercial efforts for TECFIDERA and pre-launch efforts for hemophilia
in the U.S. And we continue to expect SG&A leverage post 2013.
Our effective tax rate in 2013 is expected to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. For the balance of year, we
expect effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%, driven by a larger percentage of our revenues being generated in
the U.S. As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share results between $8.25 and $8.50 and GAAP earnings
per share to be between $7.28 and $7.53.
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.
George A. Scangos
Okay. Thanks, Paul. This was an excellent quarter for Biogen Idec. TECFIDERA's launch has gone very well, and we
believe that TECFIDERA is on its way to becoming a major drug that provides solid efficacy and a good safety profile
to large numbers of MS patients. We continue to believe in the future of TYSABRI and are working to make sure that
patients and physicians understand the value that the product brings to patients in need of high efficacy treatment.
AVONEX continues to do well and we believe our interferon franchise should be strengthened even further next year
with the anticipated launch of PLEGRIDY.
So as we said many times, we believe that we're well-positioned in MS with leading drugs in the oral category, the high
efficacy category and the injectable category. Beyond MS, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are now under active review
also with anticipated U.S. launches next year. We believe that these products have the potential to transform
hemophilia care and we're excited about their potential.
Our pipeline continues to move forward and we expect to have meaningful readouts of pivotal and proof-of-concept
trials in each of the next several years. So we're at the beginning of a new era for Biogen Idec. We're a global leader in
MS and our goal is to strengthen our position even further, at the same time as we expand into new indications.
It's an exciting time to be here. We've accomplished a lot, but we fully recognize that we have a lot of work ahead of
us. We know that if we execute well, our future is likely to be bright. We're working hard, staying focused and making
sure that we achieve our ambitious goals. Achievement of our goals to-date is the result of a lot of effort and dedication
on the part of all the employees of Biogen Idec, and I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank all of them.
And with that we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is
open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Limit to one is going to be very
difficult for me, but I'll do my best. Maybe for Paul, can you tell us how many weeks of TECFIDERA were in the
channel and whether or not you expect there to be any kind of a drawdown in the 3Q? And -or if you think that these
are the right levels? And then just a related question on the tax rate, I thought TECFIDERA was domiciled – the IP was
domiciled overseas, so profits generated on that no matter where you sold it would be a little bit lower. Could you just
clarify that situation? Thanks a lot and congratulations on the quarter.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Excellent. Thanks for the two questions, Mark.

<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: That was one -
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: One and a half. Yeah. So, look, we certainly wanted to go out of our way to point that the
breakout between TECFIDERA channel inventory and in-market patient demand. I think people got that pretty clearly,
it appears to me. By definition, the weeks in the channel at the end is like, whatever divided by the 13 weeks, right. So I
think what I'd point you to is a couple of things as it relates to that, one is that we take the weeks in the channel very
seriously obviously with AVONEX, with TYSABRI, and in this quarter we specifically didn't want to really manage
that hard because of the launch dynamics. We wanted to make sure there were no patient supply disruptions of any sort
related to that. And particularly in the launch, you don't actually know which SPPs are going to be the ones taking off
versus the others. So that was a dynamic that was probably a little bit more than we thought in terms of the inventory,
but was all to try to support the launch of the product, which was quite successful.
As we go forward, what I would guide you to – and we'll try to point out these dynamics as we go forward – but my
expectation is that, for Q3 and for Q4 that our recorded TECFIDERA numbers in the United States will largely line up
with the in-market patient demand. Said another way, what's in the channel now, which is plus or minus 80, is probably
in the magnitude of what to expect at the end of Q3 and what to expect at the end of Q4. So hopefully that helps.
The tax question is obviously much more complex, but in a given year your effective tax rate has to mirror the cash
flow, the projected cash flow. And given the strength of TEC in the United States, that puts a little bit of short-term
upward pressure on the tax rate, greater than what we actually expected. So, a good problem to have given the U.S.
launch, and I think it's temporary as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Schmidt, Ph.D.>: My congrats as well, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify one or
maybe one and a half things that Tony said on the TECFIDERA launch. First, with regard to his comments about there
being some pent-up demand and us expecting or looking to expect maybe a decline in new patient starts, is that
something that you're already observing or is that just your assessment of how this launch might play out? And then, I
guess secondly, with the TYSABRI transition to the TECFIDERA, what rate of PML might we expect based on your
experience with other TYSABRI drug transitions?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Eric. Maybe I'll take the first and have Doug answer the second. So, I would
think about it this way. If you take the U.S. market patient flows at sort of steady state, all in, the new starts, switches,
returning quitters, quitters going out, it runs at a rate of about 1,000 to 1,200 patients per week. You can do your patient
numbers however you want, but I mean just looking at the IMS data, it's pretty clear that TECFIDERA alone was
running at something like twice that rate in the second quarter. So, look, we clearly think that's going to come down
and moderate over time, but we remain very optimistic about what the product profile is and the acceptance. So that's
the way I'd think about that.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And Eric, this is Doug. The answer to your question with respect to the rate of PML, I
think it's very difficult to come up with a number or to make any predictions about that. I think that what Tony was
highlighting was the fact that we had a large number of patients who rolled off of TYSABRI and onto TECFIDERA.
Many of them are probably out at or beyond two years and are JC positive, and just like we've seen with GILENYA
and Copaxone and other disease-modifying drugs that patients have been rolled onto, we would anticipate seeing some
cases of PML. And we'd expect to see that relatively soon, just given what we've seen with the other DMTs and the
kinetics of that event. You recall that the TYSABRI label says to monitor patients for six months after they come off
the drug for the emergence of PML, and so that's the sort of expected window in which these cases would emerge, but I
can't give you a specific rate or number.

performance. It doesn't sound like you guys saw it coming much better than we did initially. My question related to
regulatory data protection, you've received approval in Canada and Australia, but highlighted on this call the need for
regulatory data protection in Europe. Could you tell us about what the regulatory data protection you have is in Canada
and Australia and what's distinct about the exposure you view yourselves as having to generic entry there compared to
Europe?
<A - George A. Scangos>: We're all kind of looking around the room here. Look, I think the issue with regulatory data
protection is unique to Europe and doesn't exist in other geographies around the world, and so it's not an issue in
Australia or Canada or the U.S.

Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations. Probably for George. George, we've
had a number of TECFIDERA side effect scares over the last year, January, the [ph] re-malignancy (37:24) issues.
April, the New England Journal [ph] PML, fumaric acid (37:26) issues, and last week, pneumonia. They've all turned
out to be storms in a teacup. What other scares might you anticipate, and how would you help us prepare for them? And
this really isn't a second question, and I don't want to guide your answer, but can you just remind us about your
post-launch monitoring systems, particularly with Tony's comments about PML? How quickly can you report back to
us when those cases pop up? Thank you.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Yeah. Thanks, Ravi. Look, there's no reason at this point to expect other issues. I'm sure
they will crop up. As you said, we had the case this week that turned out to be erroneous and was erroneously reported
and turns out to be unlikely to have anything to do with TECFIDERA. There will probably be other ones of those as we
go forward. Look, with respect to PML, I can just reiterate what Doug said. Patients coming off of TYSABRI are at
risk for development of PML for a number of months after they discontinue therapy, but I think in total about 12% of
our PML cases come from patients who have discontinued. Some of them are on other therapies, some of them are not,
and we're likely to see the same phenomenon here, right? And so we are aware of that. We count those cases in our
monthly reports when we issue our TYSABRI PML case reports regardless of what drugs patients have switched onto,
and TECFIDERA will be treated just like we treat any other drug.

Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah. Thanks very much. I know you're not commenting on EU TECFIDERA, but can we
infer from your comments, Paul, when you said that revenues were not expected to be meaningful in 2013 that you still
hope to launch TECFIDERA, believe that it's possible that you could launch TECFIDERA, in the back half of the year?
And then just, I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on PLEGRIDY, given the success of
TECFIDERA so far. You mentioned that you believe this drug could be a leader of interferon, but how we think about
the class given the strength of oral adoption to date? Thank you.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: I'll take the first part, and Tony will take the second part, Rachel. Thanks for the question. Look,
it's really – the revenue guidance – we obviously as everyone knows don't break out product guidance. I think people
would love that, but we actually just don't do that. And the revenue guidance as it relates to the TECFIDERA EU
number is just not meaningful. So that really just doesn't say anything specific on the timing. The timing's hard to

handicap as George had mentioned, the outcome's obviously hard to handicap. So we're working constructively, the
process is moving along, and that's really all we can say kind of at this point. Tony, do you want to grab...?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah. So thank you. Look, I'll just repeat our theory of the market, which we've
talked about a lot of times, is we think injectables will compress as a class, orals will grow and high efficacy will grow.
Orals, with the launch of TECFIDERA, are off to a fast start, which obviously we're excited about. The mid to
long-term trajectory of that, we still think injectables are going to be a meaningful portion of the market. We still think
convenience is going to be the differentiator. We still think that the PLEGRIDY profile is potentially attractive there,
and again a less-frequent injection with a good safety profile, in a mechanism which is interferon is going to be
appropriate for patients and may be an attractive alternative relative to the oral offerings as well. I don't think our
fundamental belief set on that has changed yet. We'll have to see how the market evolves overall.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Can you hear me?
<A>: Yes. We can.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have like seven questions on RDP if you don't
mind.
<A>: We have one answer.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Fantastic. Take the next caller. So just a quick – I'm going to kind of try to sneak them
together. TYSABRI, just help us understand if you can, what percentage of patients are sort of JCV-positive. I'm trying
to get kind of an understanding how do we think about the switch rate sort of over time? And then second, again, and if
you just can clarify when you guys say with respect to RDP you're trying to help explain the status to all parties
involved. I don't know if you can explain to us what that means.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Maybe I'll quickly take the first part of that question. I think the last time we talked about this,
the best insight we have is obviously United States on TYSABRI. But we think that outside the United States the
numbers I'll kind of share is indicative as well. But if you think of it literally like 90 days ago, we had shared that we
thought about two thirds of the patients on TYSABRI were JCV-negative, and we actually think that's accelerating. So
it's probably north of that now and that's fine. That's actually quite good, right? This is a remarkable product for those
type of patients and we think it'll continue to chug along, never getting to 100% the majority of the patients being on
JCV negative.

<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for the question. I was just looking at your guidance. I know you said, Paul, you
don't give specific product guidance. But I think you did make a mention in the past seeing AVONEX being relatively
flat this year versus last year. I just was wondering if you can update us on that given what you're seeing one quarter
into TECFIDERA? And then on RDP I know you don't want to give any insight there, but anything you can comment
with respect to how Sanofi's decision on AUBAGIO recently impacted how you're thinking about TECFIDERA?
Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Nothing different, Terry, thanks for the question. Nothing different really on the AVONEX kind
of thinking. So it's plus or minus. As you know, plus or minus on what is close to a $3 billion number is a big deal and I
appreciate that and I understand that. But I think the trends on AVONEX are largely as we expected and I think what
you're seeing in our guidance on the top-line and the bottom-line is just kind of really pulling through what is
fundamentally a stronger U.S. TECFIDERA launch than we had expected. So, great news on that.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: George, on the RDP?

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on the execution on this launch.
Very impressive. Tony, I was hoping you could quantify how large you think the pool of returning quitters is in the
U.S. and Europe and whether or not you think of it as a bolus or longer-term source of patient demand? And then
related – not sure if you can give us this, but actually what percent discontinued on TECFIDERA in the quarter and
whether or not that rate is changing as we get into 3Q? Thank you.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks. So, I think we said in the past, we think the quitter pool, the longer sort of
quitter pool is north of 100,000. I think I've always talked about that as an area of opportunity, but been cautious
because those patients go off for a complex set of reasons, often aren't looking for therapy. And it's relatively difficult
to activate them. We've said about a quarter of the patients who started on TECFIDERA in the quarter were not on
prior therapy. Our sense is returning quitters are a piece of that, but it's relatively small. But we think over time there's
some potential there, but we remain cautious about that. We haven't given out the percentage discontinuations. I would
just repeat what I said in the script, which it is very small to-date.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah. And just I think discontinuations, compliance rate, all important factors, Matt, as you
know, for the balance of year and years beyond. It's just early days. I mean, literally even for us looking at the data,
nothing really to report, but it literally is just early days on that. And we've got programs in place to try to optimize
that, but it's early days really in terms of the revenue curve.

<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah. So, look a significant portion of the patients that switched off TYSABRI to
TECFIDERA were JCV-positive. There's a mix in terms of the length of, as always the case, in terms of the length of
treatment on TYSABRI [ph] per imminosuppression. (48:16) But the point was, there's two things. One, not
surprisingly with a new alternative in the market a number of patients switch relatively quickly, and we think that
leveled out closer to market share over time. And second, there's a meaningful pool of this higher-risk group of patients
that Doug talked about that are in there.
In terms of oral pressure outside the United States, to be explicit, GILENYA is competing very hard in Europe against
TYSABRI and we have some work to do to continue to push TYSABRI's efficacy profile and risk stratification. That's
really what the indication there is.

Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, you mentioned switching in line with the
market of MS therapies on the TECFIDERA. But is switching coming evenly across the interferons, given that I think
you mentioned that you're marketing toward doctors that may not prescribe as much AVONEX. And I thought I'd
throw this one in. On slide 18 you have a lot of pipeline products that read out in the second half of the year of next
year, and looking into the next TECFIDERA, which one of those proof-of-concept trials do you think would have the
greatest – will provide the greatest insight into the product success? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks. It's Tony. So look, plus/minus on the switching relative to market share, we
track it week by week. It's early days. We believe that AVONEX should outperform on a relative basis among the
interferons. It's just very early days in terms of numbers, and we're not surprised that it's roughly at market share. So I
think it'll take a little while to develop some more noticeable trends on where the switches are and whether there's
differentiation across the therapies, which we believe will happen. But it's early days.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And this is Doug. I'll take the question about the pipeline readouts. I think that in terms of
insights into which of these will go to Phase III, which I think is the nature of your question, I think certainly the ISIS
data early in 2014 is going to be very important in terms of creating, hopefully, some additional excitement around that
program and desire to move that forward into registrational studies. It's the repeat dose data that will be available to us
early next year that hopefully will confirm that there's efficacy of that product in that disease and that would lead us
right into a very accelerated Phase III program.
I'd say all of the Phase IIs are likely to be important in the context of generating enthusiasm for the registrational
studies. STX-100 will basically give us the dose to move into a Phase-IIb proper proof-of-concept study. LINGO, we'll
see the optic neuritis data. I'd see that as proof of biology and not necessarily as the data that would really get us
excited about the product, which will come from the relapsing remitting study in 2015. And then the anti-TWEAK data
will come later.
But all of those are really critical studies. They are large enough, they are designed with endpoints that we think are
going to be meaningful in terms of deciding where we go with those programs, and hopefully those will all move to
Phase III.

physicians that want to prescribe TECFIDERA are currently holding back from doing so until reimbursement is
streamlined and their patients are ensured continuity on the drug once they initiate treatment. So the second part of the
question is really whether you have any color on the proportion of patients or physicians that are still on the sidelines
until reimbursement and the landscape is mature? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Good question. Maybe I'll take them in reverse order. So 3,500 physicians have
written already. So you can take some comment about who's on the sidelines. There's not that bad of a – depending on
how deep you go in the deck, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000 are kind of the key where you get 80:20 in MS prescription in this
market. So, we're comfortable at the signal about a broad acceptance of the product profile, and we're also comfortable
that there are a lot of physicians writing the product. Certainly there are cases, I'm sure, where physicians have had
frustration with getting patients started on therapy and payer dynamics. That's geographically different. It can be locally
very different depending on the payer mix.
Our patient services and managed market teams are working with offices and trying to work through those things on a
case-by-case basis. We think we've cleared what were some of the early hurdles that were just, frankly, part – a
function of very, very high demand at the outset. So we know there's some frustration out there. We're engaging with
the physician offices constantly, and we feel like we've largely worked through some of the early operational issues.
In terms of reimbursement, we're comfortable where we are. Again, we anticipated that we would have payers placing
restrictions. We anticipated and communicated that step at [indiscernible] (53:56), et cetera. We're working through
that. We, I think anticipated that's a kind of six- to nine-month process typically to work through with payers. In
process, we feel like it's moving in the right direction and we're comfortable with where we are.

was sort of helping out with the reimbursement process. Maybe you could help us with how many patients or what
percent of what was going on in the quarter was from QuickStart? And did they all switch on to commercial pain drug?
And how does that dynamic play into say Q3 and ongoing quarters?
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Good question. So QuickStart is our program to help bridge patients when the
reimbursement is being adjudicated. Less than 10% in QuickStart. The conversion rate, we are converting people out of
QuickStart over time. There's different pace for the people who are in there depending on how hard it is to work
through the individual payer issues. But we think we're working through that backlog and under 10% in QuickStart.

comment that was made earlier regarding SG&A leverage going forward beyond this year. I'm just curious if we should
take that to mean your SG&A leverage is going to increase just based on the additional products? Or is there a way that
you can increase SG&A leverage by reallocating the promotional effort within your MS franchise? And when would
you start to consider that? Thank you.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah. Great question, John. I think I was referring more to the former than the latter.
So obviously, leverage is both the numerator and the denominator. So, we are hopeful that we're going to have some
continued top-line growth, but I think when you combine that with our expectations that over the last 18, 24 months,
over the next kind of six months, we have been making big investments in SG&A to support pre-launch commercial
efforts, very much the obvious. We didn't want to be penny wise and pound foolish with the TECFIDERA launch.
That's proven so far to be a very good judgment. And but a lot of that build will – we've moved towards containing that

build and particularly in the U.S., we'll have some of that build ahead of us in multiple sclerosis for EU, assuming the
process moves forward. And we have some of that build for hemophilia ahead of us.
But then we're kind of left with leveraging that. The question of is there MS, within MS leverage within kind of how
we manage that? Tony and I have talked openly about that on these calls and I think we've purposefully left it a
question that we'll continue to reconsider and think about over the more multi-year time period.

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much for taking the question. If I could stay with the same theme, Paul, again on
SG&A leverage for 2014. But in your guidance, which we appreciate, the SG&A numbers as a percent of revenue as
you know, actually stayed flat. So by definition the absolute number increases. And can you provide any information
about
what those dollars will actually be earmarked towards? And within the same context, if in fact there is a share shifts in
the ABCR category or away from injectables, certainly in the U.S., Tony, I'd be interested in your thoughts as to
whether there is that share shift away from at least promotional spend on the AVONEX front, regardless of
PLEGRIDY next year. Thanks again.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Okay. No, good question. I think, Tony, it's in the range, right. I mean a little bit of a range, so I
don't expect SG&A to be going up dollar-for-dollar with the amount that revenue is going up on the guidance numbers.
So there's some modest variable spending in SG&A that comes along, associated with extra revenue. We're trying to
make sure that any of the operational issues on TECFIDERA from a supply perspective, from a reimbursement
perspective that we're well funding this. So that's really what's it's intended to kind of imply.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Tony, in terms of the share shift, good question. We're constantly looking at that. I
think it's a little early in the evolution of the market to make a call on that but we're obviously constantly think – we
continue to think we're happy with the success of TECFIDERA and where we think it's headed. We continue to think
the injectables will be a meaningful portion of market for some time to come. We want to out-compete in that area and
we'll get the appropriate level of resource against that. But it's something we're constantly looking at a balance across
the franchise. And I'll remind you, we have a franchise with a goal in patients across the franchise and as you think
about SG&A leverage in the next couple of years, you have new competitors coming in. The market is getting more
crowded, not less crowded. So there are going to be a lot of people to compete with. So we're very mindful of that as
well.

for the great TECFIDERA launch. I was wondering if could give us any more information on that patient who died of
pneumonia after stopping TECFIDERA, details like lymphocyte counts before or during and after treatment? If any
particular culprit has been found for their lung infection? Maybe just help talk us through attributes of that case that
give you the confidence that it's not that related to the drug. Thanks.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Sure. This is Doug. I'll be happy to take that question. I think with respect to lymphocyte
counts, we don't have the specific information on this patient at this moment. We're still investigating the case. But
what I can say is that if you look back at the Phase III experience with the product that the kinetics of lymphocyte drop
in patients that had it, tends to occur much later than what we've seen in terms of – this is a patient that was on drug for
five and a half weeks and then came off for two and a half weeks before they passed away. So I think there's a
disconnect in the kinetics of any sort of lymphocyte issues here. But we don't have the lymphocyte counts on this

particular patient.
Again, I would point you back to the Phase III experience where there was no signal in terms of increased infection risk
in patients who received TECFIDERA. So I think that our conclusion based on the information we have available to us
is sort of two fold. Number one, the cause of death was not GI complications as reported in the media. Number two, it's
pretty clear that this was bilateral pneumonia in this patient. But there's no suspected effect of TECFIDERA on
increasing the risk of infection based on experience we have to-date. So, I think we feel pretty confident that this was
an unfortunate set of circumstances in this individual patient that doesn't implicate TECFIDERA.
