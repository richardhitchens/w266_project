Turning to our earnings update. The fourth quarter marked another quarter of strong progress. Our core businesses of
Analog and Embedded Processing grew again with combined revenue up 13% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.27
billion came in at the middle of the expected range that we communicated to you in October. Earnings per share were
$0.76 and included a $0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit, and a $0.02 benefit from
gains on sales of assets. Without these two items, our earnings would have been in the middle of our expected range.
In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially
on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term. Free cash flow for the year
was $3.5 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of
20% to 30%. This is a 3-percentage point improvement from a year-ago period.
We believe this reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which
includes our growing 300 millimeter output and the opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the
business. In 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and
dividends.
In the fourth quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 14% from a year ago led by Power Management. High Volume Analog & Logic, High
Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. This is the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year growth
for Analog. Embedded Processing revenue grew 11% from a year ago due to growth in processors, microcontrollers
and connectivity; each of which increased by about the same amount. It is notable that connectivity grew at the fastest
rate as we continue to see more products being connected. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year
growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to legacy wireless and custom ASIC products.
Turning to distribution. Resales increased 14% from a year ago, consistent with our combined revenue growth of
Analog and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory decreased by a week from a year ago to a historically low level
of just under four-and-a-half weeks. This level has decreased over the past few years because we structurally changed
how our inventory is managed in the distribution channel with our consignment program.
This quarter we continued to support more of our distribution sales from consignment inventory and now have about
60% of our distribution revenue on consignment, up about 15 percentage points from a year ago. With this program,
inventory sits on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when our distributors pull products from our
consignment inventory that's stored at the distributor's location. We carry higher levels of inventory on TI's balance
sheet with this program, which has several benefits, such as minimizing impact due to changes in distribution channel
inventory and giving us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
Turning to our end markets. In 2014, industrial and automotive combined were 44% of TI's revenue, up a couple of
percentage points from last year. Specifically, industrial made up 31% of TI's revenue, automotive 13%, personal
electronics 29%, communications equipment 17%, enterprise systems 6%, and other 4%. We continue to refine our
understanding of our customers' end markets with better tools and software. On our website, we've included the last
two years of updated market estimates and we've identified the sectors inside of each of those markets for your
reference.
Finally, let me make a few observations about the year overall. For 2014, Analog and Embedded Processing revenue
grew a combined 12%; with Analog up 13% and Embedded up 12%. We gained market share in both businesses again
in 2014. These two key businesses were 83% of TI's revenue for the year, up from 79% in 2013. Because they now
make up more of our revenue, they're driving top line growth for the company. TI revenue overall grew 7% in 2014.
Now, Kevin, will review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.

Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.90 billion, or 58% of revenue. Gross
profit increased 16% from the year-ago quarter. This gross profit reflects higher revenue, increased factory loadings,
and an improved product portfolio focused on Analog and Embedded Processing that benefits from our efficient
manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses. Combined R&D and SG&A expense of $740 million was down $67 million from a year
ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously
announced. That restructuring is now essentially complete and we achieved a little more than our estimated annualized
savings.
Acquisition charges were $82 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles and non-cash
expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $27 million benefit due to gains on sales of assets.
Operating profit was $1.10 billion or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 60% from the year-ago quarter.
Operating margin for Analog was 38.7%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 17.0%, more than doubling
from a year ago as we benefit from our investments for growth and as we executed our restructuring plan to better align
resources with the opportunities that we are pursuing.
While this is a solid progress, we still have work to do in this business. We expect Embedded operating margins to
continue to increase as our investments in R&D and SG&A will continue to drive top line growth while we hold these
expenses flat.
Net income in the fourth quarter was $825 million or $0.76 per share. As a reminder, earnings per share included a
$0.05 benefit for the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and a benefit of $0.02 from the gains on sales of
assets.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations
was $1.27 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 117, slightly above our model range, but a number that we are
quite comfortable with. It is consistent with the growing portion of our product demands, being supported with
consignment inventory versus customer-owned inventory.
We believe these consignment arrangements give us better real-time feedback to end-market demand allowing us to
better manage our factories and maintain short lead-times. We expect consignment inventory to continue to increase
over the coming years as distribution becomes a growing portion of our business. We will monitor the appropriateness
of our current model of 105 days to 115 days of inventory and possibly update this model in the next year or so.
Capital expenditures were $125 million in the quarter. In 2014, cash flow from operations was $3.89 billion, up 15%
from the same period a year ago. For the year, capital expenditures were $385 million or 3% of revenue. As a reminder,
our long-term expectation is for capital expenditures to be about 4% of revenue.
Free cash flow for the year was $3.50 billion or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 18% higher than a year ago. As
we've said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing
shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or [ph] protectively (9:59)
reinvested in the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow plus any proceeds we
receive from exercises of equity compensation minus net debt retirement.
In the fourth quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $698 million of our stock for a total return of
$1.05 billion. Total cash returned in 2014 was $4.15 billion, which is 3% higher than the prior year. Outstanding share
count was reduced by 3.3% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns
demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders;
fundamental to our commitment to return cash and our cash management and tax practices.
We ended the fourth quarter with $3.54 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities own 82% of our
cash. Because our cash is largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and
repurchasing our stock. TI orders in the quarter were $3.18 billion, up 11% from a year ago.

Turning to our outlook. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in the first quarter. At the
middle of this range, revenue would increase 7% from a year ago. We expect first quarter earnings per share to be in
the range of $0.57 to $0.67. Restructuring charges will be essentially nil. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash
amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five
years.
Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 is about 30%. And this is the tax rate you should use for the
first quarter and for the year. The rate is higher than the last year because of an expected increase in profits and does
not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.
In summary, the fourth quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in
Analog and Embedded Processing and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation and a broad sales channel.
The result is diverse and long-lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution, being
disciplined in allocating our capital, and our firm belief that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of
shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
Dave Pahl
Vicki, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of...

provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up.
Vicki?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Danely with Citi.
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Good quarter. Kevin, I guess if you had to characterize the
overall environment now versus, say, a quarter ago or a year ago; would you say, broadly speaking, not much has
changed, we're still in this kind of fine roughly seasonal environment, or have you seen any changes in visibility of
your overall business?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Chris, I think you said it well. It probably hasn't really changed all that much. There was a
slight change in our book-to-bill on a year-over-year basis. This quarter was about 0.97, the year-ago quarter was 0.94.
But, frankly, because more and more of our orders are coming in on consignment, I think book-to-bill means less and
less about a particular of where our revenue is going.
So I think that to summarize our sense, it's more steady as it goes; just like we've seen for the last few years, of an
economy just kind of growing along on a steady basis and we're trying to take advantage [ph] of the best from that
(13:57).

<A - Dave Pahl>: And, Chris, let me just add just the other things that we see. If you look at our inventory, it's at a
healthy level. Our channel inventories are actually down a week, as I said earlier, from a year ago, just under
four-and-a-half weeks. Our lead times remain consistent. Our cancellations and reschedules remain very, very low. And
in addition, we continue to deliver products on-time for customers. So those types of things are always a good
indication for the overall environment too. Do you have a follow-up?
<Q - Christopher Brett Danely>: Yeah. So it sounds like things are pretty normal [indiscernible] (14:36). Can you
give us any sense of the relative growth rates of your major product lines this year? What you're expecting between
Analog, Embedded and the Other stuff?
<A - Kevin P. March>: We don't try to forecast out a year on the major product lines or even at the company level. I
will point out that both of those product lines turned in another year of market share gains. And certainly, we're
working really hard to do that for another year. And we'll just have to see how the year turns out. So thanks, Chris, and
we'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
We'll go next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi. Thank you. On the inventory front, are we to assume now that your visibility now
vis-à-vis in the past is higher also because of a higher percentage is consignment [ph] off the disti (15:34) and within
that – that gives you better visibility? Is that the right way to think about it? So the days are going up versus what your
targeted range is and really not comparable to if we look at the last five-year and 10-year median. And then I had a
quick follow-up.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Ambrish. I don't know that I would necessarily go to improved visibility, but we do get,
I'd say, a much more improved, a real-time feedback from what's actually going on with true end demand for our
products.
And the real benefit of that is that we can adjust our factories on a real-time basis whereas, as you pointed out, if you
went back a number of years we carried far fewer days of inventory. But the signal as to how fast our products are
actually being consumed in the end market also took a lot longer to get to us, and so we'd respond later. Now we can
respond much more quickly. So it's less a question of improved visibility as it is a question of much more real-time
feedback as to just how fast our products are being consumed.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay. Thanks for the clarification, Kevin. That's what I meant, because we always get
into this debate in cycles about sell-in and sell-through. My quick question is, what should we be modeling for CapEx
for this year? Thank you.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, I'd continue to recommend that you assume that we will average about 4% of our
revenues on CapEx, on average, over multi-year period. Some years might be a little lighter, like it was this past year,
where we came at about 3% in 2014. But, on average, we expect 4%; and that's how we build our own internal models.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Great. Thanks, Ambrish. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
Next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the good results. Kevin, 90 days ago
when you were talking about OpEx for the December quarter, you said that looking back a year ago and how it flowed
a year ago was probably a good model. And you even mentioned that it'd probably be a good model going into the
calendar first quarter. Does that statement still hold? Or can you help us understand the puts and takes on OpEx going

into the March quarter, especially around some seasonal costs?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, John, you're exactly right. So going from fourth quarter to the first quarter, the best way
to model that is to take a look – last year was a good starting point. And we typically are up in the mid-single digits
from fourth to first on OpEx. And that's because of the absence of the holiday periods that we have in fourth quarter
and the annual startup of pay and benefit increases that we have in the first quarter.
This year we might be up just a little bit more than that versus a year ago, simply because on higher profitability that
we're expecting for the year; we also expect higher variable compensation accruals. And so that may take our first up a
little bit higher than what you saw about a year ago.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Do you have a follow on, John?
<Q - John William Pitzer>: Yeah, I do. Just going back to kind of the Analog space, Dave, maybe you can give us a
little bit more color. Because it's pretty impressive. You guys put up double-digit growth year-over-year this quarter
against pretty hard compares from the year-ago quarter.
So I'm just kind of curious, to what extent do you think your market share gains could be accelerating around your
consignment efforts? Or if you could just help me understand a little bit better? I know you talked about power kind of
leading the way this quarter. Can you help me understand a little bit more why the growth seems to be doing much
better than some of your peers?
<A - Dave Pahl>: Well, yeah – I think when you look year-over-year; first of all, it's good to have all four of those
businesses contributing to growth. Certainly power is benefiting from just the secular trend of things wanting to run
more off of batteries and things that do get plugged in becoming more efficient. We also have a very strong product
line there too. So I think that those things are helping us to gain share.
And we've talked about for some time that it's not one thing inside of a business like Analog or Embedded Processing
that allows you to gain share, there's a lot of things that you have to do to be a good Analog company, and we've got a
lot of competitors that fit that category. But we've got other things like the scale of our – and reach of our sales force,
our presence on the web, our manufacturing footprint, the technology that we bring to bear, and the breadth of the
product portfolio. So I think it's just all those things kind of working together.
<A - Kevin P. March>: I'd probably add one more thing there too, is our strategy of – that we've discussed for a
couple years now, buying our capacity ahead of our needs and always having ample capacity, quite frankly, gives our
customers, new and old, increased confidence that we have adequate capacity to meet their demand requirement. And
they see us consistently maintaining short lead times. And so that's just another element that helps us be able to win
market share versus some of the other competitors that we're up against.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Yeah. Good. That's good. Okay. Thanks, John. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. Thank you for taking us through the
OpEx step up here in Q1. Now, with most of the Embedded in Japan restructuring kind of behind you, but continued
discipline on the team's part; how should we think about the OpEx trends beyond the first quarter? I think, Kevin, I
heard you mention your Embedded OpEx kind of holding flattish, but how should we think about the overall business
beyond Q1?
<A - Kevin P. March>: So, Harlan, I think the best way to think about that is – we discussed, I think it was back in
2011, that on average we'd expect our OpEx to run between 20% and 30% of revenue. So like in a weak market it
might be at the 30% level and stronger markets it'd be in the 20% level. We're in a pretty good – we're performing quite
well in our markets right now. And so you're seeing that OpEx come down. In fact, most recently, in the second half of

2014, we were running around 23% of revenue. And so I would say that you would want to model us in the lower half
of that range as you try to think about how much our OpEx spend will be in 2015.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Great. You have a follow on, Harlan?
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Yeah. Thank you for that. Your thoughts directionally on utilization levels here in Q1? Given
sort of the seasonality in your business, I would assume that it's down again given the book-to-bill ratio and the revenue
guidance for Q1. Is that kind of also how we should think directionally about gross margins as well?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, I think the way you need to think about utilization is, first, by definition – because we
buy capacity ahead of time, we will, by definition, be operating in an underutilized environment versus our maximum
capacity, theoretical capacity. But that aside, because of manufacturing cycle times, the material that we're starting in
the first quarter, especially as we move into the second month of the first quarter really is destined for second-quarter
shipments.
And so your utilization tends to [ph] proceed (22:30) the quarter you're moving into as to what your expectations are.
And as the second quarter, for the last three years, four years, five years now, and normally for us is a growth quarter
compared to the first quarter, we will adjust our factory loadings accordingly to our expectation to second quarter
revenue expectations.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Okay. Thank you, Harlan. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think to follow up on that gross margin
question, looks to me your implied guidance for margins is maybe 57 – maybe a little higher, so low 57, is down a little
bit. Our revenues are down slightly with inventories a little higher.
Could you just, I guess, give us some feeling of – if you don't want to give numbers, at least some of the drivers for
gross margins into Q1? And in particular, what are you planning to do with the inventory in your own balance sheet,
how will that trend?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah. I don't know that – I necessarily have – I don't want to get into the GPM per se. Let me
just talk a little bit more about what our inventory levels might look like and how that might drive us. We don't have an
inventory forecast per se, but given the growth in consignment and the typically seasonally strong 2Q, we'd expect our
factory loadings to increase as we move through the quarter, as I mentioned a moment ago.
One of the things to keep in mind when you adjust your factory loadings, if your quarterly loadings are really for the
following quarter's expectations, then if you think about the pattern of movement through the quarter, you take your
loadings, coming into the fourth quarter – our loadings would be dropping coming into the quarter. And going into the
first quarter, our loadings start to increase during the quarter.
And so you're always going to have a bit of a lag when you try to track the GPM that follows with that, which I think is
what you're asking for there, Stacy. I think more importantly what we see going forward is that, our margins, we expect
to continue to improve along with our free cash flow by virtue of the fact that Analog and Embedded Processing
continue to become a larger portion of our total revenues and by virtue of the fact that 300 millimeter manufacturing
continues to be a larger portion of our total production as we go forward. And both of those result in both higher
margins and higher free cash flow.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow up, just to touch on the tax rate. So your
guidance for next year 30%, a little higher than your guidance for 2014, which I think was 28%. I just wanted to verify,
is the only real source of that, just a higher profit versus expectation. I think you had told us before to sort of tax every
incremental dollar of profit around, at the incremental tax rate of 35%?

<A - Kevin P. March>: Yes. Stacy, that's correct. In fact, our tax rate in 2014, our guidance was, as you said, it
rounded down to 28% and actually came in sort of little bit higher than that, if it weren't for the R&D credit. And so
we're looking at rounding up to 30% as we move into 2015. So you're exactly right. As you model what you would
expect our earnings and fall through to be, you should tax that at approximately 35% delta profit as it comes through
during the year.
<A - Dave Pahl>: And I'd just point out too, Stacy, that, that does not assume the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit
that we got for 2014.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah. If that does reinstate, that'd be between one and two points of tax benefit.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Right. Good. Okay. We'll go to the next caller, please.

We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. Actually, when I look at your Q4 results versus consensus
estimates, you did better in your core Analog and Embedded segments, but there was some shortfall in the other sales,
which you were actually down 6% year-on-year. I think they were down almost 11% last year. And I believe you
mentioned some loss of ASIC business. I'm wondering, what is the right way, Kevin or Dave, to model this segment?
Because it is a very profitable segment for you, it is still a decent sized segment. And I think in the past, you have
mentioned that it could be sort of flattish plus/minus 2% or so. So just, conceptually, what is the right way to model this
segment?
<A - Dave Pahl>: Yeah, if you look, Vivek, at the Other segment, the first thing I would point out is it has a calculated
revenue and the seasonally strong back-to-school season happened in second quarter and third quarter. So those tend to
be the seasonally strongest quarter. Third quarter to fourth quarter the biggest transition sequentially of course is due to
the change in – the change of that business.
If you look overall, you can look at the components that sit inside of Other, the first is DLP. And I described that as a
more steady business and one that might have some – we described as wildcards of new opportunities. The vast
majority of that business is in front projectors today as well as in cinema, and we've got some, what we call, pico
projectors or small form-factor projectors that make up the revenue. But there are some opportunities inside of
automotive and other embedded opportunities that could provide growth in the future.
The next biggest piece of that revenue is calculators. And that business has been, I'd say, flat to maybe slightly down
over time. And then royalties have run steady, about $40 million to $50 million a quarter; and that's probably a good
thing to look. And then, we will have ASIC business that will transition over to EP over time. That is some business
that's in communications infrastructure and we believe that, that will move over. So you kind of net all that stuff
together, and we kind of think that the Other segment will be flat, maybe up or down a percentage point as we've
described in the past.
<A - Kevin P. March>: And I think, Vivek, you also asked about year-over-year. Just recall that last year still had
about $55 million or so of wireless revenue in it and this year is essentially zero. So that's biggest decline on a
year-over-year basis.
<A - Dave Pahl>: That's correct. Do you have a [indiscernible] (28:55)?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Yes. So as my follow on, back to your core business; do you think you have the right scale in your
Embedded business to take op margins into the 20%s? So when I look at the three areas within that business:
processors, connectivity, microcontrollers, how would you rank TI against the best competitor in that segment? And
really, I'm trying to understand how you can grow that segment, gain share, improve margins while keeping
investments flattish while all your competitors are all investing in their respective businesses? Thank you.

<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, Vivek, I'll leave it to you analyze the competitors. I'll speak to how TI is doing. You
may recall that back in late 2010, early 2011 timeframe, we significantly stepped up our investments in that particular
segment in order to accelerate our product introductions, and, therefore, begin to accelerate our revenue growth. And if
you take a look at what's happened over the last, as Dave mentioned, in his opening remarks, nine quarters of
sequential, continuous year-over-year growth, that strategy has paid off. So those products are really beginning to take.
And as you know, those kinds of products tend to have very long shelf lives, so we expect to see more of the same on
that.
Now, while we took spending down this past year as a result of the restructuring actions we announced this time a year
ago, we didn't eliminate them. The amount that we're investing is still quite high. And that's why the operating profit is
still not quite where we think entitlement would take us to. So we continue to invest at quite a healthy level, just not at
the level that you saw us invest in, in the prior few years.
So those combined, high levels of investment, a expanding product portfolio from heavier levels of investment in the
prior few years, have all given us very strong growth in that segment and will continue to give us growth. And, quite
frankly, based upon some of the best-in-class performers you can look at out there, we have expectations similar to at
least as well as those companies are operating.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Yeah. And I'd also add, Vivek. If you look at our product portfolio, like inside of microcontrollers,
we've got two architectures there where we'll introduce new products with new interfaces and that meet new standards
inside of that. A lot of our competitors will have half a dozen or a dozen different architectures where they've got to
spread their R&D investment over. So we can be very efficient with that.
And, in addition, if you remember, as part of the wireless restructuring, we brought over those connectivity products
that really already had a pretty significant investment in those wireless technologies. So we're supporting nearly a
dozen different wireless standards today and that group is really focused on growing the topline rather than having to
develop baseline technologies.
So with that, we'll – thanks for that question, Vivek. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James Vincent Covello>: Great, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Congratulations on good results.
A lot of great questions asked already. My one question is just around the long-term segment goals that you might
have. Auto is kind of low-double digits. personal electronic is almost 30%, although that's coming down. Is the goal,
really, from a segment diversification standpoint, to continue to increase in particular that auto subcategory and
decrease the personal electronics category, say, over the next two years or three years?
<A - Dave Pahl>: Yeah, Jim, I don't – our goal is not necessarily to try to optimize that mix per se. I would say that if
you look inside of personal electronics as an example, we'll look for places where we can find sustainable revenue with
a differentiated position. And if you look at some of our largest customers that we sell products into, we'll sell several
hundred devices into those customers. And those products could be anywhere from $0.75 down to a $0.05, and
oftentimes, they may have lives that live from one generation of a product to another. So those are the types of
opportunities that we try to look for in a space like comms equipment.
Now, certainly from a investment, incremental investment profile, if we had an extra dollar to spend and we had an
opportunity to spend that in either industrial or automotive, those products, in general, just tend to have longer life
cycles and better characteristics. So that may see an increase in investment.
And then, lastly, I'd just add that those two markets, I think, have the secular trends that you're well aware of. So we'll
benefit from that as rest of the industry will. And, of course, we hope to benefit disproportionately from those

investments. Do you have a follow-on, Jim?
<Q - James Vincent Covello>: Yes, I guess, I'll stick on that topic. So I mean, I guess, personal electronics has been
coming down, but your view would be, it's not really a function of an intentional effort on the part of Texas
Instruments, it's just more a function of the other businesses that you have or just happen to be better long-term growth
areas and it's sort of naturally coming down. Is that the right characterization?
<A - Dave Pahl>: Well, and even more specific than that, I think if you back out legacy wireless, you'll see that it's
actually been fairly stable as a mix. So that change in percentages is more driven by the strategic decision to exit that
one portion of the business. Thanks, Jim. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Hi. Thank you. I also wanted to ask about the end market breakdown that you guys provided. If
I look at where you were a year ago, I just – there was probably some re-classification, but it looks like industrial went
from 24% in 2013 to 31% in 2014, and personal systems from 37% to 29%. Those swings seem kind of dramatic. I just
wanted to see if there were some change in the way you were looking at the breakdown?
<A - Dave Pahl>: Yes, Joe, we continue to refine our understanding of our customers and markets and we've got better
tools and software. So if you go out to our web now, you'll actually see two years of history that we have out there as
well as the identified sectors that those markets made out. So do you have a follow-on?
<Q - Joseph Moore>: No. That's all for me. Thank you very much.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Okay. Thank you. Next caller, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Thanks for taking the question guys, and nice job on the quarter. Kevin, just a follow up to
Vivek's discussion on Embedded Processing and expense control, it's really the flip side of that. Can you talk a little bit
about what you were looking at before you would start to invest more in the business? It's clear you want higher
operating margins than you have now, but what are the things that TI is looking at before it will commit to incremental
investment in that business?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Craig, I would say we're probably quite a ways off before we even have to entertain a
question like that. Our focus for the next few years is managing the total spend inside that business and driving topline
growth. And, frankly, if we begin to see topline growth, then begin to net the kind of bottom line results that we can see
happening in other players in that space, at that point in time we might entertain increasing our spending, but not until
then.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Okay. Thank you. And then the follow up is really taking another swing at something that Chris
brought up, which is longer-term growth on a segment basis. So at least in my model, calendar 2014 was the first year
in the last four years or five years where Embedded Processing and Analog had similar growth rates and they were both
double-digits. Just philosophically, if you look at those two businesses, which have had very different histories, are
there reasons why they should have materially different growth rates going forward? Or given that they're both closer
to operating on more optimal levels, should they be fairly similar?
<A - Dave Pahl>: Yeah. I think when you begin to look longer-term at the growth rate and the potentials of those
businesses, I'd start with what you believe the semiconductor market will grow at. We have held the position that we
think that the semiconductor market roughly grows at twice the rate of GDP. There is some that will violently agree

with this and some that'll violently disagree with that basic assumption. But whatever that assumption is, we think both
Analog and Embedded Processing are big enough portions of the market that they will grow in line with that.
If you look at those businesses, certainly over the last five years, they both have continued to gain share. And we
believe that we're continuing to invest and we've got a lot of room to gain share. In fact, in Analog, we've got 18.3%
market share and inside of Embedded Processing we've got around 15 percentage points; so lots of headroom to do
that.
So – and we've gained probably 30%, 40%, sometimes more than that in market share on a given year. We still have to
have everyone report before all the final numbers are in, but we're confident that we'll gain share again this year. So,
Kevin, you have anything to add to that?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Craig, one thing I'd recommend you maybe take a look at. If you do look at those two
segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, their quarterly growth rates – I think that was the point you were making,
they can vary quite markedly from one another.
If you look at the two of them on a year-over-year basis, they actually are much more correlated than you might expect.
They're both gaining share, as Dave was mentioning, and are both growing quite nicely on year-over-year basis.
So if you do some measurements for those two segments on year-over-year growth rates and compare that back over
the last half-dozen quarters or so, I think you might be pleasantly surprised to see they grow pretty similarly to each
other.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Okay, Craig. Thanks for that question. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

We'll go next to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, as you go into your capital management conference
call next week, could you just remind us what your historical philosophy has been on levering the balance sheet to
drive shareholder value?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Well, Mark, we've talked about on debt. We have debt on the balance sheet today. It will be
there until 2023. Because that's when the last of the current outstanding bonds matures. And our attitude towards debt is
that, it will continue to be part of the balance sheet when the economics make sense. And, for us, that economics
making sense means that, if we can borrow at interest rates that we perceive to be below what we expect our inflation
rates to be, or, correspondingly at less than our dividend yield, then we think that's probably a pretty good deal on
behalf of our shareholders. And so, that'll be the kind of parameters that we look at as we continue to decide how much
debt to carry on the balance sheet as bonds mature going forward. We do actually have $1 billion of debt maturing in
2015. We have $250 million maturing in April and $750 million maturing in August of 2015.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Great.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Do you have a follow up, Mark?
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Yes. Thank you for that color. As we – so the Analog business operating margins are about
2,000 basis points higher than the Embedded. As we think about the potential profitability of the Embedded business, is
there – are there structural reasons why Embedded profitability could not equal the Analog profitability longer-term?
Thank you.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Mark, I think the simple answer in my mind is, it's difficult for us to find evidence of
somebody in the marketplace outside of TI who has been able to perform at those kind of levels. I think the economics
are such that it'll be very attractive and should be a great place for us to be in. But it probably doesn't quite get up to par
is what you see in Analog. I think Analog is quite unique in what it can produce for companies and for shareholders

We'll go next to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Co.
<Q - Timothy M. Arcuri>: Thanks a lot. Just a question again on gross margin and what the possible headroom is. I
guess, if you look at the Embedded business, you're up to 17%; but if you look at some of the well-run peers in that
space, they're doing sort of mid-20%s. So maybe ask kind of a little bit different way, is there any reason why you can't
get the Embedded margins up to the mid-20%s?
<A - Kevin P. March>: No.
<Q - Timothy M. Arcuri>: Okay.
<A - Kevin P. March>: There is no reason why we can't do that.
<Q - Timothy M. Arcuri>: Yeah.
<A - Dave Pahl>: We've made good progress obviously, Tim. We still have work to do. And – but we believe that we
can get into that range with revenue growth. And so that's what we're planning to do. They've got a good start, nine
quarters in a row of year-on-year growth and are making progress towards moving that operating margin higher. Do
you have a follow-on?
<Q - Timothy M. Arcuri>: Okay, okay. I do, yes. And then, just relative to the inventory; certainly some of it is
structural as you indicated, but is any of the rise in inventory related to your perception that June could be sort of a little
bit better than seasonal quarter?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Tim, I would say that it's probably too early for us to call the entire second quarter. Right now,
we're focused on the first quarter. So the inventory that we've got staged today is designed to support our first quarter
needs. And then as we adjust our factory loadings in the first quarter, that inventory that we've build will be designed –
start to deal with our second quarter needs.
Again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect, we will be ramping up our factories as we go through first quarter in support
of second quarter. And when we get to the end of the quarter we'll find out how much inventory we'll hold at that point
in time.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Okay. Thank you, Tim. And, operator, we've got time for one more caller.
Operator
We'll go to our last question from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess if I could dig deep into some of the
results that you've reported and maybe some of the outlook that you might have by sort of key markets out there? I
think investors are interested to hear what you're seeing in the PC and server power markets as well as maybe the disk
drive markets? And if you could offer some color on what you're seeing in the communications market as well? I think
those are maybe not that overly material to the TI story, but they are to investors in general.
<A - Dave Pahl>: Okay, Doug. Well, I can – let me share some end market trends that we've seen. I think that may
address some of those issues, maybe not down at the level that you're quite asking. So I think you were talking about
PCs, and those would fall into our personal electronics products. Those were – on a year-on-year basis they were up
despite the declines that Kevin had mentioned earlier in legacy wireless and that growth was led by mobile phones.

If you look at industrial – and I want to point out, when we talk about industrial, we've been very intentional about how
to measure that. And it's different than when investors talk about the industrial market.
And the sectors, we've got a dozen sectors that make up industrial. And they include things like factory automation and
control, medical healthcare fitness, building automation, smart grid, motor drives, displays, those types of things, the
full list is out on our website. And we've seen that that was up led by medical and healthcare fitness; appliance, factory
automation and smart grid were also up from a year ago. Comms equipment was up due to wireless infrastructure. And
then enterprise systems were up primarily due to projectors.
So with that, do you have a follow-on?
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. I guess for my follow on is just, what are you seeing in terms of any shift in the
competitive landscape? I know investors are somewhat concerned over what we're seeing in China from an investment
standpoint. Is there anything in your markets that you're seeing that would point to any change in the competitive
landscape?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Doug, as it relates to China, in particular, because as you mentioned out there, we've been in
China for a very long time now. We have over a dozen sales and R&D sites there; we have both a wafer fabrication
facility and an assembly test site there; in addition, we have thousands of customers buying thousands of parts. And
consequently, we've become a very important supplier to a large number of Chinese companies across a very diverse
set of markets.
So we see China as continuing to be a great opportunity for TI regardless of any of the competitive environments out
there. Our goal is to operate in China just like we do in the rest of the world, which is to make ourselves an integral part
of their success and an indispensable supplier. And we've got a great – shall I say, a long way, we're a long way into
that already and we feel pretty good about our position.

Okay. Great. Thanks for that question, Doug, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again
on our February 4 capital management call. A replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening.
