MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will
be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Bette Jo Rozsa. Please go ahead.
Bette Jo Rozsa
Thank you, Trisha. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2013 earnings webcast of American
Electric Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available at our website
at aep.com. Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may
cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these
factors.
Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian
Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.
I will now turn the call over to Nick Akins.

Okay, thanks, Bette Jo. Overall, we had another good quarter and a solid start for the year, coming in at $0.75 a share
on a GAAP basis and $0.80 per share on an operating basis, compared with $0.80 per share for both GAAP and
operating last year. The difference between GAAP and operating this year is primarily due to a storm change deferral

that was reversed because of a law change in Virginia, so we'll talk about that a little bit later on – Brian will, I'm sure.
But the big news is that we increased our dividend by 4.3%, or $0.02, to $0.49 per share this quarter, which is our
412th consecutive quarter of paying a dividend. The real story here is the confidence that our board and management
team have as we set a firm foundation and strategy for continued growth. I view AEP as a company that is emerging
from one of reacting to major issues, such as Ohio deregulation, environmental requirements, and plant construction
risk, to a company that is quickly moving to a place where we can truly define a path for growth.
Frankly, this is pretty refreshing to the management team and our employees. We have a distinct opportunity to
effectively allocate capital, control our costs through thoughtful and sustainable decision-making, reallocate and
optimize spending through our repositioning initiative, and make solid investments in our operating companies, grow
our transmission business, and transition our fleet for the generation resources, and as well continue the formation of
our competitive business through corporate separation. All of this is to achieve the financial integrity and objectives
that we set forth in the February Analyst Day Meeting and achieve a growth rate of 4% to 6% on a long-term basis, so
we're committed to that.
We've made much progress during the last quarter, but before going to those areas, let me first discuss what we've seen
during the first quarter regarding the economy and customer demand. Brian's going to go into this in a lot more detail,
but I just wanted to say that, since the third quarter of last year, we continue to see weakness in the manufacturing and
industrial sector of our service territory economy. I think that's true for the country and, in fact, the world. Primary
metals continues to be weak, but offset in our territory by the oil and gas activity in the Eagle Ford and Utica Shale
areas.
Those are probably the saving grace of keeping our industrials where they're at. However, we're now also seeing
improvement in the commercial and residential sectors, including increases in customer counts. We continue to believe,
as the economy improves, our service territory is well positioned because of the energy-related activities in our service
territory and will benefit as a result. Overall, customer load declined slightly quarter to quarter, but this was mitigated
somewhat by the leap year difference between this year and last year. But as we said earlier in the year, we continue to
believe customer load will remain essentially flat for the year.
This being the case, we are making advancements in other areas as we move forward to make sure that we are
addressing some of these areas to ensure that we have the financial growth that we've talked about previously. First, in
transmission, we remain on plan for continued growth in earnings contribution from our transmission business of $0.14
per share this year, moving to the $0.36 per share in 2015 that we had discussed earlier in the February Analyst Day.
The Pioneer project received Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approval and will be moving forward with
construction. A settlement agreement in Missouri related to the public utility status for our Transource/Missouri joint
venture, that transfer of property and the ability to own and construct has been filed in Missouri, and we are awaiting
approval there. Meanwhile, at FERC, related to Transource, the ALJ approved the rate and cap structure for this
project, so we await the FERC Commission approval for that as well.
Additionally, our transcos continue to invest in our state footprints to enhance service reliability for our customers and
are doing a great job in that respect. The recent FERC orders concerning Order 1000 compliance impacting such areas
as the right of first refusal, cost allocation, and other areas haven't altered our strategy regarding transmission
development and have also not changed our reported investment forecast that we provided earlier.
Other regulatory and legislative activities continue according to plan. Ohio has reaffirmed its commitment to the path
we set previously for AEP's corporate separation and transition toward a competitive market. We recently received the
final commission order regarding corporate separation, and together, with final orders on the ESP, capacity, and
corporate separation, we are set to move forward from the Ohio perspective.
At FERC, we await the orders regarding Ohio corporate separation, the Mitchell/Amos transfer, the Pool termination,
and APCo/Wheeling merger, which we expect to have by Monday, which is the statutory deadline for the order. We did
file a supplemental settlement agreement as well and settled the relevant issues with the major parties in the case.

Cases are also filed in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia to complete the transfer of the Amos and Mitchell units
to APCo in Kentucky. We expect the orders on these transfers in the June/July timeframe. These units are being
transferred at net book value. They are fully controlled and will replace the capacity payments that these customers are
already making through the existing pool. Even with lower gas prices, the units are a value to Kentucky and APCo
customers. They are located in those states, and much of the coal supply comes from these states as well. So the
Mitchell and Amos units continue to be even more of a value in today's gas market for APCo and Kentucky customers.
Moving on, I'd like to refer you to page four of the presentation, which is probably one of my favorite dashboards. I
always call it the equalizer graph. But it shows the progress we're making in the various jurisdictions. But I want to
focus on a couple of them. As you might recall from the February Analyst Day presentation, I discussed primarily the
regulatory lag issue in Indiana. And if you look at that graph, it had it at 7% – I think that's probably what it was last
time we reported – but I do have some positive news to report.
The Indiana legislation that I just had discussed previously that included shortening up the regulatory lag and as well
providing for a forward-looking test year; that actually did get through the House and the Senate, and it's at the
Governor's desk. It actually went to the Governor's desk yesterday, and he has 10 days to sign it, and we certainly
expect that to happen. So that's some very good news addressing the regulatory lag issue that we had talked about
previously.
And then when you look at SWEPCO, SWEPCO has Turk operational now. So AFUDC has fallen off, and we're now
putting that plant into rates, and the central issue around that at this point is the Texas case. Those hearings are
complete. In May we expect an ALJ recommendation, and then in June the PUCT order should come about, and that
order will have rates retroactive back to January 29. So we should see that one pick up as well. So those are the two that
we're very much focused on right now.
So we continue to also move forward on the EPA-related mandates, such as mercury HAPs, MAC, and others, as we
transition our fleet with the planned retirements of over 5,500 megawatts during 2015/2016 timeframe and retrofits or
refueling of 11,000 megawatts at a cost of around $4 billion to $5 billion over the 2012 to 2020 time period. About
one-third of the $4 billion to $5 billion are cost expectations related to the water and coal combustion residual
activities. So we're very interested in the EPA's proposed rules that were just released.
Most of the eight options in the proposed water pollutant rule are largely in line with expectations, particularly with the
assumption that the coal combustion byproducts will be regulated as a nonhazardous waste. However, there are some
extreme options that are based upon emerging technologies and require additional bottom ash retrofits, so our
comments will reflect our concerns that these requirements are not warranted.
Our repositioning initiatives continue, and I'm very pleased with the progress. We've engaged our workforce to redefine
processes and resource requirements to achieve efficiencies and redeploy resources for growth. Lean activities have
been initiated at our power plants. They continue to go through our power plants. And then we also have reviews
continuing in areas such as IT and supply chain.
These sustainable savings continue to keep us on track to the earnings targets we laid out for you in February, but even
more important, it's engaged our employees to embrace a cultural change that will sustain us toward a path for growth
and will benefit our customers, employees, and shareholders. This year we have initiated a significant cultural review
of our company to make sure that we do have an engaged workforce around those areas and strategic objectives that we
have.
So, at this point, I'll turn it over to Brian to give more details of where we stand. Brian?
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide five with the reconciliation of this year's first quarter
operating earnings to last year's. To begin with, it's very simple. First quarter operating earnings this year were $0.80
per share and last year's were also $0.80 per share. Items adversely affecting the quarterly comparison include a 2012

$0.05 effect of reversing a provision for an obligation to make certain contributions resulting from an Ohio order. That
favorable item in 2012 was not repeated in 2013.
Off-Systems sales margins, net of sharing, were off by $0.04 per share, due in large part to reduced capacity payments.
The lower receipts from competitive retail suppliers and capacity sales in the RPM market account for about $0.05 per
share, and the decline in trading margin accounts for about $0.01 of the negative comparison.
Offsetting these negative items by $0.02 per share are margins from physical sales of electricity, which were up 48%.
Later in the presentation I'll review a slide that demonstrates the competitiveness of AEP's Eastern generation fleet,
even at relatively low market prices.
Customer switching and the related capacity treatment in Ohio had an unfavorable net effect on the quarterly
comparison of $0.03 per share. This value reflects the loss of generation-related margins on the switch load of an
unfavorable $0.10 per share, partially offset by the capacity deferral provision of the ESP, for a favorable $0.07 per
share. As of March 31 of this year, approximately 53% of our customer load in Ohio had switched, with about 3%
having provided notice of intent to switch. As of December 31 of last year, those numbers were about 51% and 3%,
respectively.
Allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, was off $0.03 per share in 2013, primarily due to the
successful startup of the Turk plant in December 2012. This resulted in the cessation of AFUDC on that facility.
Operations and maintenance expense net of offsets were up slightly, adversely affecting earnings by $0.02 per share
versus the 2012 period. The higher expense levels were driven primarily by additional spending associated with
scheduled generating plant outages.
Items positively affecting the quarter-on-quarter comparison include rate changes, which were favorable by $0.07 per
share in the first quarter. This improvement in earnings through rate activity occurred through multiple jurisdictions.
Finally, weather was favorable by $0.10 per share when compared to 2012, primarily due to the unfavorable conditions
across all of our jurisdictions last year, with the exception of Texas, where weather was comparable. Weather was
favorable $78 million versus last year's quarter, but much closer to normal this year. Remember that when we prepared
our forecasted guidance for this year, we assumed normal weather.
In summary, the adverse effect of several Ohio-related items, lower AFUDC due to Turk going commercial, and a
slight increase in O&M were essentially offset by rate changes and a return to more normal weather.
Turning to slide six, you will see that the first quarter's total weather-normalized retail load was down 1.5% compared
to last year. Nick mentioned the effect of the leap year, and you're all aware that this year's first quarter had 90 days
compared to last year's which had 91. On a comparable basis, total overall load would have been only negative 0.4%
rather than the actual 1.5%. Much of the results for this year's comparison were driven by the industrial sector, which
was down 6% compared to last year, and I'll talk more about the industrial sector on the next slide.
In contrast to industrials, our residential and commercial sectors both showed growth over last year's first quarter. The
residential class was up 1.3%. Residential customer counts were positive compared to last year's first quarter, and
weather-normalized average usage per customer was positive 1.1%. This is the first increase in average residential
customer usage since the second quarter of 2011.
The commercial customer class was up 0.5%, and you may recall that 2012 was the first year of commercial sales
growth since 2008. Employment growth tends to be a strong indicator for commercial sales growth, and that held true
for AEP in the first quarter in that the areas where we saw the greatest employment growth also experienced the largest
increases in commercial sales.
AEP Texas experienced employment growth of 2.8% and had an increase in quarterly commercial sales of 3%. AEP
Ohio experienced employment growth of 1.6% and had an increase in commercial sales of 2.2%. These are the
properties experiencing growth associated with shale gas development – the Eagle Ford in Texas and the Utica in Ohio.

Let me take some time here to provide some economic indicators for AEP's service territory, which continue to
experience comparable growth to the US in terms of GDP growth and employment. For the quarter, GDP growth in
AEP's Western footprint was 3%, compared to the 2% growth in the Eastern part of AEP's service territory and today's
estimated 2.5% growth that has just come out for the U.S.
It's worth mentioning that the effect of the sequestration and fiscal tightening from Washington is having less of an
effect on AEP's service territory relative to the U.S. Many of the cuts so far have been related to defense spending,
which is more concentrated on the coasts and less pronounced in AEP's Midwest footprint. Employment growth rate
for AEP at 1.5% was slightly favorable when compared to the U.S. as a whole, at 1.4%. The unemployment rate for
AEP's service territory is currently at 6.9%, compared to the 7.8% or so for the U.S. This is the first time the
unemployment rate has fallen below 7% in AEP's service territory since the end of 2008.
Turning to slide seven, you will see that four of our top five industrial sectors experienced negative load trends for the
first quarter. A significant contributor to the 6% decline in overall industrial sales, as Nick mentioned, was related to
the primary metals sector, which was down nearly 17% compared to last year's first quarter, and much of that decline
was associated with our largest customer. That company shut down a third of its production as a result of soft market
conditions, and filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of this year. If you exclude this customer, total industrial sales
would have been down 3.7% for the quarter.
Chemical manufacturing was down 4.4% for the quarter. It's important to note that, last March, one of our largest
customers in Texas, who owns a cogeneration facility, chose not to generate last year and instead purchased all of their
electricity from SWEPCO. If you exclude this customer, chemical manufacturing would be down only 2.7% for the
quarter.
Similarly, petroleum and coal products were down 3% for the quarter, but this was influenced by two refineries that
conducted temporary maintenance on their facilities in the first quarter. Excluding those two customers, petroleum and
coal product sales were actually up 10.8% for the quarter, led by a new refinery that came on line last summer in Texas.
The mining sector, excluding oil and gas, was down 2.9% for the quarter. Weak demand from utilities and exports have
had a significant impact on coal mining operations in our service territory, and you'll note that 90% of AEP's mining
base is in our Eastern regulated operations. The paper manufacturing sector was essentially flat for the quarter, with
increases in Ohio sales being largely offset by decreases in our Western regulated properties.
In summary, the industrial sector continues to face challenges as the country tries to maintain its economic momentum.
When we originally put slide eight together, we left the old title on it, and later realized that it was not descriptive of
what actually happened in the quarter. The old title was Coal to Gas Switching, and the new title that we have here, Gas
to Coal Switching, much more accurately describes what happened during the quarter. This slide breaks out capacity
factors for our East and West coal and natural gas fleets. In both regions, coal capacity factors were up for the quarter,
and in both regions, natural gas capacity factors were down significantly. In gross terms, AEP generated 34% less
electricity from natural gas and 9% more from coal-fired generation.
These results are related to two factors. First, the price of natural gas increased significantly, and second, our coal-fired
generation fleet is very competitive, even at gas prices below $4. Henry Hub natural gas prices increased 41%
quarter-over-quarter, and AEP's delivered natural gas costs increased 35%. By contrast, AEP's cost of delivered coal
only increased 7%. This is against a backdrop where AEP generation hub peak pricing increased 15%, and
around-the-clock pricing increased 14%. Dark spreads widened considerably, while spark spreads compressed.
Turning to slide nine, we'll see the impact of a modest increase in prices for energy have on a very competitive AEP
East generation fleet, even when Henry Hub and delivered prices for natural gas are as low as the mid-$3 range. On this
slide we have drawn the 2012 and 2013 supply stacks for AEP's Eastern generation fleet, which accounts for most of
our off-system sales volumes.
You will see that in the first quarter of 2012, at an average around-the-clock price of $28.65 per megawatt hour, nearly
16,000 megawatts of capacity were in the money. By contrast, in the first quarter of 2013, at an average

around-the-clock price of $32.65 per megawatt hour, nearly 20,000 megawatts of capacity were in the money. The 14%
increase in around-the-clock pricing accounted for a 24% increase in in-the-money capacity for AEP, even at these
relatively low prices for electricity and natural gas. This is a very competitive generation fleet.
Let's now take a look at this year's financing activities on slide 10. During the first quarter we made a significant
amount of progress in securing new funds in an attractive interest rate environment. The company is using this capital
to fund its investment program and bolster its liquidity position. Specifically, in February, we closed on the $1 billion
27-month delayed-draw term loan that will provide us with interim financing as we capitalize the Genco and refinance
AEP Ohio.
At the same time, we also closed on the amendment of our two core revolving credit facilities. This included the
one-year extension of both facilities, taking the new termination dates to June of 2016 and July of 2017. The
amendment also increased the capacity for the June 2016 facility by $250 million, bringing our total revolver capacity
to $3.5 billion. TNC issued $200 million of senior unsecured notes, and I&M issued $250 million of senior unsecured
notes.
In all, we obtained $1.45 billion in new debt financing and an incremental $250 million in credit revolver capacity.
Upcoming financing activity will be highlighted by the issuance of securitization bonds at Ohio Power and
Appalachian Power. These two financings are expected to close this summer and should bring in a combined $655
million.
I'd really like to spend a little time with you now on slide 11. This slide demonstrates the financial health of American
Electric Power, and it is as strong as it has ever been. Our debt to total capitalization at 55% is at its lowest level in
more than 10 years. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to total debt, are solidly BBB and Baa2.
Our qualified pension funding is now at 94%, and as we approach 100% funding, we continue to de-risk the plan, with
50% of the plan assets now invested in long-duration fixed-income instruments. Over the past three years, we have
invested $1.15 billion into the plan. This is good news for current and future retirees as well as investors.
Finally, with the increased size and tenor of our credit facilities, with the delayed-draw term loan facility, and with the
modest uses of liquidity, the company's net available liquidity is as strong as it has ever been, at $3.7 billion.
I can assure you that the financial strength demonstrated on this slide has not happened by accident. The management
and board of this company have been very purposeful in building the company's financial strength. Whether through
careful capital allocation, O&M discipline, or thoughtfully accessing the debt capital markets, we have been very
focused on ensuring that the company has the liquidity and strength it needs to prosper in any variety of market and
business conditions. I want you to know we will continue to do so.
Let me close by saying that we remain on track to achieve 2013 annual earnings per share in the guidance range that we
announced on February 15 of $3.05 per share to $3.25 per share. We are maintaining the discipline around operations
and maintenance expenses that you've come to expect from us. Lisa Barton and her team in transmission are on track to
deliver $0.14 per share of earnings this year, up from $0.09 per share last year. The investment in critical transmission
infrastructure should allow us to grow earnings from that segment to $0.29 per share next year.
Earlier, we provided some detail coverage of load. We're encouraged by the recent experience in our residential and
commercial customer classes and are concerned by the quarterly results from industrials. Our guidance for the year
factored in overall load growth of 0.5%. The industrial results for the quarter put us behind on load growth for the year,
but not enough to put guidance in jeopardy.
Balance-of-the-year gas and power prices are higher than liquidated values for 2012. Delivered costs for coal are up,
but much less so than power prices. This widening of the dark spread should help off-system sales margins, but the low
prices paid by competitive retail suppliers for capacity and low RPM pricing will continue to have its negative impact.
Our regulatory plans are on track relative to our assumptions and guidance. We have a positive track record of putting
capital to work for the benefit of our customers, and then earning a return on that investment by efficiently getting it
into rates. This year should continue that record. Of our assumed rate recovery, the majority has already been secured.

Finally, in terms of financial strength, I took you through some metrics that demonstrate the company is in peak
financial condition. It is this strength that gave the board of directors the confidence to raise the dividend payout ratio
and then to quickly follow on with an increase in the dividend itself. With the dividend increase, AEP's yield is now
nearly 4%. That, when combined with our stable regulated business profile and steady earnings growth, provide a total
shareholder return proposition in the 8% to 10% range annually.
In summary, the company is financially strong, and we're well on our way to meeting our stated goals.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Greg. How are you?
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Good. Good quarter. So, two questions; one, when I'm looking at the slide where you talk about
gas-to-coal switching, can you talk a little bit about the types of coal that you're burning and what the breakeven cost is
between gas and coal of the types of coal you're burning – whether it's CAP, NAP, Illinois Basin, PRB – that's allowed
you to switch back?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, typically it's CAP coal. And when you look at the cost breakpoint on a delivery cost
basis, when you're in that $3.25 to $3.50 range on natural gas, you'll start to see the switching occur. And based on
natural gas prices today, obviously we've seen it just go just basically 180 degrees the other direction. But that's a good
thing. And I think the real issue is, is that we've been able to change our contracting methodologies, particularly on the
coal side and the natural gas side, to be flexible enough to adjust our generation either way, and it's worked out
positively for us.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Greg, when you look -
<Q - Greg Gordon>: That's a lot lower breakpoint on CAP coal than we've heard from other companies, is that
because of your delivery cost advantage being either mine-mouth or on the river?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, that's right. We have a distinct advantage from the river operations standpoint, and
then also the mine-mouth aspects of it as well, so a lot less rail delivery.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Hey, Greg, when you look at slide nine in our presentation and see how our supply stack
lines up, and you compare those prices to what natural gas prices were, our delivered natural gas was only $3.78 this
year. And look at how much more of our capacity goes in the money, even at that low natural gas price. So it's a very
competitive fleet that we have, and I think we demonstrated that quarter-on-quarter difference this year to last, even at

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And we've also been able to take the Northern App coal because all of our units are fully
controlled.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Gotcha. Next and last question, page 18, you go through a line-by-line comparison of what you
did in your off-systems sales business, and it's clear that obviously you sold a lot more power and made more money.
Can you take us through why the big deltas in the other areas and what drove those?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, so capacity payments were comprised of two items. One is the difference in the CRES
price that we're getting in Ohio, so considerably less pricing there. The other was capacity that we were getting from

the RPM market. So, in the first quarter of 2012, the RPM volume that we sold was 1,300 megawatts at the RPM price
of $110 a megawatt day, for about $16 million, and in 2013 the volume was about 640 megawatts that we cleared at a
price of about $16 a megawatt day, for $1.8 million. So those items comprised the capacity difference. The marketing
and trading was just lower realized volumes from that. And you see that the sharing stayed about the same
year-on-year, and that resulted in the difference in total off-system sales.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, really, the deviations would be because of the capacity payment difference.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: That's right.

And our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Dan. How are you?
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Good. Following up on Greg's question on the coal-to-gas switching – or gas-to-coal
switching, I guess, we're calling it now – if you look at the curve having moved up even further, of the 3,800
megawatts of additional economic generation in the first quarter, how many more megawatts are now economic as the
curve has moved that much higher?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: You mean for the balance of the year?
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Yeah.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's considerable, Dan. It's probably another 3,000 megawatts.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, and keep in mind too, the part that kicks up on that curve are primarily peaker units
that we don't expect to run much anyway. So you're getting much deeper into the base load capability of the system
now, and also keep in mind this is the entire fleet perspective, not just the part that's going to be unregulated in the
future.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And then -
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Dan, you could even do it yourself on this slide. You could draw in the balance of the year
prices for either AD hub or AEP gen hub, whichever you like, and see where that crosses the line.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And then when you guys – sorry, Brian.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: No, go ahead.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: When you guys talk about the coal inventory situation, and you have the normalization, are
you guys assuming, to get the days cover, are you using a historic burn rate, or are using some sort of modified lower
burn rate to figure out the number of days in inventory?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's a full-load burn rate, so it's the units that we have at full-load burn for those number of
days.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And then -
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: That's the historical measure that we've used.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Which we've done pretty well in managing our inventories during this process. And that
goes to the flexibility issue. We're still at 43, 44 days of inventory, so we're going into the summer peak period in a
pretty good fashion.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess just on load growth, you gave a lot of detail, but against the plan for this
year relative to a pretty slow start in the first quarter, even with normal or a little better than normal weather. What
gives you guys confidence that you're going to make catch-up over the remainder of the year to get to that positive
demand growth, and are you hearing comments from your industrial customers who are out of more clarification of
when they're going to be back on?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I think the story that you see on those slides kind of nails it. The residential and commercial
are up, and we're seeing the difficulty in industrial. We may not make the 0.5% of load growth that we forecasted for
the year. But your earlier question highlights an offset to that, in that if off-system sales are up a bit because prices are
up even from when we came out February 15, that puts more of the fleet in the money, and that should help offset some
of the load challenges that we might have through the balance of the year, so.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: But also you have to look at the mix. You have to look at the mix of the customers too. If
you have residential and commercial improving, the margins associated with those customers are higher than the
industrial customers, so it's not a one-for-one type of deal that you're looking at. And that's why I tilled up. Now, we
need the industrials manufacturing to continue to improve, and hopefully that will occur. A lot of economists are saying
in the third quarter of the year. But it's a matter of making sure it's sustainable so that the commercial and residential
can continue to thrive. In the past, residential and commercial have been really struggling themselves, and now we're
seeing an uptick there, and that's what's making the difference. And also I think the weather was better than last year,
but the weather was still normal.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: When you guys -
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Go ahead, Dan.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: When you guys weather-normalize, it's always complicated when you have big deltas from
one period to another. When you look at residential, given the big move after having not trended well for so long, are
there underlying commentary you're seeing that gives you confidence that that holds rather than just being kind of a
fluctuation to what happened in weather for the period?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think customer counts, I think – I always joke that maybe the 25-year-olds are
finally moving out of the house. But we're seeing customer counts go up. We're seeing construction improve. But it's
that underlying industrial primary metals side, but that's all tied to the world market. So we're watching that very
closely. Brian?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Dan, we get worried about that when you have large weather effects in the period, and
relative to normal, we were about $10 million positive to normal weather. So we forecasted normal for the quarter. We
had normal weather – insignificant compared to last year, but compared to normal, it's right on top of it. So we're not
concerned that weather is impacting those numbers in any significant way.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hey, good morning. I'm not sure how much color you want to give on this, but you
mentioned before some of the cost advantages you have with the river operations or delivering coal via barge versus
rail. I just wonder if you could talk about that or just help us for modeling purposes to kind of assume what the cost
advantages would be.

Page 10 of 16
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think the main aspect of it is, is that with the river operations, we deliver coal to our
power plants at cost. And then secondly, we also, from a mine-mouth perspective, these mines are relatively close, so if
there are any railroad movements associated with it, they can still have higher rates but they're very short hauls. And
then, overall, the position that AEP has because of our buying strength, because of the large amount of tonnage that we
purchase from all across the country, it really imputes practically a $2-per-ton advantage. So when you look at that
across the entire fleet, it's a pretty good advantage.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: I know some companies are talking about the flexibility in, like, the whole coal supply
chain when gas prices really dropped, and that the coal – not only the mine owners but the rails were very, I guess,
flexible. Do you see a change with gas prices now above $4 of maybe them trying to get back to previous levels, like
rates at previous levels?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Are you talking about the railroads?
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Yeah, or the coal mining, either one.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Or the coal mining. No, we don't see that. We have long-term contracts in place for coal
supply from a delivery perspective, and there's plenty of coal out there. In 2007 we were at 80 million tons of coal a
year. We're at around 54 million tons this year. So there is a lot of ability there to pick up production, so I think we're in
good shape.

And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Stephen, how are you doing?
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, in Ohio, your plans for contracting
your merchant generation, I guess, when it goes merchant. And we've had a power price uplift, but generally the
historic revenues that you've had on those assets relative to the market, there's a delta between the two. As you think
about your growth prospects, how do you think about that delta and what you would assume you could achieve in
getting long-term contracts for your Ohio generation, if you're kind of following my question on that delta?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, well, just keep in mind, the only ones that are going to survive out of this process
after retirements will be the 9,000 megawatts of generation, all fully controlled, all well within the market. And when
we look at it, even with the capital piece of it, in the future it's still looking very attractive. So it's a matter of how
competitive your generation is, not only from a marginal cost perspective, but then obviously the amount of capital left
in them, and I think we're going to wind up in great shape there. As far as the hedging practices associated with it, that's
why we're putting our wholesale shop who's been in the market for years from a long-term customer perspective, and
those discussions are occurring now in preparation for the separation of generation.
So that's moving along. I think, obviously, our main intent is to make sure that this generation looks as regulated as it
can. We anticipate hedging about 30% of it with retail. Once we have the generation in our retail mix, where a
competitive retailer can use that generation, we'll be able to go to longer-term contracts and those types of things as
well. So getting this generation over in the hands of our retail and wholesale shop is going to be something that's
incredibly important for us but also will help us in terms of those hedging practices. So we have great relationships
with munis, co-ops, long-term customers on a third-party basis, and we'll continue to advance those.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. So as you look at – that's very helpful color. As you look at the forward curve today,
does that pose any headwind to achieving that 4% to 6% as you move from the current contracts you have to market, or
is that sort of already generally anticipated as you think about your overall growth?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, it's already anticipated. But the 4% to 6% is generated from what remains the
regulated piece. Even in 2015 when this is unregulated, the 4% to 6% comes from that 86% that's still in regulated
jurisdictions, so – and with transmission as well. So the 4% to 6% is looking pretty good.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Stephen, there's no large uptick associated with either capacity or energy prices that's in that
4% to 6% estimate.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay, that's very helpful. And if I could just shift quickly to the dividend, you had a really
good increase here, and as we look out, your payout ratio is, happily, fairly low, so it looks like you still have more
flexibility. Could you just talk a bit generally about, as you look forward here – I know you just gave us a good
increase, but folks are always thinking about more – the payout ratio, it looks on the 2014 basis as still below that 60%
to 70% range. Could just talk a little bit about how you think about the dividend over time?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: That dividend increase is already old news, isn't it?
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Sure is.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: What have you done for me lately? So our board will continue to evaluate its dividend
policy. It does it on a quarterly basis when we look at it. And they did – and it's probably the same answer I gave in
February was that they continue to view dividend growth being in line with the earnings growth of the company, and
they look at it in that 60% to 70% so that we can track the regulated companies. We believe that we should be viewed
as a regulated company. We still track to a discount to the regulateds, which I don't understand that. But, secondly, we
want to move this company to a point where it's attractive at a premium to the regulated, because of we've spent a lot of
time cleaning the decks here. We're clearing up the story of AEP. And a lot of positive things are occurring. So I think
we – obviously, it remains to be seen, but something that the board is very in tune with.

And our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, first quick question, perhaps a clarification if you will, on the industrial segment
in the sales, the decline in the first quarter here, you mentioned a bankruptcy. Is this a permanent reduction, at least
from what you can tell, or how do you anticipate this playing out through the back half of the year and subsequent
years?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We're anticipating, Julien, that they'll continue to operate at their two-thirds of capacity
through the balance of the year. We think there's – obviously, market conditions in aluminum are not very good.
There's some political will, I think, to try and keep that plant operating associated with the jobs that are there. And I
think that they've continued to operate at this two-thirds level since last summer, and we anticipate that they'll do that
through the balance of the year.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Some of this is driven through – the primary metals is driven by the world market, so we're
going to have to see, particularly Europe and in China, things picking up there. But here in the U.S., the manufacturing
capability is there. There are expansions going on, and we have a list of future expansions that are occurring that have
been announced that many of them are in our Western footprint. Our Eastern footprint has the manufacturing
capability. We just need the economy to turn around, and certainly, the U.S. is a big part of making that happen.
I hope that after we get through all the tax issues and the budget issues and certainly the debt issues with Congress, that
the economy can start to pick up with some faith that they can invest. And when that happens, and in particular when

the President decides what he's going to do relative to Keystone Pipeline and all the other energy-related infrastructure
areas, the AEP service territory is prime because of shale gas, because of coal, because of all of these resources that are
indigenous in our footprint, where manufacturing will be able to latch onto that – in particular, chemicals and so forth –
to advance. So I don't see it continuing to deteriorate, but the timing is when it will return.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Secondly here, if you don't mind, now that you're further along in the asset
transfer process and have gotten at least some intervener testimony, what are the key issues that you're identifying and
how might you address those?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I think, generally, from the intervener testimony and others, that they understand that
the assets are very favorable. There are questions about whether we should go out for bid, which this is a case, in our
opinion, that this is energy and capacity that the customers were already paying for. It's a transfer at net book. So it
effectively is a rate-based replacement for a capacity payment that was occurring before. And when you evaluate, and
our evaluation, it's less than a new build. And on a long-term basis, and even on a short-term basis today, it's very
advantageous for the customers in Kentucky and APCo territories.
So we have a strong message. The commission certainly is, at least in our view and in the discussions with the
governors and others, that they're receptive. Because they understand these states, they have coal-fired generation;
they're located in those states. The supply of the coal comes from these states. We just did a deal late last year that kept
some Virginia and Kentucky miners at work. Those are important socioeconomic factors to consider when you're
looking at these types of assets. So the cases move on, we'll see where they go, and I think they could have discussions
about the transfer price itself – who knows – but that, to me, I think we're in very – we have a very strong message.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And then quick last question here, you've talked before about your desire to grow
transmission. Given FERC 1000's tweaks on ROFR, does that change the game plan here? Does that expand the map
for you, or is this more of a defensive posturing for you?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think it's in line with what our strategy has been. We've been for the development of
competitive transmission. We've developed our transcos to focus on achieving that critical mass within our service
footprint of reliability-type activities. But we are positioned to be, with Transource, a strong, competitive transmission
provider in this country. So we continue with the joint ventures. We continue with the adjacent companies that we do
business with. There's a lot of opportunity there. And we're also very careful about what we ask for incentives for. We
ask for incentive structures relative to ROE based upon the way we perceive the risk of those projects. And I think the
more transmission providers do that and are very solid and factual about what they ask for, I think FERC would
respond.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you for the time.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep. And keep in mind, the transmission piece of it, the earnings is already projects that are
in place with the ROEs approved and the structures approved, so we're in good shape there too.

<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, Nick. A couple quick questions, just first on the sales issue. It's
kind of hard to exactly estimate the difference in margin between residential, commercial, industrial, and turn that into
an overall number. So if you just look at the first quarter, where the residential, commercial up, industrial down a lot,
could you give us a sense of how you were on track versus budget there on sales so we can kind of get a sense for the
year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, let's see if we can find some numbers here.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yep. If you go to slide – which I'm looking for – 15, that would give you some sense for how
we were versus last year. If you look at how we're doing, we're behind a bit, Steve. And I can get you the detailed

numbers later, but as you can see, our $0.80 on top of $0.80, whatever we lost in terms of that, we made up for in
weather and rate changes. So we can get you the detail later, but we're right on track for the year.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Margins are extremely lean on the industrial side.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Right, yeah.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And so you're replacing it with – and typically the margins for commercial customers are
significantly higher than industrials, and residentials are significantly higher than commercials. So it is a measure of
what that is. We'll try and get you some additional information on that.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Maybe to ask another way, if the trend in Q1 continued for the rest of the year, where
residential was better than you thought but industrial was worse...
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: ...would you be on track for the year then?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think that would go a long way.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Or do you need -?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: It'd go a long way in mitigating the impact of the industrials. And keep in mind, whatever's
released from the industrials from an energy perspective, we're selling in the market as well. So I think there are a lot of
mitigating issues there.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Steve, when you combine that with what we're seeing in off-system sales and how we're on
track for the rate changes, we're right on top of where we anticipated being relative to budget.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: So kind of on a gross margin basis, when you include all of that stuff, you're on track.
Okay.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: This is the great thing about the diversity of AEP from the regional footprint but also the
customer side. We typically are a third/third/third commercial, industrial, and residential, and it's a good thing when
that's happening. Now, what we have to watch for is, the industrials were moving up; they had largely recovered from
2007 by the second quarter of last year, and then we started to see some movement down on industrials. Well, the
commercial and residential were tracking down as, well but with sustained industrial activity, the commercial
industrials started to move up.
So what we need to see is the industrial and manufacturing base continue to improve so that we can have the sustaining
quality of increased residential and commercial sales. So it's sort of cyclical, but one lags the other, and we just – and
you're right in terms of the concern, if we continue to see deterioration in industrial and manufacturing, it will have a
tempering effect on the increases in the other two categories. So we're watching that very closely. But it is promising
that customer count's moving up and the economy is starting to prosper in some areas again.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. One other general question, I think this is the first PJM capacity auction you'll be in
as not an FRR entity, and I'm just curious kind of if you have any thoughts on what to expect and what your inclusion
might mean, if anything, for how much PJM's net long or short.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, it's not the first one. I think we've already been involved with one. We expect this one
to be pretty consistent with the last one, give or take 10%. But I continue to be concerned about the way demand-side
management has an advantage over steel in the ground in terms of the capacity markets and that structure. And that
needs to change, because if you ever want to continue making long-term investments to ensure the stable supply of
energy to our customers, we need to make sure that there is a structure in place that's compatible for all types of
resources. So that's what I'm concerned about within PJM. There is no long-term pricing structure for anyone to go out
and build and construct and finance new capacity. And when you have demand-side management that is bidding in just

And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah, hey, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: First of all, congratulations, because over the last two to three years, Nick, Brian, you all –
and the rest of your management team have done a very, very good job of transforming AEP.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thanks, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: I have one or two questions, though, just in terms of how you're trying to think strategically
about both the non-regulated business and the regulated business. I'll start on the non-reg, and when you look at the
portfolio and the size of the retail book, what you don't have is a lot of scale or diversity, meaning you don't have a ton
of asset diversity. You have almost no regional diversification on the non-regulated side. And your retail business,
while growing, is small relative to the industry. And I'm just curious – and I know the McKinsey guys running around
your building at some point would probably hate to hear me use this reference, but if you had to plot your
non-regulated business on the old – I think it was the Boston Consulting Group matrix of cash cow or harvest, or I
think it was star for the growth businesses, how would you think about that business strategically long-term and your
intent for it?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, Michael, I've stated previously that we are a regulated company, and we're focused on
being the regulated company. If we can make this competitive business look quasi-regulated with the hedging
associated with it, then that'll certainly help us focus on what we do with that business going forward. And keep in
mind, too, that the fleet that you're talking about is one of the larger unregulated fleets in the country. It'll be 9,000
megawatts. It is centrally located within the area, the PJM area, but it also is two-thirds coal, one-third gas, two-thirds
with fully controlled units that are well within the money, a third natural gas which is going to be probably at the
market price.
So we see this business – particularly if you look at it in its breadth, not just the matter of the generation margins
themselves – on the retail side we're focused on hedging that generation, focused on, not megawatt-hours, but margins.
And we're focused on the wholesale activity that we've been doing for years to be complementary to this. So you have
to look at it as a total package. But I think, even if you look at the generation assets themselves, they are competitive in
the market. So I don't care if I have 50,000 megawatts in a market that I'm competitive or 2,000.
And so it really is a matter of where these units stack up in the marketplace – and they stack up well – and then
secondly, how you're complementing that business and what your focus is. If we wind up with a competitive business
that looks like something our shareholders are interested in, that doesn't provide the volatility that makes us look like a
regulated utility, then that's fine. But we'll have to get there and see where it takes us.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. On the regulated side, when you look across your service territories – and you've
done a good job of positioning the transmission side of the business to grow, and we all know that transmission has its
challenges just in terms of the timeline of growth, but that's more of a national issue, not company-specific. But when
you look at distribution and you look at generation, how do you think about where over the next five to seven years
your greatest rate base growth opportunities lie?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I think the greatest rate base opportunities are in transmission and distribution.
Because, if you believe that you're getting into an area where we have generation but we're also taking a broader view

of what resources are, which includes transmission from an optimization standpoint, includes renewables, includes
smart grid technology type applications, I think we're in a pretty good position because we don't have any real large
central station generation activities going on. And we are advancing transmission and distribution. The infrastructure
requirements associated with that are tremendous in this industry. And it gives us a distinct opportunity to continue to
invest to ensure the service reliability of our customers.
So we have a real opportunity here to not be – and I guess it goes to my earlier conversation – to not be off of focus of
our customers working on back-end activities, like a massive amount of environmental spending, a massive amount of
new generation that's very, I would say the density of it is pretty high so from a capital standpoint. We have the
opportunity to put capital where it'll make the most beneficial effect for our customers and as well our shareholders. So
we are trying to move as much as we can to transmission and the distribution side infrastructure.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Nick, much appreciated.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep. And also I would add to that, from the regulated standpoint, we do have a large
amount of our service territory that's still regulated from a generation perspective, so we'll continue to invest in those
facilities as well.

And our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Hey. First question, on the Ohio customer switching, is that currently on track with how you budgeted
that and what's in the ESP order? And also, related to that, I think for the year your budget had the gross margins for
Ohio utilities down, but through the first quarter you're flat, so should we assume that Ohio is doing better than
planned? Can you just address that a bit?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, we're largely on track with the agreement. I think 53% of our customer load has
switched, another 3% in the queue. So it's moving along at a steady pace, and we see that continuing. So I'd say that
we're largely on pace and moving forward.
<Q - Ali Agha>: That would include the overall earnings contribution as well, you think that's still on budget as well?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. A separate question on, after the SWEPCO Texas rate case is done, can you remind us what
would be the next big rate case coming up for you guys?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, we – as a result of the legislation in Indiana, that gives us a distinct opportunity to
focus there on achieving better results related to regulatory lag, so it gives us an opportunity to do that. And I think
Virginia is also an opportunity for us as we complete the corporate separation and move forward with that kind of
activity. So I'd say those are the two jurisdictions. And then we continue to look at other areas as well, but I'd say those
are probably the two larger ones. And keep in mind we are making a very large investment in I&M associated with the
nuclear, the lifecycle management process. It's $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. And that's largely in process of being
recovered. So there are some areas of spending that we'll be doing, but I'd say that the stage is set.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Understood. And last question. I recall in the past, Brian, I think you guys have said in the context of
the 4% to 6% annual EPS growth that you would be targeting that, through this transition period in Ohio, I guess
through the 2012 through 2015 period, more likely the lower end than the higher end would make more sense. Is that
still the way to be thinking about this?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: No, I don't think we said that. We're anticipating the 4% to 6% off the 2013 base, so the full
range of the range that we talked about is in play, even during the transition period.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. So off the 2013 base, and Brian, over – is that a five-year look forward, or how you should we
think about that?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Just until further notice.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Until further notice. Thank you.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thanks.
