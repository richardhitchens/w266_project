Darren Richard Huston
Well, thank you very much. Welcome to The Priceline Group's fourth quarter conference call. I am here with
Priceline's Group CFO, Dan Finnegan. The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of
approximately $9.1 billion, up 39% year-over-year. Gross bookings growth accelerated sequentially due to a slight
acceleration in room night growth. For the full-year, The Priceline Group reported gross bookings of $39 billion, up
38% and 271 million room nights, up 37%. Our top line growth rates were remarkably steady through 2013, reflecting
a relatively more stable economic backdrop and continued solid execution and innovation from our teams around the
world.
Booking.com continues to solidify its position as the world's leading brand for booking accommodation. In 2013, we
continued to build on our differentiated worldwide supply with now over 425,000 hotels and other accommodations in
195 countries, up 54% over last year. Much of the recent growth is also being driven by continued push into non-hotel
accommodations, including over 112,000 vacation rental properties that are directly bookable with instant
confirmation.
In addition to aggressively growing our number of accommodation partners, the group invested nearly $2 billion in
marketing during the year including our successful Booking.com offline advertising experiment in the United States.
Following that success, we intend to continue our offline investment in the Booking.com brand in the U.S. in 2014 as
well as expand this experiment to other markets. In September, we launched in Australia and in the past few weeks, we
also launched offline campaigns in Canada and our first European experiment in the United Kingdom.
As with our online advertising investments, we take a measured, disciplined approach testing and constantly
optimizing, always seeking the best return for our spend. So far, we are pleased with our results, but there is still more
to be done and we continue to invest to build our competencies in this area.
Booking.com's growth in Europe held up well this year, while its newer markets continue to grow faster, gradually
comprising an ever-larger percentage of the business. Although these markets are sometimes less profitable than
Booking.com's core market, we believe that these investments position Booking.com to capitalize on what we believe
to be an attractive long-term opportunity.
Over the course of the year, Agoda strengthened its position in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market, making great
strides in mobile functionality, accommodation supply, and localization efforts. The group's Q4 results benefited from
the increasing mix of APAC business from both Agoda and Booking.com, which seasonally peaks in this quarter.
Momentum in our U.S. Priceline.com brand continued in Q4 with 27% gross bookings growth and 28% airline ticket
growth. Room night growth and rental car day growth also accelerated in the quarter. Strong performance from Express
Deals, excellent mobile execution, increased advertising on KAYAK and effective offline advertising contributed to
these results.
When you combine Priceline.com's strong results with Booking.com's increasing success with American bookers, we
feel proud of the solid market share gains we are making in the world's more competitive online travel market.
Also notable, for the first time in 2013, the United States became Booking.com's largest destination. rentalcars.com
recently transition from a semi-opaque offering to a more broadly appealing retail offering. Early indications are
encouraging and we remain excited with rentalcars.com's opportunity to expand its business globally, and be the
world's leading online rental car reservation service.
The group made good progress in the months following the KAYAK acquisition to expand our presence on KAYAK,
where we were previously underrepresented. KAYAK and our other brands have been sharing best practices, while
KAYAK works to build its brand in the international markets and maintain its high pace of product innovation. Mobile
execution and innovation continue to be key areas of focus and investment for all our businesses. Mobile is a prime
example of how the group can successfully share knowledge, tools, and lessons learned across our brand.
To give you a sense of just how fast mobile is changing our business, we previously announced that Booking.com
completed just over $1 billion in gross mobile transactions in 2011, increasing this threefold to $3 billion in 2012. In

2013, that same number exceeded $8 billion. But mobile is not just about bookings, it is also an increasingly important
part of our customers' multi-screen lifestyles. We want to support our customers with the best pricing, best assortment,
and best connected online experience, regardless of the screen they used to book with, travel with, or stay with.
The group performed well in 2013 exceeding expectations throughout the year. In my new role as Group CEO, I'm
excited by the tremendous potential of each of our brands and by the opportunity to work with our talented and
dedicated people around the world.
Going forward, we intend to continue building our brands by making investments in marketing, people, supply, and
product innovation to drive long-term profitable and sustainable growth. I want to thank our employees around the
world for their hard work and dedication in delivering a terrific year for their brand and for the group. We look forward
to a success filled 2014 as well.
I'll now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review.
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then
provide guidance for the first quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year
comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
Q4 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom line perspective. Strong unit growth paired with better than forecasted
operating margins drove results that exceeded the top end of our guidance range in all key metrics. Room nights
booked grew by 37% in the fourth quarter, modestly accelerating compared to the unit growth rate of 36% achieved in
Q3. Our key European market posted a solid quarter and our unit growth rate also benefited from our fast-growing
Asia-Pacific and South American regions, which represent a larger percentage of our business for the quarter due to
seasonality.
Performance was also strong in North America and I believe that we, again, grew our market share across all our
regions in Q4. Average daily rates, or ADRs, for Q4 2013 were up on a local currency basis by about 2% for the
consolidated group. Rental car days booked were up by 32% for Q4 compared to prior year, accelerating compared to
28% growth in Q3, driven by strong performance for rentalcars.com and Priceline.com.
For the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, the FX rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar was favorable by about 5%.
However, the dollar strengthened significantly against many Asian and Southern Hemisphere currencies, including
those of Australia, Brazil, Japan, Argentina, and Indonesia. As a result, currency exchange rates had an overall slightly
negative impact on our growth rate expressed in U.S. dollars.
Q4 gross bookings grew by 39% compared to prior year. Our Q4 international gross bookings grew by 41% in U.S.
dollars and by about 42% on a local currency basis. Our international business continued to deliver remarkably high
growth rates made possible by our teams around the world diligently adding accommodations, efficiently driving
demand to our desktop and mobile sites and then continuously innovating so we successfully convert traffic into
customers that book.
Our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew gross bookings by 27%, accelerating compared to Q3 with strong
performance across air, rental car, and hotel verticals. Priceline.com also benefited from increased advertising
placements within KAYAK.
Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 39% as compared to prior year. GAAP gross profit
for the quarter was $1.3 billion and grew 42% as compared to prior year. GAAP gross profit includes a credit in the
amount of $6.3 million in Q4 2013 and a charge in the amount of $16.1 million in Q4 2012 related to travel transaction
tax litigation.
We've excluded the impact of the credit in Q4 2013 and the charge in Q4 2012 from non-GAAP gross profit,
non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP net income. Consistent with past practice, we exclude

significant charges and credits for judgments, rulings, and settlements related to travel transaction taxes, because the
amounts and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with
prior periods less meaningful.
Inclusion of KAYAK in our results contributed about five percentage points of inorganic gross profit growth for the
quarter. KAYAK revenue amounted to $55 million in Q4, net of intercompany activity. Our international operations
generated gross profit of $1.15 billion, which constituted an increase of 38% as compared to the prior year on both a
U.S. dollar and local currency basis.
Non-GAAP gross profit for our U.S. business, including KAYAK but excluding the impact of the aforementioned
travel transaction tax items, amounted to $172 million, which represented 44% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 42.7% of gross profit for Q4 and is 106 bps lower than last year. Operating
margins were impacted by 146 bps of deleverage in offline advertising mainly related to our Booking.com TV
campaigns in the U.S. and Australia and the inclusion of KAYAK offline advertising.
Q4 personnel expense includes a $12 million charge related to a payroll tax levy in the Netherlands. While there was a
similar payroll tax levy in 2012, it was enacted in Q3 that year, and we therefore have an unfavorable comp in Q4.
Other OpEx also reflects some deleverage as we continue to invest in people, offices, and IT-related expenses to
support our business growth.
Online advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is 200 bps lower than prior year. We continue to see pressure
on ROIs but to a lesser degree in Q4 than previous quarters. Much of the year-over-year improvement in this metric is
due to the inclusion of KAYAK, because KAYAK spends relatively less on online advertising as a percentage of gross
profit and spending by our other brands for ad placements on KAYAK is eliminated from our consolidated results.
We expect KAYAK to benefit our consolidated online ad efficiency until we anniversary the acquisition in May.
Operating margins came in 234 bps better than assumed in our guidance forecast due to gross profit over-performance,
better than assumed ad efficiency, and lower than forecasted other operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4
amounted to $578 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $540 million and represents 36%
growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 35% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 31%, reflecting the
impact of a higher fully diluted share count.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $554 million of cash from operations during fourth quarter 2013,
which is about 12% higher than last year. During Q4, we spent about $27 million on CapEx and we repaid about $415
million of our 2015 convertible notes.
For full year 2013, we generated approximately $2.3 billion of cash from operations, which represents a 29% increase
versus prior year. During full-year 2013, in addition to the $415 million spent to repay debt, we used about $500
million to buy KAYAK and the remaining minority interest in rentalcars.com, and we returned $884 million to
shareholders through purchases of our common stock. Our cash and investments totaling about $6.8 billion at year-end
are available for general corporate purposes, including additional share repurchases, acquisitions, and debt repayment.
Now for first quarter 2014 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 23% to 33% on both the U.S.
dollar and local currency basis, with the U.S. gross bookings growing by 15% to 20%. We expect international gross
bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 25% to 35% and to grow by 25% to 35% on a local currency basis as
well.
Our Q1 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 2% compared to the
prior year period. Our Q1 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.37 per euro and $1.67 per
British pound as yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be stronger by
about 4% for the euro and about 7% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. We expect the overall impact
of currency fluctuations to be about neutral to growth after factoring in fairly significant devaluation in various other
currencies versus the U.S. dollar as compared to the prior year.

We have hedged contracts in place to substantially shield our first quarter EBITDA, net earnings from any fluctuation
in the euro or pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But, these hedges do not offset the
impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, and operating income, do not hedge our earnings
beyond the first quarter and they do not hedge against further deterioration in currencies other than the euro or the
pound.
We expect Q1 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 25% and gross profit dollars to grow by 22%
to 32%. I remind you that gross profit is a better indicator of our top line momentum than revenue since we record
Name Your Own Price revenues on a gross basis while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis. For example, the
success of our Express Deal service has driven opaque hotel growth in gross bookings and gross profit, but the shift of
share away from Name Your Own Price has caused the decline in opaque hotel revenue.
We expect about 290 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to
prior year. More than half of the operating deleverage is attributable to growth in offline advertising related to our
Booking.com brand and the inclusion of KAYAK offline advertising. We've been pleased with the results of the offline
investment we have made in our Booking.com brand thus far in the U.S. and Australia. We recently launched
Booking.com offline advertising campaigns in Canada and the UK and we will likely continue to invest in additional
markets going forward, as long as the results continue to be positive.
For full-year 2014, we estimate that the group will spend between $220 million and $240 million for offline
advertising. Q1 margin pressure is also caused by a later Easter this year which means all gross profit related Easter
checkouts will be recognized in Q2 this year, whereas some benefited Q1 last year.
Other OpEx also reflects some deleverage as we ramp our head count, office and IT expenses to be ready for peak
travel season. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $420 million and $450 million which at the midpoint
represents 18% growth versus prior year. Our non GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of
approximately 15% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the
U.S.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $6.35 to $6.85 per share, which at the midpoint
represents 15% growth over prior year, including the impact of higher year-over-year share count.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 53.3 million shares based upon yesterday's
closing stock price of $1,273.76 and reflects the impact of shares issued and options assumed as part of the KAYAK
acquisition, net of shares repurchased over 2013. We forecast GAAP EPS between $5.02 and $5.52 per share for Q1.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our
earnings release.
We are pleased by the remarkably strong and steady unit growth the group has delivered over 2013. And that is
inherent in our forecast for Q1.
Our guidance reflects deceleration in growth experience to-date in the quarter and our expectation that such a large
business comparing against high transaction growth rates will experience a pattern of sequential deceleration. Our
forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the consumer
travel market in particular.
We will now take your questions.

<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. Hope you can hear me okay. My question regarding the gross profit guidance for
Q1, it looks like a quite bit of deceleration maybe you could parse that our. Is it just natural deceleration in the business
or are there other factors like Easter that are affecting your outlook? And then when you look out further in the year,
are there anything else besides the KAYAK acquisition that you would point out maybe investors should think about as
we work through the year on tougher comps? Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Hey, Justin. So as far as the gross profit growth, the later Easter is definitely a significant
factor. So that will be a shift of gross profit out of Q1 and into Q2. Since Q1 is a relatively smaller quarter from a gross
profit perspective, it has a more significant impact in Q1. We also are forecasting some deceleration, as I said in my
prepared comments, and that would flow through in the gross profit line. For the remainder of the year, we gave you
some guidance on offline advertising because that's the difficult one for you guys to model and we have been rolling
out for some additional markets. In terms of online advertising, we're not going to give guidance for the expectation for
the future other than I did make a comment in my prepared remarks that we will have the KAYAK acquisition in May
and that's had a beneficial impact on our online ad efficiency in the U.S. in the year, we've owned it.
<Q - Justin Post>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dean Prissman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: ...my questions. So for your vacation rental properties, is there any color you can share in
terms of the profile of your suppliers, specifically the majority of inventory coming from a number of large property
managers or is it a base of potential suppliers far more fragmented? And then just on KAYAK, is there any perspective
you can share in terms of how you've either begun to or intend to apply KAYAK technologies across your other
brands? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay, Dean. This is Darren. I'll take that – both of those questions. First of all, on
vacation rentals, vacation rentals are real natural extension of our Booking.com's move into non-hotel accommodations.
And as you probably know, the vacation rental market is a supply-heavy, demand-starved marketplace; [indiscernible]
(22:55) is different from others because we're working to make vacation rentals directly bookable and instantly
confirmable at scale. And we want ultimately for vacation rental to be as easy to book as a hotel room on Booking.com.
So, there is a lot of issues to work through and in terms of the early suppliers on Booking.com, there are a number of
large property management companies in that mix. These are companies that have built the infrastructure to do direct
bookings, they have like the digital calendars of the homeowners, they have exclusive access to the homes. But there is
also a lot of smaller properties as well, apartment blocks, products like this that we've been able to bring online and
we're pretty optimistic that we can continue to do that, we're going to hold a pretty high bar on that ability again to be
instantly bookable and confirmable going forward.
And then as it relates to KAYAK specifically, I think there has been outstanding learnings particularly in the mobile
space and KAYAK to the group brought a lot of great thinking in that area. And I think it's really benefited all the
group companies to be in those conversations with KAYAK. I also think that KAYAK's approach, generally speaking,
to product development was quite consistent with the other brands, but together we've learned a number of things from
that nimbleness and how we can experiment real-time, things like that.
Going forward, Steve and team are now taking a really disciplined and methodical approach, international expansion
and that's very consistent with the way the group works as well and I wholly support that kind of process versus just
throwing things out there, they're really thinking through things and I'm quite optimistic about the future.
<Q - Dean J. Prissman>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: A couple of questions. So can you talk about, if you're contemplating any kind of impact from
the political interest in Thailand in your guidance, and then with regards to the pace of hotel additions, the 425,000 that
you have currently, does it seems to be a nice pickup from the number you reported last time, does it include – is it fair
to assume, it's largely because you're also signing up vacation rental properties at a higher pace that's causing the
acceleration?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. I'll again take both those questions. The Thai market, there is a number of
things that are happening in January, seems always be a sporadic month. The Thai market has been challenging
obviously with the unrest although we are finding that bookers are finding their way around Thailand. We're seeing
strong bookings of places like Malaysia, Indonesia, other sort of Southeast destinations. But we don't think – obviously,
we're a global business, so these things aren't as material to our global results.
I'd also highlight, of course, the winter storms that many of you experiencing here in the United States as well as the
floods in the UK and the Winter Olympics, they all have a tendency to dampen pockets of demand depending on where
users are. But overall, we don't think those have a material effect on the global business.
As it relates to our property count, yes, we've been adding a lot of vacation rental properties. These are generally
self-catered products; some of them have one room, some of them may have multiple rooms. But I also want to make
sure people understand, we are still adding hotels in many, many countries, even countries we've been in for many
years, places like Italy, Spain, France. So, the mix of what we're adding has fewer rooms than the average property that
we have in the base. But there's still a lot of multi-room properties of various sorts and types that still need to be
acquired in the system.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Thanks. Darren, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing within
advertising customer acquisition costs, particularly around mobile, whether it's on the app download side or even just
the more straightforward customer acquisition through search or some of the other alternative channels that you have.
As you think about lifetime value of your app customers, how are you thinking about allocating budget between those
channels that you have available to you?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Thanks, Heath. We don't give out conversion ROI data, things like this
obviously, because it's very proprietary.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Sure.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: But I would say at the highest level, mobile is obviously an interesting area and
mobile comes in various forms. People say mobile, it's such a broad concept, but you actually have to get into either
web-based mobile or app-based mobile and then you got to talk to separately about tablets and phones. And as mobile
has increased as a mix of our business, and mobile is tending towards becoming more PC-like, it's interesting how we
talk about in mobile, how it's all last-minute booking or app based, but in fact, over time, people are starting to do even
more regular types of bookings on mobile phones or on tablets. Tablets used to be a product of the rich and the wealthy,
but more and more they're becoming very mainstream and begin to behave very much like a laptop or another device.
So, we think mobile is generally a net positive for an online travel agent because it increases the number of screens that
we can market against; it improves the experience of our customers. But figuring out exactly where to spend money
and how to attract customers is still an ongoing art. We meet regularly, as a group, to discuss these things, to really,

really be smart about it, because sometimes you can get – fads can happen and people can go out chasing downloads.
But if people download apps and they never use them, those aren't very valuable. So we think we've got a pretty good
handle now on what the ROI is of a mobile download versus a mobile app that'll actually convert. But we continue to
try to learn in that space, but I would say we certainly have a lot of caution about going and chasing downloads that
never produce and we think a lot through that.
The other really important thing is, many people will book on one device, but then experience on another device or
they'll start a booking on one device and then pick up the same search on another device. So we're working a lot to
connect our screens so that single account users can really reflect their experience regardless of the screen that they're
using. And I think that is obviously a new phenomena that people are starting to figure out and I think in general we've
got a pretty good handle on.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: Hey, good afternoon. You talked a lot about continuing the offline marketing aggressively and is
the ongoing aggressive spend in offline investment that would otherwise be made in online marketing channels or is it
an investment that, in marketing that, would otherwise follow the bottom line. So, in other words, would you just be
spending those dollars anyway? Or what's the trade-off you're making with spending more on offline, a trade-off versus
more online marketing or a trade-off versus higher profitability or is it some combination?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Well, I would say, it's not a trade-off. I mean, in all of our online channels,
we're optimizing ROI and we're not moving money from the online spend into the offline spend. The offline spend is –
we also treat very methodically and we're creating tools and figuring out how to use the offline spend as a new way to
acquire customers. And we compare that spend both from an immediate booking perspective as well as a lifetime value
perspective against all of our online channels. So you can think about it as adding a leg to our marketing stool and
trying to make that as data-driven as all the success we've had on the online side.
We got into this really from an experiment standpoint because the Booking.com brand in particular is broadly used, but
it doesn't have very high aided awareness even on our more mature markets and the bet is basically by increasing aided
awareness through effective offline marketing, can we get more earnings or more cash flow in the business from that
bet and could it make economic sense relative to our other investments. So, it's not a trade-off but it's certainly – all of
our marketing investments are compared against one and other, regardless of channel or regardless if they're offline or
online and that's the standard that we hold the entire group to and this has just given us a few more options and
ultimately it does also allow us to build more direct business for the future.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Question please.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: I think you had said an interesting factoid about, U.S. is now the largest destination for
Booking.com, and it sounds like that's after years of building up a presence in North America. I would think long-term,
however, that that would change again given that the size of the European and Asia travel markets are the same or one
day could be the same or bigger than the U.S. market. How do you think about that? It sounds like a great
accomplishment but would you want that to be the case, say, 5 years to 10 years from now? Any general thoughts on
that. Thanks, again.

<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, thanks, Mark. When we say largest market, we're meaning country market. So
that's comparing the U.S. to France or China or Italy independently. I would say at a regional level, Asia shows
tremendous promise obviously with the population, as does Europe more broadly defined as you include Eastern
Europe. So I think each one of those regions has tremendous potential.
In terms of country markets, I mean U.S. is a quarter, likely, of the world's GDP still and likely a quarter of all travel
expenditure. So we would have expected, to be truly global, at least today that the U.S. should be our largest market,
maybe 20 years from now it will be China. But at least today, that would be a reasonable expectation but the fact that
it's just now becoming our largest destination market, still means that there is a lot of growth ahead of us in the United
States, because it deserves to be significantly larger than it is today.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Darren.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: ...taking the questions, I wanted to ask maybe, Darren, a little bit more about the
seasonality, and I know you said that, while the bookings in the quarter came from Asia-Pac and South America,
particularly Agoda having the best quarter, I guess, 4Q is always its seasonally highest quarter. So, can you talk a little
bit more about just the contribution from Asia-Pac and South America, and for South America particularly, is it doing
so well because of North American travelers hitting Booking.com? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Maybe I'll get Dan first to just talk a little bit about the seasonality of the business and
I'll make some comments geographically.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yeah. So, seasonality, Ron, Q4 and Q1 to a lesser degree are typically the peak season for
South America and Asia-Pacific. And so we see, particularly in Q4, we feel the impact of those faster-growing regions
representing a larger percentage of our total gross bookings, driving up our consolidated growth rate. Then we start to
move into Q1, also an important quarter for those regions, but we also now see North America and Europe, the
bookings start to kick in for Easter and summer checkouts. So, it's little less pronounced in Q1.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: And just regarding South America, specifically, it's interesting how South America
itself is very dependent on inter-regional travel. South America is generally a long ways from other places, but as you
get up to the Northern part of South America or into the Caribbean, Central America, it becomes more and more
dependent on American bookers, particularly if you get into Mexico or the Caribbean and that has really benefited as a
destination as we've grown in America with American bookers.
I would also flag, though, that we were quite early into Brazil and Argentina. So our business there is both strong from
an inbound basis, but also among Brazilians and Argentineans, and many of those end up coming to places like Miami,
East Coast of America and that's helped that business as well. So I feel like we've got a great presence in South
America, but also still again so much more to do than where we are today.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. Just a high level question on mobile. Is the mix of mobile transactions similar
in terms of percentage coming from pay channels versus organic channels relative to your base business in desktop?
And within those pay channels, are they similar – are the ones that are working similar as to desktop, i.e., search versus
kind of affiliate and other in mobile? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Dan, do you want to take the first cut of that? Well, maybe I'll just quickly comment.
Within mobile, again, you've got tablet and phone and then you've got app versus web. An app is just a very different
thing because you're getting the app and then the business is generally exclusively direct once you've acquired the app,
but the place you go to get the app downloads can vary.
But as it relates to web-based mobile, it is relatively the same as desktop, although still a lot to work out with regard to
the non-Google sources because you can think of all the things that – you can think of TripAdvisor, trivago or an
affiliate like easyJet or Ryanair. They don't necessarily have all the tools to pass us, the same amount of mobile
business as they do with desktop business. But, Google, specifically, is probably – it's obviously a different business on
Google on the phone because you've got less real estate to play with. But they've been doing probably the most work
here to make it an effective way to buy mobile business over time. Okay?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your question, please.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Darren, I know it's only been six weeks or so and
especially since you've been in the new seat. But I was just hoping you could perhaps give us some color on where you
think your thought process might differ most from Jeff's, if it does at all? Obviously, the business has been run
extremely well, of course, in the past. But is there any strategy, geography, marketing initiative or anything like that
that you think is perhaps a little bit different going forward? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thanks, Doug. Well, I think it's always important to remember for people that I have
been running Booking.com before I took on this role for a couple of years. And a lot of things that – philosophies that
were developed for the group, I was very much part of developing. And as they say, you don't want to fix what ain't
broke. So, I really much feel like our strategy of – focusing on organic growth – potentially looking for opportunistic
acquisitions but not relying heavily on acquisitions for growth, running independent brand entrepreneurially, all of
these facets and probably most importantly in the group is our focus on the customer and making sure everything we
design is around satisfying our end users. It's really, I think will continue and I don't see any major deviation from that
path. There are lots of things going on in the group, also in the innovation side, and those will only be different because
the market continues to evolve and it's very competitive. So I hope that you'll see coming out of all the brands, if
anything, an increased pace of innovation around our products as the landscape continues to evolve and we continue to
adjust to that.
We're not afraid to invest but we definitely have a philosophy that those investments should be in profitable
investments and things that can be sustainable for the long-term versus buying business in an unprofitable
[indiscernible] (40:12) and I certainly subscribe to those principles and we are going to continue to execute in that
manner.

<Q - Tom Cauthorn White>: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow up on the comments in the
prepared remarks about U.S. becoming the biggest destination for booking. Can you maybe just parse out a little bit
whether – how much of that is a result of U.S. point of sale maybe impact from the offline ad campaign you guys are

doing here or versus maybe increased hotel supply and making it more compelling for European travelers or
international travelers to travel here? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, thanks Tom. We don't – I can't parse it where the traffic is coming from, just
because it's quite proprietary. But I'll say it is a combination of all the factors. We have been significantly expanding
our property base in the United States. We've signed now pretty much all of the chains in the United States, it's a very
chain dominant market, so our product on the shelf is extremely competitive. We've also expanded our teams in the
United States; over 1,000 people now work for Booking.com in the United States. We have offices across the country
and we're going to continue to expand those. So, I feel like the product on the shelf is very strong. And then that is
driven then a lot of engagement in the product by both international travelers as well as domestic travelers. We've
always been, for years, strong in cities like New York which is a big international destination, Miami, San Francisco,
but you're seeing increasing strength in cities that are really primarily American destinations, and a lot of that is
because we're attracting a significantly more American to use our product.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler, Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: First on, if you can talk a little bit about the KAYAK, how you're looking to integrate with
that going forward here. I know when you acquire them it was kind of more about operating independently, although it
does seem like Priceline as well as Booking as it integrated a little more. And then just any overview on, where you
think penetration rates are today for Europe online travel as well as the European mix of Booking.com. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Well, first of all, let me just talk about KAYAK first. We were really – we felt very
much, as brands, we were underrepresented in KAYAK before the acquisition. And I'd say we've taken pretty big steps
to get our fair representation within KAYAK. But we're also very careful that KAYAK has to be a marketplace that
clears at market rates and we're going to continue with that principal because, Expedia and other players are also
buying into KAYAK and we have no intention to make KAYAK a Priceline Group-only marketplace. But I feel good
that we've gotten the right things there, we're sharing a lot of learnings with them. But the level and depth of integration
work has pretty much been done. And, Dan, do you want to talk about...?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: In terms of Internet penetration in Europe, Aaron, I don't have any specific data to share
with you. We look at the same types of reports that you do from PhoCusWright and others. I'd say that given the
growth rates that we continue to post in Europe, it's clear that the penetration is still ongoing and that there's a shift to
the Internet that's one of the drivers that's helping us grow at the rate that we are.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Great. Thank you. And just any quick thoughts on the air acceleration in the quarter, what
was behind that?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: It's a good execution by the Priceline.com air team for one, getting access to
discounted rates for opaque. And then it's also been largely helped by integration into KAYAK as you mentioned
earlier. So Priceline is powering book at KAYAK for airline tickets, and that's driven some nice additional business for
Priceline.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: We've been watching the number of reviews on Booking.com for a while and maybe as a
proxy [indiscernible] (44:48) engagement and we noticed it plateaued out towards the end of the quarter, and then has
inflected up since kind of nicely. Maybe, just wondering, is that reflective of seasonality? Are you going through like a

periodic culling process where you're cleaning up the reviews and making sure they're fresh. Any color there would be
great.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. It's a great question, Brian. I think one – there's two things that people don't –
they don't find obvious that we should probably market more on our reviews. One is that, all of our reviews are from
verified guests. So by definition you can't write a review unless you've paid. But secondly the reviews on our site are
only 14-months-old. So we don't cull any reviews out of the recent reviews, they're all real guests, bad reviews, good
reviews or whatever. But we'll take the odd review out that uses strong language or mentions somebody personally, but
we've never removed a review score itself. But what you're seeing, basically, is the seasonality because of this
14-month-rule and we're very confident that the rate at which people return reviews is not changing and you'll see that
those counts will continue to increase as the business continues to grow.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Awesome. Thanks, guys.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Co. Your question, please.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Hi, thanks a lot. Could you give us any more color on your TV advertising test in the UK?
And is your approach there are any different given your brand is probably more well known there versus other
countries where you've used TV advertising for Booking.com? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, I would say on the United Kingdom, in Europe, despite our strength, we're
constantly surprised at how few European still know our brand, even though many have used us. And the UK is a big
important market for us, so this was the obvious next place for us to test. And for us, we're just being really cognizant
and methodical about the costs and the returns, including how brand awareness ultimately drives bookings and I think
we're getting smarter and smarter about this.
So I think the net of it is we're very strong in Europe but we believe and hope that offline marketing can have a great
impact there, but again this is a test and an experiment and if we find that it doesn't have the needed impact, then we'll
bring that down. But the UK was also – our ads, we're trying to use the same content in many markets; we changed the
voice-over. So, if you watch the UK booking ads, you'll notice that they're just done in a different tone. We test those
tones with customers but the voice-over in English works very well, and that's why to-date all four markets are
English-speaking markets.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: And I have two. The first one, you've made really strong progress in the U.S. with the
Booking.com branded ad campaign. I guess I'd be curious about your thoughts about just strategically a couponing or a
discounting initiative on mobile or desktop in the U.S. to really drive further growth or market share. And then the
second one, in your 10-K geographic breakdown of revenue, other revenues – so non-U.S., non-Europe, non-UK
accelerated really nicely to 113% growth in 2013. I assume that's APAC and Agoda, if so, can you just talk to which
countries you're seeing that accelerating growth in and help us understand sustainability from here? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, I'll let Dan dig and be able to answer that second question [ph] if he knows
what you're (48:42) referring to. On the first question, Booking.com is an agency model. That means that the hotels are
basically going into the marketplace and setting their own rates, and therefore we don't naturally tend to do a lot of
couponing. This is different, that Priceline and Agoda, which are merchant models would more likely use that as a

tactic. There are more things we can do but we like to be sort of an everyday low price option for customers that they
know that the prices we have are the lowest they can get in the market. We sometimes do close user group deals that we
collect from hotels and do them just to our logged in and subscribed customers and that seems to be a pretty effective
factor for us in terms of driving our growth. But couponing specifically is not something that we use on any basis with
the agency model and Booking.com.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And in terms of that geographic footnote, Brian, it's not going to be very helpful for you in
trying to decide for a growth rate for that other column. There's just some shifts there between certain regions and into
the Netherlands. And so, if you look at the footnote there, that's just a combination of our various other subsidiaries that
operate outside of U.S. or Netherlands.
