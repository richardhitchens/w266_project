MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being
recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Charles E. Triano
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's third quarter 2012 performance. Today
I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read, Frank D'Amelio, our CFO, Olivier Brandicourt, President and General
Manager of Emerging Markets and Establish Products, Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and
Development, who is joining us remotely due to the storm situation, Geno Germano, President and General Manager of
Specialty Care and Oncology, Amy Schulman, General Counsel, President and General Manager of Pfizer Nutrition,
and John Young, President and General Manager of Primary Care.
The slides that will be presented on this call can be viewed at Pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer quarterly
corporate performance, third quarter 2012 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right-hand corner of
this page. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include
forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking

statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2011 annual report on Form
10-K and in our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Discussion during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, November 1,
2011. In addition, we will offer some brief comments regarding our preparation and target timeline for the potential
IPO of the minority stake in our Animal Health business, Zoetis, and as I'm sure you'll understand we're not going to be
able to respond to questions on that subject in light of the quiet period imposed by securities laws.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ian Read.
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck. During my remarks this morning I will briefly discuss the quarter and touch on some noteworthy
events that happened in the last weeks. Overall, our performance remains in line with our full-year guidance. As we've
discussed over the course of the year, our financial performance in the near term will continue to be impacted by the
loss of exclusivity; notably, Lipitor in all major developed countries. Year-to-date, we have absorbed approximately
$5.5 billion in LOEs. I would note the most significant impact on revenues from LOEs will be in 2012, and this impact
will decline significantly in subsequent years.
To mitigate the impact to our earnings per share, we are producing growth from key in-lines, patented products,
including Lyrica and Celebrex globally and Viagra in the U.S. We are seeing growth in Emerging Markets, most
notably in China, Mexico, and Russia. On a year-to-date basis, our Emerging Market business has delivered solid
performance, with 10% growth on an operational basis.
We have been effectively managing our cost structure and using the strength of our balance sheet. For example, while
revenue for the quarter declined 12% on an operational basis, our adjusted cost of sales, SI&A expenses, and R&D
expenses in total decreased operationally by 8%. And if you exclude the $250 million payment to AstraZeneca for the
exclusive worldwide rights to the over-the-counter Nexium, they would have declined 11% operationally, bringing
costs down in line with the revenue decline we saw this quarter.
We continue to execute our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion of common
stock, and our year-to-date repurchases are almost $6 billion. The board has authorized an additional $10 billion in
share repurchase to be utilized over time upon completion of the sale of Nutritionals to Nestlé, which we now anticipate
in the next few months. A potential IPO for Animal Health remains on track, and depending on market conditions, we
continue to expect the IPO to happen during the first half of 2013. As for our regular practice, I expect the board to set
the dividend rate for 2013 at its meeting in December.
Turning now to some recent noteworthy events, I remain confident in the quality of the assets and the progress I see in
our pipeline. We have a robust set of potential high-value assets across our key therapeutic areas. They include some in
early and mid-stages for diabetes pain and cardiovascular diseases, vaccines for mening B, adolescent and Staph
aureus, late-stage oncology compounds, and recent advances for key pipeline assets.
Concerning tofacitinib, we are looking forward to hearing from the FDA about our NDA on or before the upcoming
PDUFA date this month. Tofa was discovered by Pfizer scientists in our labs in Groton, Connecticut, and, if approved,
will be the first new oral disease-modifying therapy for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in more than 10 years.
It has the potential to change the way healthcare providers treat RA. It would also be the first RA treatment in a new
class of drugs known as Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitors. And, if approved, it will be a first-in-class product that we
believe will offer a compelling clinical profile and effective new treatment option for patients.
Regarding Eliquis, the FDA has resumed its review of the Eliquis NDA and set a new action date of March 17, 2013.
We and our alliance partners, Bristol-Myers Squibb, remain confident in the therapeutic profile of Eliquis and that we

can receive FDA approval by the new PDUFA date.
Turning to Oncology, Xalkori just received conditional marketing authorization in the EU for previously-treated
ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. A conditional marketing authorization in the EU is similar
to accelerated approvals in the United States. They are granted to medical products with positive benefit-risk
assessment that addresses unmet medical needs and whose availability would result in a significant public health
benefit.
Pfizer will submit data to the EMEA from the recently-completed study, which met its primary endpoint in
previously-treated ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. Following a review of this data, the
European Commission will consider converting the conditional marketing authorization to a full marketing
authorization.
And coming out of our Consumer business, we are encouraged by positive news about multivitamins resulting from the
Physician's Health Study II conducted by investigators at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching hospital of
Harvard University. We are pleased that the study investigators chose Centrum Silver based on its quality and
consistency, among other factors, for the duration of the 11-year study that tested the role of multivitamins in relation
to long-term health benefits. I would note that Centrum is the sixth-largest OTC brand in the world and Centrum Silver
is the world's number-one selling multivitamin for adults 50 and over.
We have recently launched new products, Inlyta in Europe, Bosulif in the U.S., and we will soon launch Xalkori in
Europe. I remain confident that we have a strong pipeline focused in the therapeutic areas where we have strengths and
which can deliver our next wave of innovative products. I am pleased with how we are executing on decisions we have
made to create meaningful incremental shareholder value through the potential Animal Health IPO and Nutrition sale.
We are seeing good results from the actions we're taking to manage costs across the business. We continue to make
shareholder-friendly capital allocation decisions. And, finally, we are making decisions that we believe have the
potential to drive future earnings-per-share growth.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to
again remind you that the Nutrition business is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of
income for all periods presented. As you know, discontinued operations are excluded from adjusted financial results.
Consequently, throughout 2012, the results of the Nutrition business have been excluded from adjusted results.
Now let's move on to the financials. Third-quarter 2012 revenues of approximately $14 billion decreased 16%
year-over-year, reflecting a 4% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately
12%, driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, notably Lipitor in all
major markets.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 decreased 12%, primarily due to the previously-mentioned decrease in revenues, which
was partially offset by an aggregate operational decrease of 8% in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and
adjusted R&D expenses, primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, a lower adjusted tax rate
of 28.3%, and fewer weighted average shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchases.
Reported diluted EPS of $0.43 decreased 10%. In addition to the factors previously mentioned, reported diluted EPS
was favorably impacted, primarily by a U.S. tax settlement, and negatively impacted, primarily from the
non-recurrence of the gain on the sale of Capsugel in the year-ago quarter.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted third-quarter revenues by 4%, or $699 million, and favorably impacted adjusted
cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses by $440 million, or 5%. This negative impact was
primarily driven by the euro and, to a lesser extent, the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, foreign

exchange negatively impacted third-quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.02.
In the third quarter of 2012, Emerging Markets Biopharmaceutical revenues were approximately $2.4 billion, which
reflects operational growth of 6% and the negative impact of foreign exchange of 8%. I want to point out that the
volatility in our Emerging Markets quarterly revenues was driven primarily by Prevnar purchasing patterns, specifically
the timing of government purchases of Prevnar 13 in Turkey compared with the year-ago quarter.
Volume growth of 8% in Emerging Markets was partially offset by price reductions of 2%, resulting in the 6%
operational growth. Of the third-quarter Emerging Markets Biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 41% was
generated by Established Products, 33% by Specialty and Oncology products, and 26% by Primary Care products.
Third-quarter Biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets were approximately $1.1 billion, which reflects
operational growth of 9% and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 10%. Of the third-quarter BRIC-MT
Biopharmaceutical revenues, approximately 42% was generated by Established Products, 30% by Specialty and
Oncology products, and 28% by Primary Care products.
During the third quarter, Biopharmaceutical volume growth of 10% in the BRIC-MT markets, most notably in China,
Mexico, and Russia, was partially offset by price reductions of 1%, resulting in operational growth of 9%. Year-to-date,
operational growth in the BRIC-MT markets was 13% versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting volume growth of 16%,
partially offset by price reductions of 3%.
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing the ranges for our
full-year financial guidance components. We are narrowing the reported revenue range to $58 billion to $59 billion
from $58 billion to $60 billion. We are decreasing and narrowing the range of adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of
revenues to 18.7% to 19.2%.
We are decreasing and narrowing our adjusted SI&A expense range to $16.3 billion to $16.8 billion. We are narrowing
our R&D guidance range to $7 billion to $7.25 billion. I want to point out that our R&D guidance includes the $250
million payment to AstraZeneca for the exclusive global over-the-counter rights to Nexium which we recorded in the
third quarter.
We now expect other deductions to be approximately $900 million and continue to expect the effective tax rate on
adjusted income to be approximately 29%. We are increasing and narrowing the range of our reported diluted EPS to
$1.30 to $1.38, and we are narrowing our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.14 to $2.17. Finally, we now expect
operating cash flow to be approximately $18.5 billion, which reflects the charge related to the Rapamune settlement
recorded in the third quarter.
Our third-quarter results continue to reflect the loss of exclusivity of certain products, mainly Lipitor in all major
markets. That said, we're continuing to mitigate the impact of the Lipitor LOE with expense discipline and share
repurchases. We received U.S. regulatory approval for Bosulif, and in the European Union, we received approval for
Inlyta and conditional marketing authorization for Xalkori.
We filed the registration statement in mid-August for a potential initial public offering of up to a 20% ownership stake
in the Animal Health business, to be named Zoetis. In addition, we filed an amendment to the S-1 on October 10, which
included updated financial statements through the second quarter 2012. We remain on track to complete a potential IPO
in the first half of 2013, and as we continue to work toward a separation of the business, we remain open to all
alternatives to maximize the after-tax return for our shareholders.
We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation, with approximately $5.9 billion, or 255
million shares, repurchased through October 31. Approximately $4.1 billion of authorization remains under the current
repurchase program.
The board of directors also just recently authorized a new program, upon the sale of the Nutrition business, to
repurchase up to $10 billion of our shares over time. We now expect to complete the sale of our Nutrition business to
Nestlé in the next few months. Finally, we expect to return more than $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends
and share repurchases during 2012.

Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.
Charles E. Triano
Thanks for the review, Frank. At this point, Operator, if we could please poll for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Ian and Frank, question for you both, if you can give us some sort of granularity and color on what
the revenue outlook for this company might look like 2013 and beyond. Obviously, 2012, we were in the teeth of patent
expirations with the Lipitor LOE, but how should we think about, directionally, revenue outlook going forward? And
just also, to follow-up on tofa, Ian, you said you expected the FDA to act on or before the PDUFA date. Can you share
with us your expectations for what kind of label you might receive? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Jami. Well, revenue outlook, I'll make a few comments and then let Frank add
anything he wants to, and I'll ask Geno to answer on the tofa question. The peak year of patent expiration for us, as far
as we can see, is 2012 of approximately $8 billion. Subsequent to that, 2013, 2014, and 2015 will continue to be faced
with LOEs and alliance revenue losses. They will be substantially lower than that, probably a peak of $4 billion in one
of the years, but between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in the subsequent three years, still subject to alterations and
fluctuations as patents expire.
So, countering that, of course, we will have in-line growth from our patented products with Emerging Market growth.
We'll have the launch, we expect, of tofacitinib and Eliquis, and we expect to also have the launch of adult vaccine. So
those are the two currents, I would say, that would be affecting our revenue over those years. So, Frank, do you want to
add anything to that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: I would simply add that in addition to everything Ian said, we will also continue to manage
our cost structure and we will continue to do share repurchases, and all those things will lead to steady, consistent
earnings growth over time.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Geno, on tofa?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, just a couple comments, Jami, on tofa. We're nearing, I think, the end of the review
process. We do expect that we'll have an action by the PDUFA date this month. And with regard to our expectations, I
think you know that we have a very robust data set behind tofa, with five large pivotal trials, showing a good efficacy
and safety in both the pre-TNF and post-TNF setting. We think that the results that we've seen across this broad range
of trials and broad range of patient types showed very consistent response, and we're expecting to have a very
competitive label.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question, please, Operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. Ian, you had mentioned this earlier about all strategic options being on the
table for Pfizer. So, last year, in July of 2011, you disavowed splitting up the drug side of the business when you give

your strategic update. That language in 2012 has changed subtly, and I'm just wondering if you can provide any more
specifics on potentially splitting up the drug side, so what could it look like look? What could the structure be, and
importantly, when would we hear more? And then on tofacitinib, if I can just ask one question, do you expect that
you'll get both the 5-mg and the 10-mg doses approved on the first go-round?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Well, I'll take the overall company question and then ask Geno to reply on tofa. So I think
I've tried to be clear on this, that I see, if putting Consumer to one side, which fits with either of the other two
remaining businesses, I see as us having two businesses going forward once we finish the – if we do complete the
separation of Nutritional and Animal Health, I see us having a growth business or innovative business that's fueled by
the pipeline that I discussed earlier in my comments today, and then I see a value business which is, depending on
post-LOE or peri-LOE products, very broad geographic capabilities, large capabilities in reimbursement and managing
the global business.
So those two businesses I think are core businesses for us. We will – we already have, in the developed market,
separated those businesses out, so we do have an innovative business and an Established Products business, which
equates roughly to those two segments. And in Emerging Markets, we continue to manage them as country
organizations. Now, once we get through the changes of Animal Health and the Nutritional, we will continue to look at
how to best structure those two businesses so they can maximize the value to Pfizer.
Geno, do you want to comment?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, sure. Tim, regarding the 5-mg and 10-mg, as you know, in all five of the pivotal trials
that we conducted, we tested both the 5-mg and the 10-mg doses. Again, the results were very consistent across the
board, across the patient types in the trials that were done. We believe that the benefit/risk is favorable for both the
5-mg and the 10-mg, and at this point in our discussions with FDA, we're not going to comment any further on what we
expect the final outcome to be.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Maybe if I could just first build on
Tim's question, will you report out separately at any point in the next year or so the Established Products P&L versus
the branded products P&L, so not breaking the company up, but just giving us more disclosure in the K's and the Q's
around those business operations? And then I had a question, if I may, for Dolsten – for Mikael Dolsten, sorry. I was
wondering if he could update us just on timelines, make sure everything's on track for the Prevnar CAPiTA trial, and
also bring us up to speed on the mening B and Staph vaccine programs. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, I'm going to ask Frank to answer the question on the reporting structure, and then, Mikael,
if you could take those – the questions on the CAPiTA trial.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, on reporting, we provide revenue detail today by individual business units, so in charts
that I walked through, there's clearly revenue detail by business unit. In terms of beyond revenue detail, I think the way
to think about this is the Established Products business has lower gross margins than the traditional pharmaceutical
businesses, but has comparable operating margins because it requires less expenses, which is something that we've
talked about previously. And going forward, we'll do what we always do, which is see where there are opportunities to
improve the transparency of the company, and to the extent that we see those opportunities to be more transparent, we'll
incorporate those into our external reporting.

<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes. Thank you for your interest in our vaccine pipeline. So the Prevnar CAPiTA trial is an
event-driven, and pending the seasonality and severity of pneumonias, often triggered by colds and flu seasons. We
have in our projections that CAPiTA may have sufficient events during 2013 to allow us to aggregate data during the
latter part of that year. Mening B has gone through very productive dialogues with regulatory agencies in U.S. and
Europe, and we anticipate starting and plan to start before end of this year. Staph Aureus contains two studies that are
in Phase II, with a readout during next year.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question, please, Operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks and good morning, two housekeeping questions and one R&D question, please. What
were the sales for Xalkori and Inlyta? And, second, if you look at Sutent, could we argue that it might be slowing; if
you simply look at it sequentially, has it totally maxed its potential?
And then for Dr. Dolsten, on earlier-stage product in PCSK9, Pfizer seems to be a little bit behind at least two
competitors, given the Phase IIb just started from a dosing perspective and will not complete until next year, suggesting
the Phase III trial would not necessarily start up until sometime later next year or even later than that. And the question
really is how would you envision this emerging – is a year behind not that big of a deal, and more importantly, do you
think that there is a unique characteristic for your molecule that may be different from others? Thank you very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Tony. Frank, could you address the sales of Xalkori and Inlyta? And perhaps Geno
wants to comment on Sutent, and then I'll make a couple of comments on PCSK9, and ask Mikael to comment further.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure, so on Xalkori, revenues for the third quarter almost $40 million; for Inlyta, revenues
for the third quarter were almost $30 million, so approximately $40 million and approximately $30 million for those
two drugs, respectively.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, and for Sutent, Sutent it is doing very well. It remains the number-one choice in
first-line metastatic RCC, and frankly, it's showing a lot of durability. So we're looking forward to continuing our
leadership position in RCC now with Sutent, Inlyta, and Torisel. It's a real strong franchise for us.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. On Xalkori, the testing has gone up from 11%, I think, at the beginning of year, now
to 55%, which is very encouraging, because that required a change in physician practice, and if that occurs, it makes us
more optimistic about the potential for Xalkori going forward, and of course we now have the launch coming in
Europe. On PCSK9, yeah, I believe that we may be potentially a little bit behind some of our competitors. It really is an
issue of, as you say, is the differentiation, and if we don't have a first-in-class, do we believe we potentially have a
best-in-class asset, and clearly, the development of this asset has several strategic options. Mikael, do you want to add
anything on the science of that?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, let me just add a few words there. We are very excited about this drug class. We think
there may be differences between antibodies in their performance, in their immunicity, and in the dosing regimen, and
it's important to have the optimal dose regimen to allow sustained relevant cholesterol levels in a convenient manner to
be accomplished.

The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Two pipeline questions; the first is specific. I'm hoping to better understand the
meningococcal B development program. As I see it on clinicaltrials.gov, you're running a Phase III safety study
involving 7,500 patients, and since it has the word safety in the title, I'm assuming that the drug – or the vaccine cannot
be filed after that trial, that there will need to be additional Phase III trial work. But I may be wrong, so just wondering,
if that trial successfully concludes, can you file, or do you need to do additional Phase III work?
Then the second question is for Mikael Dolsten. Mikael, can you just highlight the key Phase II product readouts that
we should be watching in the next 12 to 18 months besides the PCSK9 which you've already discussed? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, David. Mikael, could you handle the mening B question and then also address the
pipeline?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so in the mening B program, it's correct we have a safety study ongoing. But we're
planning this year to start – and also early next year, several other studies that include large efficacy studies and
different batch lot consistency studies and potentially concomitant vaccine studies. So it will be a broad program that
will be aimed to show effectiveness to raise relevant immune responses and applicability for young and adolescent
patients to use the vaccine.
When it comes to the pipeline, what should be the next wave to watch, so let me briefly mention some 10 key
opportunities in four therapeutic areas. In Oncology, I would mention dacomitinib for non-small cell lung cancer,
inotuzumab for B-cell malignancies, and PD 991, our exciting CDK inhibitor for advanced breast cancer. We are
planning to present Phase II data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December.
In vaccines, we already spoke about mening B vaccine and the Staph aureus vaccine, which will have a POC readout
during next year. Tofacitinib is, of course, the flagship in our immunology therapeutic area, with a portfolio of
opportunities beyond RA.
We are in Phase III for psoriasis and ulcerous colitis. We're studying additional indications in Phase II, including
Crohn's, and we're supplementing our inflammatory bowel disease activity with POC studies for MAdCAM and IL-6
antibodies, which will have readouts in the next 12 months to 18 months. The IL-6 antibody will also have utility, and
there is a POC study ongoing, in lupus.
And, finally, in the cardiovascular metabolic area, in addition to PCSK9, we also have an exciting pancreatic acting
glucokinase drug. So, as you can see, I have selected some 10 key opportunities of a very rich and diverse pipeline of
some 90 projects. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. I would just add to that that, clearly, we started the safety program in mening
B because those trials take longer than the efficacy programs, and clearly, as we started our Phase III trials, we now
have an agreed-upon development program with the FDA that we believe will lead to approval.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Great. Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, Operator?

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Thank you very much. Just a couple here. First, Emerging Market growth, it looks like it's
about 10% year-to-date year-over-year growth, obviously, a nice step-up over the 2011 results. But just interested in
your thoughts on the longer-term growth opportunity in these markets. Do you think you can sustain low-double digit
growth in the emerging markets over time? Or has enough changed in the macro environment where that's no longer a
reasonable target?

Second question was on the commercial opportunity for Eliquis. Just any thoughts on your expectations for the label
you might receive there and how you're thinking about that market and how it's evolved so far with your competitors?
And then, finally, can you just give us an update on the status of Remoxy and Embeda, just kind of how we should be
thinking about those? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, thank you. I'm going to ask Olivier to comment on emerging market growth potential, and
then John Young will do the Eliquis and the Remoxy.
<A - Olivier Brandicourt>: Chris, yeah, we think we can continue to perform in line with our goals of high-single
digit growth over the period. The macro trends continue to be favorable, with increased amount of spending on
healthcare and a pharmaceutical market which is growing at 12% to 15% in the next few years. So, again, we think we
can maintain the high-single digit.
And, again, if you look at the 6% we achieved during the quarter, it's very much influenced by the Prevnar and Enbrel
institutional sales to government. And if you take out that cadence, you look at the base business, during Q1 2012 we
grew by 9%. The second quarter of 2012 and this quarter is still 11% percent. So all of that indicates that we have a
pretty strong foundation, and we think we can continue to build on it.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, I would add also we're very pleased with our presence in the BRIC-MT markets with the
accelerated growth there and the strength of our organizations. We're the number one multinational in China, and we
have impressive positions in the other BRIC-MT markets. So, with that, John, would you like to take the other
questions?
<A - John D. Young>: Okay. Thanks for your questions, Chris. So let me take Eliquis first, and say that, obviously, as
you're aware and as we announced previously on the 26 of September, the FDA acknowledged our receipt of the
Eliquis NDA resubmission for our nonvalvular atrial fibrillation indication. Those discussions between Pfizer and BMS
and the FDA are ongoing. We continue to work very closely with them. And, as you know, the target date for the FDA
to complete their review is the 17 of March, 2013, which is when the PDUFA date occurs.
In terms of your question about how do we see the potential, clearly, we believe that Eliquis is differentiated from
warfarin because it's demonstrated superior efficacy, bleeding and all-cause mortality compared to warfarin in a single
dose. And so we believe that we should have a compelling profile for both cardiologists as well as primary care
physicians, and we're obviously working very closely with our partners, BMS, to finalize the strategies and plans to
make sure that we're very well prepared for launch.
So if I turn now to Remoxy and Embeda, if I take Embeda first of all, we met with the FDA in May of this year to
discuss our proposal for reintroduction of Embeda to the market. The required stability programs are underway, and we
anticipate a submission of a prior approval supplement in the first half of 2013. If I turn to Remoxy, as you probably
know from previous calls, Remoxy has been a challenging asset that our teams have been working on very diligently
since the acquisition of King. And as a result of that work and the extensive insights that we've gained around the
formulation, we've initiated confirmatory bioavailability studies to assess the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of
modified Remoxy formulation compositions, and we expect those studies to read out early in 2013.
And we think that the results of those studies will provide us a much greater clarity on whether or not we'll be able to
adequately address the questions raised in the complete response letter that we received from the FDA. So we're
targeting a late March meeting with the FDA to discuss those outputs and agree on a go or no-go decision. I think one
last comment just to make is that I think it's important to remember that our commitment to this area is very strong, and
as such, we continue to invest in our compound ALO-02, which is an extended-release oxycodone which uses the
naltrexone platform technology, and it's currently in Phase III.

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve Scala>: Frank, would you dissect the strength in gross profit margin, how much was currency, how much
were efficiencies and how much was mix? And also, how much of the narrowing of the range in sales and EPS
guidance for the year is due to adverse currency fluctuations? And then one for Dr. Dolsten, what is your postmortem
on bapineuzumab? Was that it flawed molecule, did you study the wrong patients, or is the mechanism in your view
unlikely to be effective? Thank you.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: All right, so let me hit the two questions you asked me, Steve. So, first on efficiencies,
foreign exchange relative to the quarter, let me run the numbers, which is if you look at our total adjusted costs for the
quarter, they were down, and this includes the cost of goods sold, SI&A, and R&D, they were down $1.3 billion, so
from $9.5 billion last year to $8.2 billion this year. Foreign exchange helped that by $440 million. So if you take the
$1.3 billion, subtract $440 million, you get roughly $850 million. That was down 8% operationally.
If you also add back or adjust for the Nexium payment that we made, that 8% becomes 11%, which is what Ian
mentioned in his opening remarks. So, in terms of foreign exchange to the bottom line, foreign exchange hurt the
quarter by $0.02. And by the way, just in terms of rhythm of the numbers, if you look last year in Q3, it actually helped
Q3 by $0.04, so it was a $0.04 good guy last quarter, $0.02 bad guy this quarter.
In terms of the revenue guidance, the updated guidance is within the guidance that we provided for the year. We had
said $58 billion to $60 billion. We tightened it this quarter, left the lower end of the range, and then lowered the top end
of the range from $60 billion to $59 billion. That decrease, if you look from midpoint to midpoint, is really primarily
driven by foreign exchange.
And you can't just look at the euro, which is typically what we do. And that's a big piece of our revenues, about 18% of
our revenues are euro-denominated; but the yen and the Brazilian real have really been moving against us, quite
frankly, since the beginning of the year, the real more recently. And then when we tighten the ranges, it has a more
pronounced effect, which is why we lowered the range from $58 billion to $60 billion, to $58 billion to $69 billion (sic)
[$59 billion] (38:44). So the short answer is foreign exchange is the driver relative to our revenue guidance.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank. And within the euro being roughly 18% of our sales, the yen represents 10%
and the real represents 4%. So basically, while traditionally, people just look at the euro, you've got to look at that mix
to model the impact of exchange on Pfizer. I'm going to ask Olivier to answer the question on bapi, and then I'll ask
Mikael Dolsten to add anything if he thinks he wants to do that after Olivier's comments.
<A - Olivier Brandicourt>: All right, Steve, so we are currently closing out the bapi IV program, as you know. We
have not seen any evidence of clinical activity in any of the relevant sub-population we studied. We reported the results
earlier in October and, as we speak, at the Clinical Trials AD meeting this week in Monte Carlo.
And the only study which is remaining with bapi is a sub-Q formulation study, which is called the SUMMIT AD. It's
actually fully enrolled at this point, and we are expecting to see the results during the first quarter 2013. I'd like to
mention that it's only a biomarker study. It's not an efficacy or safety study at this point.
So the alliance is going to look at all the biomarker analysis we have, not only coming from what we have already, but
an additional two products, ACC-001 and also AAB-003, and that information will actually inform our future work
regarding potential program on AD with any of those candidates which we have in our pipeline. So we continue to
believe in the beta amyloid pathway and we're committed to research in AD. And to that point, I'd like to ask Mikael
eventually to mention a few.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, I would assume that anything you would say would be speculation, but go ahead.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, no, I think Olivier summarized it in an excellent manner. And we do continue, as many
in the field, to believe that effective intervention with amyloid formation at an early stage of the disease is a valid way
forward to explore. We have a broad AD pipeline with both disease-modifying and symptomatic approaches.

Let me mention our SAM-760 5-HT6 antagonist that has completed Phase I and is considered for further studies. We
have other ways to interfere with amyloid formation, such as BACE and gamma-secretase inhibitors in late pre-clinical,
and as Olivier mentioned, we are assessing different antibody approaches to modulating BACE amyloid, and this
reflects our continued interest to research in Alzheimer's disease.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question, please, Operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Thanks for the question. Just wondering, can we get a little bit more color on how we
should be thinking about the growth drivers of Prevnar 13, particularly in the pediatric indications going forward? What
percentage of NIPs are now filled, given the fact that we are seeing this slowdown in the U.S.?
And then, separately, as we think about some of the 2013 Phase III catalysts, Mikael, maybe you could give us a little
bit of your thoughts on the catalysts that you're most focused on? I think, historically, there's been talk about IO – that's,
I guess, the inotuzumab products for the antibody drug conjugates, as well as dacomitinib on the oncology side. Just
those are two that jump out at me. Thanks a lot.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, Geno, would you like to comment on Prevnar and the interplay between pediatric and adult?
And then Mikael will comment on the 2013.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, I think with Prevnar pediatric, what we're seeing now is primarily the effect of the
success that we had with the catch-up opportunity, where we added over $1 billion in value to the company by taking
full advantage of the catch-up opportunity when we introduced the 13-valent. And now we're reaching a point where
it's the base birth cohort that's driving the pediatric business.
We have very strong NIP performance across most of the developed world. We're still growing in Japan, and I think
future growth for the pediatric business will come from growth in emerging markets and in markets where we haven't
introduced the 13-valent yet, which would include Japan and China, and in the U.S., you get a little bit from price each
year.
But it's fundamentally a strong base of business that we think we can grow to some extent, but probably not
dramatically in the developed markets. The growth opportunity truly comes from the adult business.
As you know, without the formal recommendations in place yet, the adult business is slow to develop. In the U.S.,
we've recently gotten an ACIP recommendation for immunocompromised patients, and CDC has indicated that they
will make Prevnar a recommended vaccine as part of the hospital quality measures. These are things that will help
bring attention to the use of the conjugate vaccine in the adult population. But we think the real lift and the real big
opportunity for growth in the franchise comes when we have a broader set of recommendations from the major
recommending bodies around the world, which will occur post-CAPiTA.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno. Mikael?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, so left on the line there are a couple of interesting conferences end of this year already
with data, starting with the ACR Rheumatology Conference, where we will have several abstracts on tofacitinib,
including the ORAL Start study on structural endpoints in pre-methotrexate-treated patients. American Heart
Association, we will have [ph] P-59 (45:23) and also subanalysis from Eliquis studies.
I briefly mentioned San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. We will report the Phase II data from CDK
in advanced breast cancer. As you mentioned, dacomitinib, we will have two Phase III studies that are expected to be
presented at the conference in 2013. We will also show final analysis at a relevant medical conference in 2013 on

Operator
Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, can you just comment on your review regarding
M&A opportunities out there? Does this authorization of a new share repurchase program imply any view from you,
any change in view on the attractiveness of bolt-on opportunities and acquisitions that may or may not be out there?
Secondly, the cost savings does appear to be running somewhat ahead of at least our expectations. I'm wondering if it
is, from your point of view, just faster delivery than you may have originally anticipated, or do you think you can go
beyond what you have previously guided in terms of cost-saving and efficiencies within the business.
And then just lastly, wonder if you can make some sort of comment about the tax rate beyond this year. It appears you
may be seeing some structural mix changes in your tax rate. Maybe you can a little bit about that in terms of a
two/three-year outlook on the tax rate. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, on the – thank you for the questions, Jeff. On the bolt-on opportunities, we don't see that the
increased authorization for buybacks in any way diminishes our ability to do bolt-on M&A transactions, if we find
cases that can beat share buyback. And I'd ask Frank a look at the cost savings and the tax rate.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, so on the tax rate, we reiterated our guidance for the year, approximately 29%. I
think going forward, with all the uncertainty around tax reform, we should assume 29%. And the one thing I'll say is,
relative to tax reform, we support any tax reform that will enhance the global competitive of U.S. companies that are
operating internationally, but I think, going forward, given the uncertainty around this, we'll continue to assume
approximately 29%. In terms of the cost savings, I think the way I'll answer this is almost in terms of what inning we're
in relative to a baseball game. So if you think about a nine-inning game, we're clearly not in the early innings. Now, I
don't think we're in the late innings. I think we're toward the end of the middle innings. So there's still opportunity, but
clearly, the absolute size of the opportunity isn't what the size of the opportunity was a few years ago, given the billions
of dollars we've already taken out of our cost structure.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, I would say the changes going forward, the easy – if it ever was easy – some of the targets,
the more obvious targets, have already been taken care of, and now it's going to be cost reductions or increased
efficiency is going to be coming from exactly that, looking at business models and structure, and as Frank said, the
targets that were there available have been hit and taken care of. So, with that, I think we'll move on.

Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, Enbrel and other TNFs seemed to be little
weaker in Europe this quarter. We've heard about some cost-containment measures focused on TNFs. To what extent
do you see this as an opportunity for tofa as a potentially cheaper option that has similar efficacy? And as a follow-up,
the Animal Health business was a little bit lighter operationally compared to what we've seen with some of your peers.
Is there anything that was unique to this quarter that we should be aware of? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Geno, if you could do Enbrel, and then, Frank, if you'd like to answer Animal Health.

<A - Geno J. Germano>: Sure. Yeah, I think that the TNF inhibitors, and frankly, the whole pharmaceutical portfolio,
has experienced some challenge with cost-containment measures in Europe. Our TNF business has been impacted more
in the southern European countries than in the north, but there is some effect there. The volume growth remains fairly
strong, so I think the place for TNF inhibitors is relatively secure. I think in terms of tofa, we will announce our pricing
strategy once we have approval and we're ready to introduce the product.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: On Animal Health, let me run the numbers; then I'll give a little color commentary. So, to
your point, Alex, the quarter year-to-date growth was 4%, but if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, the operating
growth was 6%, so we'll get some volatility quarter to quarter, but on a nine-month, year-to-date basis, 6%.
If you drill down a little bit, we see increased demand across the global livestock portfolio, increased demand across
the companion animal portfolio, and increased demand in certain key geographies. And I think the watch items are,
clearly, the drought in the U.S. Midwest and Southwest and just what's going on in Europe, and in particular, southern
Europe, relative to the economy, but net-net, year-to-date basis, 6% operating growth, which we view as nice for that
business.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Damien Conover from Morningstar.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Great, thanks for taking the question. Most of my questions have been asked, but just wanted
to follow up on the management of the cost structure. And just kind of continuing the baseball analogy, it depends, I
guess, when you start the analogy, but you look at towards the end of the middle innings, it might suggest anywhere in
the neighborhood of about $1 billion to $2 billion in annual cost savings still to be pulled out from Pfizer, just
wondering if you could maybe characterize where that number fits in the scheme.
And also, when you look at managing the cost structure, are you largely balancing costs that could be saved from
products losing exclusivity versus costs that will be needed to launch new products? And then, just lastly, I was
wondering if you could comment on the variable costs supporting Celebrex. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: When we look at our costs, you obviously look at a company that has grown by acquisitions,
which has allowed us to take out costs as we do the acquisitions. You look at our global position, and we carefully
analyze what is our share of voice, what is our share of mind against our competitors, and we analyze that in the
context of an industry that is in itself restructuring and faced with headwinds on pricing and access, so that the spend
you need to put in the marketplace depends, to a large extent, on the competitive set you're against.
So we tend to look at the spending of our competitors and what we need to do to remain competitive as a benchmark.
So I want to be clear here that we are looking at our costs, but always with a view to remaining competitive in the
marketplace. Frank, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: I'll just – maybe I'll give a little sub-ledger detail relative to what I said relative to where
we are and then some of the opportunities going forward. So, first, if you think about manufacturing, we've said, I've
said previously we still have, give or take, about 10 manufacturing facilities that we plan to exit over the next several
years in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Ireland, 10 manufacturing facilities. That obviously represents a significant
opportunity. I think we continue to streamline our corporate center and enabling function services.
We continue to believe there's additional opportunities there. And then we're looking at all of our functions, everything
that we do in terms of where are there opportunities to be more efficient, more productive. We've been doing that. We'll
continue to do that. But those are some of the opportunity areas relative to what we can do on a going-forward basis

<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, and we don't really release variable or fixed costs around individual products for
competitive reasons. Thank you.

Operator
Your final question comes from the line of [ph] Mark [indiscernible] (53:30) from UBS.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Hello, [ph] Mark (53:32).
<Q>: Yeah, hi. Ian, in the past, you've talked about cost-cutting in Europe and how you're really focused on taking
more costs out of Europe and changing the business model a little bit. I was wondering if you were prepared to talk
about that a little bit. And then second question is on gross margin. Once we eliminate these 10 plants and once we get
through a couple more years of patent expiries, what is the sustainable gross margin? Are we still around 80%? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Yeah, Europe is – the opportunities in Europe, of course, center around, as the European
Union moves towards a more centralized regulatory environment, what do you need to do on a country-by-country
basis to maintain a commercially competitive organization and what you need to do to maintain your marketing and
medical and the infrastructure. And it's interesting. If you compare Europe with the U.S., which is a lot simpler because
it's federal and it's one regulation, but as Europe moves towards that, and we tend to look at the treatment of Europe,
while not identical, but more similarly to a structure you would have in the U.S. But I'd ask John Young if he wants to
add anything to that, as he's been managing – previously managing Europe for some considerable time.
<A - John D. Young>: Yeah, I think the only add I would give is that, obviously, as we do in all of our regions with all
of our businesses around the world, one of the things that we will continue to do is to make sure that we deploy our
resources in line with the opportunities to generate revenue growth and value for shareholders. That is something that
we've been doing very actively, as you know, over the last three to four years. And in line with our continued evolution
of the pipeline, we'll continue to deploy our resources appropriately in Europe to maximize shareholder value as the
portfolio continues to evolve.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Frank, do you want to try to answer the gross margin question?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. So I think, clearly, there'll be downward pressure on our gross margin on a
going-forward basis, when you think about how the mix of our revenues is changing, but I think the thing to focus on is
our operating margins. And we can continue to generate cost reduction and productivity improvements to keep that
operating margin relatively constant on a going-forward basis.
