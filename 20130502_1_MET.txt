MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the MetLife first quarter 2013 earnings release
conference call. [Operator Instructions]
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial
results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result
of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar

We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called
non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly
comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press
release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most
directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable
forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have
a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and
John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today
to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas;
Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning everyone. I know that capital management is of great interest to our investors. And I
trust you saw last week's announcement of a 49% increase in our common stock dividend, the first increase since 2007.
Our new dividend results in a Payout Ratio of approximately 20%, which is in line with our peers.
The dividend increase as well as our plan to internally fund the $2 billion acquisition of AFP Provida demonstrates our
commitment to making effective use of capital. Nevertheless, given prevailing regulatory uncertainty, we continue to
assume no share repurchases in our 2013 plan.
Turning to our quarterly results, we are pleased to report that the year is off to a good start. The first-quarter 2013
operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 12% over the first quarter of 2012. Operating earnings per share were $1.48, an
8% increase over the prior-year period. And operating return on equity was 12.7% on annualized basis. Our operating
earnings were aided by strong equity markets, favorable investment margins, and good performance on expenses.
Net income for the quarter was $956 million. The difference between net and operating income is primarily explained
by derivative losses related to asymmetrical accounting treatment and non-economic factors.
The first quarter included $411 million of after-tax derivative losses from economic hedges, where the associated risk
does not have the same GAAP accounting treatment, as well as $269 million of after-tax derivative losses related to
MetLife's own credit spread.
John Hele will discuss our financial results in further detail in a few minutes.
As I said on our December guidance call, MetLife faces external headwinds that we cannot control, such as low interest
rates and regulatory uncertainty. However, we are focusing on mitigating the impact of these headwinds and executing
our strategy in the areas we can control to create shareholder value.
A good example of this is our effort to reduce expenses. We have said that the bulk of our expense-saving opportunities
are in the U.S., and our results reflect solid progress in this market with total fixed operating expenses down 3% year
over year.
We are extremely pleased with this performance, especially considering that premiums, fees, and other revenues in the
U.S. were up 4% year over year and up 5% excluding pension closeouts. This expense-margin improvement
contributed $0.05 to earnings per share on a year-over-year basis.
Expenses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but it's clear that our cost-saving initiatives are translating to improved
bottom-line results. Going forward, we remain focused on achieving the full $600 million of annual pre-tax net expense
savings discussed at our May 2012 Investor Day.

The consolidation of our U.S. real-estate footprint announced in March is an example of these efforts. By moving 2,600
retail and technology jobs to North Carolina, we are reducing labor and real-estate costs, enabling better employee
collaboration, and driving efficiencies.
Sales growth in emerging markets is another area of strategic focus to drive shareholder value. First-quarter results
showed continued momentum on a year-over-year basis with sales in Latin America up 20% and sales in the emerging
economies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa up 40%, driven by strong results in the Gulf, Turkey, and Russia.
The sales increase in emerging markets combined with a 29% decline in U.S. variable-annuity sales in the quarter
reflects substantial progress on our efforts to shift our business mix away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive
products. We remain on track to sell $10 billion to $11 billion of variable annuities this year, which would be a decline
of approximately 40% from last year.
Now let me turn to the current interest-rate environment. With the 10-year Treasury yield falling back to below 1.7%
and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield at less than 60 basis points, we recognize that investors and analysts
are concerned about the potential impact of low rates on our business. However, our analysis suggests that a sustained
low-rate environment is a manageable risk.
The current rate environment in the U.S. is very similar to the interest-rate stress scenario discussed in our 2012 10-K
filing, which assumes, among other things, a 1.69% 10-year Treasury to the end of 2014. Based upon these
assumptions, operating earnings per share would decrease by $0.04 in 2013 and $0.13 in 2014.
In addition, we see incremental earnings risk if rates remain at current levels in Japan, but the estimated impact would
be immaterial this year and less than $0.05 per share in 2014.
Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the regulatory environment.
MetLife faces the possibility of being named a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI, which
would place us under Federal Reserve supervision. To date, MetLife has not been notified by the Financial Stability
Oversight Council that we have been moved to stage III of the process for designating SIFIs, although the conventional
wisdom holds that we will be at some point. That is why I am spending time in Washington, participating in the debate
on this important issue.
In a speech delivered at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last month, I stated that the traditional business of life
insurance does not present systemic risk to the U.S. economy. And that MetLife should not be named a SIFI. My three
main points were: One, the life insurance business did not cause the financial crisis; imposing bank centric regulations
on certain life insurance companies, however, well intentioned would negatively affect the availability and affordability
of financial protection for consumers; and three, there is a better way for the Federal government to regulate potentially
systemic activities in the life insurance sector. Rather than name a handful of life insurance companies as SIFIs
regulators should target those activities that cause the financial crisis in the first place. The Dodd-Frank Act defined a
SIFI as a company whose failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The Financial
Stability Oversight Council or FSOC clarified that such a threat only exists if there would be an impairment of financial
market functioning that would be sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy.
There is no evidence that any traditional life insurance company is sufficiently interconnected with the rest of the
financial system to meet that test. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that MetLife could never fail. What I am suggesting is
that we cannot think of a single firm that would be brought down its exposure to MetLife. For example, in our
derivatives book, counter-party exposure to MetLife, net of collateral, is insignificant as a percentage of counter-party
total capital. The average exposure in the event of the MetLife default is one-quarter of 1% of a derivatives dealer's
total capital. The largest exposure is three-quarters of 1% of total capital – simply not large enough to create systemic
risk. An approach that focuses on activities is more likely to capture systemic risk regardless of the size of the firm. An
activities based approach is also consistent with how regulation of a life insurance business is evolving internationally.
I am encouraged by the willingness of regulators and policy makers to listen to these perspectives and engage in a
dialog about these critical issues. My hope is that regulators will take into account the fundamental differences between

banks and insurance companies as the prudential rules for non-bank SIFIs are being finalized.
In closing, we are focused on executing our strategy to create sustained value for shareholders over time. Our strong
first quarter earnings and a meaningful increase in our common stock dividend illustrate our ability to manage through
external challenges. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail.
John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results including a discussion on insurance
margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash,
capital, and guidance. To begin, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion, or $1.48 per share, up 12% year
over year. This quarter included two notable items. The first was in our retail annuities business. We had a
non-recurring benefit related to our assumption review for variable annuities as some of the models required adjustment
to reflect the full impact of the lower lapse rates.
This increased operating earnings by $29 million after tax or $0.03 per share. Second, pre-tax variable investment
income was $337 million, reflecting strong private equity returns and higher bond prepayments. After taxes and the
impact of DAC, variable investment income was $217 million, which is $22 million or $0.02 per share above the top
end of our 2013 quarterly guidance range.
Turning to our bottom line results, first quarter net income was $956 million or $0.87 per share and included net
derivative losses of $410 million after tax. As Steve mentioned, the net derivative losses in the quarter included a $680
million after-tax loss, which is explained by three items: One, the tightening of Met's own credit spread; two, changes
in currency rates driven principally by the weakening of the yen, relative to the U.S. dollar; and three, an increase in
interest rates. These factors were partially offset by favorable VA hedge performance, favorable market conditions and
changes in the in-force. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $47.37 at March 31, up 2% year over year.
Turning to margins, underwriting in the U.S. was generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life
was 92.7% due to unfavorable experience in both V&UL and traditional life. This result was higher than the target
range which is in the mid-80s and slightly worse than 91.6% ratio in the first quarter of 2012. The mortality ratio in
Group Life was 91.3% in the quarter, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 89.1% and above the target range of 85%
to 90%.
The increase in the mortality ratio was driven by more term claims and a higher average term life death benefit. To give
you better sense of the earnings sensitivity for retail life mortality, a 1 percentage point change in the mortality ratio
equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $2 million to $3 million. For Group Life, a 1
percentage point change in loss ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $8 million to $10
million. The Group Health benefit ratio was 88.9%, up 140 points from the prior year quarter of 87.5% but within the
targeted range of 86% to 90%. A 1 percentage point change in the loss ratio equates to operating earnings impact of
approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis.
Next, let me discuss investment spreads. In our QFS, we now provide spreads including and excluding variable
investment income. You will note the spreads remained healthy across all major product lines in the U.S., although we
did see some modest year over year tightening in deferred annuities and corporate benefit funding. Overall, investment
spreads were better than planned in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate that investment spreads will decline for
the full year, but the earnings risk is relatively modest in 2013 and 2014, even if interest rates stay at current levels in
the U.S. and Japan.
Turning to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.9% for the first quarter. Excluding the impact of pension and
post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 23.2%. This compares favorably to the first
quarter of 2012, which had an operating expense ratio of 24.9% and 24.3% excluding pension and post-retirement
benefits and closeouts. We are pleased with this performance. As it reflects progress on a strategic goal to reduce net
expenses by $600 million. However, results also benefited somewhat from the timing of expenses.

I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I will focus on
areas where our results may have differed from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on Retail, Group,
Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Asia and EMEA.
Retail reported operating earnings of $626 million, a year-over-year increase of 33%. Normalized operating earnings
were $581 million, after accounting for previously mentioned, non-recurring VA lapse adjustment of $29 million and
variable investment income that was $16 million higher than planned. This variable investment income was split, $3
million in retail annuities and $13 million in retail, life and other.
On a normalized basis, retail operating earnings were up 17% versus the first quarter of 2012 due to higher net
investment income, lower ongoing DAC amortization annuities, and lower operating expenses. These positive items
were partially offset by unfavorable underwriting results in Life.
Normalized operating earnings for retail annuities were $340 million, an increase of 21% from the prior year quarter.
Growth was driven by a favorable ongoing DAC amortization and lower expenses. We do not normalize for variances
in separate account returns and earnings in retail annuities with $33 million higher than planned as a result of strong
stock market performance in the quarter.
As a forward-looking rule of thumb, a 1 percentage point change in the S&P 500 equates to approximately $1 million
to $3 million of operating earnings in the current quarter and roughly $5 million of operating earnings in the next 12
months. These are just rules of thumb and actual results will vary based on the equity bond mix in the separate accounts
and the performance of other indices. Due to these factors, the market impact this quarter went slightly higher than the
forward-looking rule of thumb.
This was a good quarter for retail annuities with normalized operating earnings higher than planned by approximately
$80 million. However, the results in the quarter benefited from items that may not occur in future quarters and we
continue to expect investment spread compression. Normalized operating earnings for retail, life and other were $241
million, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Earnings were as expected, despite worse than expected mortality as
both investment margins and expenses were favorable.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $230 million, down 5% year over year. After
adjusting for normalizing items in both periods, which included variable investment income that was $4 million below
plan in this quarter, normalized operating earnings were down 1% year over year. Higher interest margins, expense
management and favorable underwriting in the dental business were more than offset by lower underwriting results in
Group Life and long-term care. In long-term care, the benefit ratio was higher than planned due to higher incidence and
reserve adjustments.
Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $333 million in the quarter, up 11% year over year and 12% on a constant
currency basis. After adjusting for normalized items in both periods which included variable investment income of $10
million above planned this quarter, normalized operating earnings were up 12% from the prior year quarter. This was
due to higher fee income from the surrender of certain fixed annuity products in Japan and an increase in net
investment income.
The higher surrenders were largely the result of customers harvesting gains in foreign currency denominated fixed
annuity products primarily those in Australian dollars. We believe the intent was to shift assets into equities as a result
of the strong performance of the Nikkei and the TOPIX. The early indication that surrenders will remain elevated in the
second quarter. Although, we're only normalizing for variable investment income, it is important to note that the first
quarter results may not be indicative of future quarters' earnings.
First, excess surrenders added $29 million after tax and we assume that surrender activity will normalize eventually.
Plus there is lost earnings associated with these surrenders. Second, there was a $10 million after-tax benefit from a
loan repayment. Third, the initial impact from the strong equity market in Japan at an $8 million after tax. Finally,
currency weakness could be a bigger negative in future quarters.

As we have stated previously, we have hedges for our 2013 projected Yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices
at around JPY90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen
weakening beyond 90, but allow us to participate in the upside should the yen strengthen.
Our protection now extends in the first half of 2014 with currency options at around JPY90 in place for the first quarter
of 2014 and at around JPY95 for the second quarter of 2014. Let me reiterate that we still believe the low-end of our
2013 operated earnings guidance for Asia is a realistic expectation. Even though our plan assumes a Yen/dollar
exchange rate is slightly less than 82.
I'd like to close on Asia with a few comments on sales. Our first quarter sales were down 13% year over year and
below our plan, largely because of weakness in bank channel sales. In Japan, our sales through banks were down 60%
on a year-over-year basis. We are willing to trade business volume for business value as we remain disciplined on
pricing.
Finally, EMEA had strong operating earnings of $87 million in the first quarter, up 21% year over year and 17% on a
constant currency basis. The fundamental strength in the first quarter was driven by credit insurance in Russia, group
medical in the Gulf and lower expenses, but there are also a couple of one-time favorable items related to Greece.
These items were material for the segment but not the overall company.
I'd like to comment on a topic that I know is of great interest to our investors – cash. Cash and liquid assets of the
holding companies were approximately $4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter which is down from yearend, but
consistent with our plan given the anticipated timing of subsidiary dividends and holding company expenses.
Moving to our capital position; the combined RBC ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies excluding Alico at
yearend 2012 was 466%. Also, as of December 31, 2012, our Japan solvency margin ratio was 909%.
Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the
first quarter of 2013 was $793 million and $558 million, respectively. These results were lower than the prior year due
to less favorable market conditions and underwriting.
Our total adjusted capital is expected to approximately be $29.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2013, up 1% from
December 31.
Let me conclude by reiterating Steve's comment that the first quarter was a good start to 2013. By considering the
out-performance in the quarter, we are comfortable with the top end of our 2013 EPS guidance range of $4.95 to $5.35.
To help you think about the quarterly EPS run rate, we would suggest you consider a few things. Normalizing items
aided first quarter operating EPS by a nickel. The excess of the initial earnings impact from the strong equity market
relative to the ongoing benefit added about a nickel to first quarter EPS.
The anticipated decline in our investment margins even with the interest rate increase we assume in our plan is
expected to reduce quarterly EPS by more than a nickel on average. The timing of expenses added a couple of pennies
per share to the earnings in the first quarter, mostly outside of the U.S.
Also, you should assume that the unfavorable impact from yen weakness through remainder of the year and some
normalization of surrender activity in Japan may be largely offset by the accretion from the acquisition of Provida,
which is expected to close in the third quarter.
Finally, we don't believe it's prudent practice to revise full year guidance on a quarterly basis, especially after only one
quarter. And with that I will turn it back to Ed.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start with Steve, if I could. I thought your comments
around the presentation you made in Washington were helpful. Could you provide any color on how the response has
been and what the feedback was?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hi Suneet, I would say that policy makers, people on the hill, others in Washington
are listening carefully to the arguments, there is lot debate going on, I think it's healthy. I think having these views on
the table is important to make sure we get it right. This is an important industry. It affects millions of Americans across
our country and just really important that these financial protection products are still going to be available and
affordable to people going forward, especially the time when the social safety net is under a lot of pressure in our
country. So, I think people are being pretty thoughtful about the discussion, are listening carefully and I'm hopeful that
when things finally transpire here that we'll get a solution that makes sense.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: And anything on the timing of when things may transpire?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: We don't have any clarity on that, Suneet. You know, there have been statements
coming out of FSOC that they think that the first designations of non-bank SIFIs will be coming and the word they
used was "soon", but obviously that word doesn't have a great deal of specificity to it, so we have to wait and see how
that sorts out.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Got it and then just a follow-up for John, if I could on the holding company cash. I think
you said $4.8 billion, down a little bit from year-end, if we think back to that cash flow roll forward that you provided
in December. I know you had some items in there that were like placeholders, for example the Dodd-Frank collateral.
I'm not sure if we had real clarity on what the run rate holding company expenses were, but just sort of big picture, is
that cash flow roll-forward pretty much the same based on where you sit today or have there been any changes to it?
Thanks. Other than the dividend I understand that.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Sure – the $4.8 billion is where we plan to be, given the timing of our expenses and sub
dividends how we get them and the flows in and out. We did have a placeholder as we mentioned for Dodd-Frank
derivative collateral rules. Those are still a bit influx. The original rules that were specified last year in the U.S. were
somewhat onerous. However, the international rules had longer phase-in period and were not as onerous. There's still
discussion going on between which ones are going to be adopted. I believe they are leaning very much on the
international, less onerous rules with the longer phase-in period; but for now we are going to keep the placeholder in
and we'll have to see how things develop throughout the year.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: All right, thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Good morning, first question is, of the $600 million of cost saves that you're targeting,
can you tell us where you're at on that? How much is in this quarter's run rate to-date and how much is still on the come
through? I think Steve, you guys had said, the $600 million should be realized by the end of 2014, how much is still to
come on that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah, we've got net – and this is mainly hitting to the U.S. There is about $115 million, but we
have some one-time costs of about $40 million. So the net to the bottom line is about $75 million.

<A - John C. R. Hele>: So it's really, it's really $115 million, but there is a one-time cost of $40 million.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: And you're not stripping out that one – or are you stripping out that one-time cost from
operating?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: No, it's included.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Got it, okay. So, and that would be restructuring cost I presume?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes, but some of our reinvestment, the $600 million is a net number, so we plan to get to $1
billion with a $400 million reinvest over time when we get out there. So we'll start to have some more reinvest hitting
in, in future periods as well.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: So should I view that that you guys are more than half of the way there? Should I be
netting that against the full year $600 million pre-tax number? Or should I be netting that against $1 billion? I just want
to understand how you're thinking about that $115 million in the context of your goal?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah, I'd say we're about halfway there, may be a third to a half. The reinvestment timing is
still going to be phased in, but we've made good progress here.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Got it. And then Steve my follow-up is, just want to understand the yen sensitivity a
little bit better at a higher level. Can you tell us what percent of your Asia earnings or actually Japan because obviously
Korea is a pretty big contributor, so I want to understand; of the $330 million, how much is Japan and of the Japan how
much are yen denominated earnings versus U.S. dollar denominated earnings?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Let me wait in that, it's Chris Townsend. Let me just wait in and give you the
number in terms of the Japan proportion of the $333 million. The Japan earnings overall for the quarter are $303
million, part of $333 million and I think we're about 65% yen-based earnings on that.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Chris, that's 65% yen based of the $303 million?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: That's correct.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: Great. Thank you. Good morning. With capital, good to see the dividend increase last week, with
buybacks, I know you said your plan doesn't include any buybacks for this year. That said, did you have the dilutive
equity units coming up later this year?
Should we take it from your comments that offsetting the impact of those units is off the table or is that something you
could still consider over the course of the year? Also I know you're not a SIFI currently and you didn't need the
approval from the Fed, but would it be correct to assume that you did consult with them before going ahead with the
dividend raise? Thanks.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Nigel, we think a strong dividend and buybacks are both important to our
shareholders, those are two goals of ours going forward. As you've seen we've increased our dividend by 49% for the
second quarter and going forward, and we've also mentioned today that there are no buybacks planned in 2013. That's

what we're working with as an assumption. Clearly, the regulatory environment is a key factor in terms of what we do
in regard to buybacks and we're waiting for more clarity around that topic right now. So I think it's just prudent on our
part to take a wait and see attitude around how the regulation sorts out here over the course of the year before we make
commitments about buybacks.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: And with the dividends. Did you consult at all with the Fed?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: No, in terms of talking to the Fed, as you know, we sold our bank in January. We
legally de-banked in February. We're no longer regulated by the Federal Reserve. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to go
to them at this point in time.
Although I'll tell you that certainly we went through the stress-test exercise in late 2011, early 2012. We had $1.10
dividend request in that test, and we've already made that public. Back in 2012, we made that public. So the Fed
certainly is aware of our desire to have a $1.10 dividend.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: Okay, great. Then just second, with annuities, as you mentioned, you had a positive impact this
quarter from lower lapses on your DAC for variable annuities. I guess my concern is that lower lapses can actually be a
sizeable problem for guaranteed-minimum-income benefit products.
Accordingly, can you discuss what sort of lapse assumptions you are using in your statutory accounting for variable
annuities, and how that compares to the lapse activity that you are currently seeing?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well – this is John. The lapse assumptions are consistent with what we communicated at the
last quarter, in terms of the changes to lapsed functions. We had a slight model refinement in calculating out the impact
on operating earnings. It had no impact below the line. And statutory assumptions are the same as we use for GAAP.
<Q - Nigel Dally>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Hi, thanks a lot. Just a question on the pace of VA sales. I know $3.5 billion is probably a little
bit outsized, considering that you still have the old product for the first month. Could you give us a sense of old product
versus new products mix between that $3.5 billion?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yeah, most of the first quarter sales were old product. Because even if we actually stop
taking new apps, there was a lot of throughput that got processed ultimately through the quarter. So most was old
product.
The old product, by the way, still had an attractive ROI this quarter, because obviously hedging costs have come down.
But now sales for the remainder of the nine months should be all GMIB Max V, the new product.
And in terms of our ability to hit our run rate, we're currently tracking at a weekly sales rate that we think we'll still be
able to hit that sales goal comfortably.

rates remain at these levels, especially in products like long-term care?

And then also, how should the impact of low rates compound beyond 2014, if we're sort of in this environment for
more than a year or so?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, Jimmy, it's Bill Wheeler. With regard to long-term care, couple of things to keep in
mind.
We've added to the statutory reserves over a long period of time, which is, of course, where any likely reserve impact
would be. We'd be a long ways away from GAAP adjustments.
And I think we feel that, with regard to what we're doing with regard to long-term care, in terms of price increases as
well as on the in-force, as well as the fact that we've really built up reserves over time prudently, make us feel that the
likelihood of adjustments, even at this level of interest rates, is pretty low.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: And that goes for other products, as well?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yeah, so we have given you some guidance here. Steve gave you some operating-earnings
sensitivities to lower rates.
We still have mean-reversion assumptions on very long-term contracts that do gear up over time, and we are
comfortable with that now, and are comfortable for the foreseeable future.
We still have the Federal Reserve doing extensive bond-buying in the markets. We're not certainly in normal situations.
I think we would have to wait and see for some period of time, how that would resolve. And we would rethink about
our long-term assumptions.
But for now, and for 2013 certainly, and going into 2014, we're comfortable with our long-term assumptions, which is
what drives the GAAP and DAC.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: But you would review on like – and you are assuming a slight increase in rates over time,
and if that does not materialize over – for an extended period of low rates, then you'd just look at those on an annual
basis, I guess?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We kind of look at these – we look at these on an annual basis because we have very
long-term contracts. Long-term care is probably the longest of the liabilities, but we have long liabilities. The pension
business. The life insurance is all very long-term liabilities.
And you have to really think carefully about how you set these long-term assumptions, given we're still in the aftermath
of 2008, with a lot of activity by Federal governments looking at and working on interest rates. So we will take it year
by year and think it through carefully.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: And then just on SIFI, have you done any internal studies that would – just to assess what
the – what your balance sheet would like, if it was subjected to like a Basel-type capital standard? Because just if you
do a big-picture analysis, it seems like if the insurance companies were subjected to bank-based standards, they would
be significantly short on capital? Is that a correct assessment?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Jimmy, it's Steve. The [ph] questions of being (40:55) what Basel standards. And
we've heard from officials in Washington – is it going to be Basel I for insurance companies? Will it be some other
form of Basel? Will it not be Basel?
It's really very much up in the air right now. And that's why we continue to make the argument in Washington that
whatever rules come forward for non-bank SIFIs should be tailored to the industry they are regulating, and not really do
a bank or bank-like approach for regulation.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: But under Basel III, the insurance company statements were just – just given the capital
charges on the various investments, it seems like the large insurance companies, if they are subjected to SIFI, they
would be significantly undercapitalized. I don't know if you've done an analysis of that internally?

Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Hi, good morning. I have a question on Japan sales. I think, John, that you mentioned that sales
were down about 13% year over year, but that was driven heavily, I guess, by the bank channel, which was down 60.
I was wondering if maybe either you or Chris could give us maybe a little bit more of a breakdown. I'm unclear on
what percentage of overall Japan sales actually come through the bank channel. And maybe what some of the third
sector and non-single-premium whole-life sales – what kind of growth rates were you seeing there?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Let me have a shot at it, first of all. The bank business overall in Japan makes up
about 15% to 20% of the total A&P for Japan. Of that, the fixed annuity foreign-currency products that John referenced
make up about 50% of the total there. So overall we've seen that bank channel down 60%, so a rather significant
reduction.
And I think in terms of the surrenders you are seeing that John referenced, you'll see those continue for all the way
through the second quarter. And we expect the bank channel to be down about 30% to 35% for the full year.
In terms of the A&H business, we're down 6% for the quarter, which is in line with the market. And we expect to be
flat on A&H overall for the year.
So with all of these moving parts, we would expect sales in Japan probably to be flat year on year, and overall for Asia,
given all the other countries you've got in the region, we expect sales to – the A&P number for the year to be about 5%
up, year on year.
I would just caution you, in terms of the bank sales. A good portion of our earnings in Japan come predominantly from
the A&H business, and second from the life business, which are in reasonably good shape. And the big benefit of what
we got there is a bundling capability on the A&H, where we tend to get about 60% to 65% of the life sales are bundled
with an A&H product, which gives us a good edge in that market overall.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: That's very helpful. Thank you very much. And then I guess just thinking about interest rates a
little bit more, I was wondering if you could give us some sense for how much portfolio overall turnover you're
expecting this year and next.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, I don't know that we historically talk about portfolio turnover a lot, John. But I think
our activities – we make projections on what we expect. I think the first quarter, we probably had a little more portfolio
turnover than normal just given the rate environment and some of the [indiscernible] (44:51)
<A>: [indiscernible] (44:52)
<A - William J. Wheeler>: – interest rates and the like. But overall if we look at historically, if we look at the last
several quarters, I mean our turnover is pretty much in line with what we see for typical industry statistics.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: And then just real quick, any sort of outlook commentary you can provide, with respect to
variable investment income for the remainder of the year? I mean you've got a pretty wide quarterly range, and I always
want to be careful about trying to model all the way at the upper end of the range, which is what you adjust against. But
any commentary there would be helpful.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure. Again, there is a reasonable correlation between equity-market performance and a
good portion of our variable investment income.

So you have to take into consideration what happened in the first quarter. We saw a very strong equity market. So I
think certainly the near-term, meaning the second quarter, we would expect our VII performance to be strong.
And as we look forward for the rest of the year, we're not projecting necessarily the continued same performance in the
market. So we're back probably comfortable with the plan.
And overall, I think that means we feel very comfortable with the VII plan. Right now, we probably think we'll be
closer toward the top of the plan, but obviously anything can happen in the second half of the year.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: And then, Steve, just around that, a lot of private equity firms are – the distributions are quite
elevated, and it appears that it's going to remain that way. Are you reinvesting, such that we ought to expect
private-equity investments in total to remain relatively stable as we look forward?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Yes. Yeah, we do have ongoing commitments to private equity. We like the sector,
and we will continue to, at least, maintain our investment level.

<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Hi, good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?
<A>: We can hear you.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, great. Can you just talk about the strategy on hedging the yen in Japan, and
maybe just give thoughts on an end game?
I mean you obviously kind of layered into the first quarter of 2014. You layered into the second quarter of 2014 at
JPY95. Where do you expect to get to? And what is kind of the longer-term strategy?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: All right. This is John, Mark. Currency is always an interesting thing to think about.
We have decided that we take it quarter by quarter. We meet and decide, do we want to take a position on the yen or
not? We did so far with input from our investment group, and thinking about our business there.
But again, it's a quarter-to-quarter plan for us, in terms of how we think about it. And we've got the protection that
we've told you about.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: I guess would you expect to kind of build hedges that get you through 2014 based on
the current conversations?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We haven't decided.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, and then just I guess a follow-up question on Asia earnings and just thinking
about the higher lapses, maybe going back to kind of, I think, it was Nadel's question.
Should we infer from the commentary that the higher lapses that you've seen and that you are going to continue to see
into this quarter are not material to the overall earnings? Or should we be thinking about an earnings drain, and if so,
how much?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: It's Chris Townsend again. Let me – I guess the way you should think about this
overall is that the surrender fees we are getting or the surrender penalties we are getting at the moment are the net of
DAC and VOBA amortization and the market value adjustment.
So that $29 million you have got in the first quarter is effectively a prepayment of the profit for the life of the contract.
So what you are seeing is economically, we're being made whole for our profit.

If the contractors stayed in place, you'd probably see those earnings spread over the life of the – that's probably – it's
around seven years, the average amount of the contract.
So I think for the first two quarters of the year, what you would expect to see is earnings deficiency of about $2 million
to $3 million per quarter for the life of the seven years of the contracts.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. And then I guess just – would you expect the second quarter to kind of look like
the first quarter, in terms of that $29 million?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: We would. As I said before, we'd expect the same sort of surrender fee income at
the moment.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Thanks so much. Good morning. I guess first question regarding the Provida
transaction.
So one of your competitors did a large Chilean pension deal, pointing to better than expected earnings, partly
attributable to more customers that actually stayed in the plan post the deal announcement than what was expected. So
curious if you can provide any insight around what you're seeing in terms of retention since the deal was announced?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Chris, it's Bill Wheeler. So remember, we won't close until sometime in the third quarter;
that's our expectation. And I would tell you, I think Provida's performance for the first part of this year has been right
on track, and in terms of profitability and ongoing business I haven't seen a fluctuation one way or another. So it's
looking good.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay, and then I guess regarding VA policyholder behavior, there is certainly a lot
of focus around lapse assumptions, but I wanted to ask about sort of annuitization trends. So your GMIB product, I
guess, is really at a point where you're likely starting to see some policyholder behavior trends on annuitization
take-ups. So I want to see if you can comment on those trends sort of relative to maybe your original expectations and
then your current assumptions for reserves?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure. My guess is we'll talk more about this Investor Day, but I'll give you some sense of
what we're doing. A very small portion of our GMIB block is available to be annuitized today. It's, I think, roughly 5%,
maybe even a little less than that, so there is not a lot of data yet on the experience in terms of people deciding to
annuitize. That said, the level of annuitizations right now is very low and even for products that are in the money. So
we're seeing a quite low level of annuitizations, but I think we haven't decided to react to that yet because it's very early
days and not many people have had the opportunity to annuitize yet.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay, thanks. Look forward to the Investor Day. Thanks.

<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Yeah, what we're seeing is that people have taken advantage of the significant rise
in the equity markets in Japan and locking in some of the foreign currency gains. So you've seen all of these, so and it's
most of them, it's about 60/40 in terms of Australian dollar versus U.S. dollars in terms of the mix of these fixed
annuities, but it's effectively taking the benefit and putting it into mutual funds and the equity markets.
<Q - Sean Robert Dargan>: Okay, thank you. And then just is there any color on what's driving the sales growth in
Latin America? You call out Mexico and direct marketing, is there anything to note there?

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven D. Schwartz>: Hey, good morning, everybody. I want to follow-up on, I think, it was Chris's question.
Bill, while you haven't seen a whole lot annuitization yet, have you seen any changes in the usage of dollar-for-dollar
withdrawals on the GMIB?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: No. But when we design the product, we assume that there would be a certain level of
dollar-for-dollar usage and there is and it has not changed. Remember though, that now in the new products, the new
GMIB, the dollar-for-dollar benefit, though it still exists, is much less attractive.
<Q - Steven D. Schwartz>: Okay. And then, Steve, if I could follow-up, in your discussion about the dividend, were
you saying that you had basically run through the current dividend through the CCAR test that the Fed found you
deficient on?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: No, that's not what I was saying.
<Q - Steven D. Schwartz>: Okay.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: I was asked the question earlier, if we informed the Fed or ran by the Fed, our
decision to raise the dividend to $1.10 before announcing that. What I said was, because we're no longer regulated by
the Fed, it would be inappropriate for us to go to them seeking approval or something of that nature. But I noted that
when we went through the stress test, that was our – part of our submission was having $1.10 dividend, so they are
certainly aware of our desire to raise the dividend to $1.10 for the common shareholder.
<Q - Steven D. Schwartz>: Okay, got it. And then one more, if I may. There was a – I think there was a reference to a
yen loss or currency exchange loss and I think it was the yen, with regards to net investment income. Is this akin to
what Prudential has reflected over the last couple of quarters with liabilities being treated differently from the asset?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: No, we don't have issue that Prudential does. We have a multicurrency reporting and that we
avoid that volatility that Prudential has.

have much greater clarity. It is our goal, as I mentioned earlier, to provide a good yield on our stock through an
appropriate dividend and also to have share buybacks as part of our capital management process going forward, but we
have to see how things sort out here in the current year around regulation coming out of Washington.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay, and then switching gears, for John. Just so I understand that that normalized run rate of
operating earnings in the first quarter, if you normalize for the items you outline, we get to a range of around $1.30 for
the first quarter. Am I thinking about that the right way?

annuities?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, you mean when we price, is that what you're referring to?

<A - William J. Wheeler>: Right around 100%. Or excuse me, not the implied volatility, the implied volatility is – the
hedging costs in total we're assuming were about 100% when we priced. Right now, of course they're running at about
115% I think, or that's where they were for the first quarter.

when I listened to the last quarter's call, it seemed like Steve was very cautious on any capital deployment before there
was additional clarity from regulators. So what exactly changed since that call and into the point that the dividend was
increased by 50%?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Yeah, I know that some people wanted me to make some statement as soon as we
sold the bank, but we were not at the point where we were going to declare the dividend for the second quarter yet and
we have a process, of course, under normal corporate governance, to go to our Board and get approval for any sort of
capital action of that nature. So timing just wasn't right for us to make any declarations at that point in time.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: Yes, I just – most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to go
back just to the capital management topic one last time. Understanding that there is no expectation for share repurchase
in 2014, you've already taken action on the dividend. You have the $2 billion Provida deal to close. Where do you
stand in terms of capital deployment with respect to additional acquisitions, because it seems that there has been some

increased activity in that market right now. So could we look for potentially another deal this year? I mean, we don't
want to build it into our expectations, but would that be a possibility?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: So I just want to make one correction. I think you said 2014, maybe you meant
2013?
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: 2013, precisely.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Yeah, okay, so just clarified that. So no expectations of share buybacks in 2013,
although as I mentioned, the Provida deal, $2 billion approximately will be the cash transaction, so we'll be using
capital in that sense. I think that as a practical matter, regulators look at acquisitions differently than share buybacks.
Acquisitions should be generating earnings and have assets involved and so on. So we certainly will be looking at
transactions over the course of this year, as we always do. There's nothing we can talk about at this point in time about
a deal on the horizon, but we certainly look at most anything that comes in the market that could make sense from us
strategically and at that point in time we'll make a decision about how we finance it, if there were to be another deal
going forward.
<Q - Joanne Arnold Smith>: All right, great. I'm all for the gift that keeps on giving. Thanks very much.
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: You're welcome.
