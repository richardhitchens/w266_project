MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Good day, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter
and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide
presentation, plus the analyst and media question-and-answer sessions, are being broadcast live over the Internet.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of
Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.
Troy Jeffrey Lahr
Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. I'm Troy Lahr, and with me
today are Jim McNerney, Boeing's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing's Chief Financial
Officer.
After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please
limit yourself to one question. As always, we've provided detailed financial information in today's press release, and
you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.

Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely
to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release, in our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statements
disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for
disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning. Let me begin today with some comments on our strong operating performance
and strategic progress in 2013 followed by an overview of the business environment we see moving into 2014. After
that Greg will walk you through the details of our financial results and outlook.
Now let's move to slide 2. Strong fourth quarter results across our company capped a year of outstanding core operating
performance and significant business achievement for our team. We successfully delivered on our strategies to convert
our record backlog into profitable growth, executed well on commercial and defense development programs and drove
productivity and affordability gains throughout our business and enterprise functions.
For the full year, we reported record revenue and earnings, improved operating margins, increased cash flow, a large
portion of which was returned to shareholders, and we reached our highest product backlog ever, now totaling $441
billion on net orders of $135 billion. We also continued to retire legacy business risks, including settling the
longstanding A-12 litigation with the U.S. government that dated back to 1991.
Our Commercial Airplanes business reported record revenue of $53 billion for the year on an industry-record 648 total
deliveries, including the highest-ever deliveries for the 737, 777 and 787 programs. We successfully executed our
planned production rate increases and expanded our market share leadership and deliveries that we regained in 2012.
In a strong year for orders across the industry, we captured record gross orders of 1,531 airplanes and net orders of
1,355 airplanes, which increased our backlog to 5,080 jets worth a record $374 billion.
Commercial Airplanes also achieved key development milestones in 2013, including firm configuration of the 737
MAX-8 and the start of flight testing of the 787-9. And we solidified our long-term market leadership in the high-value
twin-aisle segment with record orders and commitments in launching both the 787-10 and 777X.
On the other side of our business, despite continued domestic budget headwinds and tough global competition, Boeing
Defense, Space & Security also had a very strong year with revenue of $33 billion on increased deliveries of aircraft
and satellites, higher operating margins, significant program wins, and clear progress in further improving productivity
and increasing our competitive position.
Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included a $750 million order from the U.S. Air Force for
engineering services on the B-1 Bomber fleet, a multi-year service support contract for the B-22, and an option exercise
by Inmarsat for a fourth satellite. Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included fuselage and wing join on the
first KC-46 tanker, the P-8A achieving initial operating capability within 10 days by the way of a target established
more than 10 years ago, and successfully launching the first Inmarsat-5 satellite.
Strong operational performance throughout the year driven by our relentless focus on business execution and
competitiveness, increasing cash flow, and our confidence in the future all supported the new $10 billion share
repurchase authorization and 50% increase in the dividend we announced in December.
In summary, 2013 was truly a milestone year for Boeing, thanks to the tremendous effort of our employees, our
partners, and our customers all around the world. With record revenue and earnings, substantial cash generation, and
progress on our path to continued growth and profitability through production rate increases, execution on development
programs, increased productivity, and further growth in our record backlog, we strengthened our market position and
our outlook for the future.

With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 3. Global customer demand for our fuel-efficient and
value-creating Commercial Airplane family remains high, as evidenced by the 508 net orders booked during the fourth
quarter and 30 added so far this month.
Global passenger traffic trends are strong. Air cargo traffic is gradually improving and appears more stable than we
have seen over the past year. Recent 747-8 Freighter orders from Cathay Pacific Airways and Silk Way Airlines
highlight the airplane's superior value proposition and potential as market conditions improve in the cargo area.
Replacement of older airplanes in favor of new models that offer compelling operating economics and increased fuel
efficiency continues at a healthy pace. Many airline customers around the world also are expanding their fleets to
support the ongoing growth in passenger traffic. Deferral requests from customers are still running well below the
historical average, while requests to accelerate deliveries continue at a steady and quite frankly encouraging rate.
Overall, Commercial Aviation remains a very attractive near and long-term growth market, and our product strategy
advantage continues to position us for significant and sustained growth. The launch of the 777X at the Dubai Air Show
was the largest launch by dollar value in commercial jetliner history, with commitments in firm orders totaling 259 for
this game changing fuel-efficient family of airplanes. The airplane's all new composite wing, flight deck and flight
controls leverage technologies developed on the 787 and provide customers with unprecedented operating economics.
We are pleased that our employees who are members of the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace
Workers 751 voted to extend their contract from 2016 through 2024. This solidifies production for the 777X in the
Puget Sound region within our broadened geographic production and engineering footprint.
In an environment, where customer expectations for quality, reliability, and affordability have never been higher,
contract extension ensures 10 years of business continuity and further improves our productivity and competitiveness,
while still also providing our work force highly competitive wages and benefits.
With a firm backlog for our current 777 family of more than 300 airplanes, coupled with strong customer demand and
airplane availability this decade we have high confidence in a successful transition to the 777X.
777 is an outstanding performer and a valuable asset. Based on buying patterns among wide-body customers, we expect
the production bridge to be filled over the next few years. The 787 production system is now operating at the 10 per
month rate in final assembly, including both the Dash-8 and Dash-9, which entered production last year.
Flight testing of the Dash-9 is progressing well with first delivery on track for mid-year. The in-service 787 fleet which
now totals 115 airplanes making more than 200 flights per day, continues to set new records for fuel efficiency and
passenger satisfaction. While there is still more customer-by-customer variation than we would like, we have made
good progress improving dispatch reliability, which is now up around 98% on average. More work to do on that one,
but we are moving closer to the goal line.
In the single-aisle segment, airline interest in our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains high, with nearly 1,800
cumulative orders to-date. Robust customer demand for the 737 family led us to the planned rate increase to 42 per
month in 2014, and the announcement of an additional production rate increase to 47 a month in 2017. Recently, Air
Canada recognized the value of the 737 MAX by committing to 61 airplanes and becoming a new Boeing narrow-body
customer.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security we are pleased that a fiscal year 2014 budget agreement has been signed and
fiscal year 2015 deliberations have progressed providing some near-term sequestration relief for the Department of
Defense and our other U.S. government customers. This averts another disruptive government shutdown and provides
our customers at least a near-term planning horizon. That said, we remain very concerned about longer-term budget
uncertainty, the ultimate consequences of sequestration on national security and the potential devastating impact to the
nation's industrial base.
Fiscal year 2014 budget strongly funds core Boeing production programs like P-8, F/A-18, rotorcraft and satellites as
well as key development programs like the KC-46, Long-Range Strike and the Space Launch System. It also provides
advanced procurement funds in support of continued production of the F/A-18 line into 2015. Support for critical

Boeing national security programs continues to be driven by strong on-cost, on-schedule performance that customers
expect to meet their needs in a more for less world.
Our Defense, Space & Security portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable systems and services remains a competitive
advantage in today's budget environment. We also continue to target organic growth through investments in technology
and innovation in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance, cyber security, and the few but critical future large-scale programs identified as priorities by our
customers, like Long-Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer.
Combined with our market-based affordability initiative, these investments strengthen our long-term position and
differentiate us from our competitors, many of whom have scaled back R&D in these more austere times. And we
continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global advantage in our efforts to mitigate domestic market pressures.
International Defense, Space & Security business represented more than 30% of BDS revenues during the quarter and
remains just under 40% of the BDS backlog.
We also continue to strengthen our competitive position in all markets by driving further efficiency, quality and
productivity through our own offices and factories, and through our Partnering for Success initiative launched last year.
We are seeing tangible benefits of our Partnering for Success work with suppliers recognizing the growth opportunity
that's available to those who fully embrace its objectives. These productivity efforts along with an enterprise-wide
focus on reducing the spiraling cost of development programs remain top priorities for improving our program
profitability and enabling investment in future growth.
One final note before I hand it off to Greg, in December, we announced a series of personnel moves to strengthen our
overall leadership structure as we scale up for future growth and competitiveness. We promoted Ray Conner and
Dennis Muilenburg to Boeing Vice Chairmen and named Dennis Boeing President and Chief Operating Officer. We
also appointed Chris Chadwick President and CEO of Defense, Space & Security, replacing Dennis, and named Shelley
Lavender President of Boeing Military Aircraft, replacing Chris.
While assuming some corporate duties as Vice Chairman, Ray's primary focus will remain on delivering the growth
and profitability at Commercial Airplanes. Dennis has joined us in Chicago, where he is working with me in the
day-to-day oversight of the company's business operations with a particular focus on growth enablers, including our
global relationships and development program performance.
All four are highly capable, high-performing leaders with demonstrated track records, who will continue to strengthen
our company and drive business results. And just to be clear, I'm not planning to retire any time soon. So, while you
may be seeing more of them, it doesn't mean you'll be seeing less of me.
Now, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to slide 4, and we'll discuss our full-year results. Revenue for the year was a
record $87 billion, reflecting 6% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries across our commercial and defense
businesses.
Core earnings per share was $7.07 for the full year, representing a 20% increase. The increase in EPS was driven by
strong operational performance across the company. Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $9.7
billion before the $1.5 billion discretionary pension contribution. The robust cash generation was driven by higher
deliveries, solid core operating performance, as well as favorable timing of receipts and expenditures, both of which
will ultimately factor into 2014 expected cash generation.
Moving now to our quarterly results on slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7% to $23.8 billion, driven by again
strong Commercial Airplane and Defense deliveries. Core operating margin in the quarter was 7.7%, excluding the

$406 million non-cash charge associated with the A-12 settlement. Core operating margins increased to 9.4% in the
quarter, primarily driven by favorable mix in commercial deliveries and solid productivity gains at both businesses.
Core earnings per share increased 29% to $1.88 in the quarter on higher volume and continued strong operational
performance. The $0.28 benefit from the recent IRS tax regulation change for research credits partially offset the $0.34
earnings per share impact from the A-12 settlement.
Let's discuss Commercial Airplanes now on slide 6. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplanes business
increased revenue 4% to $14.7 billion on 172 airplane deliveries and increased operating margins to 10.3%. Higher
volume, favorable delivery mix and strong performance was offset by the anticipated increase in fourth quarter R&D
spending and higher 787 dilution.
Commercial Airplanes' revenue for the year was a record $53 billion, an increase of 8% as we successfully executed on
our planned production rate increases resulting in record deliveries totaling 648 aircraft. Commercial Airplanes
captured $43 billion of net orders during the quarter, and increased backlog to a new record of $374 billion in over
5,000 aircraft.
Gross inventory for the company included $33.1 billion related to the 787 program, an increase in the fourth quarter of
approximately $1.7 billion; this increase was primarily driven by the higher planned inventory and to support the
production rate increase to 10 per month and the introduction of the 787-9 program. Included in the work in processed
inventory are deferred production costs, the deferred balance of the 787 program was $21.6 billion at the end of the
fourth quarter.
We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators and unit costs as we further implement
production efficiencies and stabilize the overall production system on the 787 program. Unit cost has improved
approximately 20% over the past year on the 787-8, while we are introducing the Dash-9 into the production system
and at the same time increasing production rates by 40%.
Overall, the team has continued to make good progress in reducing production flow times and reducing part shortages
at both Everett and Charleston facilities. These are key enablers to reducing unit costs and achieving planned
production rates and deliveries.
We're also seeing good initial progress on the 787-9, where we've seen 25% improvement in unit costs from the first
airplane to the fourth airplane to roll-out of the factory. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us on the 787
program, we anticipate continued improvements as production stabilizes at 10 per month rate. We're also remained
focused on improving program performance and successfully completing the flight test program on the 787-9 and the
development of the 787-10.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue on our defense business
increased 6% to $8.9 billion and operating margins were 10.8% driven by higher volume, delivery mix and improved
performance.
As a result of our continued focus on productivity and driving market-based affordability efforts, we've significantly
reduced our cost structure and we're on track for additional reductions that will further enhance our productivity and
strengthen our competitive position going forward.
International customers accounted for 33% of our defense revenue in the fourth quarter, and we continue to drive
towards sustaining 30% of defense revenue from international markets going forward.
Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft increased 9% to $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher
deliveries. Strong operating margins of 10% in the quarter were due to increased volume and solid operating
performance.
Network & Space Systems revenue at $2.3 billion increased 12%, primarily driven by higher sales on ground-based
missile defense and Space Launch Systems. Operating margins were 10.3% in the quarter, resulting from continued
focus on execution and productivity along with favorable delivery mix in the quarter.

Global Services & Support reported fourth quarter revenue at $2.2 billion and solid operating margins of 12.8%.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $67 billion, with 37% of our current backlog representing
customers outside the United States.
Let's now turn to slide 8. Boeing capital net financing portfolio declined to $3.9 billion on normal runoff that exceeded
new aircraft volume. Fourth quarter unallocated expense from core operations of $532 million was primarily driven by
the $406 million charge associated with the A-12 settlement and an increase in deferred compensation expense driven
by higher stock price and overall stock market performance.
Let's now turn to cash on slide 9. Operating cash for the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion and the strength of our cash
flow was driven by higher volumes, strong operating performance and timing of receipts and expenditures.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid approximately $400 million in dividends to shareholders, and repurchased
7.6 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and
repurchased 25.4 million shares for $2.8 billion.
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $15.3 billion of cash and marketable
securities. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us very well going forward. Again, our
financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of our business, return cash to shareholders, and
execute on our balanced cash deployment strategy going forward.
Let's turn now to slide 11 and we'll discuss our outlook for 2014. Our guidance for 2014 reflects solid core operating
performance and higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business, while reflecting impact of the current DOD
defense budget environment.
Core earnings per share guidance for 2014 is set between $7 and $7.20 per share. We expect first quarter revenue, core
EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries and phasing of expenditures and
advances. First quarter core EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full year earnings.
On a GAAP EPS basis, first quarter is expected to be impacted by $140 million non-cash pension curtailment charge
associated with the IAM contract extension; again, this will not impact core EPS. The financial effects of this
agreement include the initial cash payment associated with the approval of the extension and the enhanced employee
benefits as we transition from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan.
The long-term benefits to both employees and the company are clear as the unprecedented 10-year agreement further
de-risks the business and 777X production, providing a stable foundation for productivity improvements and
employment of our highly skilled workforce as we strive to remain competitive.
Revenue for 2014 is forecasted to increase between $87.5 billion and $90.5 billion. Our Commercial Airplane revenue
guidance is expected to be $57.5 billion to $59.5 billion, reflecting approximately 10% growth as we execute on our
record backlog.
2014 commercial delivery forecast is between 715 and 725 airplanes. This includes approximately 110 deliveries from
the 787 program, including 17 new customer introductions and additional flow time to support early introduction of the
787-9.
Commercial Airplane operating margin guidance is approximately 10% on improved operating performance, offset by
greater dilution impact on higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future business growth.
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2014 is between $30 billion and $31 billion, reflecting the continued
challenging defense environment, partially offset by ongoing international growth.
Operating margin guidance at our defense business is forecasted approximately 9.5%, reflecting continued productivity
efforts offset by impact of lower volume and delivery mix. We expect research and development spending for 2014 of
approximately $3.2 billion, primarily driven by 737 MAX, initial 777X and 787-10 development, along with continued
key strategic investments in our defense business.

Turning to cash flow, we expect operating cash flow before pension contributions to be approximately $7 billion,
reflecting higher 737 and 787 deliveries and continued strong operating performance. The cash flow in 2014 also
reflects favorable timing of receipts and expenditures last year. Higher cash tax payments associated with the improved
787 unit cost in 2014 as well as fewer 767 deliveries as we efficiently transition to tanker production, and then finally
includes the payment of the signing bonus to the IAM employees associated with the contract extension.
Our required pension contributions for 2014 will be minimal, while we aggressively look for additional opportunities to
reduce future pension liabilities, we continue to proactively manage the funded status and anticipate a $750 million
discretionary pension contribution in 2014.
Regarding our cash deployment, in December, we announced the next steps in our balanced cash deployment strategy
with a new $10 billion repurchase authorization, adding to the $800 million left in the prior authorization at year-end.
We anticipate completing the repurchase authorization over the next two to three years; and furthermore, we increased
our quarterly dividends 50% at the end of the year. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investments to
support future growth remains a top priority for us.
So overall, strong 2013 results were driven by our continued focus on program execution, production rate increases and
productivity improvements. We expect this performance and focus to continue into 2014.
Now, I'll turn it over to Jim for some final thoughts.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Greg. 2013 was a very successful year for Boeing. We continued to convert our record backlog into
deliveries through strong core operating performance that allows us to return cash to shareholders, while investing
wisely in our products, technologies and people to sustain our growth and competitiveness.
Our priorities going into 2014 remained clear. The profitable ramp-up in production on our Commercial Airplane
programs, executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability
throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and position our defense business with investments in growth areas
amid further international expansion; and importantly, providing increasing value to both our customers and our
shareholders.
Now, we'd be glad to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I may have two parts in this. But, today, when you gave guidance for 2014, revenues,
earnings, cash, they were less than we were expecting and I think others too. Now our assumption was that there's
always some conservatism here. But this appeared to be tied to lower-than-expected delivery rates.
And what I wanted to understand is, on the 787 you're now at 10 a month, but you still have a large number of change
incorp airplanes that should be delivered. So, the 110 guidance seemed low to us. And we're trying to understand how
you expect 787 production and deliveries to evolve over this year and 2015? And then also how we should be looking
at the ramp to 42 a month on the 737? And what that means for production and deliveries, so that we have a good sense
of where you're at in terms of these delivery rates? And also, just do you expect – with these numbers, the delivery

rates you're looking at, are those consistent with what you were hoping for, say, a few months ago?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay. They were, Doug. Let me just start there. And then let me give you some color on 87
and 47. On the 87, I think the one thing to keep in mind is although we are executing at 10 a month, we're not
delivering at 10 a month yet. So, you got some transition there of going from 7 a month on a delivery basis to 10 a
month, but you got to factor that.
And there is a handful of change incorp airplanes that are in our guidance going forward for this year; and frankly, less
than last year, so you're taking that into account. And then some final deliveries at the end of the year, as we've worked
with customers on their ability to take a certain amount of airplanes within certain timeframe. So, this is all within our
expectations. Team is executing very well as you saw from last year's deliveries, very focused on meeting these
objectives in 2014.
As you look to 2015, if you just kind of calculate on production rates, you'll certainly get closer to delivery
expectations. But certainly right now, we're focused on meeting our objectives for 2014 and getting these airplanes into
the hands of our customer.
On the 737, we're making great progress. 38 a month and stabilized at 38 a month. You look at the operating metrics
around us, operating at 38 a month. We have record low shortages. They're improving flow time on final line and
making good progress as we look at production readiness getting to 42 a month and obviously that will come into play
a little bit later this year. So, you won't get the full benefit of the 42 through the balance of the year. But again, that
team has executed flawlessly and making rate breaks, keeping the production system stable at the same time looking
for opportunities to improve. So, that's kind of how we see at least 87 and 37 deliveries going into this year.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And can you say when that transition is on the 37? When you're expecting to be at 42?
And what the implications are for deliveries this year?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, we'll break 42 here in around second quarter on the production basis. And
then the deliveries will start to flow out from there. And I think you saw on the 87, we just pushed our first airplane out
at 10 a month earlier this week.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes, okay.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: We're making good progress.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So, I'd like to follow-on to Doug's question, but specifically with respect to the cash flow
guide given that Boeing is very much a cash flow story today. And again, understanding the guide may be somewhat
conservative, but the market's actually I think reacting to the other option, which is that it's just disappointingly low. So,
beyond the delivery discussion we just had, Greg, can you simplify this to frame 2014 cash flow in a longer-term
context, understanding there was some acceleration into 2013, but that's just simply going to make some investors
wonder if 2013 was peak? And if it's not, can you help us figure out where peak is, when and how we get there, and

perhaps within that, could you speak specifically to 787 cash flow profile over the next few years?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll give you some additional color kind of going from 2013 to 2014,
because that is important as you think about timing, because we certainly had some very favorable timing late in the
year that was really more expected to be in 2014. So, you've got to step back and look at the guide, recognize where we
are in the year and then at the same time look at 2013 performance, and as you saw from the guidance we issued, we far
exceeded that. So, timing is a big aspect of this from 2013 to 2014, as well as cash taxes. So, as we continue to make
improvements on 787 unit cost, obviously we'll pay more in cash taxes and that will continue going forward.
Now that will also, long term, be more than offset by us continuing to execute on the rate increases we've talked about
and continued focus on 787 unit-by-unit profitability and that's ultimately going to continue to drive the cash flow
profile over the long term.
Another moving piece as I mentioned in my remarks from 2013 to 2014 is 767 deliveries, which again planned out
lower production rate as we successfully transition from commercial on to tanker transition. So again, well planned out,
we know what we need to do there and then from there it really – lower volume at BDS, but those are really the big
moving pieces from 2013 to 2014.
Now to answer your question kind of more long term, and I partially addressed this earlier, but the fact is, again, when
you step back and think about our production rates and what we need to do to execute on those rates, and again, 787
unit-by-unit profitability, that's what's going to drive the cash flow profile throughout – again, kind of over the long
term, so we feel very comfortable with that. And I think as you saw by our cash deployment announcements on the
repurchase and the dividend, we have the confidence in our ability to do that and return a good portion of that cash
back to shareholders.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So, Greg, that presents a fairly sizable bridge from 2014 to 2015 and beyond, but you feel
comfortable that peak is somewhere in that future, we shouldn't be looking back at 2013?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No, I would tell you – certainly, think about where we are in deferred, and I would kind of
put the peak more out in the 2016 going forward timeframe. And again that's – the production rate increases over that
time as we've talked about on 87 in particular, and then the unit cost progression and improvement on 87.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: On the margin side, within BCA, if you net out R&D and net out dilution from 87 and 47,
looks like you had a pretty good quarter sequentially, usually you have a step down from Q3 to Q4 and period costs I
guess at year-end, and that didn't happen this quarter, Greg. So, as we think about the margin profile, maybe you can
talk a bit about what happened in Q4. Why you didn't have that step down? And why we shouldn't think that your
margin could be quite a bit above what you're guiding for 2014?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I think, Joe, certainly the performance on the core programs was the biggest driver in
fourth quarter, particularly 37 and 777. So, they executed very well. To your point, very tight controls over the period

expense, R&D and other elements that support [ph] the bid (38:38). So just good solid execution from the team on
there.
As you look forward into 2014, certainly we have the dilution of the 787 as being one of the bigger contributors. At the
same time, slightly higher R&D as we peak out on MAX, but really start to get ramping up on Dash-10 and 777X. And
then again, slightly more forecasted on period expense, as we double our production on 87, get more customers in our
fleet and how we're supporting those customers initially as they take deliveries.
So, those are kind of the moving pieces. Team is very focused on driving productivity. We're continuing to make
investments on streamlining. I talked about the production flow on the 87 and the 37, but we're continuing to look for
further opportunities there and making more investments frankly over this period in things like automation and
productivity tools than we have in the past. So, team is very focused on executing and meeting these objectives.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Seems like Partnering for Success probably is playing a pretty big role in the margin
improvement. And I was wondering if you could maybe confirm that and talk about what inning you think you're in of
the process?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. I think we're pretty much in the same timeframe we talked before. We're at the
beginning. We're at the early stages of this. We've certainly – you and I've talked about 37 margin and 777 margins and
particularly 37 through the transition of the NG and the MAX and that certainly has helped. But it's early on. We've got
people obviously that have signed up and we have great partnerships in place to execute that going forward. But we got
a lot of opportunity and a lot of work to do from here. And I think, again, we have good plans in place and we're really
engaging with the suppliers and really trying to figure out how do we collectively work together to drive additional
productivity and profitability. And again, I think we've got some good plans in place to go execute that. It's going to
take time.

And next, we'll go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just to expand a little bit on that, Greg, on the 777 program margin, given what's going on
there with the transition.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Jim, you said that you expected to sell that bridge out over the next couple of years, but
obviously there are price considerations associated with that, non-recurring costs associated with that. And then on the
other side, Partnering for Success and productivity, you guys had a – it seems to be the right assumptions for the 737
transition. And in your comment, in your response to Joe's question, do you imply that you're appropriately protecting
for those items and you think that the 777 margin can be maintained and expanded, or is there some risk there due to
the items I mentioned?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think the big picture here is that there are fewer stronger customer franchises out
there than the 777 franchise. And there are customers who have invested heavily in this airplane, who are beginning to
order the new airplane out in the future. And the reason is, it represents incredible productivity versus almost any
alternative. Whereas we were building a bridge on the 37 in competition with an airplane that was somewhat

comparable, depending upon who's making the argument. With the 777, we're building a bridge with a franchise that is
pretty singular in its strength.
So, we do anticipate an ability with these customers who are driving the productivity associated with it and the
performance associated with it. We anticipate being able to build that bridge over the next number of years, as we
approach 2020 and beyond with the new airplane. And it's all about what the alternative would be as they're trying to
build lift in the meantime. So, we're working with them on combined orders for the current 777 as well as the new one.
And we anticipate at least the same kind of result that we had with the 37. So, we're working it.
And we don't think the economics – our current projections don't suggest that economics are going to change
dramatically. Now, are we building a hedge with Partnering for Success and driving internal productivity? That's the
way we live life around here. Okay?
Now, the Partnering for Success, we'll be hitting, and some would say this is coincidental, but we'll be hitting its
mid-stride right around the time that the bridge is being implemented and that's not by accident.

And we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I want to go, Jim, and talk a little bit about the strategic partnering
that you've done with the union.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Could you elaborate a little bit more on how you've tried to form a partnership with them
when – what we see is a little bit of angst over this contract extension?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Maybe just to put it a little bit more, I mean, you're making a big investment by paying each
member $10,000 today. And so, what do you expect to get tomorrow?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Howard, this is a good question. I mean, I think, again, just starting at 50,000 feet here
for a second, we're exiting a period where every few years we had a dramatic event. And we're entering a period of 10
years of stability. So, that's the big picture.
Now, having said that, the vote was closed, there were emotions on both sides of the equation. But I think eventually
everybody centered on this huge business opportunity we've got with the 777 and we came together.
Now, just as in the past every few years, we had to go through a period of rebuilding relationships. We now have an
opportunity to do it for a 10-year period. And I think Ray and his team are reaching out and I would also say, that the
union out there is also reaching out. I think both sides, I'm seeing signs at both sides, seeing the size of this opportunity,
through the drama, heartfelt as it was, and emotion – there's still some emotion, but I think, we're now focused on the
business opportunity, there's more interaction right now between IAM 751 and the management in Seattle than there
has been in a long time. I think they're beginning to come together.
So, I think there'll be a period where we have to work together and where emotions will still play a role, but I'm
convinced for the 10-year opportunity in front of us like we've got. I think fairly quickly, we're going to come together

and capitalize on that.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, follow-up if I can a little bit.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean, can we see either some change – I mean, obviously you offer a lot of new people an
opportunity to enter the workforce and that will lower the average age over time, and that's constructive development
and also not spending all of the capital to move a plant somewhere else. Could you at least provide us with a little bit of
indication of how that's helped competitiveness of The Boeing Company?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I mean, I think with the agreement that we were able to come to with the union
that became the best opportunity for the company. You're right. It's capital avoidance versus moving the work. It is
using some of the best – very best aerospace workers in the world that don't have to go down a learning curve to get
things done, a very committed set of folks around the Boeing brand and around our customers. So, this was the right
answer for both economic, risk and leadership reasons.
Now having said that, if we didn't come to that answer, we were prepared to move the work, notwithstanding some of
the risk I mentioned, but given the agreement, I think this is the right answer for the company and will benefit us going
forward, both with our customers and economically.

And next, we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: To get back to one of the early questions. Cash flow guide for 2014 is considerably below I
think where most people were. So, could you give us some more granularity in terms of some of the key issues, for
example, 787 deferred, how much are they likely to be up? Your 787 tooling was up more than I guessed in the fourth
quarter, how much is that up? Do you have to pay the $400 million on the A-12? You mentioned the IAM, how big is
the cash bonus? And then some color if you could on progress payments and excess advances. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Okay. Cai, I'll take a shot at that. I don't think I captured all of it, but I'm sure you'll catch
me if I don't. Deferred, there's no change in deferred, and then, that kind of profile as we've said kind of reaching the
$25 billion by late 2014. So, that has not changed in from what we talked prior. And with the 2013 to 2014, the biggest
driver certainly being timing and as I said, we had some real favorable timing in the fourth quarter that initially we
expected to be in early 2014.
The cash taxes, I talked about that; but again, when you step back – the cash taxes on the 787 are the result of improved
performance on the 787. So, continuing to kind of come down that learning curve and improving unit-by-unit, we are
going to pay more in cash taxes. And so, there's some headwinds in 2014 that wasn't in 2013. And then as I said,
making a successful transition over on the tanker will have fewer airplanes we'll deliver on the 767 this year from last
year.
So, those are the big moving pieces, and then, everything beyond that is more, you know, rather smaller than those
pieces. So, that's what it is. We understand it. Team is very focused on cash management, as you've seen over the last
couple of years and how we have executed on meeting our objectives, and quite frankly, exceeding them a couple years
in a row. So, it's early, we're going to stay focused on it.

And just one other point you mentioned A-12 that was a non-cash, so there's no impact there. But, again, looking
forward, it's all about us meeting our production rates and coming down on that learning curve on the 787. Those are
the two biggest elements as we look forward in continuing to grow cash flow going forward.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, you'd also mentioned the investment in the 87. Your 787 tooling...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: ...was up in the fourth quarter, is that going to be up and how big was the IAM bonus and
IAM pension?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I don't expect the tooling to be up there. There was a one-off in there related to a
suppliers meeting summit, key performance objective. So, I wouldn't see that growing over time. The IAM agreement
was about $300 million.

Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good morning, Jim and Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey, Greg, can I just circle back quickly on the 787 delivery guidance. You mentioned there
was going to be less of the change incorp aircraft delivered this year.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Is that just, is it driven by the customer timing and acceptance or are you still struggling to
complete some of those early ones? And then, just related to that, if you could also address how things are going in
Charleston in terms of there's been some articles written.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Just reducing the flow times, the parts shortages, Jim mentioned, I think you've made some
progress, but you're talking about adding some people.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Maybe you could just provide a little more color?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, let me maybe start there and then I'll bring you back to deliveries. But certainly, when
you look at flow time, you look at unit cost at Charleston whether it's final, mid or at, it made great progress there.
And the team has been very focused on continuing that progress going forward. We have experienced a higher number
of jobs behind schedule in the mid-body section and that's really due to, if you think about it, you're introducing the
Dash-9 at the same time going to 10 a month.
And just a reminder, most significant structural change in the airplane going from a Dash-8 to a Dash-9 is in the
mid-body. So, to address this, we've applied additional resources, we know how to do this and we'll get those jobs back
to what we view as a more acceptable level. So, we got mitigation plans. They are building net 10 a month. And as
you've seen, we just finished that first airplane at 10 a month. So, we know what to do here. We got the right people

addressing it.
And this is again, this is just all part of bringing this program up to a wide-body rate that obviously has never been done
and they're doing it successfully. But there is going to be points in the production system where you're going to have to
put additional resources from time-to-time and this just happens to be one of them; but stepping back from there, that
team is doing a great job, as is obviously the team in Everett.
On the 87 deliveries for the year, yeah, there's fewer EMC, some of that's customer, some of that is that the airplanes
that are in flow this year are longer flow. So, they have more outstanding work to be completed and some of them had
in 2013, so you kind of got to take that into consideration.
And then at the same time as I mentioned, you've got additional flow in there for Dash-9 again progressing well, but as
we got to introduce that into the production system and get the flow time being equal on the Dash-8 to the Dash-9,
there is some transitional period there. And then of course on top of that, we're introducing 17 new customers in 2014,
so there's some consideration for that through the 2014 delivery. So, those are kind of the big moving pieces within 87
deliveries.

And we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, good morning, guys.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Ron.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: I just want to circle back on. This kind of came up in a couple of previous questions, but
maybe from a different point of view. When we think about – maybe a little bit of a longer term picture and we've got
the transition between the 737NG to the 737 MAX. We've got the R&D program ahead of us on the 777X. How should
we think about that and the potential impact on margins? I mean, do you expect a smooth transition, I guess, first part
of the question between the NG and MAX? That would be interesting. And then two, it seems like despite the scope of
the project, even though, it's a derivative, but a new big wing on a big airplane, that that's – I don't know, $8 billion,
plus or minus, a couple of billion-sized program, right? So, how should we think about those as headwinds in the
future?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, Ron, I'll take a swing at that one. I mean, my view is that the next 10 years are
significantly de-risked when compared with the previous 10. Okay? And why do I say that? You mentioned derivative
elements in the two big programs that lie in front of us, I would add the Dash-10 to that, 787-10, technologies harvested
largely from the 787 that have now matured. Lord knows we lived through the maturational process, not as elegantly as
we would have liked. But, we're now in a position that we can move those technologies into our new platforms.
And so, it is a huge opportunity because the economics of a new 777, the Dash-10 and the MAX are very strong.
Customer acceptance as you've seen is very strong. And the risk that we will absorb in developing them, as well as
introducing them into production are – I would characterize is significantly less than we've had over the last 10 years.
And now that doesn't mean that these are free throws, okay? But just more specifically on the 37, I mean, it's basically
the same line, there are some changes to the structure obviously, and certainly the engine build-up and the engine itself
is different. The front strut 777 will also use the same line, you're right. The developing the wing is something that lies
in front of us, but it's our fourth-generation airfoil with the composite matrix we're going to use on that wing. So, we've
got some experience with it. It's bigger. But scaling up is something, is one kind of challenge, a completely new

material for any kind of an airfoil is a totally different kind of challenge, challenge that we absorbed in the last decade.
And the Dash-10, the third derivative-type program is really a stretch of the Dash-9 with some modifications that
actually give us an opportunity to make the Dash-8, Dash-9, and Dash-10 more common. We're going to use the –
which will reduce the production risk to the program overall. So, whether at a 50,000-foot level or a

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I think you'll see a higher number this year, Sam. We're obviously – as I said, we're
committed to executing on that balance deployment, the $10 billion of authorization in the dividend. So, as I think I
said before, plus or minus 80%, it's going to vary from year-to-year, but I expect us to be north of that in 2014, so we're
committed to doing that
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And then just on the R&D, can you break up a little bit the $3.2 billion this year, how much
of that is commercial versus defense? Because it just looks like you're going to see the growth in the commercial. I'm
trying to think, should we assume that that's going to continue to grow...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: ...until the MAX entry into service?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, defense is kind of flat. It's about $1.2 billion, so you are seeing a slight increase there
in 2014. And again, that's the Dash-9 coming down, 37 MAX picking up in investment and that'll peak in 2015. And
then again, early introduction on the 777X and the 10X, so those are kind of the big moving pieces in 2014.
As you look to kind of 2015 and out, and certainly, we're early in having that discussion, but we're going through
program-by-program and doing what Jim said, where are we leveraging our prior investments in technology, where are
we applying replication, and really where are we leveraging in kind of key technologies that we have on other
programs, real obviously keen focus on affordability and disciplined operating rhythm around our R&D expenditures.
And I think, frankly, you saw some results of that in 2013. So, we're continuing to kind of work through the next three
to five years on that profile; but again, real focus on affordability there.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now return
you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate
Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Thank you. We are running a little tight here, but we do have time for some questions from
the media for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at
312-544-2002.
Operator, we're ready for the first question and in the interest of time we ask that you limit everyone to just one
question please.
Operator
And we'll go to Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Just looking back at the IAM contract debate. Boeing really talked about how airplanes were
being sold for a lower – sorry, a much higher relative discount than in the past. As you look at Airbus' next move,
potentially putting new engines on the A330, and you look at that as a lower cost option for delivering the kind of
efficiencies that airlines are clamoring for. As you look at from a strategic perspective, is there any regret from your
perspective, about not continuing to invest in the 767 as a lower cost offering to airlines with large existing 767 fleets?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Absolutely no regret. I think if you look at the operating performance of virtually any of
the 87 family compared with whatever they may do with the A330, and it's pure speculation Jon as far as I know, I
know nothing, the operating advantage that we have is very, very compelling. Now, could they build an airplane and
lower the price to a point where it breaks even on some NPV analysis? Maybe, but paying for the development you
allude to and still having it all work would be tough in that kind of environment. So no, we're highly confident that
we've got an answer for anything they might do with the A330.
And the 767 as you know, is alive and well, selling Freighters to great customers like Federal Express, and will become
the basis of a 40-year plus – as some people say, I don't know how long it will be, but some people say that the tanker
program could last 40 years, that's a pretty good deployment of that capability in my mind.

Next, we'll go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Dominic.

<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: ...which as you know they had to give up their defined benefit pensions?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Many shop floor workers and others in Washington State are pointing to your personal defined
benefit pension, which will pay out more than $3.6 million a year, and asking, where is the shared sacrifice from you
and other top executives? What would you tell them?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, listen, I think the IAM deal, first of all, was a necessary deal that makes this
company very competitive. Okay? Now, in addition, we do have a very, very large – even after that deal and some
other deals that we've cut, we still have a very large pension obligation that we need to address over the next few years.
And we will address it. And we're not prepared to have a discussion about that today, but the principal of dealing with
that in a fair and equitable way is something that we're mindful of, but stay tuned.

Our next question is from Al Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, Al.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Okay. Great. I wanted to ask, last summer, you were saying in terms of the budget, U.S. budget
cuts and sequestration, that we're not out of the woods. We're going into the woods. I wonder if you could talk
descriptively about how that picture has changed now that we're seeing more clarity on the 2014 horizon. And also, just
on the commercial side in terms of your sense of the readiness of the suppliers to support your ramps in production?
<A - W. James McNerney>: On the commercial side?
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Yeah.
<A - W. James McNerney>: The second part? Yeah. As to sequestration, I think what really happened with the deal,
the Ryan-Murray deal was sort of – one way to think about it simply is that it delayed the full impact of sequestration
by 18 months to 24 months, by about a half. Okay? So, sequestration still lurks out there, it could be dealt with
legislatively again. There is time to have a rational debate about that. And in the meantime, there is relief for 18 months
to 24 months, so that's the quick way to think about that.
In terms of readiness – and Boeing by the way, as I think both Greg and I said in our remarks, did very well with that
incremental funding in terms of program allocation.
Supplier readiness, look, it's an incredible part of the work we do to be prepared for these rate breaks, it's going well.
We've gone through a series of rate uppers over the last two or three years, we're actually entering a period now over
the next two or three years where there's a more – the rate changes aren't as dramatic. And therefore, there'll be
somewhat less pressure on suppliers, but we're feeling very confident in their ability to deliver the program that we'll
describe to you out in the next few years.

And next, we'll go to Andrew Parker with Financial Times. Please go ahead.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. Yes, Andrew.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Jim, I wonder if I could ask you a sort of broad macroeconomic question, please. You all have
seen for some time now, China, India, Indonesia, several emerging market economies, reporting economic slowdown.
And now, we're seeing significant currency volatility of a currency, like the Indonesian currency, against the dollar. Are
you at all concerned that this is going to have a negative impact on your commercial aircraft order backlog? In other
words, are you alert and concerned about the risk that some airlines, as a result of lower growth currency volatility,
could actually cancel orders, deferred deliveries, et cetera? How do you look at it?
<A - W. James McNerney>: We haven't seen that yet, and we have had no sort of leading indicator discussions with
people either. So, I think from time-to-time, we do have these currency flurries. China, as they go through their
leadership transition, there's some uncertainty and a point or two of slowdown in the overall economy as they try to get
their feet underneath them with the new leadership. I don't think the China story has changed personally. I see the
currency as a country-by-country. I think the big picture, and so I don't see an epidemic at this stage.
And the other thing to be mindful of is that half of the planes we sell are a very, very big value proposition to these
airlines. The planes they're replacing are dramatically inefficient versus the ones that we have, whether it's the new 777
or 787. So, a 10% move in currency, even a 20% move in currency, isn't going to get in the way of providing 30%,
40% improvements in overall economics that these planes have. So, we're a little bit insulated in that way too.

Our next question is from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Hey, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Obviously, you had a blockbuster year for orders last year. Just wondering, if you can give us a
little bit of color for what you expect for 2014 and also what your thinking is for book-to-bill? Do you see orders
exceeding deliveries?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think, this year will be – as we look at it, it feels like at least a book-to-bill of
1-to-1 coming up this year.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: All right. That's it.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have time this morning for one last question, please.
Operator
And that will be from Josh Freed with The Associated Press. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua Freed>: Hi, there.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi.
<Q - Joshua Freed>: You mentioned the customer-by-customer variation in the reliability for the 787. So, I was just
wondering if you could say more about that, I mean, why would there be differences for one customer to the next? And
what kinds of reliability – what are maybe sort of the top one or two reliabilities you're just still dealing with on that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, each customer has different ways of using and operating the airplane. There is also
some randomness about it. But 98% is – which is the average is a pretty good number. I think about 45% of the fleet is

operating above the 98.5%, which is getting closer to our 99% plus objective. So, there's just sort of standard
randomness, but also some operating things, the operating differences across the airlines. But there's still some software
debugging that's going on. There's some electromechanical systems that have to be replaced a little more often than we
want them to be replaced, but all those trends are coming down. And so, we remain confident that this year we're going
to reach our goal of getting over 99% reliability.
