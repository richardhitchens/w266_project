MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's second quarter 2013 earnings release conference call. This
call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Public
Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Katherine, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter results. With me
this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, and
both Lambert and Charlie will have prepared remarks. Also joining for the Q&A portion are Francis Cuss, our Chief
Scientific Officer, who formally took over on July 1; Béatrice Cazala, who is Executive Vice President of Commercial
Operations. And joining us from Rome is Giovanni Caforio. Giovanni has been kind enough to join us from our Rome
office this, as he's dealing with some family health issues over there.
So before we get started, let me cover off the legal requirements. During this call we'll make statements about the
company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from those
indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the

Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone.
We have just completed another very important quarter for the company. We made good progress in R&D, including
the presentation of key data and advances on the regulatory front. We demonstrated real strength in the performance of
our key products, namely Yervoy, Sprycel, Orencia, and with our virology franchise. And with respect to Eliquis and
our diabetes franchise, in some areas we did well; but in some we did not get the results we wanted and we need
improvement. All necessary actions are in place to help us realize the sales and market share that our products can
achieve.
Let me elaborate on this point. Clinically, the big news last quarter was the ASCO [American Society of Clinical
Oncology] meeting, at which we presented very exciting data that demonstrated that our immuno-oncology [I-O]
portfolio has the very real potential to significantly change the treatment paradigm for patients with a range of cancers.
Granted, we still have a lot of work to do, but the promise of our immuno-oncology work is evident and presents us
with important opportunities that we are committed to invest behind.
Yervoy is performing well in all markets and we continue to develop its new indications. We have seven potential
registrational trials underway on nivolumab [nivo] in three separate cancer types: renal, lung, and melanoma, and we're
considering additional tumors. And we have other products at an earlier stage of development.
Of significance is the fact that we are developing our immuno-oncology assets in both monotherapy and combination.
At ASCO we presented the results of our Phase 3 trial combining nivolumab and Yervoy in patients with advanced
melanoma, the first such clinical trial to combine two immuno-oncology agents. Simply stated, the results of this Phase
1 trial were striking. We will continue, as I said, to devote significant resources to our exciting immuno-oncology
program.
Regarding Eliquis, we made progress with respect to lifecycle management in the U.S. We filed for DVT prevention,
an indication already approved and launched in Europe and other international markets. We presented the results of the
AMPLIFY study of Eliquis at the ISTH [International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis] Congress. Results, so
far they speak to the strong safety and efficacy profile of Eliquis, in this case for patients in DVT treatment, and we
plan to file later in the year.
Commercially, the global launch is well underway and there have been some positive indicators, especially concerning
our work with cardiologists. But the results are still far from the levels that I believe Eliquis can reach thanks to its
profile that is strong and well differentiated. Together with Pfizer, we have identified various opportunities for
improvement and are intensifying our access efforts and our field, medical, and promotional activities. Additionally,
we'll be initiating our DTC campaign in the U.S. n the third quarter.
Regarding diabetes, as you know, we announced the top line results from our SAVOR study of Onglyza. And while we
will have to wait until September for a fuller analysis, we were pleased that the drug met its primary safety objective.
With respect to Forxiga, we have resubmitted the application with the FDA just this morning, perfect timing. The FDA
notified us that they consider that resubmission completed and gave us a new PDUFA date of January 14, 2014. We
look forward to working closely with the FDA in the coming months to review the filing, and we are preparing for a
likely Advisory Committee.

Diabetes is an important therapeutic area for us. We have a strong portfolio in an increasingly more competitive and
more crowded space. And we and AstraZeneca have made the determination to increase our commercial investments
behind that portfolio.
Turning to the rest of our products, this was the last quarter affected by the loss of Plavix last year. And excluding
Plavix and Avapro/Avalide, we delivered solid double-digit growth last quarter. Again, I was especially pleased with
the performance of some of our key products, mainly Yervoy, Sprycel, and Orencia, products that are important to the
future of Bristol-Myers Squibb. And taken as a whole, I'm increasingly happy about the strength and diversity of our
portfolio. A number of things can and will be improved, but we are moving in the right direction with the right
products.
As you have seen, we have updated our financial guidance for the year, including our outlook for revenue. The
reduction is related largely to two factors, foreign exchange and the recall of Fervex, a local OTC product in France and
other international markets. Charlie will discuss these two factors that affect our top line.
What I want to make clear is that while we continue to look for opportunities to be more efficient across the entire
organization, we are also perfecting key R&D and promotional expenses. As we know, they are important investments
to our future success.
Again, taken as a whole, this was an important quarter for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our focus on balanced execution
remains the right approach, focusing on driving short-term results while laying the foundation for long-term growth.
With that, let me turn the call over to Charlie for a closer look at some of our results. Thank you.
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone.
As you have seen, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and reported double-digit sales gains in our key brands.
Excluding Plavix and Avapro, global sales grew 10%, led by Yervoy, Sprycel, and Orencia. Let me provide some
highlights.
Yervoy sales were $233 million, an increase of 44%. Yervoy continues to post strong sales growth as physicians
embrace Yervoy's durable long-term survival benefit and efficacy in a broad range of patients. In the U.S., we continue
to do well in the hospital setting, and we are seeing strong growth with community-based oncologists. Yervoy also
completed its best quarter in Europe and had a strong quarter in South America and Australia as well. You may recall
that during Q1, there was a $25 million returns reversal in our reported Yervoy sales.
Orencia sales increased 21% to $352 million. We continue to see strong growth in Orencia's share of biologic-naïve
patients as we expand access, reimbursement, and promotion for Orencia sub-Q [subcutaneous]. While sales of the IV
and sub-Q formulations are both growing, sub-Q continues to set the pace, and now represents nearly 30% of all
Orencia sales. By early fall, we plan to land Orencia sub-Q in the seven additional markets in Europe, where new
guidelines announced last month at EULAR [European League Against Rheumatism] recommend Orencia as a
first-line biologic for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Sprycel grew 28% to $312 million. First-line trial and usage Sprycel continues to grow in all markets, especially among
physicians who traditionally select a first-generation TKI [Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor] for patients with CML [Chronic
Myelogenous Leukemia]. We also continue to educate prescribers about the revised NCCN [National Comprehensive
Cancer Network] guidelines, which encouraged switching earlier, at three months, if treatment milestones have not
been met.
Sales of Eliquis were $12 million during the quarter. While the initial launch has been a bit slower than we anticipated,
we and Pfizer are aligned in the continued belief that Eliquis will be the leading new agent in this market over time. As
Lamberto mentioned, there are areas in which we had a good start, particularly in cardiology. But we clearly have

identified areas for improvement to ensure the differentiated profile of Eliquis is recognized by physicians and patients.
In order to help Eliquis gain momentum in the U.S., we will be increasing our medical education activities with
physicians in key territories. We also will be launching a DTC campaign during the third quarter. Outside the U.S., we
plan to launch Eliquis in nine additional countries by year end.
Our diabetes portfolio had sales of $415 million in the quarter. Clearly, the diabetes market has become increasingly
competitive. And we along with our partner AstraZeneca recognize the need to adequately resource this business and
execute better to drive growth, and therefore plan to increase our commercial investment in the second half of the year.
Sales for the Onglyza franchise were up 40%. This includes a favorable impact from a $26 million returns reserve
reversal in the U.S. As you'll recall, there was significant change in formulary status at Caremark late last year. We
believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in franchise performance as our TRx [Total Prescription] share grew
slightly excluding the Caremark impact.
For Bydureon and Byetta, Q2 was the first quarter in which we had full commercial control of the exenatide franchise
on a worldwide basis, having taken over the international markets on April 1. Bydureon had a good quarter, as sales in
the U.S. were up 10% sequentially. With AstraZeneca, we will be increasing our resources behind Bydureon. For
Byetta, we will focus our promotional efforts in combination with long-acting insulin.
We are in the process of launching Forxiga in Europe. And as Lamberto mentioned, the FDA just accepted our
regulatory resubmission in the U.S.
We also posted solid gains in our global HIV and hepatitis B franchises, with sales totaling $1.2 billion in the quarter.
Reyataz global sales were $431 million, a gain of more than 6%, driven in part by the timing of tenders in Brazil.
Sales of Atripla and Sustiva also rose 6% to $411 million. Atripla remains the number one single-tablet regimen.
I also want to address a recall we undertook during the second quarter for three of our mature brands outside the U.S.,
which together had 2012 full-year sales of approximately $100 million. The largest of these brands is Fervex, an OTC
product for cold and flu symptoms. This was a voluntary recall based on quality concerns from a third-party supplier,
and there have been no product complaints or reported adverse health events. In Q2, the estimated pre-tax impact of
this recall was about $54 million, or $0.02 per share. This includes an inventory write-off, sales returns, and estimated
lost sales. We are pursuing several options to get the product back on the market, which we don't expect to occur until
sometime in 2014. With that assumption, we estimate an additional $30 million pre-tax impact during the second half
of 2013.
Now let me highlight two line items from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. As
John mentioned, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website.
First I want to comment on other income and expense, a line item we do not usually discuss. Prior to the restructuring
of our agreement with Sanofi at the beginning of this year, we had reported royalties from certain international markets
in this line. Following the restructuring, any royalties from these markets are reported as revenue. The impact to other
income and expense this quarter is roughly $40 million.
Secondly, our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.8% during the quarter, primarily driven by favorable earnings mix and an
adjustment to our reserve associated with the legal entity restructuring we did late last year.
Finally regarding guidance, we are revising our full-year 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.70 to $1.78. We
are also making the following line item revisions. 2013 sales are expected to be between $16 billion and $16.5 billion.
In addition to the recall that I discussed earlier, foreign exchange is having a significant impact on our sales,
particularly the Japanese yen. At current rates, we estimate that sales will be negatively impacted by approximately
$180 million as compared to our original expectations.
Gross margin is now expected to be approximately 73%, primarily driven by product mix. A&P is now expected to
increase in the mid-single-digit range. While we are increasing resources behind certain growth brands, we have been
more efficient with some of our mature product spend.

And finally, our full-year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 15%.
At this time, we will be happy to answer your questions.
John E. Elicker
So, Katherine, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A portion. And I would just remind people that in addition to
Lamberto and Charlie, we have Beatrice, Francis, and Giovanni here to take any questions that you might have.
Katherine?
Q&A
Operator
Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first caller, Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yes, hi. Good morning. I was curious when we'll see any new data on nivolumab in any tumor
type, and also some commentary on Eliquis and maybe some specifics around what you're doing there to get the
product going other than access related issues. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: [indiscernible] (16:57 – 16:59) Gregg, thank you. This gives me the opportunity of saying
a couple things about – a couple of additional things about nivolumab, and then Francis will continue with a more
specific answer to your question. I want to confirm that we are aggressively investing in this immuno-oncology
portfolio that we have. And nivolumab is clearly an important component of this portfolio that we started to build with
Yervoy.
We believe that based on the data we presented at ASCO, we believe the transformation of potential immuno-oncology,
and we feel good about our leadership in this area. Others are working also in this area. Other companies are also
working also in this area, but we are committed to remain at the forefront through a program that is science driven,
diversified, and have active resources. Now let's go back to PD-1 and Gregg's question on the further disclosure of data.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Gregg. We are very encouraged by the progress of both our Phase 3 and early
trials. We expect to get data from our ongoing Phase 2 study in third-line squamous non-small-cell lung early in 2014.
Depending on the results of that and our discussions with the regulators, that may lead to a submission and obviously
an opportunity to present that at ASCO. In addition, we have combination data from nivolumab and Yervoy ongoing in
renal cell carcinoma and non-small-cell lung. This is a Phase 1b study, and we will be seeing in house that data before
the end of the year. That will help us determine how to go forward with the studies in that combination. Again this will
be presented at ASCO next year. Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Giovanni, I think that this is not unexpected question of the Eliquis actions. It is yours to
answer if you want to. But let me just say before you do that, Giovanni, that I personally, my own management team,
our colleagues at Pfizer are convinced that the clinical profile of Eliquis is unique and differentiated. We are the only
agent with superiority claims versus Warfarin in the three key outcomes of stroke and embolism, major bleeding, and
also mortality, and the other two new agents cannot make the same triple superiority claim. So we have things to do.
We are convinced that the new supportive actions we identified together with Pfizer will deliver results. And we
continue to believe, I personally continue to believe and everybody here continues to believe the Eliquis will be the
leading new agent over time. Giovanni, why don't you go into the specifics of the actions?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, thank you and good morning. I would say following up to what Lamberto just said,
there are really four areas in which we are focusing. I'll touch on those very briefly. We had really good access early in
launch with a large percentage of lives covered in both commercial and Medicare. The focus now for the second part of
the year is actually increasing preferred status coverage in both areas including, as you know, in Medicare. That is very

important. The second point is with the hospital formulary listing and stocking. We had somewhat of a slow start there.
We are now back on track. But clearly in the second part of the year we'll be working very actively to fully close that
gap.
The third one is penetration in cardiology. As Lamberto mentioned, we actually have had a good initial uptake in
cardiology. When you look at new-to-brand share, NBRx share, we are at roughly 15% at this point in cardiology,
which is in line with Pradaxa. And when you look at our switch share in cardiology, it's above 20%, significantly above
Pradaxa. We have clearly seen that physicians that are exposed to the full data set find that profile to be very
compelling. And so in the second part of the year, we are planning a significant increase in the number of promotional
medical education events and peer-to-peer interactions with physicians through the medical organizations. And finally,
as was mentioned before, we will be starting a DTC campaign in Q3. And those are really the four areas we are
focusing on.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Gregg, for the questions. Katherine, can we go to the next one?
Operator
Yes, sir. Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, just a couple of follow-ups. The $12 million in sales that were recorded this quarter for
Eliquis, I just was wondering. They don't seem to match with prescription trends that we've seen during the second
quarter. Not that we think the trends have been so spectacular, but there does seem to be a disconnect. Were there
scripts that were not filled, returned? I'm just trying to understand that.
And then, Francis, if you could elaborate a bit more on PD-1, I'm just curious to know. Post-ASCO, did you see a bump
at all in enrollment? I'm just curious to know how enrollment is going with your trial. And then, also interested in what
trials have you started with other immuno checkpoints in combination with PD-1 outside the three tumors you've
already studied. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Giovanni, do you want to answer the question on prescriptions and sales of Eliquis?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, in the U.S. only, demand sales in the quarter were $16 million, and so the $12 million
really relates to work-down in the initial inventory, which was built in Q1 when we started distribution of the products.
But the demand in the quarter for the U.S. market was $16 million. And in terms of abandonment and rejection rates,
we're doing quite well. It's in line with our forecast because our reimbursement support programs are working quite
effectively.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Jami, thank you. So we've had no difficulty at all recruiting. What has bumped up after ASCO
is obviously the combination studies we have ongoing and actually requests for many different other tumors in a
compassionate use approach, so there is a lot of interest.
In terms of other tumors and other combinations, I'd say we're looking already at hepatocellular carcinoma and
hematologic malignancies with nivolumab. And we plan to start very soon a clinical program exploring both
monotherapy and the nivolumab/Yervoy combination in a number of additional tumor types, particularly those with
high unmet need, such as head and neck glioblastoma, colon cancer with high microsatellite instability, pancreatic,
gastric, small cell lung, triple-negative breast, a whole combination of studies which I think will inform us about where
we would see both for monotherapy and combination where we go next. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Jami; Katherine, next question please?

<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Hi, three questions, if I could. The Yervoy and nivolumab data that you presented at ASCO
was remarkable as much for its safety as its efficacy. Should we expect within the non-small-cell combination cohort in
the safety, you're going to present a slightly less attractive picture in terms of safety given some of these patients
presumably had radiotherapy? I'm just thinking of the combination impact on pneumonitis risk.
Second, there's a lot of excitement about LAG-3 as a target. You have identified that within your portfolio as one of
high interest, and yet you still haven't entered the clinic. Is there any problem here with anti-therapies and antibodies to
explain the delay?
And then finally, if you could comment on the forthcoming ruling from IQWiG [Institute for Quality and Efficiency in
Healthcare] in relation to the AMNOG and Onglyza/Kombiglyze; what are your expectations there with regard to
pricing for both these agents? Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Andrew, let me start with the non-small-cell lung combination. As I just mentioned, we are
ongoing with a Phase 1b study. We're obviously looking carefully at safety and efficacy, and we'll have that data
in-house towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. Obviously, we're also looking at monotherapy, and so
we've got a couple of options here. Both of those are in Phase 3.
As far as LAG-3 is concerned, as you say, we are very excited about LAG-3. There's no particular delay. We're due to
go into the clinic before the end of the year. And of course -exciting about this, this is an area of interest around
exhaustive T-cells, which of course is nivo, Yervoy, and of course LAG-3 fit together very well. So there's no delay.
We're very excited to get in.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay Francis, so we move from the excitement of science to the reality of Germany.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: Okay. So for everybody just to remind you quickly what the process is in Germany now, we
have a process going on now which is a three-step process. You first have IQWiG as this is your product. They come
up with a ruling. This ruling is non-binding, an advice to the G-BA which is [indiscernible] (26:56) looking at the
product. They come up with a ruling there, and then you start your negotiations with the BfArM. So it's a lengthy
process going over a period of time, which usually lasts about a year. So at this stage, we were the first company going
through an assessment for a DPP-IV. Actually, it was Kombiglyze, and Kombiglyze was assessed through IQWiG and
also now an assessment with G-BA. So those two first steps have been completed for Kombiglyze. And actually there
was a difference in the ruling between the IQWiG, which gives us an enormous benefit, and the G-BA which
confirmed the thing that was an additional benefit. So now we will answer in the negotiations for Onglyza and
Kombiglyze, and we cannot comment further on this part.
As it pertains now to the overall class of DPP-IV [ph] and paradigm (27:46), the process has started for the evaluation,
so IQWiG first and then the G-BA. So the G-BA assessment is going to start. What we have in our hands is the ruling a
few weeks ago, a ruling of IQWiG on the whole category, and it includes obviously the Onglyza one, not the
Kombiglyze. So we are now expecting to see the G-BA ruling, and then we will go into the BfArM negotiations. So it
would be premature now to discuss what pricing will come out of that. What we know, however, is that there is a
chance to be able to argue the benefit of those assets and the importance of those DPP-IV in the treatment of diabetes
with very good efficacy and safety. So this is happening, and we are looking forward to continuing the discussion with
the G-BA and the BfArM.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Andrew. Katherine, can we go to the next question, please?

<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you, a couple of questions. Yervoy, can you talk about your level of enthusiasm
for the upcoming Phase 3 prostate cancer data because that's just around the corner? And can you talk about the
commercial opportunity for that indication in terms of how the trial was designed, and also in terms of the current

competitive landscape?
And then on PD-1, I know you guys are pushing into – likely pushing additional combination trials with PD-1 and
Yervoy. But how much do your outside advisors and folks internally think that the initial combo data in melanoma
foretells that you'll have success in other tumor types just based on what you know about tumor biology?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So I guess let me start, Tim, with Yervoy. As you know, we have a lifecycle management
program with Yervoy. There are two prostate cancer studies ongoing, one which, as you say, we'll be presenting later in
the year in more advanced cancer. I think we're modestly enthusiastic about that in the sense that this is a very heavily
treated group. We have another ongoing study which would be in earlier lines, which we believe when we have those
results we'll take the two together and have an idea of the value there.
Just talking about PD-1 for a moment, I think there are two ways to look at the combination trial. Obviously, in
advanced melanoma, the results are pretty extraordinary. Clearly, that does provide some evidence to the opportunity
for increased response rates. But the other way to look at this might be that in certain tumors where traditionally
immunotherapy hasn't had any effect, the combination might actually have some effect. As you know, there's a lot of
unmet need. We are being encouraged to look very broadly to signal detection work and then go on from there. So
we're hopeful, but we have yet to get a lot of the data but will do over the next 12 months.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: And, Tim, I think we'll discuss the commercial aspects of Yervoy and prospects once we
have both trials and we have analyzed that.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thank you, Tim. Katherine, can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Seamus Fernandez with Leerink has the next question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Great, thanks very much, just a few questions on dapagliflozin and then also – first off on
dapagliflozin, can you talk a little bit about the reason for an Advisory Committee? Specifically you mentioned that
that likely was going to be discussed. And can you give us a little bit of flavor of what has been changed or improved
meaningfully with the new filing versus some of the questions that have been raised by FDA historically?
And then separately, as we think about the investments that you're talking about both behind the primary care
franchises and also the investment behind the immuno-oncology portfolio, obviously this is going to be likely pretty
costly. You hopefully will also have a launch of dapagliflozin next year. How should we be thinking about your ability
to manage the cost structure relative to the longer-term opportunity? Thanks a lot.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Seamus, thank you. The dapa data we are submitting significantly enhances the information
we provided in our first submission, and in addition answers many of the questions raised by the FDA as part of the – I
should say all the questions raised by the FDA as part of their Complete Response letter. Part of the reason for the
AdComm is that at the original AdComm, as you recall, there was a vote not to approve this. So the FDA felt it was
important to come back and for us to present our broader portfolio of information now for the Advisory Committee to
opine.
As part of that resubmission, let's just say we will have a couple of studies on CV risk, which are now two years in.
Those are in patients with a history of CV disease who are diabetic and two new studies which weren't in the original
dossier specifically studying blood pressure and glycemic control in diabetic patients. As you heard earlier, we now
have a PDUFA date of early January. We're preparing for the Advisory Committee with the hope of getting approval
by then.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So about the investments, Charlie will give you details here. First of all, it is a great
problem to have because when you have multiple assets behind which you can invest, that means that you have a good
pipeline and a good portfolio, and I feel very good about it. Yes, we have a lot of investments that are needed to support
that pipeline and that portfolio.

If you think about 2013 when we were looking and we were preparing for the revision of the guidance, we obviously
looked at expenses. And when we were facing the Fervex recall and foreign exchange, we can see that way back we
had to cut expenses significantly. We decided not to go beyond looking for efficiencies because we believe we need to
support the portfolio, the launches, and the pipeline we have. Charlie?
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yes, thanks, Lamberto. I would just say as a general premise given our legacy and
heritage of productivity, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout our P&L as part of our everyday business;
but having said that, we need to balance the short term and long term as we build a solid foundation for sustained
long-term growth. And as Lamberto mentioned, we have a lot of very unique opportunities in front of us.
Let me frame it by saying if I look at the portfolio, we have taken out almost all Abilify expenses as I think about 2013,
as we've transferred most commercial responsibilities to Otsuka. And we've also optimized our mature brands, in line
brands, although we continue to look for efficiencies there. But moving forward when we think about Eliquis and the
continued rollout of launches, the annualization of DTC spend in the U.S., obviously there will be more spend going
forward.
And the same thing with diabetes, as we've brought up another sales force and potentially launching Forxiga in the U.S.
and we're also rolling out Forxiga launches globally, you would see incremental expenses there as well. And there have
been some questions already on I-O. That's a unique and compelling opportunity for Bristol-Myers Squibb. So moving
forward from 2013, that will be an area of focus. And then lastly, in hepatitis C, we do have a unique and significant
opportunity in Japan and one-offs in different countries as the portfolio evolves. So we will see incremental expenses as
we think about our hepatitis C program as well.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great, thanks a lot, Seamus. Can we go to the next question please, Katherine?
Operator
Yes, sir. David Risinger with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. I have three questions, please. The first is could you just provide a little
bit more clarity on whether there's going to be any public disclosures of any incremental PD-1 data in any cancer later
this year, or whether we need to wait until early 2014?
Second, with respect to Yervoy in prostate cancer, given the scientific community's interest in immuno-oncology, I'm
surprised that you're not going to be disclosing the Yervoy data, the Phase 3 trial results. I think that they're completing
on ClinicalTrials.gov. It's indicated for completion in September. So could you provide some more color on that? I
know that the first line monotherapy study has a completion date in January of 2016. So I'm just wondering if we need
to wait a couple years for the prostate data disclosure.
And then finally, I was hoping that you could review the hep C opportunity in Japan and the timing for launch. Thank
you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Francis, you start.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: David, thank you. So let me be very clear; there won't be any public disclosures during this
year. Obviously, the third-line lung data, if it's good after discussions with the regulators, we would certainly disclose
that should we be making a filing.
As far as Yervoy prostate cancer is concerned, we will be providing that data at ESMO [European Society for Medical
Oncology] later this year. And my point really earlier on was that when we look at prostate, we will be looking at the
whole prostate area together with the early-line study that you commented about, which will be available around 2016.
Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Charlie, would you like to handle...

<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yes, as I mentioned earlier regarding hep C, we believe that we have a unique and
significant opportunity to have the first all-oral regimen to market in Japan with our GT – genotype-1b strategy. And
we think we that have 18 months to a two-year lead on both Abbott and Gilead in Japan. So our registrational Phase 3
study of our NS5A, daclatasvir, and NS3 for null and intolerant GT or genotype-1b patients is expected to be presented
at AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] in November. And we expect to file before the end
of this year with approval sometime in the second half of next year. Just as a reminder, we have about 1.2 million to 1.5
million people in Japan infected with hepatitis C, and about 70% of them are genotype-1b.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Dave. Can we go to the next question please, Katherine?
Operator
Yes, sir. Marc Goodman with UBS, please go ahead.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, a couple questions. First, Lamberto, in the past you've actually said that you thought that
R&D spend would be relatively flat for the next couple of years. So I was curious if that has changed and as part of the
previous couple of questions about spending if there will be increased spending in R&D, and we should expect that
relative to what you're spending this year because of immunotherapy.
Second question is the guidance change on sales, I was curious whether the Eliquis ramp, slower than expected, is that
also baked in to your lower guidance sales, or is that basically doing what you thought it was going to be doing?
And then in diabetes, can you update us just on the reimbursement, the payer issue, pricing? What's happening? Are
you on formularies? Is that the issue, or is it a marketing issue? I'm just curious on your thoughts on that. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay. I will start with a comment on the R&D, the R&D expenses. This is a very
important topic, and we are still discussing this subject within our company. It is clear that the opportunities associated
for us and for the patients associated with the immuno-oncology are increasing. And therefore, Francis, Charlie, and I
together with our teams are looking at the level of investment that this will require. As Charlie mentioned, we also have
other investments that involve R&D in our commercial organizations that we are looking at in defining the budget for
next year.
I think I can quickly reply on Eliquis. The sales for this quarter were below what we were expecting but there's nothing
– we're still at the launch stage. And so the guidance is not related to the performance of Eliquis this year.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: What I would just add to that, Marc, is that when we look at guidance and as we've
adjusted it, we take all product trends into account. The bigger issues, as I mentioned, were Fervex. And the total year
impact as we see it for Fervex is going to be over $80 million, Fervex and the other two products. And then FX, as I
mentioned, had an $180 million impact. So they were the larger ones, but we take into account all product trends.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Giovanni, would you want to answer the question on diabetes?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, this is Giovanni. So to answer your question, the comment made before was
specifically related to coverage with Caremark. We lost coverage at the end of last year, and that had a meaningful
impact on our Onglyza sales coming into this year. We've seen that impact primarily in Q1, at the beginning of Q2. We
believe that impact has now stabilized. Beyond that plan, we continue to have good access with Onglyza and
Kombiglyze across the majority of the market. And on the other side of exenatide, our preferred access in both
commercial and Medicare for Bydureon has actually been improving following the launch and steadily improving this
year as well. So although diabetes clearly from a pricing and rebates perspective is an increasingly competitive area,
overall the access to our portfolio is quite good The Caremark issue was a very significant issue. It was one issue that
impacted us in 2013 for Onglyza.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Marc. Can we have the next question, please, Katherine?

Yes, sir. Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group, please go ahead.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I appreciate it. My first one is on
Eliquis. Is it that the message – the data message on superiority isn't being disseminated properly, or is it that you're
seeing resistance to acceptance of that message?
And on nivo, if I may, you've been pretty clear about the potential filing timeline in squamous lung. But at least in my
mind, I'm a little bit confused about the potential filing timeline in melanoma as a monotherapy. I was wondering if
you're willing to clarify that at all.
And just finally, obviously, there have been a lot of press reports around M&A activity in the space, not including
Bristol. But I just think it might be a good time to get your updated thoughts on use of capital and the size of a deal that
you might consider theoretically. Thank you very much.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Let me start with the use of capital, and then I will ask Giovanni and Francis to answer
your questions on Eliquis and PD-1 respectively.
Our use-of-capital priorities have not changed, and they include business development. They include, Mark,
investments in business development. So we continue to look at opportunities outside there, assess them, assess the
financial value of those opportunities as well as the fit with our portfolio and pipeline. So we continue to be actively
looking but in a way that is financially clever and disciplined. Giovanni, do you want to talk about Eliquis?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, so the message is actually resonating quite well. And when you look at the messages
that are recalled by physicians, the first three messages that are recalled in very high percentages are stroke reduction,
the bleeding data, and the mortality data. Obviously, the data set is one of the most comprehensive data sets that exist.
And we've seen that physicians that are exposed to a medical education program and have the opportunity to learn
about the profile typically become believers and trialists. And that's the reason why we are strengthening the
investment in medical education programs and peer-to-peer events in the second part of the year because when
physicians are exposed to the full data set, it actually resonates quite well.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thanks, Mark. Next question, please – sorry.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Mark, just to say I'm not going to comment specifically on the timing now. But what I will
say is we're encouraged about the progress of the three Phase 3 trials we have ongoing in melanoma, two of them with
nivolumab monotherapy and one with a combination. Interim analyses are embedded in all these trials. We have overall
response as one of the co-primary endpoints. And certainly there is – were looking at other ways to accelerate as well.
So we're enthusiastic about the Phase 3 program. It gives us a lot of options. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Sorry, Francis, and thank you, Mark, for those questions. Can we go to the next question
please, Katherine?
Operator
Yes, sir. Steve Scala with Cowen, please go ahead.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have two questions. You've already given a very thorough assessment of Eliquis.
But on the Q1 call, the company said that Eliquis was on track and access was ahead of plan, so I'm wondering what
has changed in the last three months. For instance, have competitors reacted in unexpected ways for instance?
Second, may we assume that if there were any pancreatic findings in SAVOR that we would have been told that
already? Thank you.

<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So, Giovanni, I think that, first of all, Steve, very good question on Eliquis, and Giovanni
can give you a good answer. And then you will talk about SAVOR.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Steve, this is Giovanni. I guess to repeat going back to what we said at the beginning, we had
very good success with access from early on and continue to have over 80% of lives covered in the commercial space
and over 75% of lives covered in the Medicare space. My comment was they are covered lives at the beginning, as
always, primarily in a non-preferred status. We are currently working and completing contract negotiations to increase
the percentage of lives that are in a preferred status, and that's normal.
With respect to performance, our uptake in cardiology has been quite good. It has been quite good at the beginning.
The last few weeks have been more, I would say, flat than the first part of the uptake curve. Part of that was linked to a
number of weeks where there were short weeks because of vacation in the U.S. But the uptake in cardiology continues
to be good. What we want to see in the second part of the year is that uptake to accelerate and to broaden in some
segments of primary care, and we haven't seen that yet.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Steve, just to – I'm not going to comment any more about SAVOR results. But of course, as
you know, they will be presented on Labor Day at the ESC [European Society of Cardiology]. I think many of us were
very encouraged by the recent meeting at the NIH [National Institutes of Health], where for two days this item was
discussed. And I think many people came to the same conclusion we had that that there really wasn't any indication
that's either GLP-1 based therapy or increases that were associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Steve. Katherine, I think we only have time for two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Chris Schott with JPMorgan, please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much, just a couple here, one just quick one just following up on
Eliquis. I guess you mentioned the potential for broader uptake in PCP [Primary Care Physicians] as we go later this
year. In that setting, how much of a hurdle do you think the breadth of your current label and the lack of [ph] DDT
(50:44) is in terms of uptake relative to Xarelto in that setting?
Second question, following up on business development, is there a bias more towards end-market products versus
pipeline at this stage? And it seems like you have some very significant assets to invest in with the immune-therapy
platform. Does that lend itself towards looking more at end-market products that could maybe provide more near-term
operating profit to reinvest back into that internal pipeline?
And then finally, DPP-IVs, just more broadly, category growth has slowed a bit here. What's your expectation going
forward? Is that something that you think is a new norm? Can we reaccelerate growth in the category? I'm just
interested in any comments you might have on the broader category. Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Giovanni, you will take Eliquis and DPP-IV. On business development, Chris, no, [ph]
having spent a couple years here (51:35), it has not changed. So we continue to look at a full range of opportunities that
go from end-market products to early-stage R&D assets. And it is clear that even though we have an interesting
portfolio of – interesting pipeline ourselves, we must be very careful not losing opportunities outside that to integrate
our pipeline with assets that come from the outside. So yes, there is continuing activity to identify also early assets that
can make our presence in these areas stronger. Giovanni?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, so two answers on Eliquis and primary care. The biggest hurdle in primary care has
really been so far the entrenchment of Warfarin. If you compare primary care to cardiology, in cardiology about
two-thirds of new patients today have already started on a new agent. In primary care two-thirds of patients are still
started on Warfarin. And there, clearly a differentiated profile like the profile of Eliquis has the potential to accelerate
over time that transition. We don't see the breadth of indications as a major factor there. But of course, as you know, we
are working to broaden our indication set as well.

And then on DDP-IVs, a lot of the acceleration we saw last year for DDP-IVs in the U.S. was really related to the very
rapid erosion of the TZDs. The slowdown this year has been has really been related primarily to that process ending. So
we continue to see opportunity for growth of DDP-IVs. But clearly, the very accelerated growth of last year was linked
to a number of factors, including the erosion of TZDs.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thank you, Chris. And, Katherine, can we go to our last question please?
Operator
Yes, sir, and our final question conference Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thank you very much for taking the question. Lamberto, I believe you've made reference to
increasing resources around the entire diabetes franchise with Astra, and I wanted to understand that a little more fully.
Is Astra fully engaged with the amount of resources that the joint venture wishes to spend in that category? And
importantly, had they are ready been engaged with Bydureon because I think your comment was toward Bydureon
specifically? Thanks a lot.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: In fact, Astra has been very engaged, and we have discussions with AstraZeneca at all
levels, including discussions between Pascal Soriot and myself about how to improve our presence in diabetes. It is not
necessary to do this. We've only invested or decided to invest more behind Bydureon. In the U.S., we are adding an
additional sales force that is mostly focused on Onglyza. So it's that entire portfolio that we are supporting. And again,
Astra is engaged and we are engaged equally, and we continue to work together to optimize the individual assets in the
entire portfolio.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thank you, Lamberto.
Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, Tony. And with this, thank you. In fact, we just completed a very important quarter for Bristol-Myers
Squibb, a quarter that is characterized by the balanced execution between commercial sales and clinical R&D advances,
a quarter that is focused on driving near-term results and making long-term investments. Thank you very much,
everybody.

Katherine, that concludes the call. I appreciate everybody taken the time to join us, and have a great rest of the day.
