MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Allstate Corporation First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and
instructions will be given at that time.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference
over to your host, Mr. Robert Block, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's first quarter 2011 earnings call.
Following prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Don Civgin and me, there will be a question-and-answer session. Judy
Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer, Joe Lacher, President of Allstate Protection, Sam Pilch, our Controller, and Matt
Winter, President and CEO of Allstate Financial are also with us to answer your questions.

This discussion may contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on
our website. As always, Christine Ieuter and I will be available following the call to answer any follow-up questions
you may have. Now, let's begin with Tom Wilson.
Thomas J. Wilson
Thank you. Glad you could all join us. After my comments, Bob will go through the business results and Don will then
cover the investments and the balance sheet. This quarter was a good start to the year. The underlying performance of
our business was good and in line with our full year commitments which we talked about last time. We benefited,
obviously, from lower catastrophe losses this year in comparison to what were near records for the first quarter of 2010.
We also had strong investment results.
We remain focused on three priorities this year. The first is to improve our operating results; secondly, to grow our
business profitably; third, to differentiate ourselves from the competition by reinventing our businesses.
The first quarter results reflect our efforts to achieve each of these priorities. From a company perspective, operating
income increased 32.5% to $497 million compared to last year's first quarter which is due to lower catastrophe losses
and continued strong profits from auto insurance. Net income rose to $519 million, $0.75 per share higher than last
year's first quarter which was due to realized gains versus realized losses last year.
Book value per share was 13.2% above a year ago, and 3.4% over the last three months.
At Allstate Protection, profitability improved, but net premium written declined slightly. The recorded combined ratio
was 94.9, compared to 98.9 in the Q1 of 2010. Catastrophe losses were $333 million, or 5.2% of earned premium,
which was in line with the historic average cat losses for first quarter. But that result was, obviously, substantially less
than last year, it was about half of what we had in the first quarter of last year.
The underlying combined ratio was 89.9, which is up 0.8 or 80 basis points from the first quarter of last year.
Net written premium declined by 0.7% as our successful marketing campaigns generated increased new business in
auto, but that did not offset the impact of actions taken to improve profitability in a couple markets.
At Allstate Financial, profitability has stabilized and we're executing on our strategies to improve returns and grow
profitably.
Our investments results were very good. We continue to actively manage our risk and return. As you know we've been
reducing our municipal debt but the reductions this quarter were at a lower pace than they have been over the last
several years. This quarter we also reshaped fixed income portfolio maturity profile to optimize returns and balance the
risks associated with the shifts in the yield curve. That's particularly true because of the steepness of the yield curve.
We are not extending the interest rate in equity derivatives related to our macro hedge programs given our strong
capital position.
We also made progress on our effort to generate long-term profitable growth by focusing on the customer, sharpening
our value proposition and improving margins in underperforming businesses. We continue to test new products, refine
our customer value propositions for Allstate agencies, and the direct business, and are seeing gradual improvements in
returns from the underperforming homeowners and annuities businesses. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob to cover the
business unit results in more detail.
Robert Block
Thanks, Tom. Allstate Protection entered 2011 with the following priorities: to maintain auto profitability, to improve
homeowners profitability and to position our businesses for growth. The results for the first quarter reflect progress
towards the achievement of those priorities. Turning to slide 3, with the overall profitability of the business improved

primarily due to lower catastrophe losses recorded in the quarter, the top line continued to show mixed results in terms
of premium growth.
In total, net premium written at $6.2 billion declined slightly by 0.7% from first quarter 2010. This was primarily due to
a decline in units partially offset by rate actions taken in the last several quarters.
For Allstate brand standard auto net written premium fell 1% compared to last year's first quarter as we continue to
reach for the proper balance of growth and profit. Our successful advertising campaigns continue to drive an increase in
new applications issued of almost 12% over the first quarter 2010. This includes the results for those markets where we
are taking significant actions to restore profitability.
Our retention ratio remains stable at 88.9% but is still not at a level where we are generating unit growth in total. There
are many markets where we are experiencing unit and premium growth but in total, we have not reached the point
where growth in those markets exceeds the impact of profitability actions taken in select major markets.
For Allstate brand homeowners net written premium at $1.2 billion, grew 3% over the first quarter of 2010 as rate
actions taken over the last several quarters work into the numbers. This trend more than offsets the reduction in units.
We continue to employ a variety of profit improvement actions including filing and gaining approval for rate increases
which in the first quarter amounted to an average annual increase of 9.9% in 12 states or 1.8% on a countrywide basis.
Net premium written for the balance of our property liability business fell by 3.8%, driven mainly by declines in
Allstate brand non-standard auto and to a lesser extent in our Encompass business written through independent
agencies. Encompass continues to focus on its core product offering and is showing signs of stabilizing its business
from both a growth and profit perspective.
Shifting to the bottom half of the slide, we recorded a combined ratio of 94.9, a full 4 points better than the first quarter
of 2010. As we have said a few times, the primary reason for the improvement was the lower level of catastrophe losses
in this year's first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. While this was a dramatic reduction in cat losses from
the last few years, it reflected a result that was slightly higher than our average first quarter level of catastrophes of
5.0% to earned which we provide you in our investor supplement.
The underlying combined ratio was 89.9, an increase from the first quarter of 2010, of 0.8 points. This result remains
within the annual range of 88 to 91, with the underlying combined ratio we provided in our last earnings call.
On the next slide, we provide charts detailing the loss cost trends for Allstate brand standard auto. On the left side of
the exhibit, we give you the frequency levels, trends for both bodily injury and property damage reported frequency.
For the first quarter, both coverages showed an increase relative to prior year's first quarter but at a lower level of
increase than we experienced in the back half of 2010.
In the upper right-hand corner of the exhibit, we show the results for paid severity increases over prior year for those
same two coverages. The first quarter showed an uptick in trend but at relatively low levels. In the lower right-hand
corner, we give you the combined ratio for this line on a quarterly and 12-month moving basis. The overall margin for
standard auto remains fairly stable as we strive to balance growth and profitability.
The next slide provides similar information for Allstate brand homeowners. In short, the loss cost trends for this line
were in line with both our most recent experience and are being reflected in our rate actions that we've taken and will
continue to take.
The overall margin for this line was obviously better this quarter than last year as a result of the lower level of
catastrophe losses. More importantly, on an ex-cat basis, the margin improved only slightly and our actions to improve
this over time will continue.
Shifting the conversation to our results for Allstate Financial, on the next slide we provide the top and bottom line
results for this business. Consistent with a strategic intent to improve returns and to shift the focus away from spread
business to underwritten products sold through our agencies and in the workplace, the results for the first quarter
demonstrate the progress we've made.

Total premiums and contract charges increased 4.6% in the quarter over prior year, with underwritten products
contributing positively. We've stabilized the profitability of this business, generating net income in the quarter of $97
million and operating income of $116 million.
As is our practice, we conduct an annual study of our policies during the first quarter of the year. As a result of this
activity, we unlocked our assumptions with an unfavorable impact on first quarter 2011 operating income of $8 million,
and $7 million on net income.
In last year's first quarter, the annual unlocked produced a favorable impact on operating and net income of $26 million
and $8 million, respectively.
So, adjusted for the unlocked operating income in the first quarter of 2011 was $124 million, compared to $113 million
in the first quarter of 2010.
With that, I'll turn it over to Don.
Don Civgin
Thanks, Bob. The results for the first quarter reflect the continuation of our proactive management of risk and return.
Slide 7 provides you with a look at our portfolio composition and how it has changed since the first quarter last year
and year-end 2010.
During the quarter municipal fixed income securities were reduced by about $700 million to $15.2 billion. At the end
of Q1 2010, this asset class was over $20 billion, so we've reduced the municipal bond portfolio by $5 billion over the
last year.
At the end of Q1 2011, it comprised 15% of the portfolio, down from 20% a year ago, consistent with our risk
reduction strategy.
Our actions have further improved the diversification of the municipal portfolio by geography and sector as well as the
overall quality.
As a result of our improved and strong capital position at both AIC and parent company, we modified our approach to
managing rate exposure and exited substantially all of the macro hedge programs that were primarily designed to
protect against interest rate spikes and significant equity declines.
Given our outlook for interest rates, our goal in the cash portfolio was to reshape the fixed income maturity profile to
optimize returns given a steep and potentially changing interest rate yield curve.
The results can be seen on the right side of this exhibit with reductions of both the short and long ends of the curve and
the corresponding increase in the middle portion of the curve at the 3- to 10-year maturity level.
On the next slide, we give you details on net investment income by business segment. For property liability, net
investment income declined slightly on a sequential basis, as yields fell while average assets remained level despite
moving $200 million up to the holding company during the quarter.
For Allstate Financial, net investment income also declined sequentially as the assets under management declined as a
result of our strategy to move away from spread-based products. The fixed income yields have stabilized in this
portfolio.
On the next slide, we provide information on the trends for realized capital gains and losses. Losses from impairment
write-downs were $114 million, the lowest level since Q3 2007. Gains from sales were $283 million as we repositioned
the portfolio during the quarter. The realized capital loss in derivatives included the impact of non-renewing the macro
hedge program and gains from limited partnerships were $63 million in the quarter.

In total, we recorded realized capital gains of $96 million versus realized capital losses of $348 million in the first
quarter of last year.
Finally, on the next slide, we provide a snapshot of our capital position at three points in time. Shareholders' equity
grew to $19.3 billion, up $300 million since year-end 2010, and up $1.7 billion since March 2010.
Our book value per share at $36.51 increased 3.4% since year-end and over 13% over the last 12 months.
We repurchased $300 million of our stock, leaving about $540 million remaining on our $1 billion authorization, and
we moved $200 million up to the holding company level from AIC during the first quarter.
The net results of these transactions was deployable assets at the holding company level of $3.7 billion.
With that, let's open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan. Your question, please?
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Hi, good morning. A couple questions. First, just would you mind giving us similar
to 4Q, some color on just how the auto book is looking ex-New York and Florida and just kind of where we are in
terms of pushing for a rate there? And the second question is, there's potential legislation, I guess, both in New York
and Florida related to PIF, or uninsured motorists, and would be curious how if that legislation were to pass, how it
would affect your actions, if at all?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Matt, this is Tom Wilson, Joe will talk about the auto book to profitability and around the
country how he looks at and where we are.
As it relates to legislative action, it's really a little too soon to tell. We, obviously, think that our issues and profitability
are some of our own doing but some of what is going on in the marketplace. We'd like to see the marketplace be a little
more stable with better and clearer rules and the fee schedules be changed. But that's too early to predict what those
would be. But, Matt, get Joe to talk about auto.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Thanks, Matt. Ex-New York and Florida combined ratios for auto, are running on a run rate
basis, excluding catastrophes, excluding prior year reserve changes, consistent with what they were running a year ago,
first quarter last year, and are in line with our expectations. We continue to actively manage all of those states on a state
by state basis. Some are a lot better than we'd like them; some are a little worse than we'd like them and we continue to
work those on a state by state basis to adjust them.
I'll defer from giving you too much forward looking rate or pricing perspective as we usually do, but we feel good
about those combined overall.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: So just to summarize that, it's fair to say that if we think about the year over year
change, that can be entirely thought about as being kind of driven by New York and Florida then?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: If you take New York and Florida as two individual states and you take everything as an all
other bucket, that's a fair characterization.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Okay. And then -
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: In that all other bucket, some of those states are doing better and worse.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Okay, that's fair. And just Tom, if I heard you correct, then, you're just going to go
full steam ahead with whatever rate you feel like is warranted and if you get any legislative reform that's just maybe
gravy on top?

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I wouldn't say gravy on top. I'd say we'll adjust to whatever the law is when it's put in place.
But we're going – we're continuing to operate with a broad-based, multifaceted program in Florida and New York
which covers everything from pricing to underwriting to claim handling practices to improved profitability in those
states. To the extent the laws change and we need to change that, any part of that program, we'll do that. But we're not
waiting for someone else to fix the profitability there.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Okay, thanks much.
Operator
Your next question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Yes, thank you. I was interested in looking to the accident severity trends. I noticed that
frequency is down just a tad. Wondering how much that is being driven by prices of gasoline and whatnot and while
severity is up, it's not up a lot. But it's up more than it's been in the past. Perhaps you can elaborate?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll make a couple of general comments and then maybe Joe wants to speak specifically
about any of the components of frequency or severity.
Josh, I would say that first, as it relates to frequency, there's a whole bunch of components to that, right. There's
obviously gas prices, miles driven has a negative effect. In fact, when people drive less, there are fewer accidents.
Employment rates have an upward impact on it because the more people drive to work when they're working, they
drive more miles. And then, of course, you have weather, which impacts frequency. It's a little hard to differentiate on a
quarterly basis, or even a yearly basis, how much of the variance and change is driven by any one of those components.
For example, you know, if you have rain and it's 30 degrees out at 2:00 in the afternoon, that's different than if it rains
at midnight and it's 55 degrees.
So, it's a little hard to actually distinguish between those. But we feel good about where we are overall in the
combination of severity and frequency, so that we're pricing that auto business profitably and based on what we see.
Joe, I don't know if you want to make any comments about -?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Yes, I'd echo some of that. Often, Josh, the first things that move on frequency are the
smaller dollar claims. So, sometimes when you see frequency go down, you do see severity go up a tiny bit and they
offset. So, thinking about it in total is the right way. We're clearly seeing gas consumption over the last several months
decrease. We're seeing some minor decrease in miles driven. Those factor into what's going on, but as Tom mentioned,
there's a whole bunch of other things that ripple through it.
As we look at frequency by coverage underneath auto, in most of those lines of coverage, we are seeing some favorable
frequency trends to what we've seen in the past couple of years, a little bit of offset in most of those and severity,
overall, we see it as a combination that's a little less unfavorable in total loss trend than what we had seen before. But
certainly not pushing total loss trends significantly negative.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And then to some, would you say that it would be correct, if I listen to what you're saying,
that you're not clearly seeing a trend, there's a lot of exogenous events combined but there's no clear directional trend
right now?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: I think what we're saying is that the increase in total loss trend is increasing at a slower rate
than we had seen it before. And we can't put our finger on it. Often, folks will ask, is gas – are gas prices doing this?
Are miles driven doing this? And the answer is there's a hundred different things impacting it. And to put our finger on
one of them being the sole driver is almost impossible.
So, what we're saying is we can't answer that part of your question. As a general statement, we are seeing somewhat
lower rates of increase in aggregate loss trend than we were seeing before.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And we feel good about the profitability of the auto business and we like the trend.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And given that you feel good about the profitability and what we're seeing on accident and
severity, how does that affect your discussions with the regulators in the states for rate increase when you need them?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Again, it varies by state. In states like Florida and New York, where the profitability isn't
where we think it needs to be or really anybody in the industry looking at the data would think it needs to be, it doesn't
have a huge challenging impact. In states where we've got very strong profitability, it would have the effect you'd
expect it to have.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, I'd take you back to the conversation we had last year where we made some rate
investments to reduce prices in a number of states because we felt the combined ratio trends were good. And we
wanted to increase our growth, not that price is everything, but price is obviously important. And so if you look at this
quarter, you'll see the average premium is actually down a little bit. That's reflecting those investments we've made in
growth, offsetting that is exactly the point that Joe made, which is the average premium is not going down in Florida
and New York.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. Well, I appreciate the color. If there's not a lot more questions, I'll ask some more.
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Dan Farrell from Sterne, Agee. Your question, please.
<Q - Dan Farrell>: Thank you, and good morning. We've had a number of companies indicate that they had higher
non-cat weather-related losses in the quarter, and I was wondering if you guys observed that as well in your results?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Dan, Tom Wilson, I'll make a couple comments. Joe might have something to say as well.
First, I would say, if you look over a longer period of time, let's say 10 years, what we had, 10 years ago we saw an
increase in the number of severe storms called hurricanes. Over the last 4 years, we've seen a dramatic increase in what
we would call non-modeled cats, which are any large severe storms, catastrophes that are not modeled by the
catastrophe models called hurricanes, earthquakes and so you have seen a big increase in severe weather.
So, if you look at our catastrophe losses, they've been over $2 billion in the last three, four years and prior to that, there
were years, they were much lower than that, if you look at '06 and '07. So, you have seen a dramatic increase in the
amount of hail storms, golf ball, softball-sized hail, straight line winds at 80 miles an hour, you know, 120 tornadoes.
It's just you see a lot more severe weather. We are acting and running our homeowners' business as if that is a
permanent change as opposed to an anomaly. Because what Joe is seeking to do is turn the homeowners business into a
competitive advantage that generates an adequate return. Their challenge is trying to get ahead of the weather because
the weather continues to be bad. Joe, I don't know if you want to make any other comments?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Yes, and if you take the question of non-cat weather, to some degree, that's going to be a
function, Dan, of how people define cats running through their numbers. Our definition is a pretty broad definition of
cats. So as a general rule, we're seeing most of the activity running through those numbers. We wouldn't make the
comment the way others might, but I think it might be a definition of how we're describing cats.
<Q - Dan Farrell>: Okay, thank you. And then could you just comment generally on your ongoing efforts to improve
productivity of the agent force? And I know in the past, we've talked about there being a little higher turnover of agents
and maybe just give us some general color on where we stand right now?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Again, the biggest thing to think about is we're not in any way trying to reduce the number of
people we've got serving our customers, the licensed sales professionals and folks working inside of agencies. What we
found is that in some cases, some of our agencies have a sufficiently small scale that they're not as readily able to
deliver that customer value proposition that we're looking for and we're trying to help them get to scale.

Page 8 of 16
The likely result of that may be that some of the smallest folks conclude they can't get there on their own and the best
way to do it is by combining with another agency. We anticipate that the number of personnel in the agency, if you
think licensed sales professionals, the total number of bodies working with our customers, should remain close to
where it is. But it will give them a better ability to actually deliver that value proposition customers are looking for.
We're making good progress on that, that work will continue. It will take us at least another year or year and a half to
really move it where we want to go, and we feel good about the progress we're making overall.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Dan, let me broaden your question just a little bit. It is in part about efficiency, but it's also
about effectiveness. And so, everything Joe just described is also about making sure that those agencies have the skills,
capabilities, people to be able to serve our customers well. Last year, the Agency Loyalty Index, which is a measure we
have which says how well are the customers doing, was up 3 full points, which is about 5% improvement.
<Q - Dan Farrell>: Okay, thank you very much.

Your next question is from Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please?
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: I was wondering if you can give an update on your view of the non-standard market, and an
outlook as to whether or not you might be growing there more significantly at some point. And similarly, I was
wondering if you could update us on California and where you stand there. And then my last question would be on the
life earnings. Ex-the DAC unlock, how sustainable do you think that is?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, Alison, let me just give some is clarity on question two. What in California,
specifically, so Joe can definitely deal with non-standard, and Matt can talk about the life business which we're feeling
good about these days. What was your, in California, what specifically were you talking about?
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Oh, sorry. Growth and the resumption of it now that you've resolved some of your issues
there.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Okay, very helpful, Alison.
<Q - Alison Jacobowitz>: Thank you.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Non-standard in the auto marketplace functions very differently than standard auto. You got
to approach the customers, the operations, the pricing, the claim activity differently. We have at times, if you go back
far enough in our history, been bigger there, concluded that we weren't operating that business in a way we were
comfortable generating an appropriate level of profitability. So, it's contracted somewhat.
I do believe there is a place for it and we can provide some coverage in that marketplace over the long term. I'm
optimistic that we can get better growth than we've had in the last couple years because we've been shrinking it. So,
anticipate we can turn that around. But don't anticipate it's going to be a huge percentage of our aggregate portfolio in
the near term, if that helps you with that question.
On California, it has been and we anticipate it will continue to be a challenging marketplace. There were a couple of
obstacles we had with the Department of Insurance and consumer advocate and adjusting our rating plan. We've
cleared those and are moving forward. We anticipate successfully executing those in the marketplace and feel better
about our prospects there. But we'll continue on a regular basis to move somewhat slowly in that marketplace because
any time you get a little sideways, it takes a long time to correct it. So, we'll cautiously move forward there.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Matt, do you want to talk about life?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. Hi, Alison, this is Matt Winter. So I think your question was how sustainable we think
the life earnings are ex-DAC. As you know, we spent the vast majority of last year stabilizing the business and
de-risking the business in order to take out some of the volatility that existed in the business, specifically in its earnings

stream. A lot of the work we're doing this year is to continue that de-risking and at the same time position the business
for growth.
So there will always be some volatility in the benefit spread through the mortality, which fluctuates during the year.
But the more policies we put on and the more we grow our mortality and morbidity businesses, we will attempt to
dampen some of that volatility. So, we believe that we're positioned quite well for the future. And we think the earnings
that you see are representative of the capabilities of the business and we're cautiously optimistic about what the future
brings.

Our next question is from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Hi, good morning and thanks.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Hi, Greg.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Hi. I wanted to – I'm sort of trying to reconcile the direction of the standard auto top line, and
so, I certainly can see from the supplement what average premiums are doing and you call that out on – in the release,
and then I'm trying to reconcile that with pricing overall for the marketplace is going up and it looks like on page 15 of
the supplement, pricing seems to be headed higher, and you know, we know what PIF is doing. I know it's been asked
before and you guys commented on it, but I'm trying to think, when does the top line begin to grow for standard auto?
Is this an '011, an '012, when do we see the reversal?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, we obviously – the only forecast we like to do is what we believe the underlying
combined ratio is, so we don't do top or bottom, bottom line.
As it relates to the prospects for that business, if you – if you – once we fix New York and Florida, the business overall
should be growing. You can decide how rapidly you think that grows based on what our new business trends are, which
have been very strong, and then the most important part of our growth at this point is moving our retention levels up.
So, we've kind of held retention flat, it's up a tick but I would say it's statistically not really significant. We need to
move that number up to get real growth. So, you move retention a point, you get a point of growth automatically. So,
our big focus right now is driving retention up.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay, great. And then the second question is just on the ROE for the overall corporation.
How do you – is this a 10% ROE, business, is this a 12%, is this a 15%? You know, we know what you've earned in
the past and I'm just curious once you execute on the trend, where you think you'll settle out with given what's going on
in the balance sheet yields, et cetera.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Obviously, we think it's a lot higher than it is today. Let me break that into components. The
return on both book capital, which is the way you look at it, and economic capital, which is another way we look at it,
in the auto business is terrific. We like it; we manage it quite effectively and it's been very consistent.
The underperforming businesses have, of course, been homeowners, where we have about $6 billion of premium and a
lot of capital up against it because of the volatility, and Joe has talked about how he's working to drive or turn up in that
business. That will obviously bring our overall ROE up from where it is today.
In the life at Allstate Financial, a couple of the businesses are quite profitable, both our life business, which is sold
through Allstate agencies, and our Allstate Benefits business. We like both of those businesses, both their growth
prospects and the returns. We're still working our way through the annuity business that Matt talked about, trying to
stabilize that return. So, those are the components of the earnings piece of it.

From a capital standpoint, what obviously we seek to do is to make sure we have sufficient capital to protect us from
any volatility that comes around in the company and to the extent we don't need that capital to support the current
business, we either deploy it by expanding it to something else or doing things like share repurchases where we're way
ahead on our $1 billion dollar program today. So, we try to manage both the operating side and the capital side in a
reasonable and balancing. But the most important thing to driving returns up from here will be getting homeowners and
the annuity businesses their returns up.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay. But you -
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: We don't necessarily have a target. I'm not going to say, here's a target and I'll be here by
this date. I'd like it to be as high as it can be. There's nothing wrong with great returns and we've had, as you know,
ROEs that are well into the teens, the high teens, and sometimes even into the two on it. So, we don't have – I don't
have a target that I want to work to or below. Our job to drive as much shareholder value, which includes returns, but
then related to that you also have to have growth.
So, share prices are driven by both the current returns which is usually more than half of your current value, and then
growth. So, in the auto business as you pointed out, somebody else pointed out earlier, the average premium was down
a little bit, but that's because we're trying to drive growth up because we think that maximizes shareholder value.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay, and just again on the ROE, I have a very hard time seeing teens, but I actually think,
you know, your stock would do fine if you just got to double digits. So, I should take away that double digits is a very,
very reasonable trajectory, sustainably, obviously, this quarter but that is a sustainable, reasonable trajectory for the
business the next three years?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would agree with that, yes.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please?
<Q - J. Paul Newsome CFA>: Good morning. Thanks for the call. Maybe you could update us as to when you're
going to think about – or when the Board is going to discuss buybacks again and has your thoughts changed given that
cash flow has done pretty well year to date at the holding company.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Paul, we're, of course, always thinking about capital, as you know. And both in terms of
how much we have, where we source it from and how we return capital to shareholders. So, we obviously feel good
about how much capital we have and, in fact, we've built capital this quarter despite buying back $300 million of stock,
so we're in a better position this quarter than we were at the end of last year. So, we feel very good about that.
I would like to see us growing a little faster so we could use more of that capital, and deploy it at good returns, so we
could grow shareholder value.
To the extent we don't have those opportunities, the easiest way to do it is to move through the share repurchase
program, because that's a good, clean way to give it back to shareholders and it doesn't build fixed charges for the
company.
We obviously are ahead on that, as I just mentioned. From a dividend standpoint, we tend to look at it as a percentage
of earnings. I'm feeling okay where we're at right now. You know, we had a great quarter, but one quarter is a quarter.
We tend to look at that on an annual basis. We obviously – my Board obviously approves it every quarter, so we have
the right and obligation to do that every quarter. But we tend to think about that more on an annual basis than share
repurchase program which, you know, if we keep generating more capital, we'll keep buying back stock. And if we
don't have good uses for that capital when we get done with this program, we'll do another one just like we've done the
other, I don't know, Bob, $16 billion, $18 billion of share repurchases.

<Q - J. Paul Newsome CFA>: No question there's been a lot of share repurchases in the past. Second question, I
apologize if I missed this, but could you revisit the modest reserve development that we've had of late? And just, is
there any components there that we should be aware of? Is it medical inflation, is it some other factor that we should be
thinking about?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll talk about the philosophy on reserves from an overall perspective, maybe Joe will want
to make comments. Of course, there's not much to talk about. Our philosophy has always been to be conservative, put it
up when we see it and make sure that the balance sheet is solid and accurately reflects our reserve levels.
When you look at the total company, we have really two components of that. There's the personal lines business, which
tends to be very short tail. And those – any changes there rattle through relatively quickly, and you saw a little bit of
that this it quarter in terms of catastrophes and little bit of bodily injury from '09 and '10. Then, of course, we have
about $1.6 billion up, in what we would call our discontinued lines, which is asbestos and environmental. The trends
there have been very good for the last 4 or 5 years. If you look at sort of how much we pay out in those reserves and the
payout ratios and the various ways you would – survival ratios, the various ways you would look at that business, we
continue to feel that those are adequately as reserved as well.
Is there something specific, Paul, when you look at the numbers on the amounts that are different from you're seeing
with other competitors and you're trying to compare one to another, or -?
<Q - J. Paul Newsome CFA>: You know, I'm mostly fishing to see if medical cost trends have started to peak up for
insurers. I know it will hit – it will often hit autos writers as quick as anybody else.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: You know, Paul, what we're seeing in reserve re-estimates, there's not a lot of motion. And if
you look at them over the size of the overall reserve balances, they're relatively small amounts. So, we're not seeing
anything that's sort of out of pattern there from a trend perspective. As we look under coverages, we'll from time to
time see things moving around a little bit. Nothing that we're seeing from a medical trend perspective that is way out of
pattern.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Excellent point. I mean, we've put up a lot more money in PIF in the last 12 months than
shows up here but that just gets moved around between coverages underneath the covers.
<Q - J. Paul Newsome CFA>: Great, thank you very much.

The next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question, please?
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yes. A couple ones here. First one, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the market
environment in standard auto insurance, the competitive environment. And also, if you could focus a little bit on the
telematics out there. And what do you see that having, what impact is that potentially having on the marketplace and
what do you see it having going forward?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll give you a longer term perspective. Joe can give you how he feels about the market
today. On a longer term perspective, go back 7, 8 years, the competition in auto insurance first got dialed up with
pricing sophistication. So, what we would call strategic risk management, SRM, we put our credit-based algorithms in,
Progressive, GEICO, other people did.
Then the market shifted to include not only that, but increased advertising, and so you saw in 2003, we dialed up our
advertising from $70 million to $250 million or something like that. And everybody at the time, GEICO was doing like
a couple hundred million. Now, GEICO is, from my read, looks like $900 million to $1 billion. So, you've seen that
level – lever of competition get heated up. And now what you're seeing is more competition in the area we started on
about 4 or 5 years ago, which is product and features.

So, Your Choice Auto, you're seeing a number of people start to copy our new car replacement stuff. You're seeing
people copy what we would call declining deductible. Some people call it vanishing deductible. So, you're seeing the
increased level of sophistication of competition build on itself. And so, under that context, Joe might want to talk about
sort of what he's doing to make sure we continue to win.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Yes, and Brian, I think there's part of it where I think the question was targeted where Tom's
going and part of it might be a more general comment about how aggressive people are being in the marketplace.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yes.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: From a marketplace perspective, we continue to see, broadly, carriers having an interest in
writing more auto business. There's clearly some marketplaces that are a challenge. I think New York and Florida is a
pervasive challenge for the industry, broadly. We're seeing folks look at a lot of different tools just like Tom described
in that broader perspective. Pricing sophistication, product differentiation, marketing to try to write more business.
We haven't seen crazy rate activity where folks are dialing back rates to try to drive it. We're seeing the competition
occur on other different – other fronts. And we continue to compete there ourselves. We don't think it's a particularly
advantageous advantage to try to just be perpetually the cheapest and keep dropping rates, to have a price war.
Better consumer value driven by looking at the products and the features and the service capabilities that are provided.
And that seems to resonate with consumers. Nobody wants you to be the most expensive, but they do look for value.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: And thoughts on telematics?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Telematics continues to be a neat opportunity. Personally, I think over the long term, I think
we'll see it have an increasing impact. We continue to make investments and run our programs and tests and learn in
that space. And I anticipate being able to roll out some things more broadly. In the future, I don't think it's going to get
a real broad consumer adoption across the overall marketplace in the next 12 months or so. I think it's got a little longer
time horizon.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey, Brian, it's Tom. I'm going to try to put it in that contextual layout. Telematics has some
of the advantage of pricing for an individual, some people, as Joe pointed out, like to think they're only paying if they're
in their car driving. So, there is some consumer benefit. Telematics is also in that first bucket of increasing pricing
sophistication. So, we're obviously working on making sure we're sophisticated pricing. We also are testing some
things on just the consumer piece, which are slightly different. So, for example, we've been testing a claim guarantee in
three states, where Joe's team, the promise they make to customers, if the you're not happy with your claim service for
any reason, we give you your premiums back. So, that's a sense of how the competition is evolving.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Right. Okay. And then one just quick question here with commodity prices up as much
now, particularly oil prices, you know, in the last 6 months to a year, and as we head into the second quarter, any
concerns or any watching what happens with respect to homeowners, some severities, purely roofs and that kind of
things?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Always. We're watching it, looking at it. We have a sense of what happened last time we saw
oil prices pop up, and that's always in the back of our mind and we're watching for it to come through in severities.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Have you seen it yet at all?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Not a ton with this piece. We definitely are seeing the residual effect of the last time we saw
oil prices up and it's running through the severities and we're responding accordingly.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: If you look at building materials, they were up all last year even though fewer houses were
being built.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Cost of shingles, all those kinds of things, asphalt, shingles.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your question, please?
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if we could delve a little bit more deeply into New
York and Florida to get a sense as to where you are with regard to let's say, nonrenewal of policies where you don't
think profitability is possible, rate changes and maybe competitor rate changes.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Joe will give you a little bit of perspective, but given that we compete and that's a relatively
defined market, we're not that anxious to let everybody know what we're doing. So, with that caveat, we'll be happy to
talk about the components of the program we have.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Yes, we're focusing on using every available lever to fix profitability there. We made some
very aggressive actions from a claim perspective. We've added significant numbers of adjusters, bodily injury
personnel, SIU, special investigation unit personnel, to very actively work in that marketplace. We're using more
medical exams, medical reviews, statements under oath, a whole series of levers on that side. And they're appearing to
be providing some benefit and paying off and they'll continue to do so. They're in line with our expectations, we expect
to see more improvement emerge as we move through the year.
We've taken some significant rate action. We filed just under 21% rate change in our open company in Florida this
quarter and that's in effect. It's having largely the effects we expected it to have on mix of business we're writing new.
It's having the expected impact largely – the expected impacts on retention. We're retaining the customers we wanted
to. We're retaining the customers that were the most unprofitable at significantly lower rates and at significantly
improved profitability. Very aggressively working on lobbying and regulatory fronts, both to get legislative reform and
to get regulatory help in dealing with some of the fraud and what's probably the bigger issue is abuse of medical
treatments. So we're pushing on all those fronts. We are selectively looking at nonrenewal activity in certain spots and
in certain categories of business and we'll move on those as appropriate.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's helpful, I guess. I was hoping for more of a timeline but I can understand why
that's not available. With regard to the surge in new issued applications for standard auto, is there any way of sort of
quantifying the impact that that new business growth is having on the overall combined ratio?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Help me with what exactly you're looking for Meyer.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: In the normal state of affairs, if you're pricing for lifetime profitability, then the underwriting
margins, they can be a little bit thinner on new business. We're clearly seeing, I think, an uptick in new business with
only a hint upward in the renewal ratio. And I'm wondering how much that's contributing to let's say the year over year
rise in standard auto loss ratios?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: It's not a significant contributor. If you just do a little bit of algebra on the new business
policies relative to the in-force book, it's not enough to be moving it. The year over year change is much more
significantly driven by New York and Florida. And then the new business piece would be at best rounding error in that.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Meyer, you know, we do run, on preferred customers, we run a new to renewal loss ratio
relativity which is over 100. So, you're right. But we'd like the number to have a bigger impact. How about that.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Understood. Okay, thanks a lot.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Matt, are you talking on the last two pieces, do you want Judy to deal with – sorry, Michael
– do you want to deal with just property casualty or do you want asset liability and matching on the whole portfolio?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: I'm just thinking about P&C right now.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, Michael, Judy will hit all three of those.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And she's happy to have a question.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: Yes, thank you for the question.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Sure.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So, the first part of the question was about the duration of the portfolio. And the duration of
the portfolio in the P&C business is around 4.5 years. That's extended over the quarter, and part of the reason for the
extension is because of our decision to not extend the macro hedge. So, I'd say about half of it is because of that. And
the other half is because of the portfolio repositioning which both Don and Tom mentioned, where we changed the
maturity profile of the portfolio to optimize what we think is the right thing to do in this rate environment and this
curve environment. So, it extended.
And I guess from an ALM perspective with regard to the protection portfolio, we don't spend that much time thinking
about the ALM profile. We manage the portfolio to optimize the economics for the Protection business, but don't
necessarily pinpoint the liabilities from a duration perspective. Different in the life business, in Matt's business we do
that, but in the Protection business we don't.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: All right, great. And then just a quick question on reinsurance cost and the recent RMS
model change and cats in the second quarter, can you just give us some color on how to think about that? Thanks.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: I missed the last part. What in the second quarter?
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Catastrophes, just extreme weather in the South.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Of course. The RMS model change is clearly significant and we've all heard a bunch of
people talking about it from an industry perspective. We look at the RMS model. We more heavily rely on AIR, which
made their changes a while back. We look at all the models out there and factor those generally into our
decision-making processes. It's not having a huge impact on tactically what we're doing. We do anticipate that it's going
to ripple into the reinsurance marketplace from a pricing perspective and haven't seen all of those impacts yet. So, we'll
continue to watch that. Most of our program in Florida we placed in February, and it wasn't significantly impacted by
this. We've got a little bit left to go. And we may see some change there, but we'll see how the market plays out on that
one.
Relative to cats in the second quarter, clearly been a lot of activity so far in the quarter. We've seen over the last couple
of years increased volatility in the first and second quarters from what we might have seen, if you look back 10 or 15
years when the heaviest volatility was in the third quarter relative to hurricanes. If you look back at last year, the
second quarter was a very large cat quarter for us. So, we continue to watch it and look at it. We expect that we're going
to see volatility like that going forward. We're clearly concerned and worried about our customers and our agents and
the folks particularly watching yesterday in Alabama that they get the appropriate help and support and service that
they need to recover from such devastating losses. In terms of being able to predict what those losses will be for us
from the quarter, we're not even through the first month yet, so it's tough to tell.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: And Joe's goal with respect to volatility and catastrophes and what he's doing in
homeowners is to have the question be, how profitable was homeowners, not was it profitable.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great, thank you.

The next question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Langen McAlenney. Your question please.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. Just following up on the homeowners, Joe, you had said that it
was a multiyear turnaround story a year and a quarter ago, so we're maybe 30% of the way through the turn. The first
quarter was a good test on cat management, which you aced, and the second quarter will be probably even a better test.
Where are you in the turnaround and are you ahead of schedule, or does the first quarter give you confidence as a good
data point?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey, Bob, before Joe jumps in, there let me ask one question and make one comment. First,
are your fingers okay? You're normally the first guy to ask the questions. So, like did you break – I'm concerned about
you.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: I was in shock with the quarter, so I guess my reflexes were a little slow.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Secondly, I would say I wouldn't hold the second quarter out as a test of our cat
management programs. The second quarter is going to be whatever Mother Nature delivers to us. It really isn't anything
that our operational programs can deal with. And Joe, you might want to talk about your overall game plan.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: I was looking more how you – what your cat number is relative to the field, so the first
quarter was a good cat number relative to the field. So if it's big for the industry and you're a little less, I think that
would be encouraging.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: I guess, Bob, I'd encourage you not to make that your benchmarks. I'm not sure that's the
right benchmark of the change. It may be an absolute measure of long term performance, but that's not something I'm
going to anticipate is going to change quarter over quarter.
What we're doing is trying to push the improvement on the aggregate returns of the business. One of the things you can
see is we had another quarter where earned premiums and written premiums were growing faster than underlying loss
cost. We've done that, I think, every quarter for the last four quarters, and we'll continue to drive that. We're going to
push that profitability improvement broadly. We're continuing to deploy a whole series of other programs at increasing
rates across the book.
One example of them are, we spend a lot of time with claim adjusters on a regular basis out looking at our insureds'
homes. We're instituting a program where we're also having them spend a little bit of extra time and reinspect the house
and provide a report back from an underwriting perspective. That lets us make sure we're appropriately on the risk and
let us provide a great customer service back to our insureds to let them know when we see some sort of risk or issue
that could subject them to a future loss and help them prevent it because I think most people would rather prevent a loss
ahead of time and know about that risk than have to deal with it after the fact. So, big opportunity for us there and it's
one of a bunch of little things we're doing that's going to help drive that profitability up.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Joe, what inning do you think we're in, in the turn? Early, or middle or -?
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: It's a long game, there's probably two tracks to watch on it. There's aggregate, catastrophe,
model catastrophe management and we're well into that one and have done a very good job of reducing our peak P&L
exposures. There's managing exposures to non-modeled catastrophes and we're more in the middle of that pack. And
then there's fixing aggregate returns and we're probably in some of the earlier innings in terms of change you'll see on
that track.
<Q - Robert Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, we'll do one more question.

Our final question today is from Harry Fong from Soleil Securities. Your question, please?
<Q - Harry Fong MBA>: Good morning, everyone. Joe, this is a question for you in terms of the homeowners. Cats in
the first quarter were clearly closer to the ten-year average. However, if I strike the results from '08 through '10, the
10-year average or the 7-year average drops down dramatically. Can you sort of speak about your mix of homeowner
business as part of the changes that have taken place over the last few years in terms of removing hurricane exposure,
earthquake exposure, increasing exposures elsewhere in the country, can we get back to cat – non-modeled cat numbers
that we had, let's say, from 2000 to 2007?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Harry, first, good morning, nice to hear your voice. Let me make a comment on overall
weather and Joe can talk about our exposure. The assumption underlying some people's view is that that is an anomaly
in severe weather, and that we'll go back to the good old days when non-modeled cats were in the $500 million range,
not the $2 billion range. We're not running our business that way. We're running our business as if this change that
you've seen, as you appropriately point out in the last 3 and a quarter years is permanent.
We don't know whether the genesis of that increase over the last 3 years is just a cyclical movement in weather,
whether we're to normal or were at normal before, or it's global warming or anything else. But we're acting as if this
will be permanent and we need to recover those costs. With, that Joe can talk about the things he's doing on geographic
concentration because, obviously, that's another way you can reduce losses.
<A - Joseph P. Lacher>: Yes, Harry, the mix question you asked, I think suggested that we've reduced hurricane and
earthquake exposures and increased exposures in other spots. I think more accurately is we decreased a little bit of all
of them and a lot of the hurricane and earthquake, as a percentage, that increases our percentage in those non-modeled
hurricane and earthquake type environments, but we didn't really significantly increase exposures in those spots. I think
what you've more likely seen is an increase in activity from tornadoes, hail storms, other weather. And as Tom
mentioned, wherever we sit, you know, as individuals, on our belief of whether or not that's permanent and ongoing or
an unfortunate, you know, abnormality in the trend, we're responding to it in exactly the same way. They are significant
loss dollars, they provide a significant volatility and we're going to very actively pull the levers to fix those profitability
and return levers.
Thomas J. Wilson
Okay, thank you all. Summary, we're off to a good start this year in 2011, good first quarter. We're working on our
strategies which are to improve our operating results, grow our business profitability and then continue to differentiate
ourselves from the competition. So we look forward to talking to you in the second quarter.
