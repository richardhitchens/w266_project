morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 19, 2016, which may be accessed from the Investors page of the
company's website.
I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. Stephen
Hemsley. Please, go ahead.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today as we close on 2015 and look ahead to 2016. We finished 2015 in line
with the guidance provided at our December investor conference with fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at
$1.40, bringing full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share to $6.45.
Overall, UnitedHealthcare had a positive year and finished with strong fourth quarter growth, exceeding 300,000
members and growing across all its markets. Optum delivered an exceptionally strong fourth quarter, with revenues up
70% and earnings up 46% over the prior year.
Before we go into the business commentary, let me offer a brief recap of 2015. 2015 UnitedHealth Group revenue grew
more than 20% to $157 billion with organic revenue growth of 10%. Our cash flows were exceptional at $9.7 billion,
up 21% year-over-year. Our dividend increased 33% to an annual rate of $2 per share this year. UnitedHealthcare grew
to serve more than 1.7 million more people domestically and Optum grew its revenues by 42% and revenue backlog by
more than 20%.
Excluding the impact of individual exchange-compliant products and reserves related to the initiation of a new
Medicaid contract, UnitedHealth Group still grew revenues by 19% in 2015 and grew operating earnings 15% to $11.8
billion. And that would have produced an adjusted earnings per share of $7, a 16% year-over-year increase, again,
absent those two items to give you an idea of the underlying strength of the enterprise.
We know the individual exchanges are top of mind to you and Dave Wichmann will discuss these fully in his
comments. As we said at the investor conference, the balance of our total business, the well more than $175 billion of it
is driving considerably stronger and better position than this time last year.
We are committed to delivering a strong 2016 performance year in growth, in financial results and in the quality of our
services and Net Promoter Score or NPS performance metrics. 2016 is off to a strong start, considerably stronger than
2015. Our initial growth trends are very encouraging and our service performance for new January business is strong.
Optum's revenue backlog and pipelines have never been stronger. Medical costs in the fourth quarter trended slightly
better than expected. And we are confident our benefit businesses have appropriately priced their products for 2016.
Our operating business platforms drive these results, so I'll ask Larry Renfro to review Optum's performance for full
year 2015 and Dave Wichmann to cover UnitedHealthcare and provide some UnitedHealth Group enterprise-wide
comment. Larry?
Larry C. Renfro
Sure. Thanks, Steve. 2015 was, without question, an exceptional performance year for Optum in revenues and earnings
growth, and in our preparation to set up 2016 to deliver well for the nearly 115 million people we serve.
Optum businesses have strong momentum and are producing strong sustainable growth across the board. Since
beginning the One Optum journey in 2011, we have compounded revenues at 23% per year and operating earnings at
34% per year.
In 2015, Optum's revenues of $67.6 billion grew 42%, including organic revenue growth of 13%. OptumRx revenues
grew 51% this past year to $48 billion, and even excluding the Catamaran combination, posted solid double-digit
organic growth.

OptumHealth and OptumInsight together grew revenues to more than $20 billion, which is growth of 24% over 2014.
Our full year operating margin of 6.3% reflects the increased mix of pharmacy care services revenues, driven by
OptumRx organic growth and five months of Catamaran business. Both OptumHealth and OptumInsight strong full
year 2015 margins are sustainable. And we project operating margin expansion for OptumRx in 2016.
In 2015, we added to our strategic relationship portfolio, which now numbers 10. And we remain focused on
developing more of these comprehensive large-scale relationships. They leverage Optum's unique end-to-end
capabilities to help solve the broader challenges customers and prospects are facing in a changing healthcare
environment, whether they are physicians or hospitals, health benefit sponsors, governments or consumers.
To illustrate, consider our Optum360 revenue management relationship with Dignity Health, where cash flows have
already improved by one-half billion dollars and accounts are being settled a full eight days faster, and where our
documentation technology is helping Dignity Health physicians meet demanding ICD-10 requirements, even as they
are realizing a 50% gain in productivity.
Or consider OptumCare, our expanding care delivery business in which we are developing some of the most impactful
and durable consumer relationships. Today, we serve 7 million patients through more than 150 payer relationships
across our physician practices, our community-based clinical services and our MedExpress neighborhood care centers.
MedExpress operates at the convergence of healthcare and retail, measuring success one patient at a time. MedExpress
can provide as much as 90% of the care patients receive in the ER and for as little as 10% of the cost. MedExpress
mitigates cost for both payers and consumers, while providing high quality convenient care.
We currently operate over 160 neighborhood care centers with a goal of operating several multiples of that number five
years from now. Today, there are OptumCare clinics in more than 270 locations in 26 local markets, having recently
added ProHEALTH in the Connecticut market to that distinctive high performance practice portfolio.
Our pipeline for growth is gaining momentum as well. The OptumCare approach respects local market norms and
expectations and our doctors consistently deliver high quality results for the communities they serve. We consistently
outperform benchmarks around acute care readmissions and skilled nursing facility stays. More than three quarters of
private Medicare patients we care for are in health plans rated four stars or better, and more than 96% of our patients
would recommend our local care provider office to others.
For patients with complex medical conditions, our integrated care model has proven distinctive results. We deliver on
average a 50% reduction in overall healthcare costs for medically complex patients with very high patient and family
satisfaction. A number of OptumCare's high performing practices have been nationally recognized for their
performance and accountable care initiatives, including Monarch in Southern California and ProHEALTH in New
York Metro area.
And finally, our house call services continue to deliver clear and distinctive value for Medicare recipients and payers,
with 98% patient satisfaction and more than 1 million visits to patients in their homes delivered in 2015 and further
growth in 2016.
With the market momentum we have today and through these constantly advancing capabilities, we expect OptumCare
will remain a high growth business for many years to come. As we share other examples in future quarters that reflect
Optum's growing diversifications, such as our military and veterans health services or our pharmacy care services, or
our technology support services, you should see, with even more clarity, a pattern emerging: the application of data,
technology and services to bring better performance, helping health systems work better for everyone.
Today, revenues from our top 25 customer relationships at Optum have quadrupled over the last three years. In 2015,
the average customer award size doubled across OptumHealth and OptumInsight, and we expect continued strong
customer retention at OptumRx as we work to bring the powerful benefits of the OptumRx merger to these clients.
Prominent organizations continue to inquire about how our capabilities can help them, so we are exploring potentially
large and interesting new strategic relationships. In many cases, these pairings could further accelerate growth in the
OptumInsight backlog, which now exceeds $10.4 billion and grew by more than 20% year-over-year.

Within the current portion of that backlog, we already cover more than 80% of OptumInsight's full year projected 2016
revenues. We remain optimistic about the prospects for Optum in 2016, 2017 and beyond. For 2016, we are projecting
revenues to well exceed $80 billion, which would be growth in the area of 20%, and for operating earnings to grow
30% to 34% to more than $5.55 billion.
Optum is becoming an increasingly valuable business and now represents about 42% of UnitedHealth Group's
consolidated operating earnings outlook.
Now, let me turn it to Dave.
David Scott Wichmann
Thank you, Larry. UnitedHealthcare continues to differentiate itself from competitors on a foundation of distinctive
service, product innovation, and integrated clinical and network value and the result is strong sustainable growth.
UnitedHealthcare now serves 46.4 million medical members and we have leading market positions in all private health
insurance segments of North and South America. Over the past five years, we have grown by nearly 13.5 million
people or 40%, well diversified across commercial, government programs and international offerings. This reflects the
deliberate diversification and consistent competitiveness of our offerings globally.
UnitedHealthcare continued this trend in 2015, growing to serve 1.75 million more people domestically as it continued
to improve its market share. UnitedHealthcare's full year revenues grew nearly 10% to $131.3 billion. The full year
operating margins of 5.1% decreased as expected, declining 70 basis points year-over-year due to the effects of public
insurance exchange products.
Full year commercial medical cost trends of 5.5% came in at the low-end of our initial outlook one year ago. Our cost
trends reflect a positive, sustainable impact of higher consumer engagement, strong alignment of incentives with care
professionals through value-based relationships and improving data collection and application.
We are equally pleased with emerging innovation trends in our business focused on advancing the consumer movement
and healthcare. Today, 25 million consumers are served through our Advocate4Meservice model. People served by this
innovative approach are more engaged in their health and are more effective in their healthcare decision-making and
are more satisfied.
Today, over 23 million consumers have joined our rallied digital health applications and we are seeing steady advances
in daily active use of these services, including, importantly, engagement around selecting primary care physicians,
better use of urgent care over emergency care, screenings and higher adoption of personal health and condition
management programs.
And today, our Real Appeal digital medical service designed to help manage weight and reduce the onset of diabetes
has been deployed to accounts representing 1 million people in just the last half of 2015 and with an additional 0.5
million committed for the first half of 2016. The initial results are encouraging with 46% of participants achieving a
meaningful reduction of 5% or more of their bodyweight within 16 weeks.
5% weight loss reduces the conversion to diabetes by nearly 60% according to studies conducted by the National
Institute of Health. Given these exceptional results, we plan to make available digitally a broader set of preventative
medical services to engage people to live healthier lives to the fullest.
Across UnitedHealthcare, we intend to continue to positively impact the quality of social services, condition
management, cost and quality transparency, convenient care, wellness and the overall quality of life for the consumers
we serve by giving them the tools like these to engage them in their health.
Our work is improving the quality of patient care. In Medicare, we helped close 9 million gaps in care for the seniors
we serve. We will serve 1.7 million members in health plans with higher star ratings in 2017, as we expect at least 63%

of our members to be in a four-star plan. And we will further improve that percentage in 2018 to 80% or more.
It is not a coincidence we are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history. We expect
to close first quarter with growth of around 300,000 seniors in Medicare Advantage, and we are tracking well against
our full year outlook of 325,000 to 400,000 people in net growth.
In commercial benefits, we combine tiered networks, our clinical strategies and innovative product designs in a myriad
of ways to align to a wide array of affordable price points for employers and consumers. Today, one third of our
commercial customers are served through one of these more affordable plan offerings. That's double the number from
five years ago. And we expect that percentage to more than double again over the next five years, aiding to our
exceptional growth.
In Medicaid, over the past two years, we have secured new contract awards totaling more than 2 million people.
Managed Medicaid continues to emerge as the ultimate long-term sustaining solution for states and we believe
UnitedHealthcare offers our state customers the most distinctive and comprehensive set of capabilities. Like in
Medicare and commercial, we are well positioned for 2016 growth in community and state.
Turning to exchanges, we expect to start the year at around 700,000 or fewer public exchange members. And expect
these numbers will steadily decline over the course of the year. We are not pursuing membership growth and have
taken a comprehensive set of actions to contain membership and sharpen performance over the balance of 2016. We
have withdrawn platinum products, increased prices, eliminated marketing and commissions, intensified clinical
engagement and medical management with this membership group and reduced operating cost as appropriate.
As a matter of prudence, we have increased our premium deficiency reserve by $65 million, above our investor
conference estimates, bringing the total fourth quarter charge to $340 million. $245 million of that charge addresses
2016's exchange-compliant product exposure. This is in addition to the unreserved losses including in our 2016
outlook. Combined, more than one-half billion dollars is set aside for 2016. We believe we have fully captured 2016
exposure, now based on our actual starting enrollment. And by mid-2016, we will determine to what extent, if any, we
will continue to offer products in the exchange market in 2017.
In Medicaid, the start of the new program in Iowa has been deferred, while the state has also increased the assigned
enrollment for each contracted plan, which increases our estimate of revenues. We are in constructive discussions with
the state concerning elements of an effective and sustainable managed Medicaid program to serve that market.
As we look into 2016 and 2017, we believe UnitedHealthcare will continue to grow at a strong pace and profitably
improve its market share. Fundamentally, UnitedHealthcare is emerging across the spectrum of consumer-driven
products, service, wellness, transparency and most important, care engagement and clinical quality, particularly in
government programs.
We have room to improve, but the sharp focus on NPS and the quality of the work we do, and the culture centered
around helping others, we have an opportunity to offer even greater value to consumers, providers, and customers alike
in the coming years.
Before Steve sums up, let me touch on the outlook for UnitedHealth Group as a whole. We are committed to strong
performance in 2016 across UnitedHealthcare and Optum in service, in operations, in growth, in earnings generation
and in cash flow production. We foresee cash flows approaching $10 billion and adjusted net earnings of $7.60 to $7.80
per share. Again, adjusted net earnings, for us, is GAAP EPS plus after-tax intangible amortization.
We encourage everyone to move to adjusted net earnings to enable better comparability among companies and among
the analyst community. We expect about 46% to 47% of full year earnings in the first half of the year, with Optum at
approximately 40% of its full year plan in the first half, exactly as you saw it last year and in the past.
We expect the rate of our earnings growth to strengthen during 2016. Current consensus Street estimates for first
quarter adjusted earnings per share might be slightly strong compared to our expectations at the moment. All in, we
have a strong view of 2016 and look forward to this year. Steve?

Stephen J. Hemsley
Thank you, Dave. At our investor conference we offered a sense of the growing innovation and entrepreneurial activity
in our company and the restless drive our team has to grow and improve performance. On the customer side, we're
committed to further elevating satisfaction for consumers, care providers and all our stakeholders to levels more often
seen outside our industry to better meet the increasing expectations people and society have for healthcare.
When our Net Promoter Scores reflect people being staunch advocates for our products and businesses because of the
way we make their life simpler and the value we provide as they define and experience it as consumers and customers,
we'll be on the path to creating truly distinctive and substantial growth and brand equity. We believe a differentiated
brand and reputation will drive accelerated growth and market share gains for our businesses for years to come.
Our goal for serving you as investors in 2016 is simple. We're committed to delivering clean, strong results this year
backed by a growing pipeline of opportunities for 2017 and beyond. We expect distinguished revenue growth, earnings
and cash flow in 2016 that continue to reflect the diversity, breadth and overall strength of our enterprise and the
valuable businesses we are building.
Thank you for your interest today. And operator, can we take some questions this morning? One per analyst, please.
Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Could you just talk about what the factors were that caused
you to increase your booking for anticipated losses in 2016? I guess maybe – I think it was $45 million higher on the
exchange side and $20 million higher on the Medicaid contract, if I got that right.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yes, you do, and it's really just purely updating, and I think Dan Schumacher can take you
through it.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: So, you're right, we did increase our loss expectations for 2016. And what it came down
to, really, as we closed out the year, we took a prudent posture on the 2015 impact and then we carried that through to
2016 outlook, and then we adjusted further for a little higher enrollment expectation for 2016. So those are the elements
that played into the increase in both the 2015 impact and the assumed losses for 2016 in the individual
exchange-compliant plan offerings.
And then with regards to the Medicaid portion, that's simply just a function of a higher enrollment expectation as the
number of carriers was reduced from four down to three. But when you put that all together in total, as we closed the
year, it was about $100 million of impact beyond what our guidance had assumed from December, and...
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Okay.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: So our base business, the vast majority of our business performed exceptionally well
and we delivered fully in line with the expectations as we closed out 2015. And then as we look to 2016, we've
incorporated that, again, fully into our outlook as we reaffirm our guidance for 2016.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: And if I could, just one related question. In the fourth quarter on individual
enrollment, I think your total book is about 1.2 million. How did that change as a result of the – maybe at the end of the

year and then coming into this year as a result of the co-op insolvencies and related instability in the individual market?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: So – and I think the last time we talked, we talked about our individual exchange
compliant being about 700,000 of that 1.2 million you referenced. As we closed out the year, that came in at about
650,000 lives. And then we'll expect that to grow as we step into January, and then it will start to shrink again over the
course of the year as some of those enrollees attrit out.
<Q - Matthew Richard Borsch>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I would just say, as kind of an overarching philosophy, our goal in this area is to be
careful, conservative and to make sure that we really capture all this so that really we have de-risked 2016. Next
question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Want to talk a little about Medicare Advantage. I know the CMS
data is relatively preliminary, but certainly seems like you guys are well on pace to beat the 400,000 for the full year at
the high-end. So just curious, doesn't sound like you've gotten much Star improvement this year, so what made your
products more attractive? Is it more retention? Is it more agents or coming from other plans? Just any color on where
the growth's coming from?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. It is good growth, as Dave indicated, but Steve Nelson can really respond to that and
it is a very positive story.
<A - Steven Nelson>: Thanks, Steve. Hi, Josh, it's Steve Nelson. Yes, very positive about the growth that we're seeing
coming through the AEP, and just a little insight into that growth. First, it's important to remember that it comes as a
result of and after a couple of years of really hard work as we repositioned this product to some of the changes in the
Medicare Advantage program introduced premiums. It's created a more aligned and engaged network and relationships
with our providers and meaningful improvement in Stars, as you mentioned.
And second, we really like where the growth is coming from. And so, I think Dave mentioned in his comments about
300,000 or so as a result of AEP. About a third of that comes from group, so really good insight into that pricing and
that membership. And then within the individual business, meaningful improvement in our retention also has added to
this growth. And so this is membership that we've been engaged with and they've been involved in our clinical
programs. And it's very evenly spread across geography and products. But the stability of our products, the evolution of
our portfolio is really resonating in the market, and so I think that's all contributed to the growth. And we expect this
Medicare Advantage product to continue to grow as we look to 2017 and beyond.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: And Steve, just a quick follow-up on that. Do you have a percentage of how many are
coming from previously not in MA, whether that's agents or traditional fee-for-service, versus how many are coming
from other plans – competing plans?
<A - Steven Nelson>: It's a little early to give that kind of color, but I would say, in general, in terms of how we look at
the membership, it's very much in line with our expectations.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.

<Q - Andrew Schenker>: Hey. Thanks. Maybe just going back to the exchange enrollment real quickly, just a few on
the membership here. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about how your positioning or membership growth compare to
the existing states versus the 11 new states you entered? And then related to that, obviously, still a little over a week left
in open enrollment, so just how you're – what kind of forecasts are you expecting for total enrollment? I assume you're
trying to – you assume there's a big jump in the last week or two, but just how we should think about that 700,000
related to expectation in the last two weeks? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Andy. So on the exchange enrollment specifically, the 700,000
that Dave mentioned beginning January, we ended the year with just about 500,000, so that jumped up to about
700,000 as of 1/1. We'd expect that over the balance of the open enrollment period to grow something underneath – to
about 800,000, something a little south of that. And then we would expect that to wear off as you pace through the year
as those members attrit out. In terms of where it's coming from, I would tell you that the net growth is coming with a
greater orientation towards those new states as well as expansion areas, but a little bit of mix of both.

<Q - Chris Rigg>: Good morning. Thanks. Just on the last question, I got a little confused with the numbers, Dan, just
on the 800,000 versus 700,000, 500,000 ending the year, and 650,000-ish now, can you just confirm did you end the
year at 650,000 or was it 500,000? And then, my real question with regard to all of this, do you know how many of the
people that have currently signed up were enrolled with you guys last year versus new membership? Thanks a lot.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. So just to be clear, we ended the year with 650,000 lives in individual
exchange-compliant offerings. Inside of that, 500,000 of them were on exchange. So the balance, 150,000 was
off-exchange. And then as we step into January, that exchange component, which ended the year at about 500,000,
grows to about 700,000. And then as you move towards the end of the open enrollment period, it grows further, up
towards 800,000, something south of that, and then works its way down over the year. The off-exchange is more level
than what we experienced in the on-exchange. And then to your last question about mix of enrollment, more than half
of the enrollment is new to us and a little less than half of the enrollment is existing enrollment base.
<Q - Chris Rigg>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next, please.

And we'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Hi, everybody. Just might ask – focus my question on Medicaid. Both do you update your
membership with one player dropping out in Iowa? Is that enough to move the needle? I guess we had some companies
comment on concern about profitability in Medicaid year-to-year, can you give us a flavor there? And then finally on
that, the health insurer fee question for 2017, have you gotten any clarity from CMS as it relates to either Medicaid or
Medicare and how they are going to treat that [indiscernible] (32:31)?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, that is quite an impressive single question, A.J., so we'll break that up into pieces
and we'll start with Austin on Medicaid?

<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Hey, A.J. This is Austin, and how are you?
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Good.
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: So, first of all, I think you're asking about Iowa. We did increase our membership outlook
and assumptions for Iowa, as the state moves from four players to three. As far as the sustainability of the program, I
think, first of all, as we stated before, we're really honored to have been selected to serve the people of Iowa. We
continue to feel good about the relationship that we developed with the state and we're in very productive conversations
with them about really tried and true methods to ensure long-term stability.
And so we feel good about where that's headed. And it will become a long-term and very durable part of our portfolio.
And really, with regard to the rates overall, as you know, states are always pressured; there's nothing new in that. I
think we're very pleased with our business. Most pleased with the value that we've been able to bring to our customers
and to the consumers over the years. We've got a very strong management team, very locally deployed and able to
manage these populations and really help people in very vulnerable situations and deliver value for the long term. So, I
think we feel good about a pressured but stable rate environment and the growth in this market.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: And nothing really distinctive in terms of the rate environment, the same pressures that exist every
year?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Absolutely.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. A.J., its Dan Schumacher. On the health insurer's tax, I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention that from my perspective, obviously, the tax just increases the underlying cost of healthcare and, as a result,
makes healthcare less affordable. So, as we look at the elimination of it for 2017, we're certainly encouraged by that
and, frankly, we've been long supporters of its permanent repeal.
Now, with that said, I'll tell you, in terms of the impact, in Medicaid we expect it to be no impact. In the commercial
business, because that's priced on a policy year basis and the tax is levied on a calendar year basis, there's no impact
over three years, but there are differences bi-year, and we expect it to actually be a drag on our 2016 earnings. We've
estimated that impact to be $100 million pre-tax or about $0.06 earnings per share. And then lastly, in the Medicare
business, the tax has not been part of the rate setting process previously, so we wouldn't expect it to be for 2017 either.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And that pressure is covered in our guidance, so we basically absorb that in our guidance
given the strength of the start the year.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Okay.

We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks. Just to go back to the exchanges, I guess, if we shift the premium
reserve from 2015 into 2016, are you saying that you expect to lose more money on exchanges in 2016 then you did in
2015? And if so, why would that be the case? I guess you had a chance to [ph] price out (35:56) the core business?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I'll have Dan answer this, but I think as a matter of prudence, what we are doing is
making sure that we have covered ourselves appropriately in 2016, and that means we set aside more money between
the reserves that have been set aside and what we have covered it within our guidance, that is clearly our purpose. We
are really focused on making sure that this item is really covered in 2016. And so, I think that's what you should read

through in terms of our activities. Dan?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Kevin. So if you move the premium deficiency reserve and reset
the years and look at it, on the individual exchange-compliant plans within 2015, we lost about $475 million on the
2015 policy year. In the 2016 policy year, as Dave Wichmann mentioned, we'll lose more than $500 million.
So, we've got about a 10% increase in the loss assumption balanced against about a 25% to 30% growth assumption in
the underlying enrollment base. And the reason that we're able to do that is to the points that you mentioned.
Obviously, we came in with very strong pricing, in that mid double-digit and, further, we made some strong
refinements to our product portfolio. Those are the largest contributors, but beyond that we're also working every single
day to tune our operating environment as well as focus our clinical interventions and our network orientation around
this population.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: I guess you're saying its the loss of [indiscernible] (37:32) and then you mentioned half
the growth is going to be new states and new geographies. Is that why the losses – is that why you have losses really at
all going up or do you think the core business is actually going to get worse as well?
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: No, I think it's going up because we've got enrollment growth, and then balanced
against that is our pricing, our product positioning, our clinical interventions, our operating environment and the
improvements we're making there.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I might point out that this is what we are providing. We are being careful in terms of
making sure that we have covered this off. These are not losses that we are sustaining, these are what we have protected
ourselves against in terms of 2016.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
And we'll take the next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: Thanks for the question. Previously, you said that you are expecting $0.13 to $0.15 or $200
million to $225 million in additional loses from the exchange business in 2016. It seems like that grew a little bit
because you talked about over $0.5 billion now in losses, including the $245 million PDR.
But my question gets to – if that's the right number, the $0.13 to $0.15 and maybe correct me if I'm wrong, that would
be, say, $0.14 at the midpoint added to the midpoint of your $7.60 to $7.80 guidance. So, let's call that $7.84 of
potential earnings. That's only 12% growth from the $7 number that you have, excluding the individual business item.
Yet, last year you grew 16% to get to that $7 in terms of earnings. Which of your core businesses is one responsible for
the slowdown from 16% to 12%?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, Peter, those are projected numbers. We would think that we could perform even
more strongly. So, I think by just isolating that against a beginning of the year range may not be a fair comparison in
comparing your 16% to 12%. Actually, as we take a look across our spectrum of businesses, we really don't see any of
these businesses in a position that they are actually – I would say, they're all stronger than they were as we – compared
to this time last year, as we entered clearly across the board in Optum. The strength of the portfolio from one end to the
other has advanced. And in terms of UnitedHealthcare, I think all those businesses have strengthened and I think our
positioning on the exchange has strengthened. So I think my view on this is that it is a pretty positive outlook.
<Q - Peter Heinz Costa>: The 16% you'd say – the difference between the 16% and the 12% then is PPD perhaps, is
that what you'd say?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No, I'm not sure you can, in my view, take out that one element and then project against an
estimated earnings range as we go out. We could be even stronger than that.

We'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
<Q - Gary P. Taylor>: Hi. Good morning. This is a question for Larry, I think. When we look at OptumInsight,
operating income was up $200 million sequentially, same case last year was up about $100 million sequentially in the
fourth quarter. Can you just remind us the source of the seasonality in the operating income for OptumInsight, please?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I think we'll have Larry kind of give you some sense of the growth and momentum
there and then respond to that specific question.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Gary, its Larry. I think that you've seen over the last few years that the fourth quarter is
obviously a dominant quarter for us. We think that will stay that way. If I had to break it down, I'll give you three areas
to think about. A lot of times at the beginning of the year we're making investments, and those investments pay off in
the fourth quarter, and you see a little bit of that happening.
We're also in implementation mode during the year and those implementations and installations also come true in the
fourth quarter and that enables us to obviously have a stronger position at that point. When you look at the products and
services, there are specific products, like, obviously, distribution, that goes along with open enrollment. But also, our
pay-for-performance and incentives will also hit in the fourth quarter. So we don't see that changing. We see that being
the pattern that Optum, in general, will be experiencing.
<Q - Gary P. Taylor>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Thank you. Impressive increase in backlog for OptumInsight, can you remind us, I think
you gave us some parameters at Investor Day, how to translate that into expected revenue over time? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: You want to take it?
<A - John Franklin Rex>: Sure. Christine, it's John Rex. Good morning. When you think about the backlog, $10.4
billion backlog that you see in Insight, some of the guidance points that we provided on that is you should expect about
60% of that to be recognized in the 2016 revenues, so that would equate to about 80% of the full year revenue outlook.
Another way to look at that is that the average duration of the backlog runs about 20 months. And these have been
fairly consistent numbers and I'd expect that to be fairly consistent as you look ahead also.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Christine, it's Larry. One thing I would add to what John said is that, as of now, about 90% of
our 2016 revenue is locked in. Obviously, that's part of the backlog.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: All right. Perfect. Thank you.

<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. I just have one quick clarifier before my question. So you had mentioned earlier that
there are conversations with states on Medicaid rates around tried and true methods that ensure stability, does that mean
– I'm wondering if this is referencing changes in the risk adjustment methodology that can lead to some premium
givebacks or are you talking about other aspects of tried and true methods?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: So this is Austin. Really, I was talking about a whole portfolio of methods. So you can think
about care coordination, network management, the level of transparency that we address, the rates and emerging
experience over time with states. So you couldn't narrow it down to anyone. We've got a very long-term history, of
20-year and 30-year relationships, so a lot of success in how we work with states, and so that's what led us to feel so
confident and comfortable with where we go with Iowa and really with our whole portfolio of states.
<Q - Sarah James>: Got it. It's just that I know some of your peers are trying to lobby to get those risk adjusters
changed back, so I wasn't sure if that was an indication that United was as well, but it sounds like there's some other
aspects that you're negotiating with?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Yeah, and I wouldn't comment in any further detail about the specifics of any conversation
with any state.
<Q - Sarah James>: Got it. Then, in the past, you've talked about opportunities for growth in Medicaid outside the
RFP cycle, like states assigning LTSS or carving in other products. Do you still see that as a possibility? And is there
anything near-term?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Yeah. Sure. So, let me comment on the pipeline overall, which I think is very strong. States
continue to move and look to managed care as solutions for their healthcare needs. That movement continues as states
have really embraced this. I think that activity – in fact, I think we expect to respond to over 20 RFPs this year that'll be
implemented in 2016, 2017 and on into 2018. So, again, when I say the pipeline is strong, it's very strong.
That's heavily weighted towards more complex populations, so that's really what you're talking about when you speak
to LTSS and the movement of those complex populations from fee-for-service into managed Medicaid. We've got one
of the largest books of business in that space. We've got a very long history at dealing with these very vulnerable
people and delivering real value to those individuals as well as value to the states.
So, I think we feel, and Dave mentioned it in our opening comments, I think uniquely positioned between
UnitedHealthcare and Optum to really serve these populations, help them live healthier lives year-over-year, and
deliver value back to the states in the process. So, I think our outlook for that continued movement, even within states
where we're already providing traditional [ph] TANF (47:08) population managed care to continue to grow into those
complex populations.

We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho USA.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Thanks so much. And first of all, let me step back. Against the backdrop of a somewhat
challenging situation with exchanges, let me – and this shouldn't sound false, complement everyone from UHC to
Optum to senior management on the way you performed and handled during 2015. I'm impressed by, especially the fact
that, from where I sit, the progress you've made with the cost structure as well as positioning the business. I don't
remember United having a better cost structure, better positioning going into a growth year in a very long time if ever
than you've got now.
So, let me ask a question about one of those things that's interesting to me that you performed well on, which is the
cash flow. I guess, multi-part one. Why the strength? Two, does this change in any way your thoughts around share

repurchases versus deleveraging versus investment in the business for 2016? And three, it seems like 2016 guidance is
perhaps a little bit more conservative if not a little modest on the cash flow, and I was just wondering what you think
might change?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Thank you, Sheryl.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dave will touch on the beginning of that and then we'll get into the share buyback, invest,
et cetera, as part two.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: Thank you, Sheryl. First, thank you for the recognition of the hard work this team has
done this year, particularly in the last half of the year, to get its cost structures aligned and to really position its business
for growth in 2016 and beyond. Our cash flows were exceptionally strong. I think you know from past calls and
discussions that we've had, we're very focused on cash flows and, in particular, managing the balance sheet elements of
our business. And the strength of the cash flows – or the departure from what our original expectations were really
around collecting receivables more quickly and paying claims more in line with what our contractual requirements are
as opposed to paying it early, so just better working capital management really contributed to that.
As it relates to then what our priorities for that, is around share repurchases, deleveraging and investment, we're going
to continue to maintain a very balanced posture with respect to those things. Obviously, it's important that we continue
to de-lever the business as we had indicated that we would over the course of 18 months following the Catamaran
transaction, and we continue to be committed to doing so. Part of that is our expectation that we'll continue to curtail
our share repurchases at least for 2016 unless extreme circumstances arise. But for 2016, it's about $1.2 billion to $1.5
billion in cash use. And as you can probably suspect by the activity that's underway in our business, we continue to be a
strong investor in new capabilities organically in our business, but also through acquisitive means.
As it relates to 2016 and the cash flow, certainly jumping off of a $9.7 billion cash flow year with stronger earnings
expectations for 2016, you would expect we would achieve higher cash flows. And as a result, we used a language of
$9.5 billion to $10 billion in cash flows; we're now talking closer to $10 billion. And we'll take a hard look at that over
the course of the first quarter and reassess whether or not we can push that number forward. But, clearly, the business is
operating well from a balance sheet management perspective, and we'll do all we can do to move that cash flow number
forward.

We'll go next to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. I just had a one follow-up first on the exchanges. At the Investor Day, I know you talked
about assuming around a negative 15% margin on the exchanges. Just as you work through sort of the updated math, is
that still how we should be thinking about that or sort of different relative to that number? And then just a follow-up
question, just interested outside of the exchanges just on the membership front, how membership ended up developing
for the rest of the commercial risk business for the 2016 enrollment period, most notably, in the small group segment.
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. We'll let Dan comment on the first and then Jeff Alter kind of speak to the business
in 2016.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Good morning, Scott. So, where we landed on a policy year basis as we closed out
2015, our policy year losses on the exchanges were in the mid double-digit – mid-teens range that we talked about in
the investor conference, so 15%, 16%. And if you look at 2016 on a policy year basis, we expect that to moderate
some. We'd be into the low double-digits from a margin percentage basis with higher enrollment base, lower
percentage margin losses, again, on those things that I talked about earlier, so the strength of our pricing, the

repositioning of our product portfolio and then our management efforts underneath that. So hopefully that provides a
sense for what you are looking for. And then, Jeff, on the enrollment?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Sure. Good morning, Scott. It's Jeff Alter. So we closed out 2015 with very strong growth across
both our fully insured and self-funded product. I would say driving a good part of that was increased retention of our
existing clients. And in certain markets, we saw the market come back to our pricing, particularly in small group. We
also had the opportunity to win back a very large part of the Health Republic small group block in New York at our
rates. And as you recall, from early 2014, one of our headwinds was that Health Republic pricing against our small
group block in New York. So we were – we're in position to win that back during the fourth quarter of 2015, which is
good.
We also couple that with very strong specialty sales. Our vision and dental products are selling really well. And I think
it plays to sort of our value in the marketplace. Our strong brand, our consistent pricing and the ability for folks to take
advantage of our increasing innovation in the marketplace, the service that we deliver and our efforts to make the
healthcare system a little simpler for our members. So, we're really encouraged by the growth that we've had over the
last 18 months. We see that momentum continuing as we pace into 2016 and feel good about what that will deliver in
2016 and 2017 and beyond for our shareholders and our members.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Pretty positive. And so maybe we'll just take two more questions and then, as you know,
John and Brett will be available through the course of the day for questions and any other areas of interest. So maybe
two more questions, please.

And we can take our first question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to cash flow. Again, it seemed even stronger
than usual. Are you holding back claims at all with ICD-10 implementation? And maybe just generally speaking, are
you seeing any impact at this point from sort of a coding and acuity perspective relative to your expectations? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Not at all, but we'll let Dave handle that and others who want to comment on coding, but
those are not issues at all. Dave?
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: I'm not sure what to add to that other than not at all. Those are not issues at all. No,
this is just purely really more refined cash flow management principles across the company. The enterprise is doing
well in really managing cash flows. Obviously, the performance of the business sans exchanges is strong, and then
couple that with the balance sheet management. We're not holding claims or doing anything other than paying them in
accordance with contractual terms.
It's part of the value that comes from a more integrated UnitedHealth Group than what we've experienced in the past
possibly, a bit more fragmented healthcare platforms or claims adjudication platforms. As we continue to move towards
a common set of technologies working more closely with Optum and UnitedHealthcare, we're seeing the benefits of
strong cash flow.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And on terms of ICD-10, maybe we'll go real quickly to UnitedHealthcare as it relates to
them and then flip to Optum and talk about more broadly the industry and what we're seeing.
<A - Daniel J. Schumacher>: Sure. Ralph, its Dan Schumacher. From an ICD-10 standpoint, there's really nothing to
update from the investor conference and my comments there. The reality is we are paying tens of millions of claims in
the ICD-10 code set, and as you look at inbound volumes, rejection rates, auto adjudication rates, throughputs, ending
inventory, all the way through that process stream, I would tell you all of that is in line. And so there's nothing getting
hung up, nothing getting slowed down. And to Dave's point, really around the cash flow, it really comes down to just
managing better to contract terms as we have more of our business on common platforms which allows us to do those

our Computer-Assisted Coding. We've actually had a very distinctive product in the market and customers that used it

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. So, one last question, please.
Operator
We'll take that question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Peter's question and your response around
what I thought I heard was there's upside to your guidance for 2016. And I'm just looking at all the things that have
developed. We've got a weak flu season. You pulled forward even more losses from exchanges in Medicaid. Pricing
looks pretty good, your days in claims payable has gone up year-over-year by three days. Your Star membership
rebalancing looks good as well, and special enrollment periods may be a tailwind. Are there any headwinds we're
missing or should we think there could be upside to your consolidated care ratio and your margins that you're
projecting for 2016?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That is an excellent list. I'm not sure I could do have done better myself. I just think it is
the 19th of January, I we should be careful in terms of how we are discussing our results. We have to truly work
through the balance of our exchange. We do think we have reserved for it and considered it appropriately into our 2016
numbers. And as I said, it's the 19th of January and I think that we should move forward thoughtfully and prudently in
our business. So I think those are the factors.
In terms of headwinds, like we said before, we have less than before, but we clearly have to play out the year and that's
what we intend to do. I think our focus is to really deliver a very clean, strong financial year to the marketplace to
continue to advance our business. Continue to innovate, continue to diversify across both the platforms of
UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and kind of that's our focus. I think we always endeavor to try to perform better, but I
think our guidance right now is a very appropriate range and I'm assuming you've taken some of the input in terms of
how the quarters might play out from our commentary in the teleconference. So I think we will just end it at that.
Stephen J. Hemsley
And once again I'll thank you for joining us today, and I'll leave you with a few closing thoughts. As businesses, Optum
and UnitedHealthcare, we think really advanced their capability significantly in 2015. And the UnitedHealth Group's
revenues and operating earnings grew significantly as cash flows increased, as we talked about, over 20%. And our
dividend has increased and we will certainly address that in the middle of the year as is our custom. UnitedHealthcare
served more than 1.7 million people domestically, growing virtually in every market that we serve. And Optum grew
its revenues by 42% and its backlog by more than 20%.
In 2016, we expect to continue and accelerate this growth trend and carry it into 2017 and beyond. We intend to further
differentiate our products, our services, by focusing on consistently high quality in everything we do and creating real
value for customers and consumers on their terms.
We remain committed to delivering clean, strong financial results, as I said, for our shareholders this year with the
growing pipeline of future opportunities. So we appreciate your interest today. This concludes our call and, as I said,
