MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning everyone. My name is Debbie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like
to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have
been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt McGrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McGrew, you may begin
your conference.
Matt R. McGrew
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief
Executive Officer; Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Gugino, our
Director of Investor Relations. We're also joined by Steve Rales, our Chairman of the Board.
Given last night's announcement on the CEO transition, our earnings call is going to be slightly different format here
this quarter. Larry and Steve will open with a couple of remarks on the transition before getting into the details of the
quarter and then the Q&A.
So with that let's get through the disclosures. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation
supplementing today's call, our first quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciling and other information required by SEC
Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investor
section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Financial Information.

The audio portion of this call will be archived in the Investor section of our website, later today, under the heading
Investor Events, and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until
April 24, 2014. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the U.S., and 719-457-0820 internationally, and the
confirmation code is 6763223.
During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year
performance. The supplemental materials and our first quarter Form 10-Q describe additional factors that impacted
year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplementing materials to
earnings, revenues, and other company-specific financial metrics relate to the first quarter of 2014 and relate only to the
continuing operations of Danaher's business, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial
metrics are year-over-year.
During the call we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including
statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These
forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC
filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to
update any forward-looking statements.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp
Matt, thank you, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to say a few words
about the announcement we made yesterday regarding the CEO succession.
Next year marks my 25th anniversary with the company with more than half of that time as President and CEO. I will
be in the fortunate position next year of having 14 years in the CEO saddle, while yet still shy of my 52nd birthday.
Although many CEOs do not serve this long, I'm sure last night news comes as a surprise for many of you. Not because
of my tenure but because of my age. I am convinced in my head that it's the right time for a transition both for Danaher
and for me personally. This decision is mine.
So let me answer the obvious question. Why? It's pretty simple actually. After spending half of my life at this great
company, I'd like to do something different in the next chapter of my life. Danaher today is strong, I think you see that
in our results, and we have every conceivable strategic degree of freedom in front of us. The team is strong, and Tom is
the right person to be our next CEO.
I am a lifelong student of Thomas Jefferson. And have always been struck by the wisdom of what he has written about
the benefits of revolution every 20 years or so. So, while I don't anticipate a revolution per se at Danaher, I do think a
fresh look, a free swing will be of value to the company. That said, this decision is hard on the heart. I love this job and
more importantly, the people with whom I get to work every day. I will miss them greatly.
So, many of you have asked, so what am I going to do? Well, after this call, I'm going to go back to work. We have a
lot going on and there's much I want to do before next March. Plus, Tom, the rest of the team and I will be working
closely to effect a smooth Danaher class transition.
In time, I'm looking forward to spending more time in some areas of real interest to me, particularly education and
perhaps even teaching. I'm also keen to do some things with my family that the 24/7 nature of this job can make
difficult. And I'm hopeful that I will be able to bend the rod more regularly than I have in recent years.
But goodbyes are a long way off today. So let me stop there and hand it over to our chairman, Steve Rales for a few
comments before we discuss the details of the first quarter.

Steven M. Rales
Thank you, Larry. And good morning everyone. I'd like to begin by saying that the board fully endorses everything that
Larry has just said. He has done an outstanding job for this company for 24 years and in particular as CEO during the
past 13 years. As most of you know, we will be sorry to see Larry eventually move on. But we respect his personal
decision and are fully confident we will have a smooth transition, just as we did with our two previous CEO transitions.
As all of us well know, Larry has been instrumental in driving Danaher success. Just a few highlights. Revenues on his
watch have grown from about $4 billion to nearly $20 billion, while our market cap has grown from under $10 billion
to more than $50 billion. Shareholder returns are five times that of the S&P 500 Index since Larry took the reins.
Our annual revenue in high growth markets has increased tenfold from less than $500 million to now $5 billion. And
free cash flow has exceeded net income every year of his tenure. At the same time, Larry has played a central role in
expanding the Danaher Business System and in building Danaher into a science and technology company. He has also
developed a deep and talented management team that is ready to take on new challenges.
Larry is the first to acknowledge that there's always more work to be done. But meantime, the board and management
recognize his many achievements and we thank him for his remarkable work. Fortunately, Danaher has a history of
developing strong managers and Tom Joyce is ready to become our next CEO.
Tom has spent 25 years at Danaher and at 53 still has plenty of runway ahead of him. He has succeeded throughout his
career and challenging assignments in all parts of Danaher. Tom is a superb strategic thinker, with strong operating and
people skills, he is currently responsible for our Water Quality, Life Sciences & Diagnostics platforms which
collectively represent $9 billion of annual revenues.
He helped shape the current portfolio with the acquisition and integration of many of Danaher's leading brands
including Beckman Coulter, AB SCIEX and ChemTreat. He is also a seasoned teacher and practitioner of DBS and has
played a key role in enhancing many of the tools and metrics upon which DBS is built.
All of us have great confidence in Tom's ability to lead Danaher, to execute on our strategic priorities and in turn, with
the supporting cast of 65,000 plus associates create significant value for our shareholders.
Now, let me turn the call back to Larry to talk about earnings.
H. Lawrence Culp
Happily so, Steve, thank you. We're off to a good start in 2014, as our team's execution, a function of our commitment
to the Danaher Business System, drove better than expected topline growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid
earnings performance in the quarter.
We saw a positive impact to DBS across our portfolio where the acceleration of new product introductions and
go-to-market initiatives helped drive mid single-digit growth or better at a broad range of our operating companies,
including Hach, Gilbarco, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct, Videojet and Esko. This strong growth coupled
with our solid cost management by the team led to core operating margin improvement of more than 125 basis points in
four of our five segments.
So with that as a backdrop, let's move to the details of the quarter. This morning we reported adjusted diluted net
earnings per share of $0.81, up 8% and representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Revenues for the quarter
grew 5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 3.5%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%,
which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 50 basis points. Despite the headlines, high-growth
markets remained strong increasing at a high single-digit rate. China grew approximately 10% led by our Water
Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental platforms. Latin America and the Middle East both grew at a
double-digit rate, and India was up high single-digits.

The developed markets grew at a low single-digit rate as both the U.S. and Europe grew low single-digits. This marked
the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Europe. Japan sales increased at a double-digit rate. Gross margin
increased 30 basis points to 52.6%. Our gross margin expansion along with the productivity and efficiency initiatives
made in 2013 has allowed us to grow our investments in R&D and sales and marketing.
Core operating margin expanded 100 basis points with reported operating margin at 16.9%. On the capital allocation
front, M&A remained our primary focus. And in the first quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million on five
bolt-on acquisitions, to further strengthen our competitive positions within our Test & Measurement and Environmental
segments. We also increased our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share in February. With a healthy
balance sheet and robust acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to deploy more than $8 billion in M&A
capacity.
Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 1%. Core
operating margin expanded 125 basis points and reported operating margin increased 20 basis points to 22.1%. Core
revenues in our Instruments platform grew low single-digits. Fluke core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate for
the second quarter in a row led by demand for industrial test products in China and Europe and calibration products
globally.
Next month we are launching Fluke Connect, a collection of 20 Fluke tools that wirelessly connect to a smartphone
app, allowing maintenance technicians to capture, store and share data on mobile devices and in the cloud. Using data
captured and our analytical software, technicians will now be able to quickly and proactively address problems with
critical equipment before it fails.
Fluke also closed on the acquisition of Unfors RaySafe, a global leader in testing devices, software and systems for
diagnostic imaging equipment. Unfors complements Fluke's existing offering of biomedical testing products.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly, as solid growth in Latin America and the Middle East was more than
offset by weakness in U.S. military and government verticals. Core revenues from our communications platform grew
low single-digits, as strong demand for mobile network monitoring and enterprise network analysis tools was partially
offset by weakness in network security.
At Fluke Networks, we introduced a LinkSprinter network tester and cloud service, a pocket-sized tool that allows
network specialists to view email, store and analyze their test results on smartphones or in the cloud. Revenues from
new products such as the LinkSprinter have increased 20% from the comparable amount in 2013 and now represent
nearly a quarter of Fluke Networks total sales.
Our products are evolving to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunity made possible by today's computing
and communications technologies. Both Fluke Connect and Fluke Networks' LinkSprinter launches are examples of
that shift and provide our customers with the ability to not only perform complex testing, but to access, analyze and act
on critical information in real time.
Moving over to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin
expanded 145 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 30 basis points to 18.9%. Our Water Quality
platforms' core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate, led by a double-digit increase in the high-growth markets.
Hach had another strong quarter led by double-digit growth in service and healthy municipal demand in Europe. During
the quarter, Hach expanded its product line with the acquisition of BioTector, a global provider of online TOC or Total
Organic Carbon analyzers that monitor water quality and help reduce waste primarily in the petrochemical and food
and beverage industries.
At Trojan, we received IMO Type Approval for our full suite of UV Ballast Water Treatment products in early March.
With this approval our team can now seize the opportunity to help customers who have been waiting for an IMO
approved ballast water solution. Importantly, our testing was performed at a U.S. certified lab, which will provide us
with an advantage as we seek U.S. Type Approval in the next stage of the regulatory process. We believe Trojan's low
energy requirements, small footprint and ease-of-use differentiate our solution and position us to capitalize on this

tremendous opportunity.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues increased mid single-digits led by point-of-sale and payment solutions globally,
and strong dispenser demand in Western Europe and China. Our comprehensive products continues to differentiate us
in the marketplace. And GVR was recently voted the best POS System and Fuel Dispenser Manufacturer by The
Petroleum Marketers Association of America.
In Life Sciences & Diagnostics revenues grew 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis
points and reported operating margin was up 50 basis points to 13.2%. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform grew
at a low-single digit rate.
At Beckman Coulter, core sales were up low single-digits led by healthy demand in the high growth markets.
Beckmann continues to strengthen its competitive position with first-quarter wins in North America exceeding those
made during all of 2013. This marks Beckmann's best quarter since the acquisition in expanding its install base. We
also achieved an important milestone on the regulatory front receiving closure of the last two FDA warning letters at
our Chaska and Miami facilities.
Earlier this month Beckmann expanded its world-class automation capabilities with the introduction of the UniCel DxH
Connected Workcell. The scalable workflow management solution enables our hematology lab customers to connect up
to three analyzers to a Slidemaker Stainer increasing efficiency and reducing turnaround time for each critical test.
Radiometer's core sales increased high single-digits, as we continue to benefit from our growing install base of acute
care instruments. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better for Radiometer.
Demand was strong across all platforms with core blood gas sales up high single-digits. High-growth markets remained
robust led by China and the Middle East, each of which grew over 20%.
Sales at Leica Biosystems were up mid single-digits led by mid-teens growth in advanced staining and digital
pathology. Core Histology revenues decreased mid single-digits in part due to a large project shipment in the
prior-year.
During the quarter we received FDA clearance for the Leica Bond Oracle HER2 IHC System on the Leica
BOND-MAX. This HER2 test is used to help determine the appropriate treatment for breast cancer and in combination
with the speed and efficiency of the BOND-MAX provides patients with quicker access to important test results and
treatment plans.
Our Life Sciences platform had a good start to the year. Core sales increased mid single-digits with all major
geographies contributing to the growth. AB SCIEX core sales grew high single-digits as strength in the clinical and
academic markets drove double-digit growth.
Earlier this month we expanded the capabilities of our mass spec offerings in clinical settings with the release of a
newborn screening assay for use on the 3200MD IVD system in Europe. This essay allows labs to detect metabolic
disorders in newborns more accurately and more efficiently than traditional diagnostic tests. In our Separations
business we launched the CESI-MS, which helps our customers more accurately predict the efficacy and reduce the
time to market for pharmaceuticals.
Leica Microsystems core sales were up mid single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Geographically,
high-growth markets grew double-digits with sales in Japan up more than 20%.
Dental had an outstanding start to 2014 as the investments we've been making in new product development helped
drive excellent top-line and operating margin performance. Reported and core revenues grew 6% representing the
segment's best quarterly performance in three years. Both core and reported operating margin increased 170 basis
points to 14.8%.
At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Meeting in February we were excited to announce the formation of the KaVo Kerr
Group, which strategically unites our leading dental consumables, equipment, high-tech and specialty brands under one
global platform. Together our brands have the scale they need to better drive innovation, improved clinical outcomes

and simplify workflows. Both customer and end-user reception since the launch has been very positive.
Dental consumables' core revenues grew mid single-digits with broad-based demand across all major geographies.
Orthodontics, professional consumables and implant revenues all grew mid single-digits or better.
During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill dental composite system in China and Japan further expanding the
product's global application. SonicFill is the only solution that enables clinicians to perform cavity restorations in
posterior teeth with an easy-to-use single step sonic activated hand piece. SonicFill has already been a tremendous
success around the world with more than 4 million shipped worldwide since the initial launch in the middle of 2011.
Dental Technology's core revenues also increased mid single-digits with solid demand for our suite of imaging
products. At the Chicago Midwinter show we launched more than 20 new products including the DEXIS peer-review a
portable imager that pairs with our software and uses illumination technology to better assist doctors in identifying
lesions and cracks in teeth.
Finally in industrial technologies, revenues grew 4.5% with core revenues up 3%. Core operating margin expanded to
185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.5%.
Motion platform core revenues improved sequentially from the fourth quarter, but still declined at a low single-digit
rate. Strong sales in North American distribution were more than offset by a weak defense market and the impact of
exiting certain lower margin product lines. We expect to complete that transition in the second quarter.
We remain really pleased with the team's execution on operating margins which increased more than 200 basis points
from the prior-year. Our Products Identification platform core revenues were up mid single-digits with growth across
most major geographies. Videojet's growth was balanced with mid single-digit growth in both consumables and
equipment. During the quarter, Videojet launched the 8610 thermal inkjet printer, the world's first TIJ printer
specifically designed for fast drying inks enabling customers to print high-resolution codes on non-core surfaces four
times faster than other inkjet technologies.
At Esko our suite of packing management and design software grew double-digits as the need for more efficient
solutions across packaging workload continues to build. Esko remains the workflow management software provider of
choice for brand owners with sales increasing more than 30% in this market.
So to wrap up, we're off to a very good start in 2014 as our team's execution drove better-than-expected revenue
growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance.
The Danaher Business System has helped build momentum across the portfolio by driving continued share gains and
funding increased growth investments. We believe this momentum along with our robust balance sheet and confidence
on the acquisition front position us well in 2014.
We are initiating second quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which assumes core growth
comparable to the first quarter. We're also reaffirming our full-year 2014 diluted net earnings per share guidance of
$3.60 to $3.75.

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Congrats, Larry, on a great run. Also just having the guts to make this decision. I mean a lot of
guys would sit around and milk this job for a while and obviously you're not doing that, so congrats.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: With the change being 12 months out, how do you avoid 12 months of inertia here? And how
are you guys going to think about deals, and how does this change? It would be kind of awkward, I think, to announce a
substantial deal and then pass it on to Tom at this juncture, but is that the wrong way to think about it?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Scott, I understand the concern, but I think that's the last way we would think about it. Tom
and I have worked together for 25 years. We have been full partners for over a decade. So, I think that on the M&A
front, Tom begins to be more a part of that conversation as we think about identifying, cultivating, pursuing targets. We
wouldn't change anything at this point that Tom wasn't fully bought into. But we do not slow down here at all in terms
of what we want to do from an M&A perspective. I think that we've got the time here to affect operationally and
organizationally a very smooth transition. And I'm exceptionally confident that Tom, Dan and the rest of the team and I
are going to be able to work together, as we always have, over these next several months during transition. Tom will, of
course, be spending time with businesses that he doesn't know as well, getting up to speed on some of the CEO duties
that will be his come March, but from an M&A perspective, I think, it's very much business as usual.
And you go back to my first year as CEO, I'll never forget my first Danaher Leadership Conference where we
announced three deals that week. So there's I think precedence and confidence to suggest here that the transition in no
way will dilute or impede our activity on the M&A front.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Fair point. And I don't know if Steve Rales is still there available for questions. If he is,
I'd love to ask him one, if he's available.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: He's here, Steve. He's here Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Great. Steve, I guess my question for you is when Larry took over, as you said, it was a
$4 billion revenue company. Now it's a $20 billion company, substantially more complicated, and the quality is
definitely a lot higher for sure. But how does the mandate for Tom change? He's filling the seats of a guy who just had
a five-bagger in market cap in 13 years. It's a pretty tough shoes to fill. How does a mandate for Tom change? How
does the board think about how this company goes from $50 billion of market cap to something that is acceptable for
shareholders in that same timeframe?
<A - Steven M. Rales>: Thank you, Scott. I think the conversations about longer-term strategy and capital allocation
are regular subjects for the board, and this is a board that's not unfamiliar with either of those. We'll examine the market
as we always do, have lengthy conversations with Larry, Tom, Dan and the rest of the team, and we'll continue to
evaluate opportunities, as we have for the last 25 or 30 years. We think it's an exciting runway ahead. We've never been
in a better position from a balance sheet standpoint, and I think there are plenty of opportunities that will be very
exciting, and I expect shareholders at the end of the day will be winners as a result.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Fair point. Thanks, Steve. Congrats, Larry, and good luck to Tom. I'll pass it on.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks a lot.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Congrats, Larry. I echo Scott's comments.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you very much.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: How are you guys looking at the macro environment? And maybe if you could just talk about
specifically what's going on in China and in Europe?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. I think that we were pretty pleased from a geographic perspective with the way things
played out. Just maybe a word on the U.S., we saw, like a number of companies, a slow start to the year, particularly in
businesses where getting out every day is important, whether that be at Beckman on the diagnostic side all the way to
Matco. But we really were encouraged by the building strength during the quarter and the way we exited the first
quarter and even the way we've begun April here.
Europe, third quarter in a row being positive, admittedly it's up low single-digits. But that too has been encouraging just
given the history. Our European Leadership Conference was held just two weeks ago, and the mood there, Steve, was
as buoyant as it's been in several years. So we're optimistic there, particularly with respect to Life Sciences, the dental
side of things, and PID are all well positioned in Europe.
China, clearly a lot of headline concerns there, but we're pretty pleased to see double-digit first quarter with a bit better
balance between our Healthcare businesses, which as you know the last few years have really led the way, dental was
up over 20%, LS&D up about 10% with the Industrial businesses also doing better, particularly in the environmental
realm. So we're going to watch China carefully, some of the other high-growth markets. That's why we said back in
December, we thought the gap between the high-growth markets and the developing markets might narrow a bit. That
played out for us here in the first three months, but still very much high-growth markets in the pole position. So we like
what we saw broadly around the world in the first quarter.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: And you said April was how good, has kind of April started, and are you kind of assuming that
falls off here in the second half in your kind of consistent guidance for the second quarter? Is there a comp issue in the
second quarter?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No, I.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: With the similar organic?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No, I think we're really talking about a comparable core in the second quarter, mindful that
it's still relatively early in the year. Obviously a host of concerns out there in terms of the macro scene. I think if we
look at the way the first quarter played out, we knew we were hurt by one less selling day, particularly in Consumables.
We were probably helped a little bit given the Japanese tax dynamics. I suspect that they wash. And while we were
thrilled with how strong Dental, Hach, Videojet, Life Sciences were relative to expectations, we did have a choppy start
in T&M particularly in comps, and that's a space that both with some of the mobile carriers and with some of our larger
enterprise customers we want to watch carefully. So, I think comparable to the 3.5% we rung up here in the first quarter
feels about right, but we really like the exit rate in March, and while it's just a couple of weeks are encouraged by the
start here in April.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: And then one last question. Larry, I know you're probably – this is probably a dumb question.
But I guess in your mindset are you still of the mind, or you spent some time with your family. Do we take this to mean
you're kind of done with the large public company gig? I mean are you going to take and are you kind of retiring? I
mean politics? Have you thought about kind of what the next step is at all? I mean should we be surprised to see you
resurface at another public company in a few years? Or it's probably like a tough question to answer obviously at this
stage.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: But thanks for asking it. Steve, I'm very fortunate given the great run that we've had for a
long time here. There probably hasn't been a large public job that hasn't been floated my way in the last six, seven
years. But you see where I am. This is a great job. Tom is a lucky guy to have that opportunity here in a while. My

We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Hate to sound repetitive, but congratulations, Larry. And if you do
decide on politics, I think, the government could use some DBS methodology. So just think about that.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So it sounds like March was stronger than January and February. It doesn't feel like the weather had
a big impact on your organic performance. So, I'm wondering the impact on Consumables versus Equipments and
whether that dynamic had any impact on your margin performance during the quarter and how that maybe should go by
segments?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure, Nigel. This is Dan. Good morning. Consumables were up 4% during the quarter, which
has been pretty consistent, maybe 50 basis points lighter than what we saw in the second half of last year. I think you
could really explain that entirely by the one less selling day. I think what was really encouraging during the quarter was
the Equipment side. We were up 3.5%. That is the best number we've posted in a number of quarters. We saw balance,
stability. It was the first, as Larry alluded to, better breadth in China. This was the first quarter in a long time that all
five segments were up in China. Healthcare was up more than Industrial, but again seeing some footing there. We were
up 100 basis points in terms of core margin expansion, so good improvements there. Do we make a little bit more
money on Consumables than Equipment? We do, but it didn't really seem to impact margins at all during the quarter.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's good. And then just coming back to the – there's obviously a pretty healthy debate on
capital deployment. PE seems to be pretty active pushing up multiples to some pretty high levels. A lot of public
companies are out there saying they want to do more M&A. I'm just wondering, is the environment tougher to deploy
capital? And then maybe to throw into that as well, what is the message on dividends? You obviously increased that
fourfold during the quarter. Still a lot below in terms of payouts, but what is the message on dividends?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Nigel, let me speak to M&A and maybe Dan will talk a bit to dividends. I think from and
M&A perspective, there's no question that the environment, given valuations, first in the public markets and the
spillover effect in the private markets, has been more challenging the last couple of years. I think we've acknowledged
that. But fortunately given the breadth of our portfolio and the inventory of markets we have an interest in, we don't
have to buy market indices, right. All we're really looking to do is identify and invest in discrete companies, which we
think are great fits with the Danaher portfolio. And it's really from that perspective that we are out talking to a lot of
people really across the entire corporation about opportunities that we think would be glove-fits for Danaher and for
DBS.
So different environments are challenging in different ways. I don't think today that we see private equity even with
their resources being a primary competitor for us. It continues to be rare for us to see PE as the competition around an
asset set that we might covet. Clearly, the last several months have had some situations where we've been mentioned in
combination with private equity, but largely around assets where our interest was partial, not full. When we have strong
interest in an asset in its entirety, I think we have great confidence in our ability to carry the day. Dan?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, on the dividend, despite the increase, we know it's still relatively modest. At $0.40, a
share would represent about 10% of our free cash flow per year. So we're not trying to signal anything there. The strong

We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Larry, the accolades could go on all year. I'll just echo
them, we will miss you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Very good luck. I just wanted to come back again and maybe approach M&A, again, through a
question to Steve Rales, if he is still there and will take another one. Steve, you have kind of a unique position with
your involvement with Colfax also, obviously. And they do seem to be able to get stuff done over there. And I guess it
does beg the question, is it simply a law of large numbers dynamic that has come to bear as it relates to Danaher? Is
there a need potentially to reevaluate the portfolio or think of a new leg to open up another vector for capital
deployment? Do you think a question of size really has crept into the ability to perpetuate the business model?
<A - Steven M. Rales>: Thank you, Jeff. First, let me say, yes, I am a shareholder of Colfax Corporation, full stop.
Second, going back to what we talked about earlier, our board has a very long view, and our objective is to continue to
find a way along with management to make our businesses better and add values for shareholders. It's an evolving
process. It's an ambulatory process. We're constantly looking at M&A. There's a certain lucidity, if you will, to the law
of large numbers. But we think more about opportunity and making our businesses better. But, truthfully, Larry and
Dan do a very nice job of communicating the company's view on M&A. So, I would defer it to either of them on your
question.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jeff, I would just add that we really don't think being a $20 billion revenue base company, a
$50 billion market cap in any way gets in the way in terms of doing M&A. I think it's just the opposite. At every step
along the way, as we've gotten bigger and in turn stronger, we've had more degrees of freedom. We've had more
latitude, more capacity to do the things that we think really build an outstanding company over time, witness Beckman
Coulter.
If you look at the way we've run M&A on a daily basis, it really starts with all nine of the strategic platforms, which
would be great mid-cap companies all by themselves if they were standalone entities. And it's really that family of
mid-cap companies working their market funnels around competitors, distribution, technology, bolt-ons that may be of
interest in addition to the adjacencies, which give us the bulk of our flow around the smaller transactions that you see.
The team here in Washington, which I think is outstanding, is really the group that targets the new spaces, the larger
situations, which naturally are going to be less frequent and at times more meaningful just in terms of the sheer amount
of capital deployed. So, I don't think that while we have great respect for Steve and the team at Colfax, we don't really
think that there are lessons there that will help us deploy the next $8 billion-plus in capital we intend as we build out
our company.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Fair enough. Just a quick one for Dan, if I could. You did get a number of small deals done
apparently in the first quarter. Can you give us an idea of how many transactions were in there and what the average
valuation was?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, we closed five acquisitions in the quarter, which was an increase, and we are seeing
actually an increase around small deals, which hopefully portend will be a positive sign about potentially getting
something bigger done. We spent about $160 million, so relatively modest. Some of those are businesses that are
relatively low margin today but it will come in as bolt-ons or create opportunities on the margin side. So those are all

We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks. Good morning. And obviously I will echo that congratulations, Larry. Fantastic.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: So, hey, since you are a student of Thomas Jefferson, I can't help but recite one of his
quotes, right; "Delay is preferable to error." on the capital deployment side. You didn't say that second part, but it's a
great quote, and I understand that's sort of how you're thinking about it. Is that $8 billion still the right number I should
be thinking about?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, it's Dan. I mean, clearly, if you looked at the balance sheet, the breadth of our – and
quantity of our free cash flow, you could pencil out a larger number. I think until we obviously get some deals done of
size, I think we'll stick with the $8 billion.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And Dan, while I've got you, since we are in this period where M&A is a lot
smaller in terms of our viewing the portfolio right now, where can ROIC go, I mean, just assuming that there is a
continued delay for a little bit of time? And how do you see ROIC kind of playing out in that event?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, you've been seeing at 50 basis point to 100 basis point increase in annual ROIC given
that we've had fewer acquisitions, I would be happy to see that stop for a little bit as we bring in some larger ones, but
no. I mean, I think if you look at Q1, I think, representative of last year, up 3.5% core growth and earnings up 8%, we
are getting I think good relative performance on the top line and good margin expansion along with it. And that's
obviously increasing our overall returns.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And sorry if I could add just one more just on the mundane earnings side, the
dental strength that you guys had was a surprise to me anyway. What do you really attribute that to? Is it sort of
products, market? Can you identify kind of that? And give us a sense for the sustainability? Or you just think it's sort of
a lumpy demand and we just happen to see it spike this quarter?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, I think if you look both at the consumables versus technologies divide as well as the
look around the world, the strength was very broad based. I don't think they continue at that rate. We did get a little bit
of help in Japan given the VAT increase. But we've long said dental is a mid-single digit grower, strong imaging in
digital franchises and technologies. And while there are rarely home run products in consumables, we had a wonderful
wave of products launched at Midwinter. The team continues to execute better both in the U.S. and in Europe, while
China clearly is a concern for a lot of folks, our dental business continues to do very well there. So, again I think we've
probably come down a little bit from what we saw in the first quarter, but dental ought to continue to be a contributor
for us as we go through the year.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: You bet, Steve. Thank you.

journey, but we'll have you around for a while.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, you mentioned speaking of being around for a while, you mentioned wanting to
get some things done before you leave. I mean, are there any sort of big things on that checklist that you think you want
to make sure you get done before you hand it off?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I'd like to write a few more checks before I go.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. So it's mainly M&A focused? Anything other than that sort of internal initiatives
or other things that you feel like you want to bring to closure or no?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think a lot of our internal initiatives around the high-growth markets, around what
we're doing in terms of taking full advantage of the web, what we're doing increasingly at a platform and regional level,
is work that we won't finish when Tom hands the baton off. But this is work that Tom and I and the rest of the team
have been engaged in together for some time. Tom and I will be dividing and conquering over the next year, and that's
where I've been focused and would expect to continue to be focused. Clearly getting the team ready as well, as they
assume new and additional responsibilities, will be part of where I'll be focused, but also just making sure that Tom is
ready. I can vouch now from experience that this is one of the more meaningful transitions that you have as an
operating leader. Tom is more than capable, but we want to make sure he is just tuned all the way up come March 1 to
be ready to go, as I know he will be.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks. And then you've seen some of these other encouraging trends across the
businesses. Where do you think the tech instruments business is at this point? I mean, you had some of this military
government pressure, that's one vertical, but maybe talk across the others? And where do you think that is? And what's
it going to take to get it going?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think that we will take the stability that we are seeing in some of the larger tech
verticals, like computers, communications and semi and the like. The broader distribution business actually has been
decent, but again because of the military government dynamics particularly in the U.S. here at the start of the year,
which we saw, and I know some competitors have spoken to, puts us in that flattish zone. We'd like to think we see a
little bit of an uptick from there, but don't anticipate necessarily a pronounced spring back at Tektronix through 2014,
but gradual improvement.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.

We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Congratulations. I just had a quick question, a broader one on Test & Measurement
really. If you look at the organic growth in that segment the last 10 quarters, it's about 0.5% or less. I just wondered if
there was something with the portfolio you thought needed some major work in T&M, or it's just the function of
sluggish macro and that kind of thing?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Julian, thank you. Relative to your question, I think you really have to look at the segment
in two halves. The communication platform has really been a nice performer for us, particularly around these mobile
network build out that we have been a large part of. We think that opportunity and that challenge just to keep up with

the explosion in bandwidth demand that we're all generating will be with us for a while. Soft start to the year in
network security, but as you know the last couple years that's been a strong performer for us, and we're optimistic that it
will return to that type of performance as we go through the year.
But on the instrument side, Fluke has had a tough go of it, particularly in places like China where the slowdown in the
industrial sector has been particularly pronounced. At Tektronix, we just spoke to that a moment ago with Shannon. I
think those dynamics are well known, but we're encouraged by Fluke here putting up another quarter of positive
growth. We really like these new products that are coming out and in a review just last week with the commercial team,
I really liked what I saw in terms of the launch plans for the second quarter and the second half. So while Fluke is
unlikely to be a high single-digit grower for us any time soon, we think we get Fluke back here to a more normal,
low-to-mid, single-digit range as we go through the course of the year, and while Tek will be challenged we'll build on
that stability and hopefully get them back to growth as we go through the year.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thanks. And then Life Sciences, the last couple of years, each year you had
margin expansion of about 150 bps each year. Q1 was up I think 50 bps, the Life Sciences margin. Is that kind of the
run rate going forward just because I guess most of the Beckman savings have now been squeezed out?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Julian, this is Dan. Core margins were up about 75 basis points in the first quarter. So there
was a little bit of acquisition noise. Life Science was stronger than Diagnostics. And again, I think Diagnostics, their
shipments were up low single-digits that was we believe largely impacted by one less day. If you look at their orders,
they were up mid single-digits. I think that's encouraging. That creates a little bit of a negative mix just because an
incremental sales of consumables is at a higher margin. So I think you'll see continued very good margin performance
and expansion in this segment.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks, Dan. And then lastly on the CapEx, I think you talked before about low to mid
single-digit CapEx increase this year. Q1 was up a lot more than that. Have you changed the full-year view at all or it's
just a timing thing in Q1?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, it's coming up in part because of increased placements at Beckman because of our
leasing model that shows up in CapEx. So some of the increase in CapEx is less traditional PP&E, is actually
expanding our installed-base at Beckman, which is obviously a good sign for the business.

Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question today from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Brandon.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Larry, could you elaborate on what you saw from an order perspective at Beckman,
understanding weather and one less selling day were headwinds, but given your comments about win rates in the U.S.
when do you think we see that translate into a core revenue inflection in the Beckman diagnostics unit?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think that we do a bit better from a bookings perspective. And again, better in bookings
than we did in shipments. The trend through the quarter was positive for us in that regard, primarily with consumables.
But that North American equipment comment that we made, we think it's significant because it's really the culmination
of so much of the work the team has done the last several years. As you know, it will take a while to get those orders
converted into new boxes on the lab floor and in turn, see that consumable stream. But we think that as we move
forward sequentially through the course of the year that we will see a pickup as a result of those increased wins here in
North America, not unlike what we're seeing already in terms of some early benefit from the return of troponin through

progress, and then we can build on the prints through the course of 2014.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks, Larry. Just one for Dan, operating cash flow is a little soft even excluding the
discrete factors from last year. What is your operating cash flow outlook for the year, and how quickly would you
expect the timing dynamics from the first quarter to normalize?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think you'll see an improvement here in Q2, as Larry alluded to, given the stronger
shipments in March relative to the first two months that hurt us a little bit from a timing perspective on CapEx, but I
think that will shortly reverse itself.
