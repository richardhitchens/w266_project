MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE's Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you will find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, VP President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms.
Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current
expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and
10-Q.
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues
for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations,
discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a
significant portion of NIKE, Incorporated's continuing operations, include equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and
Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market
footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Incorporated and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual
results. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP
financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable
GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.

I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter for NIKE. Even in the face of challenging
macroeconomic conditions, we delivered robust growth and we did so in a well-balanced way across our entire
portfolio. By the numbers, here are the highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% to $7 billion. Gross margins
increased 30 basis points to 44.5%. SG&A rose 16%, reflecting strategic investments in our brands and operations. And
despite currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.76.
We delivered these results because of the breadth and depth of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio. For a company that does
business in more than 190 countries, volatility is a fact of life. While NIKE, Inc.'s global reach increases the complexity
of our business, it also presents us with the opportunity to leverage strength in certain areas while we continue to invest
in others.
Because our portfolio includes a diverse set of categories, geographies, products, brands and distribution channels, we
are best positioned to match through an ever-changing macro environment.
Our deep connection with the consumers ensures we focus our innovation on products and services that consumers
expect and also on those that they never thought possible, and our commitment to operational excellence, and our
supply chain and financial management and in our resource allocation, ensures we remain laser focused on driving
profitable sustainable growth.
While we're not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we certainly have a management team that knows the
terrain and can effectively drive growth in various conditions. And that is why I am so confident in NIKE's ability to
create shareholder value.
While the NIKE portfolio is diverse, there is a common theme. It's powered by innovation. We don't innovate just for
the sake of change. We do it with a clear purpose and that's to help athletes reach their full potential.
The breakthrough performance products we develop with insights from the world's best athletes become the must have
performance in sportswear products for consumers. And global sports moments continue to present the perfect
opportunity for us to showcase our innovation. When the world's greatest athletes compete on a global stage, we're
inspired to create some of our most exciting and game changing products and we can connect our brand to consumers
when the world is watching.
I want to highlight three examples from Q3. First, for the Super Bowl in New York, we launched an array of innovative
footwear and apparel for the NFL's biggest moment. In footwear we debuted the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat designed for
speed and quick cuts. As part of our long-term commitment to take advantage of the most advanced manufacturing
processes, we leveraged NIKE's state-of-the-art 3D printing capabilities to inspire this revolutionary new cleat, which
we put on the field in record time for football's ultimate game.

As we do with all of our innovations, we plan to expand the transformative benefits of 3D printing across multiple
areas of our business. In apparel, we launched the Silver Speed collection of on field, sideline, training and sportswear
products including the Aeroloft Summit Jacket which is constructed to be lightweight and breathable. Worn by players
on the sidelines, the jacket made a great statement of brand innovation in a game that was seen by over 110 million
viewers. And for the fans, we updated the NIKE NFL Limited Jersey combine on-field innovation with premium style
to give consumers an authentic way to express their love of the game.
Next, the Winter Olympics, which featured incredible displays of athleticism and accomplishment. NIKE was on the
ice as both Canadian men's and women's hockey teams took gold wearing our lightweight game jersey. The jersey
leveraged innovations from across our categories including NIKE Flywire, a technology originally developed for
basketball footwear. The Olympic hockey jersey provides another example of how we take innovations developed for
one category and share them not only across categories but also across product types.
The U.S. Team medal stand apparel featured our Aeroloft 800 Summit Jacket. So it was a privilege to be there when
U.S. athletes like snowboarder, Sage Kotsenburg, who won gold in slopestyle celebrated their greatest achievements in
front of a global audience. In the Olympic Village, and at the many sport venues, NIKE athletes also wore our Tech
Fleece with its technical performance elements to provide lightweight warmth. Both Tech Fleece and the Aeroloft
Summit Jacket quickly become go-to apparel items for consumers.
And then of course in the run up to World Cup, you've seen us launch an impressive collection of cutting edge football
products. The Hypervenom boot with the NIKE skin mesh upper that provides an amazing level of ball feel. The
Hi-Vis boot designed to help footballers see teammates quickly and make critical plays. Ten new national team kits
featuring NIKE Dri-FIT technology for better cooling and our lightest NIKE Pro base layer ever. And the Tiempo
Legend V with NIKE hypershield technology to give this leather boot incredible all-weather performance.
And just two weeks ago, Trevor and I were in Barcelona to introduce a new standard in performance football boots, the
Magista. With a radical new silhouette, the boot is designed to enhance player fit, touch and traction for a game that has
become faster and more intense. The Magista was a result of four years of work in our sports research lab incorporating
insights from the world's best football athletes including Barcelona's Andrés Iniesta and Paris Saint-Germain Thiago
Silva.
This is the first football boot to utilize NIKE Flyknit technology, something many thought impossible. We didn't set out
to invent a Flyknit football boot but we listened to our athletes and harnessed Flyknit's power to re-imagine what a
football boot could be. We've used Flyknit to revolutionize running and basketball and now we've done the same with
football, which is exactly what you'd expect from NIKE.
When it comes to innovation, we pride ourselves on being the pacesetter. We get out in front and we stay on the
offense. The World Cup is now just a few months away and you can expect even more excitement leading up to the
opening match in São Paulo.
The products we've launched so far take the game of football to a new level. And before the first whistle in Brazil, we
will have more amazing products to come. Football is the biggest sport in the world and NIKE is the leader in
innovation for athletes. That's a combination that drives us to deliver bolder innovations for the World Cup than we've
ever done before. So stay tuned.
Now these are just a few of the innovations that represent who we are as a company and they demonstrate our
commitment to athletes and how we drive growth across our portfolio of businesses. And because we're NIKE, we just
don't innovate for the present, we innovate for the future.
The steps we're taking with digital, Flyknit and 3D printing technologies and with new materials and methods of
manufacturing, are driving us to improve performance and achieve new levels of sustainability. When I consider these
steps, it's clear to me that NIKE has more capacity to innovate in more dramatic ways than ever before.
The opportunities are truly unlimited but our resources are not. As a result, we are relentless editors because innovation
isn't about just doing more, it's about doing things better. It's about staying sharply focused on the opportunities that

have the highest potential for growth and that's how we unlock our true potential. There is never an off-season for
NIKE. We will continue to leverage the power of our portfolio and the power of innovation to connect with our
consumers and create long-term shareholder value.
So thanks, everyone, and now here's Trevor to discuss the NIKE brand.
Trevor A. Edwards
Thank you, Mark. The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter. As our innovative products, compelling consumer
connections and effective marketplace management continued to drive growth. On a constant currency basis, NIKE
Brand global revenue increased 14% with growth across all geographies and key categories including double digit
growth in our largest categories of sportswear, running and basketball.
NIKE Brand DTC grew 23% driven by 10% comp store growth and an impressive 57% growth in online sales as our
digital investments and sharper merchandising increased traffic, conversion and average order on nike.com. And
finally, global futures grew a robust 14%. These strong results are driven as always by our relentless focus on the
consumer. Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting edge products, engaging consumer experiences and a
powerful retail presentation. NIKE's ability to deliver on all three strengthens our position as the brand of choice with
consumers and builds our business around the world.
To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at running. Running is our heritage and our largest performance
category but as we like to say at NIKE, there is no finish line. That is certainly true of the running business, which
continued to deliver strong results with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in Q3.
That growth is fueled by our steadfast focus on bringing innovation to the market. In running footwear, we expanded
our breakthrough Flyknit platform. The new Flyknit Air Max combines Flyknit with an improved Max Air to create
lightweight, well-cushioned running shoe. Also resonating with consumers is the resilient, ultra-light Flyknit Lunar2
with its supportive Lunarlon cushioning. And in running apparel, which is also fueling growth in the category, we
continue to gain share with our new Dri-FIT Knit products. The running shirts with their softer, high-stretch knit are
best sellers in the market.
We also drive growth by targeting our resources against the biggest opportunities. A great example of this is women's
running, an important pillar of our women's amplify strategy. That strategy is working, and our Women's business grew
faster than our Men's business again in quarter three. A key element of the strategy is the NIKE training club. This
concept within NIKE stores offers cross-merchandise collections from women's running, training and sportswear, and a
high level of service dedicated to helping our consumer achieve her goals.
We continue to see strong consumer response to this retail concept and expect to have nearly 50 locations globally by
the end of fiscal year 2014. These retail successes, combined with strong wholesale partnerships like the NIKE Track
Club at Finish Line, are growing the running market, not just our share.
The other performance category as Mark discussed is basketball. Both the NIKE and Jordan's brands continue to
deliver the very best in basketball, with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 10th
consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our basketball category, and as the game becomes increasingly global,
this growth story is just getting started.
Our continued success in basketball is the result of creating the game's most cutting edge products. Our lightweight and
breathable Hyper Elite uniforms provide NIKE college teams a new level of performance just in time for March
madness. In Footwear, the power of our innovation engine is on full display with the LEBRON XI, the KD 6, and the
KOBE 9 Elite, which since its launch has sold out at nearly every location as soon as it arrives. And our new Hyper
Elite Fanatical sock have become a popular performance item, which speaks to the opportunity NIKE has in expanding
the market by creating new segments.

These products come to life in retail experiences that express a deep love of the game, serving those who share that
passion. All over the globe, NIKE is driving and growing the basketball market from our own DTC stores to Foot
Locker's House of Hoops.
Likewise, the Jordan brand leads by combining innovation with a unique sense of style that speaks to the legacy of
Michael Jordan. Quarter three included important Jordan milestones. The largest one-day product launch in the brand's
history was the release of the latest Air Jordan 11, and the debut of the exciting new retail concept in partnership with
Footaction we opened the first-ever Jordan only store in New York City called Flight 23. Jordan athletes Earl Thomas
and Carmelo Anthony visited the store at the opening and gave it rave reviews. Consumers agree with the initial results
exceeding expectations.
The final category I want to touch on is sportswear. We often talk about our three-pronged amplify strategy of compete,
train and express. Sportswear represents the express portion of that equation. It is a key element of the product
assortment for our performance categories, and offers consumers premium, sports-inspired products to express their
love of the game. With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and technical innovation in
traditional sportswear styles resulting in the category delivering double-digit growth in Q3.
Let me now turn to a few of our geographies. First, the emerging markets. This diverse portfolio offers significant
growth opportunities today and well into the future. For the quarter, revenue was up 19% and futures were up 24%. So
let's start with a quick update on Mexico. We continue to work with our third-party logistics provider to resolve the
distribution challenges I discussed last quarter.
While we still have work to do, we shipped to demand in Q3. Over the next couple of quarters we will continue to
refine our processes and work to clear any excess inventory. Meanwhile, consumer demand for our products in Mexico
remains strong, and we're working closely with our wholesale partners to properly manage the flow of product into the
marketplace.
Now across the rest of the emerging markets, we saw seven of our nine territories reporting double-digit revenue
growth. As Mark described, this summer, the entire world will see the full power of the brand with game changing
products, compelling retail presentations and inspiring campaigns as we lead up to the World Cup in Brazil. By
amplifying the power of sport, we grow our business in the emerging markets and all around the world.
In North America, our category offense continues to drive growth across every category with Q3 revenues up 12%. The
NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in North America as demonstrated by our 9% futures growth. And last
month, the Super Bowl provided an incredible energy point for the brand.
As Mark mentioned, we drove excitement in the marketplace with innovative products and elevated retail experiences
which included both DTC locations and our wholesale partners such as Field House at Dick's Sporting Goods and also
the Yardline at Champs.
As I said before, NIKE's in the business of making big moments bigger, which is exactly what we did and we couldn't
be happier with the results. In Greater China, revenue grew 7%. Our strategy to reset the marketplace for profitable
long-term growth is working and we are creating more productive retail with focused product assortments that
strengthen our position as the number one performance sport brand. Our results for Q3 reflects progress against that
strategy.
We work with our wholesale partners to better balance supply and demand and we have made changes to the supply
chain that are improving inventory levels in the marketplace. In DTC where we tested and deployed new
merchandising concepts, results remain strong, revenue up 27% with comp growth of 11% and expanding margins.
And our wholesale partners are seeing positive results in their re-profiled doors, which continue to outpace the rest of
the fleet.
We still have work to do in China in our China reset but we feel great about our progress. These efforts are improving
our business today, and importantly, they fit a strong foundation for our long-term profitable growth in China. And we
continue to see tremendous growth opportunity in this key geography.

Lastly, let me turn to the Western Europe where revenue accelerated to 19% and futures were up 30% with reported
EBIT up 54%. Growth was broad-based for both a category and a territory perspective. Revenues in the U.K. and AGS,
which is comprised of Austria, Germany and Switzerland, were up double digits for the second quarter in a row.
From a category perspective, we saw double-digit growth across our largest performance categories, running, football,
basketball and women's training. Notably, sportswear also grew double digits, which amplifies our performance
positioning.
Our DTC operations, which continue to strengthen NIKE's Brand positioning and drive growth, were up 29% driven by
14% comp store growth and a strong growth online. And lastly, EBIT results were also driven by expanding gross
margins reflecting a clean marketplace and a strong sell through of new styles.
The success in Western Europe is no surprise. By restructuring our business two years ago we now work closer with
our wholesale partners to better segment and differentiate the market. Our work to transform the marketplace with our
own DTC locations and key retail partners such as JD Sports and Foot Locker has improved the experience for our
consumers. All told, we strengthened our brand and expanded the potential our business and we're just getting started.
Looking forward, I am confident in what NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we're making with
them. I like where we are, and better yet, I like where we're headed. Thanks. Don?
Donald W. Blair
Thank you, Trevor. As Mark and Trevor both discussed, our Q3 and year-to-date growth was strong and well balanced
driven by expansion across nearly every dimension of our global portfolio. These results were particularly noteworthy
given the stiff currency headwinds we faced in our significant investments in future growth.
It's the strength and diversity of our portfolio spanning multiple brands, categories, geographies, products and channels,
which enables us to consistently deliver growth and manage risk.
As always, our growth is to deliver profitable growth in the near term while continuing to make the investments that
will sustain that growth into the future. Striking this balance puts us in the best position to continue to create
shareholder value over the long-term despite the volatility that's an inherent aspect of a global business.
With that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third-quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 13%. On
a currency neutral basis, both NIKE, Inc. and NIKE Brand revenues increased 14%. This was above our expectations as
strong demand particularly in North America pulled some Q4 futures orders into Q3.
Converse revenues increased 16% on a constant currency basis. Also on a currency neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures
orders increased 14% driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led
by extraordinary growth in the emerging markets in Western Europe as well as double-digit growth in the football,
basketball, and women's training categories.
On a reported basis, futures grew 12% reflecting weaker developing market currencies. Third quarter diluted EPS
increased 4% to $0.76 driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher year-over-year
SG&A investments and headwinds from weaker developing market currencies. We estimate changes in currency
exchange rates, reduced our EPS growth by 6 percentage points for the third quarter and 9 percentage points
year-to-date.
We expect FX headwinds will continue to reduce our EPS growth rate for Q4 and into fiscal 2015. Gross margin for the
third quarter increased 30 basis points driven by higher average prices and continued strength of our DTC business
partially offset by product cost inflation and FX headwinds.
Third quarter SG&A spending rose 16% reflecting 18% growth in demand creation driven by support for the launch of
new products, the ramp up to the World Cup and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products and wholesale
accounts. The level of spending was slightly lower than we projected last quarter as we shifted some investments for

World Cup initiatives to Q4. Operating overhead grew 15% reflecting investments in infrastructure, supply chain
capabilities, DTC and digital.
As Trevor mentioned, we're seeing significant acceleration in nike.com growth as a result of the investments we've
made earlier and we plan to continue to fund these initiatives to realize our significant global potential in digital
commerce.
Other expense net was $45 million for the quarter driven largely by FX conversion losses in developing markets, most
notably Argentina. The third quarter effective tax rate was 22.4%, a 40 basis point improvement versus the prior year
primarily due to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower
tax rate. This was partially offset by the comparison to a prior-year benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the
U.S. R&D credit.
Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape and our cash conversion cycle continues to improve. As of the end of
Q3, accounts receivable grew just 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue growth. Inventories were up 12%
in line with the growth in futures. As a result, our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 24.2%, 120 basis
points above last year and well within our mid-20%s target range.
Now let's take a look at our Q3 performance by segment. In North America revenue increased 12% on both a reported
and constant currency basis driven by double digit growth across nearly all key categories led by basketball,
sportswear, men's and women's training, and global football.
DTC revenue grew 19% in the quarter driven by 8% comp sales growth in stores and significantly higher sales for
nike.com. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 11% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin
expansion partially offset by higher demand creation spending to support new product launches.
In Western Europe, revenue grew 19% on a currency neutral basis reflecting strength across our portfolio of businesses.
Revenue grew double digits for every key category except action sports and every territory except Italy. On a reported
basis, Q3 revenue increased 22% and EBIT increased 54% driven by revenue growth, significant gross margin
expansion and SG&A leverage.
Revenue for Central and Eastern Europe grew 22% on a currency neutral basis as every territory except Israel reported
higher revenues. In Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece, revenues grew at a double digit pace. Revenue was also higher
in every key category.
On a reported basis, revenue grew 17% while EBIT increased 23% as revenue growth and gross margin expansion
more than offset higher demand creation spending related to the winter Olympics.
In greater China we continue to see encouraging signs as our market reset actions take hold. In Q3, currency neutral
revenue grew 7% led by expansion in sportswear, basketball and running. On a reported basis, greater China revenue
grew 9% and EBIT increased 7% as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher SG&A
spending reflecting investments in our new China headquarters facility and DTC operations.
One of our key objectives in resetting the China market is to increase the productivity and profitability of our retail
spaces. As Trevor mentioned, comp sales for our DTC stores grew 11% in Q3 and equally important, margins
expanded significantly.
Comp store sales for partner-operated NIKE stores that we've reset with more focused assortments also continue to
grow at a double-digit pace, well above the fleet average. We're very encouraged by the Q3 results in China. That said,
not all of our financial metrics in China will improve in a linear fashion as we optimize the flow of product into the
market.
As a result of planned changes in our seasonal product flow, futures are down 3% on a currency neutral basis and we
anticipate Q4 revenue will be flat to slightly down.

Our business in Japan continued to generate positive momentum with 10% currency neutral revenue growth driven by
higher revenues in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Japan revenue declined 9% and EBIT fell 13%
reflecting the impact of the weaker yen as well as increased SG&A spending behind the launch of NIKE.com in Japan.
In our emerging markets geography, currency neutral revenues grew 19%, reflecting broad-based growth across
virtually every business unit. Revenues for nearly every category increased double digits led by running, football and
sportswear and almost every territory in the geography also reported double-digit revenue growth led by Brazil,
Mexico, and our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
On a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets grew 8% and EBIT increased 6% reflecting the significant
adverse impact of currency devaluations as well as higher SG&A spending on infrastructure and DTC.
For the Converse brand, Q3 revenue grew 16% on both a reported and currency neutral basis driven by continued
strength in direct distribution markets particularly the United States, China and the U.K. The Chuck Taylor franchise
continues to deliver sustained profitable growth and we're making progress extending the Converse brand in footwear
and apparel. We're also developing the marketplace for the Converse brand by enhancing presentation in wholesale
accounts, expanding DTC and transitioning new countries to direct distribution.
So far this year, we've converted Scandinavia and Taiwan to direct distribution and we're preparing for additional
conversions in FY 2015 laying the foundation for continued strong growth.
On a reported basis, EBIT increased 10% as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by increased
SG&A investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC.
The NIKE, Inc. portfolio has delivered strong performance year-to-date, and we expect to see continued momentum in
our business as we finish the fiscal year. However, as I mentioned earlier, FX headwinds have been a significant drag
on EPS growth so far this year, and we expect to face ongoing pressure in Q4 and into next year. Our guidance for Q4
and FY 2015 incorporates the expected impact of these headwinds.
We now expect Q4 revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate. This is below the rate of futures growth largely due to
the timing of shipments at the beginning and end of Q4, as well as lower levels of at-once and closeout sales. For the
full year, we now expect revenue growth at the top end of our high single-digit target range.
We now expect gross margin for Q4 to expand by 50 basis points to 75 basis points, somewhat better than our prior
expectations due to a shift in mix to higher margin products and geographies, as well as ongoing strength in our higher
margin DTC business.
For the full year we expect gross margin expansion of about 90 basis points. For Q4 we now expect SG&A to grow at a
high teens rate. As I stated previously, we re-phased a portion of our Demand Creation from Q3 to Q4, strengthening
our World Cup marketing initiatives. Given that shift and a relatively lower level of spend in the fourth quarter of FY
2013, we expect Q4 demand creation growth of over 30%.
We expect Q4 operating overhead to grow at a low double-digit rate, reflecting ongoing investments in strategic
initiatives such as digital and DTC. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low teens rate.
For FY 2014, we now expect the effective tax rate will be around 24%. We haven't yet completed our planning for FY
2015, but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and
anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY 2015 at or slightly above our high single-digit target range.
That said, this year's devaluation of developing market currencies will be a significant drag on next year's reported
revenue, gross margin and profit growth. In addition, we remain committed to investing in the strategies that are
driving our growth. As a result, we expect FY 2015 EPS growth will be somewhat below our mid-teens target range.
As Mark said at the top of the call, we feel great about the strong results we've delivered through the first three quarters
of this fiscal year. As we look ahead to Q4 and FY 2015, we'll continue to make strategic investments to drive
sustainable long-term growth, while capitalizing on those investments we've already made to deliver consistent

We're now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: My first question is on China. One of your biggest distributors had reported that they're
regaining a reasonable profit margin by lowering the cost of purchases, and there's new consideration for their
performance on new metrics. And I wondered if you could help me understand how this may impact NIKE's profit
margins in China, if at all?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, first of all, we've seen as I said earlier, some improving performance in our retail stores
and also our wholesale partners are doing better. And I think when we get more productive and profitable in those retail
spaces, that raises profitability for everybody. So, our objective here is to make sure that the marketplace is as
compelling for the consumers as possible, and that we are generating productivity and profitability at the retail space,
and we're confident that when we do that both we and our retailers will be making more money.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is, on basketball. If you could walk us
through how you're thinking about managing the launch product as the basketball category grows globally, and why
you think there seems to be more than acceptance of basketball in Europe now versus other periods of time?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, it's a great question. Basketball clearly is continuing to become much more of a
global sport. I think the fact that more people have a chance to see the sport all around the world, obviously watch the
NBA with the great players that we have from Kobe, LeBron, KD, I think people are having the chance to really
experience how those players are just keeping the excitement in the marketplace.
In terms of how we continue to manage the launch, we manage everything pretty much from a global perspective. We
will sometimes put in very specific products in some local markets like in China, which we will launch in specials in
China, but across the board, we tend to run our offense globally.
In terms of in the future, we continue to feel that the consumers are becoming increasingly excited about the sport and
we look at basketball as just a tremendous growth opportunity and all the work that we're doing with Foot Locker, the
House of Hoops, the work that we're doing at our DTC stores are really helping to solidify the marketplace.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I would also add that the technology and style that we're bringing to basketball both in NIKE
and Jordan are really resonating with consumers around the world. So we're just seeing an uptick in popularity of the
category for all the reasons that Trevor mentioned but also I think from the design and innovation standpoint.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you.

<Q - Omar Saad>: Hey. I'd love to hear an update on two of the topics you, guys, talked about at the Investor Day last
year, price and premiumization. On price, how are you using kind of price strategically relative to the cost inflation? I
remember you talked about some new systems and processes to think about how to optimize pricing.
And then on the premiumization question, could you elaborate or if you're willing to give some numbers around how
the mix is shifting to more premium products? It seems the consumer is increasingly willing to pay more for better
products. And then what does that mean for your lower end offerings? Thanks, guys.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yep. On the pricing strategy, I think we talked about this once before. We continue to say
that our pricing strategy really centers on ensuring that we have the right price value relationship with the consumer.
One of the things that our focus on innovation really does is it gives us great credence as we bring more products into
the marketplace that have new innovations. We also have the strength of our brand, which allows us to command a
premium price, and so we continue to drive the business from that perspective. The third zone that we continue to do is
we continue to really look at pricing within the context of a particular marketplace and make sure that we're managing
based on the market dynamics.
What we are seeing is an increasing move towards premium products. A lot of our consumers are, you know, seeing
our premium lines and they're being very excited about them so certainly what we've seen in the sportswear Tech Pack,
in our sportswear lines, we've seen in our performance lines is the same thing. So we've really seen limited resistance to
us continuing to bring premium into the marketplace but it's really based on giving that consumer a clear value.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I think there's also an opportunity to actually take that premium product and that position and
that style and innovation down in the product line as well to create that, we like to call our complete offense. So we are
setting the tone I think at the top. We're not seeing any resistance at all from consumers. I think the product is really
resonating and I think we can continue to do a better job of actually leveraging some of that style and innovation down
throughout the whole product line.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks. That's really helpful.

The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hey, Bob.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Just the first question that I have is for Don. On the foreign exchange losses, how should we
model that sort of in Q4 and in FY 2015 knowing what you know today from your hedge position?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, first of all, one thing to bear in mind is there's three things that drive the FX impact on
the company. One of them is gross margin. As you know, we sell product in many currencies around the world. We
buy product in a variety of currencies now, probably about two thirds U.S. dollar, about a third other currencies at this
point but that's one area of FX exposure. And we did have headwinds in Q3. We actually think the headwinds in Q4 are
a little stronger.
But at this stage, we've been doing a really good job I think of putting, as Trevor said earlier, premium products in the
marketplace, taking price on a surgical basis, so we think we can continue to expand margin. But the headwinds are
actually getting a little stronger in Q4. The second impact is on translation of profitability, and at this stage we are, even
if we stay where we are today on exchange rates, we're going to have a built-in devaluation versus where we were for
the fourth quarter last year. So they'll be ongoing pressure for translation, and that will continue until we anniversary
the major devaluation. So for most of FY 2015 we'll see that headwind as well.
And then the third piece has to do with translation of balance sheet items in various countries around the world, and
certainly the Argentine peso and the ruble were fairly significant drags from that this year. I think that, as long as the

currencies stay roughly where they are, that one should over time ease-off, but at this stage, it's hard to tell.
But I guess what I would step back from the whole question of currency and go back to one of Mark's comments,
which is, when you operate in a 190 countries this sort of volatility is something that goes with the territory. We have a
large number of levers in our business to manage that helps us offset the pieces of the equation we can't manage. And I
think our track record of delivering consistent growth even in periods of time where we've got macroeconomic
headwinds tells you that we can continue to do that.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question is, on the basketball category, how many teams
does NIKE have this year in March Madness versus last year, and who do you guys project to be the winners?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Well I'll take the last part of that question first. Your guess is as good as mine. No, no. I
think that in that respect, I think we have around 49 teams out of the 68 teams. And so we're obviously – that continues
to shift as the tournament goes on. But clearly, the great thing about March Madness in those moments is that they
provide an incredible platform to create excitement in the marketplace and drive demand. So to the earlier question
actually, those are some of the things I think that continue to create excitement and allow us to continue to leverage our
opportunity. And we're seeing those things continue to go global. So yes, I hate to try and bet on exactly who wins, but
as I always say, the more hope, the more business. So we'll take it from that perspective.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: And I think Warren Buffett's billion dollars are probably safe. I don't know if anybody's going
to get the brackets exactly right.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I already lost. Thanks very much, guys.

The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Thanks. Great quarter, guys.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Thanks Robby.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: I think a question, maybe this is for Trevor. I was hoping you could maybe talk about
NIKE's youth business. You called out women's on the call, but maybe how the youth business is doing, particularly in
apparel relative to women's and maybe men's, and maybe particularly in North America. And then my second smaller
question was, I apologize if I missed it. But I know that you mentioned Russia did well, but is there any change to the
outlook for Russia, and maybe, Don, remind us percent of sales Russia is for NIKE? Thanks.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yes. First on, just on young athletes. Our young athletes business actually is doing
incredibly well. We're just seeing an increase of consumers and certainly working with our retail partners, have just
clear access to young athletes' products. Part of that strategy also comes very much in line with what we're seeing
around our basketball category, and our performance categories, where the consumer are sort of buying similar
products. So we're seeing an incredible growth really coming from the same sort of statement items that we've created
in the adult category. So our ability to leverage those great items makes a difference.
Also, in the United States, we also are working specifically with kids Foot Locker around the NIKE FlyZone where
we're able to bring new concepts into the marketplace that give consumers more access. And in the third zone, would
be our dotcom business we're seeing a continuous growth of consumers coming to dotcom and looking for young
athlete products. So all in all it's been a very strong quarter but going forward we are very bullish about the young
athletes business because it just continues to grow not only in North America but really around the world.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah, and with respect to Russia, Robby, I mean right now we have not yet seen any impact
to our business. Obviously we're hoping that that solution – that a resolution comes to that situation peacefully and

right now we're focused on the things we can control which is making sure we connect with our consumers and make
sure we provide them with innovative products. I think in terms of that business for us it's less than 25% of our CEE
business so at this stage, we think that whatever happens there we'll obviously be able manage it across our portfolio.

Your next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I just had a couple quick ones. Number one,
just to clarify in your guidance, number one, can you tell us whether your gross margin contemplates, sorry, your
earnings guidance contemplates gross margin expansion. And, Don, thanks for the clarification on EPS impacts from
currency. How much of that is embedded into the FY 2015 preliminary view?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: I'm sorry so the first question was – I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Does your guidance for next year contemplate gross margin improvement and how
much – what is the EPS drag for forex?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Okay. So with respect to a broad outline, we're really at this stage at the preliminary stages.
We would expect to see over time expansion of gross margin. How much of it obviously depends upon a lot of
variables, many of which are not settled yet including FX. So at this stage I'm not ready to tell you a number of points
but I think FX would be – what I can tell you is that when we look at the devaluation we saw in FY 2014, and the fact
that you have to anniversary that in FY 2015, it will be a drag. The question of how much is going to depend upon
where the numbers actually fall out by geography, by territory and where the currency exchange rates go.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Okay. Then maybe just as a follow-up on the gross margin side. Is there anything
specific on your supply chain initiatives, manufacturing revolution that you can call out as a meaningful driver to your
P&L for next year?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah, I wouldn't want to get into that level of granularity just yet. What I would say is just to
go back to the conversations we had at the Analyst Day and what we talked about in our last few calls. We do believe
that this is – manufacturing revolution is going to be both impactful from a consumer standpoint in terms of the
products and innovations we deliver to the market and how responsive we are as well as the cost. At this point I'm not
ready to talk about an impact for FY 2015.
<Q - Lindsay B. Drucker Mann>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: ...great execution across the global business. I'm sure it's frustrating to not see the full impact of
that flow-through to reported earnings. A couple of questions. The currency volatility and recent devaluation of some
of these currencies, how does that change strategy for capital allocation at all?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, I think it depends on your outlook for where you think the economy is going. I mean
certainly as we talked about earlier, we manage these individual businesses. We're looking at the consumer value
equation so we're focused on the inflation in a particular market. We obviously are looking at our deployments of
demand creation and so on. But in general terms if we believe that the market over the long haul is going to be healthy
and most of these markets we believe will and we're going to see expansion of the middle class, we're going to be
continuing to build our business and connect with consumers and deliver innovative product.
Certainly from a financial management standpoint we're going to try to minimize the amount of cash we leave in those
markets. We're going to minimize the level of receivables and so on. So financial management absolutely is driven by
where we see the currencies going.
From a business standpoint, sometimes these difficult times in emerging markets are opportunities for us to gain
ground. I mean the last time Argentina went through a financial issue a number of years ago we actually remained
committed to that market. We built our business and we took a lot of market share.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Great, makes sense. The second question, there's been a lot of discussion in the investment
community around how World Cup orders benefit the futures. Clearly you've sponsored some of the important
European and Latin American teams. Is it possible to put some shape around the impact of World Cup orders to the
futures? How much of the growth that we're seeing today is from sponsorships, things like the kits, et cetera?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Well, there certainly is an impact. But what I would direct you to is, the conversation we had
about where the growth in revenue is coming from, as well as the growth in futures. We're seeing growth across
categories around the world. So running's up, women's training is up. We're seeing great results, as Trevor said earlier,
from basketball. So certainly global football is a major driver here, as it always is for this sort of event. But we're
seeing growth very broadly across categories.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, and I would just say that, we feel obviously great about our football business, and
the potential as we head into the World Cup. Futures are up double digits, revenue's up double digits, we're launching a
great array of products into the marketplace. So we're super-excited about the opportunity that the World Cup
represents. But not only in markets like Brazil, or just the emerging markets, but really all around the world. It's a
tremendous platform for us to continue to grow the business.

The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - David Weiner>: Oh, yeah, good morning or good afternoon. It's Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank. So I wanted
to ask a question about China, if I could, and specifically kind of a two-parter. So one, it looks from what we can tell
that the macro environment for apparel and athletic apparel and footwear specifically is improving. So I was wondering
if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the overall marketplace?
And then secondly, I think you made a comment that your own stores that have been reset saw a significant margin
improvement. Could you just drill down a little bit on that? Is that based on gross margin and kind of the mix of
product that you're selling, maybe the premiumization thesis, or something else? Thanks a lot.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, on China, I think the part that we clearly can see is that, the reset strategy that we
put in place is working, and we're obviously very encouraged by the results that we're seeing in the marketplace. As I

think Don sort of pointed to, we're very focused on driving both profitability and productivity at retail. What we've
been able to do in our own stores is to continue to drive a premium position in the marketplace that is based on
performance, and then amplified through our sportswear lines. And that combination is driving a better mix in the
stores, that is leading to a much more profitable business. We're also across the marketplace, we're narrowing the
amount of categories that we focus on, which is allowing us to go deeper to make sure that we have the right size [ph]
curves (57:46) in the marketplace. So the team is working very specifically down to the granular details to really help
us build a better foundation for long-term growth in the marketplace by making sure that we're driving against the right
operational metrics, but also delivering against the consumers, specifically around what the consumer wants in China.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: It's really a case of focusing on the fundamentals, executing the merchandising, the product
flow, the assortment planning, and then the storytelling at retail. Some of the retail executions in those reset doors that
we have in China, I would say are some of the best we have in the world. And then the response from the consumer is
obviously quite positive. The Chinese consumer, I'll just say as a general point, is more and more sophisticated and
discriminating in terms of their choice in product. And price is not a limiting factor in the end if the product and brand
are really resonating, and we're definitely seeing that in China as we are in other parts of the world.
<Q - David Weiner>: Great. Thanks. Do you have time for me to squeeze maybe one more in?
<A - Kelley Hall>: Sure.
<Q - David Weiner>: Sure. Thanks. So someone asked earlier about kind of the payback schedule for some of your
initiatives 3D printing, Flyknit and your other supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies, and I understand you don't
want to talk about next year. But can you at least comment if, from the investment side, if you are already well on your
way to starting to apply some of these initiatives broadly? So that, at least from an investment point of view, you've
already started that to some degree?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. I'll jump in and say that there's two factors that are really driving a lot of our priorities
in this manufacturing revolution space. One is it creates the capability to create new innovation in product that the
consumers can experience. Flyknit is a great example of a process, and 3D printing as you mentioned, processes that
allow us to do things that conventional shoemaking or a product manufacturing process won't allow us to do. So there's
breakthroughs in performance innovation that come. We're also very discriminating when it comes to making sure that
we're focused on things that really affect the bottom line, the product cost.
So we are prioritizing our investments and this is a great example of we have lots of opportunities and we need to make
choices but we're making choices against things that can help us innovate the product as well as actually reduce our
product cost and our speed to market. So we actually have a very strong and deep view over the next three to five-year
period and that's expanding the impact that these investments are making, and again we're prioritizing where we think
we can have the greatest impact. It's one of the areas frankly as an innovation geek I'm most excited about.
<Q - David Weiner>: Yeah, great. Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah, from an investment standpoint I just wanted to make a point that I think to the
conversation that we just had from Mark, there's a lot more opportunity and we're not even close to the end of this and
what I'd also point out is that a lot of this investment will be made in partnership with our factory group. So you won't
see all of this investment on our books. In fact, in many cases the factory partners are going to make most of this
investment and we're really the drivers of the innovation, the catalysts for this. So we've got a long list of opportunities
ahead of us.
<Q - David Weiner>: Perfect. Thanks for the color.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thank you.
