Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter volume performance came in below our
expectations. There was a confluence of factors that effectively led to unusually weak second quarter volume results.
We continued to see [ph] growing elasticity (2:30) in Europe, slowing economic conditions across markets, like Asia
and Latin America, and social unrest in Southeast Europe, Middle East, and Brazil.
On top of this, we were faced with unusually widespread wet and cold weather conditions across multiple regions,
including North America, across Northern Europe and India, all of which impacted the entire industry. Consequently,
we grew global volume 1% in the second quarter, leading to year-to-date volume growth of 3%.
Our comparable currency neutral operating income, excluding structural, grew 5% year-to-date; and both in the quarter
and year-to-date, we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as in both
sparkling and still beverages. These gains included volume and value share increases in core sparkling, juice, tea and
water, all of which underscores the real strength of our brands and the global reach of our system.
While we're not happy with our second quarter volume performance, I can assure you that we are intensely focused on
improving those areas we can control to ensure better performance in the second half of the year.
Looking forward, we remain absolutely confident in our 2020 Vision and in our system's ability to execute, to grow,
and to create value all across the world. As we've often said during these challenging global economic times, there will
occasionally be a bump in the road and the real strength of the business is how you deal with that bump.
In that respect, together with our system bottling partners, we continue to invest in our brands to strengthen our system
for the future and to achieve our long-term growth targets. The fact that we have outperformed the industry in this most
recent quarter reinforces our belief that we are navigating these circumstances in a way that further strengthens our
position of leadership within this extremely vibrant and resilient beverage industry.
Let me now provide you with an overview of our business performance by operating group, starting with North
America. In North America, volume declined 1% in the quarter, as a 4% decline in sparkling beverages offsets 5%
volume growth in our still beverage portfolio. Year-to-date volume in North America was even. Prior to this quarter,
we consistently grew our business in North America for 12 consecutive quarters. Unfortunately, we experienced an
extremely wet and cold second quarter, with more rain in the U.S. in June than we've seen in 50 years; and 44% more
precipitation than in June of last year. This weather clearly impacted our entire industry's volume growth.
Nevertheless, we gained sparkling volume and value share both in the quarter and year-to-date, reflecting the strength
of our brands; and we have robust marketing plans in place for the balance of 2013. So, beverages gained volume and
value share in the quarter making this the 24th consecutive quarter that our still beverage portfolio has either
maintained or gained value share.
Our growth in still beverages this quarter was led by strong performance across the ready-to-drink tea and packaged
water categories with brands such as Gold Peak, smartwater and Dasani leading the way. Further, our volume and value
share gains in the juices and juice drinks category were driven by solid growth for Simply and Minute Maid.
We are confident that we are on the right track in North America and we continue to work diligently with our bottlers
as we advance our re-franchising plan. Indeed, we saw sequential improvement across the quarter in both the
convenience retail and quick-service restaurant channel, suggesting that the category trends are beginning to improve.

While we do recognize that we still have work to do in North America, we remain laser-focused on the strategies that
we have shared with you.
First, we're building a balanced portfolio of strong brands led by Coca-Cola and ensuring that our portfolio remains
relevant to all generations of consumers and across all beverage occasions. Second, we're focused on translating this
brand value into unsurpassed customer value by delivering best-in-class customer service each and every single day.
And third, we're continuously investing to build the capabilities we will need to sustain and to repeat our success. These
strategies are taking a real hold and we are building on them with the evolution of the United States franchise system
announced earlier this year. We, therefore, believe we are well-positioned to continue outperforming the nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverage industry for the balance of the year.
Turning now to Latin America, we grew volume 2% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Volume growth was a little
softer in the quarter due to macroeconomic challenges in a few major markets. Specifically, increasing consumer debt
levels and higher food inflation along with concern over transportation fees contributed to some civil unrest and softer
consumer spending in Brazil.
In Mexico, weaker job creation and higher inflation impacted disposable incomes resulting in reduced retail sales.
These macro factors led to low single-digit volume growth in Mexico, while volume results in Brazil were even.
Given slower growth rates in personal consumption across the region we estimate that year-to-date, beverage industry
growth rates are currently 1.5 percentage points to 2 percentage points lower than the average of the last four years in
Latin America. In the second quarter, we gained volume share in Latin America in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverages including both volume share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.
Moving to brand performance, Trademark Coca-Cola grew 1% during the quarter and maintained volume share within
the sparkling beverages category. These results reflect sustained marketing across the brand and the category.
Our other sparkling brands grew volume and value share in the quarter as we expanded Mundet in Mexico and Fanta in
Colombia, while reigniting marketing behind Schweppes in both Brazil and Argentina.
High single-digit growth in still beverages led to volume share gains in the quarter. These results were driven by the
expansion of Fuze Tea, continued strong performance of the Del Valle portfolio and strong share gains in Powerade,
thanks to superior execution of our programs.
We expect that our Latin America Group will return to rates of volume growth that we have been more accustomed to
in the last few years, given current dynamics. Continued marketing and bottler investments along with solid execution
plans for the second half of the year will also contribute to this improvement.
I will bring my Americas update to a close by congratulating the associates of Solar, our new bottling partner in Brazil.
With the close of this transaction, Solar forms the second largest operation in the Coca-Cola Brazil system serving over
70 million consumers.
Now turning to Coca-Cola International, starting with Europe, the weak economy continues to be a key factor affecting
our performance in Europe, especially in the southern regions, where unemployment remains high, while consumer
confidence and expenditures remain low. We're seeing this continue to play out across most fast moving consumer
goods categories, with several of those slowing between the first and second quarters.
Additionally, historically wet and cold conditions across Europe, including the coldest spring for Germany in 40 years,
further dampened already weak consumer sentiment and industry trends, and contributed to volume declining 3% in
Germany in the quarter.
While our European volume fell 4% in the quarter and is down 2% year-to-date, we maintain the positive share
momentum of the first quarter, growing volume and value share across total nonalcoholic beverages and core sparkling
beverages.

Across the continent, our team and bottling partners are activating a number of marketing and trade execution
programs. Among them is our new "Share a Coke" summer campaign launched across Europe in May and early signs
are very positive. In fact, excitement surrounding the launch helped to partially offset the impact of weather on
immediate consumption.
Our current European outlook remains cautious for the time being, given ongoing macroeconomic conditions.
However, we believe with our commitment to our brands and execution, we should continue to gain share through the
remainder of the year.
Moving on to our Eurasia & Africa Group, we achieved 9% volume growth in the quarter, up double-digits
year-to-date. All business units grew in the quarter with our Middle East and North Africa business unit, as well as our
Central, East and West Africa business unit delivering double-digit growth.
For the quarter, we strengthened our competitive position as we gained volume and value share in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages. Local execution of our global marketing campaign, along with continued price pack
innovation, fueled this growth, which was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 7% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Fanta
and Sprite further contributed to core sparkling growth, while our still brands grew double-digits led by Rani, Crystal,
and Fuze Tea.
Volume in Russia grew 3% with Trademark Coca-Cola up double-digits. The successful sparkling promotion fueled
Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite growth as consumers collected under-the-cap points to obtain a limited edition set of
Winter Olympics-themed glassware.
In Spain and Portugal, we're encouraged by the early integration efforts underway at Coca-Cola Iberian Partners, our
bottler in Spain and Portugal. We now have 8 bottlers in those markets, now operating as a single entity.
Shifting to our Pacific Group, we saw volume growth of 2% and we maintained nonalcoholic ready-to-drink value
share. As is well-publicized, China's economy has been slowing as this is now being felt in consumer spending. China's
first-half retail sales were the slowest in 10 years, while much of the growth in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink
beverage industry in the second quarter came from the value-orientated water category. As a result, our volume
performance in China remains soft and was even for the quarter, cycling 7% growth from prior year.
We command a leadership position in China in both brand preference and market shares in sparkling, as well as in
juices and juice drinks.
Sparkling volume grew 2% and our juices and juice drinks' volume grew 7% year-to-date. This is driven by solid
execution of key consumer and commercial initiatives, and continual new product innovation. Looking forward, we're
keenly focused on adjusting our strategies and improving our business in China.
We recently strengthened our management team in that region, adding to the already strong talent that we have in
China and we're evolving our strategy, reallocating resources across our brand portfolio and strengthening our
consumer communication. We anticipate a return to growth in our China business in the second half of the year.
In India, volume grew low single-digits in the quarter, cycling 20% growth last year; and importantly, we again
improved our volume and value share of total nonalcoholic beverages, as well as sparkling and still beverages, further
strengthening our competitive position as Trademark Coca-Cola grew by double-digits.
Our business in Japan delivered 1% volume growth, while cycling 4% growth last year, and we're seeing sequential
improvements on share trends as we are moving through the year. Japan's sparkling beverage volume grew 1% in the
quarter, supported by music-themed integrated marketing campaigns such as the "Zero Limit" campaign for Coca-Cola
Zero, up 13%.
Solid growth in tea and sports drinks, up 3% and 7% respectively, also contributed to this momentum. Our Georgia
Coffee performance was below our expectations and we are keenly focused on strategies and new launches to improve
performance in the second half of the year.

I do want to acknowledge and congratulate our Coca-Cola East Japan associates on the successful completion of their
merger and the launch of their company on July 1. With this merger, our system is building on its deep roots and a
50-year history of strong partnerships in Japan. Coca-Cola East Japan will be well-positioned to meet the business
growth needs of our customers, while also engaging and refreshing consumers of all ages and lifestyles.
Lastly, our ASEAN business unit delivered strong results with 10% volume growth cycling double-digit growth from
the previous year, as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam all delivered strong double-digit growth. Going forward, we
expect to see an improvement in our Pacific Group's performance in the second half of the year.
On a global scale, we were recently humbled by several accolades including rising to number 5 on Barron's list of the
world's most respected companies and receiving the '2013 Creative Marketer of the Year Award' at the Cannes Lions
International Festival.
In my 35 years of experience in the Coca-Cola system, I've learned that we proudly participate in one of the
fastest-growing and most dynamic industries in the world. As I think about the second quarter, nothing has changed in
our ability to continue winning in this industry. There's no question that our system's commitment to superior execution
is stronger than ever before and our business fundamentals remain firmly intact. Our leadership team is firmly in place
and I'm confident in our ability to capitalize on the abundant opportunities that lie ahead.
Given this, we're confident that we have the right strategies; we have the right vision and the right initiatives to drive
long-term sustainable growth and value. And our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering with current
dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the back-half of the year, why? Quite simply, with
three important reasons.
First, our global brands are stronger than ever and we will continue to invest in them to capture long-term volume and
value share. Second, we have an unparalleled global business system focused on delivering on our 2020 Vision. And
third, we have great confidence in our plans and we will sharpen our focus to ensure our resources are directed to those
strategic priorities that will drive our business and certain key markets will return to growth.
The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry is and is always – and always will be a terrific, terrific business. We will
continue to capitalize on our unprecedented global reach, the broad portfolio of preferred premium brands and superior
system execution. And we continue to invest alongside our global bottling partners and we are well-positioned to
effectively manage our business for long-term profitable growth both in today's economic environment and also as we
look forward to our future.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.
Gary P. Fayard
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar has shared the industry clearly slowed a little due to a
number of factors that impacted various markets around the world. The combination of these factors resulted in weaker
volume performance in the second quarter than we expected. At the same time, we recognize the need for improved
performance in certain markets. Having said that, we remain absolutely focused on doing the right things for the
long-term health of the business and investing for long-term sustainable growth.
Increasing share during times like these, further strengthens our position and can ultimately lead to accelerated growth
as market conditions normalize. And we continue to win on this front gaining both global volume and value share in
both total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as volume and value share in global sparkling and still
beverages.
So, let's review our results in more detail starting with a review of the key drivers of our financial performance. Our
second quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflects concentrate sales growth in line with unit case, volume
growth as well as a strong increase in direct marketing expenses as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health
and the strength of our brands.

From an operating segment standpoint, our operating income growth this quarter reflected strong profit growth in Latin
America and Eurasia & Africa, as well as the continued solid financial performance of the Bottling Investments Group.
Operating income in North America and Pacific was even, while Europe experienced a slight decline in profit.
Comparable currency neutral net revenue declined 1% this quarter and we were even year-to-date. However, excluding
the impact of structural items, primarily the sale of the Philippines bottler, net revenues increased 2% both for the
quarter and year-to-date.
We continue to earn pricing in the marketplace, but at the consolidated level the positive pricing was offset by the
impact of geographic mix, resulting in even price/mix for both the quarter and year-to-date. Although, geographic mix
unfavorably impacted price/mix at the consolidated level, it contributed to the improvement of our gross margin in the
quarter and year-to-date.
Our comparable gross margin was 61.2%, this represents a slight improvement compared to the prior year, primarily
due to the impact of geographic mix, structural items and our foreign currency hedging program.
As we shared in our first quarter earnings call, we expect our gross margin to moderate somewhat over the remainder
of this year, primarily due to a shift in geographic mix. Excluding the impact of structural items, we achieved 2 points
of favorable operating expense leverage for both the quarter and year-to-date and we now expect to achieve low
single-digit operating expense leverage for the full-year.
Our comparable currency neutral operating income, it was up 4% this quarter and year-to-date; excluding the impact of
structural items, operating income grew 5% year-to-date. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency was a 3%
headwind on this quarter's operating income results. And based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the
cycling of our prior-year rates, we expect currencies to be a 4% headwind on our operating income for the third quarter
and full-year.
Below the line, we've benefited from an increase in net interest income, an improved tax rate and fewer shares
outstanding due to our continued share repurchase program. We expect net interest income in the second half of the
year to be relatively in line with comparable net interest income year-to-date. Additionally, we now expect our full-year
tax rate to be 23% and we expect to hold this rate through 2014.
Comparable earnings per share grew 4% in the second quarter, despite currency headwinds of approximately 2%.
Year-to-date comparable earnings per share also grew 4%, despite currency headwinds of approximately 4%, as well as
the impact of two fewer selling days. We continue to generate a strong $4 billion from cash from operations
year-to-date providing a – providing us significant financial flexibility.
As I've shared with you over the years, we've redeployed our cash flows utilizing a consistent and disciplined
framework. First, our first is to reinvest back into the business and to strengthen our global system. Secondly, to
continue to expand our portfolio and capabilities through bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships. Third, continue to
return cash to shareholders through our dividends and we increased our dividend 10% in 2013, our 51st consecutive
year of dividend increases. And lastly, repurchase shares, year-to-date, our net share repurchases totaled $2 billion and
we continue to expect full-year share repurchase to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion.
As you model our 2013 operating results, let me again remind you that the steps we have taken along our – along with
our bottling partners to strengthen our global system will have a structural impact on our operating results over the
remainder of the year.
As you're aware, we closed the transaction in the Philippines earlier this year and the merger of our bottling partners in
Brazil and Japan recently closed. As I shared in our 2012 year-end call, we do not expect these transactions to have a
material impact on our 2013 earnings results. However, these transactions will impact various line items within our
P&L.
We anticipate that, these transactions will have a 3% structural impact on our full-year 2013 net revenues. Likewise,
our full-year operating income results should see a 1% structural impact. However, there should be a corresponding
improvement in our equity income to account for our share of the results of these operations moving forward.

Additionally, the structural impact from these transactions will be larger in the second half due to the impact of the
deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations beginning in the third quarter.
In closing, we delivered solid financial performance through the first two quarters of 2013 and we expect to continue
our solid financial performance during the second half of this year. Our company and our system are well-positioned to
capitalize on the real opportunities for growth. We remain very confident as we continue to win in the marketplace with
volume and value share. We continue to deliver solid financial results. We continue to innovate and invest in our
brands. Our global system continues to get stronger. And we are best positioned to continue capturing growth in the
dynamic nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry.
Operator, we're now ready for any questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Morning, everybody. Muhtar, I was hoping, you could step around the world and dive a little bit
deeper into certain markets and regions to help us separate out the impact of non-recurring factors that hit your second
quarter versus any macro-related factors that can continue to pressure the business in the second half. You had
mentioned macro factors in Brazil, Mexico, Europe and China. Will those continue to be as big an impact in the second
half of the second quarter? And if not, why? And then maybe, if you could help quantify maybe what you think the
weather-related impact was in the second quarter?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. Hi, Bill. Thanks. I think overall both from – in Europe, United States, India, some
other parts, we did have a pretty significant impact from weather. Unusual weather, monsoon coming very early in
India as you probably all read. Many thousands missing in flooding, worst flooding since the tsunami back 10 years
ago; so, and then Europe, also Central Europe, Germany, all the issues around the riverbeds rising and flooding and
very heavy, wet conditions. So, we did, yes, have impact both from a consumer sentiment, both from a mobility
sentiment in the United States also and both also from just a pure, in some cases distribution issues that hindered our
performance.
And as you know, when we lose a sale that doesn't recur anymore, we lost that day and so – and also in some cases, we
were cycling very unusually warm and favorable weather conditions from prior years in some cases like India last year
the monsoons actually started later. That gave us a 20% growth in India, unusual for the second quarter in India.
Usually, the first half in India is always less than the second half in India because of the anomalies of the weather. So,
yes.
And then macro conditions, we all have felt it in social issues in the Southeast Europe, the demonstrations across the
Middle East and then more recently in Brazil. But we feel confident both in terms of looking at our plans in place,
looking at current dynamics that both Brazil will have a better second half, China will have a better second half, Russia
will have a better second half and certainly better quarters than this last quarter, where we grew volumes 3% overall,
Mexico as well as India.
So, while we continue to invest in our brands, our brands are stronger than ever before. We've taken market share, our
system is stronger and so all these key markets we believe will perform better in the second half.
In fact, as I said, we have seen this – we've – we always know that the second half in a country like India is
significantly better than the first half in any case, if you look back at our performance over the last few years. So, and
then in the United States, I think, we've got very robust plans to return back to growth. So, I – we feel pretty confident
that this was a confluence of events that happened all at the same time.

The portfolio effect of our global business did not work in our favor in this particular case in the second quarter. And I
feel – and my colleagues feel and our bottlers feel very confident. I've been across many markets recently. I've traveled
to China, Japan, Thailand, Myanmar – many other parts of Asia. I've been in the mid – in Southeast Europe, I've been
in France and – all in the last sort of four, five weeks and I feel that we will look towards a definitely a better quarter
volumetrically. And again, we can talk to you about how we feel about the financial numbers too later in the call and I
can ask Gary to reflect on that too, in terms of the second half. Do you want to, Gary?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Sure. Well, let me continue on then versus the volume. On the second half, on the P&L, I think
we had a very solid first half. We would expect to have a solid second half of the year as well. We have said there'd be
bumps along the road. The industry had one, obviously and it slowed, but we continue to take share and we feel very
confident about the second half. As we look at the second half financial results, I think we'll be very close to our
long-term growth targets, particularly in volume and earnings per share should be coming back in line with what we
would all have been expecting at the first of this year.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. I'd just add, Bill, that I think this is more an anomaly. We should not see this as a
trend or a systemic issue and that is simply how I believe one should think about it. And again, I can ask Steve and
Ahmet to reflect upon how they see the second half from their vantage point in both Americas and International. Maybe
Steve, you can start?
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Sure. Thanks, Muhtar. Starting with Latin America, Muhtar said it well. We saw things in
Brazil that we hadn't seen before, the economy slowed, there was social unrest. It didn't last very long. Things are
slowly getting back to normal and we expect a better performance sequentially as we progress through the year in
Brazil and in Mexico.
In Latin Center and in South Latin, we've seen very good results – high single-digit results continue, so there's a lot still
going very well that continue to go well in Latin America, and Brazil and Mexico getting back to what we would
expect to see on a normal basis.
In North America, Muhtar said it, we don't like to talk about the weather, but the first half of last year saw unusually
good weather conditions. We had warm weather, we had dry weather coming out of winter and going into spring.
This year, in North America, we had some of the worst weather and you've all seen it. It's been very wet, it's been very
cold, it's been historically wet and cold, which obviously impacts our business.
On top of that we had the payroll tax effect which started at the beginning of the year, which affects lower income
households obviously much more, affects their disposable income, their ability to spend. We saw late payroll tax – late
payroll – or tax refunds coming into the marketplace.
But as we look forward, we expect the weather pattern to obviously normalize. The weather will not continue to be a
factor in a country as big as United States like it's been. And from an economic standpoint, people are used to the
payroll tax now. They've had 4 to 5 months to moderate their household budgets to get used to it. The refunds,
obviously, it's been back in the marketplace and we're already starting to see better trends in QSR, better trends in
convenience retail, better trends across our business. So, we look forward to the second half of the year across the
Americas much more favorably than the first half. Muhtar used the word anomaly, I think, especially, an anomaly in
North America and we see ourselves coming out of that.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Ahmet?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Muhtar. Yeah, just to build further on Muhtar's comments, I'll start
with India. That's definitely completely weather-related. All our investments in the route-to-markets, coolers and
capabilities will continue to deliver the kind of levels that we're used to having from India in the rest of the year. So,
we're quite comfortable on that.
On China, there were probably impacts of – as you hear, the continuing slowdown in macro levels as well as there was
some weather impact. But we do expect volume to return for a number of reasons. First of all, China is a country with
very, very low per capita. I've been there a number of times in the last 3, 4 months and we have been working on

evolving our strategy with better OBPPC, more price points and more packs, as well as improving our capability.
As Muhtar mentioned, we have recently strengthened our management team there and I'm very confident that in the
second half of the year, we're going to start returning to growth in China. Maybe not at the levels of double-digits that
you might have been seeing, but we'll certainly be looking to returning to growth in China.
Now, the other anomaly in the international results was Europe. I could comfortably say that a very, very big part of
that 4% decline was driven by unseasonable weather, as it has already been mentioned. It shows the strength of our
system that we were able to gain volume and value share in both sparkling and NARTD. And as we see weather
normalizing, we again look forward to coming back to our normal range of growth in Europe. The rest of international
territories, such as EAG continued to deliver its historical growth rates.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: And Bill, this is Gary. I'll just add one or two other quick data points as well. When we talk
about 1% volume, I think you have to wonder, is that a weak 1% or a strong 1%. Let me just assure you, it's as strong
as it can be and still be 1%. So, that's number one.
The other thing is, we talked about some of these anomalies on some of these markets, one of the things that gives me
some confidence as well because there's been a lot of discussion about what's happening with the emerging markets and
all around the world with the slowdown from China, et cetera, but we've always talked about the markets where the per
capita consumption is less than $150, has always been a real strength of ours. Well, it's – again, even in the second
quarter, if you looked at those markets under $150 and exclude China and India, which we've just discussed separately,
if you excluded those, our volume in those markets was plus 7% in the second quarter. So, it still shows the underlying
strength of the markets in those emerging markets.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answers.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gary, I just wanted to ask a clarification about the
back-half of the year. In your commentary on the financials, it sounds like you're saying, you're going to get to that
level in the back-half of the year, not the back-half of the year will get you to the long-term algorithm for the full-year.
At least, that's how I interpreted it. Can you just sort of clarify that?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. Here is how I would say, we're actually very close in the
first half of the year. Year-to-date, if you look at operating income, I think, year-to-date, ex-structural, currency neutral
is plus 5% and our volume is plus 3%. So, we're not that far away. So, our view would be that we should be – and in
pact year-to-date earnings per share, ex-currency is 8%, rounds up to 8%. So, we're not that far away in the first half,
that's why I was saying, solid results.
And when I say solid, I think you've followed us long enough, we like to be at the top end of ranges and not at the
bottom end of ranges. Unfortunately, we're at the bottom end right now, but that's the world we're dealing with, but we
feel very good about the second half.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: John, this is Muhtar, just one point that I can add to that is the following, it's customary
sometimes that when in the kind of businesses that we're in, when you have a blip in your volume because of a
confluence of events, some of which are not in your control, the first thing you do is go out and cut marketing. And I
think, if you look at our numbers, we have continued to invest aggressively in our brands through the second quarter,
through the first – in the first half, and as you know, every investment in marketing does not pay back in that quarter, it
pays back in future quarters. And therefore, we are confident with the share gain, we're confident with the strength of

our brands, we're confident about the metrics on our brands, both in sparkling and stills across the world and we're
confident in our bottling partners investment plans that are taking place in the second quarter, that we can continue our
momentum going into the second half of the year and also improve on it volumetrically, but also continue with our
mission to achieve our 2020 Vision through the next years ahead.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Got it. Okay. Thanks. Then, my actual question here was, Gary, you've got positive price/mix
in the vast – I think in every region this quarter, with the exception of Pacific, I think. And yet, it's not sort of going up
to full positive price/mix here. How do we view the regional price/mix versus the geographic offset? And how does this
fit into your long-term algorithm? Because it seems like this is something that's most likely going to continue to be a
notable overhang. Thanks.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Okay. John, first, I want to compliment you on your creativity with that first question and then,
here's the real question. But anyway, a great question actually. And the first thing I would say around pricing is, we
believe strongly that we have premium brands and our brands should command a premium in the market, and they do
command a premium across the world. Number one, we are seeing pricing rational and within the industry, we think
pricing is rational, particularly in the United States.
But if you look at price/mix – and I'm going to go year-to-date, but the second quarter is essentially the same thing. If
you look at price/mix; price/mix year-to-date is even. But within that, you've got positive pricing and you've got
negative geographic mix. So, year-to-date consolidated, we actually have positive 1% pricing.
If you look at it by region, year-to-date North America has positive pricing up 1%, Eurasia & Africa have positive
pricing up 8%, Europe has – looks like positive pricing up 2%, although, I'll tell you a lot of that is because of Innocent
and our acquisition of Innocent. So, absent Innocent, I think Europe is closer to flat. Latin America is positive 8 points
of pricing year-to-date. Pacific is even. And Bottling Investments Group is plus 2% as well.
So, we're actually getting very nice positive pricing, as well as category mix, brand mix, channel mix. All of those
things are working. What's happening to us and where the ding comes in, if you will, is that we've got negative
geographic mix. So, we've got significant negative geographic mix across many of those regions, which brings us back
to even when you put price and geography together overall at the consolidated level.
As I've often said, geographic mix is always going to be probably negative, because you're going to expect those
emerging market countries to be growing faster than the developed market countries, and you've got better pricing in
the developed market countries.
What amplified it a little bit, this quarter, particularly was the result in Europe that we talked about and North America
being coming at even where they were. So, you put all that together, we're actually getting the kind of pricing we would
expect to be getting in the market.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the second half expectations, then, and
clearly, you can't control the macros and the weather. But I'd just like to hear a little bit more specifically on some of
the actions that you're doing to improve the volume performance, particularly markets like China, where there's a
macro issue, but there's also competitive issue, there's also portfolio issue, just in terms of not participating in some of
the fast-growth segments. So, can you just talk about, how you're thinking about marketing investments? How you're
thinking about your portfolio? Can you accelerate price-pack architecture strategy more aggressively to really get the
volume performance, even if the macros don't come back and/or the weather continues to be challenging?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Should I take this?

<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I'll – Judy, let me just reflect on that and I'll ask Ahmet also to comment. But I
think what we have said again is there was a coming together of many events that usually don't come together all the
time. I mean you have – we have performed overall globally at rates that are much more commensurate than what
you've been used in the last three or four years, despite the fact that we've had issues, some of these issues happening to
us from quarter-to-quarter. But you haven't felt them because – because of the fact that the portfolio worked.
In this time, you have the issues around – in Latin America, the two key markets Brazil and Mexico on slowing down
and also consumer spending being impacted because of the Brazilian crunch in consumer credit that was taken away
from the consumers and generally the consumer spending went away.
And then you also had China, the issues in China that was – consumer spending is actually much below GDP levels.
And that's documented across the macro numbers in China and as well as the weather issues related to India. And also
other issues coming together in North America, where it went for the first time in 12 quarters from a plus to a negative,
which we don't expect.
All of these things we don't expect to continue at the same time. Some of these things may still continue to impact us;
therefore, the portfolio will work.
Now related specifically to China, we are participating in two great categories in China and we're the leaders, which is
sparkling and juices. Those categories we've grown in and they are adding tremendous value to our portfolio and to our
business in China. We have also, as we said, re-targeting all our efforts in China, re-focusing all our efforts. Yes, there's
a different competitive landscape. We feel that actually that has not been the issue for us. The main issue for us is to
ensure that we can continue to distribute in outlying areas in China that we have had some issues and we're correcting
those.
And also that our marketing is working, which we feel definitely our brands are stronger, our innovation pipeline is
working in terms of what we're providing to the consumer, also in terms of packaging and we feel confident that those
two categories – playing in those two categories and then also innovating across some other categories like dairy is
going to create the growth and the value for us starting in the second quarter but also continuing.
And we also feel confident that the Chinese leadership, the new Chinese leadership are going to ensure that they take
the right actions and we're seeing that to reposition and transform the economy without creating a major bump as they
transform the economy from a purely export-led economy to a more balanced economy with also consumer spending.
And both the Deputy Prime – Vice Premier, Yang, in-charge of the economy as well as the new team, we feel confident
have the plans in place to ensure that, that takes place. So, again, Ahmet, you can reflect more on that as well as any
other markets you want to.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. Thanks, Judy, for the question. A couple of messages here, Judy.
Message number one is that the economy may be down, but the growth prospects in China, even in the short-term is
there, simply because of the very low level of per-capitas and strength of our system.
Point number two, if you look at all the competitors in China, nobody really participate in all the categories. All the
players have one or two categories that they're strong in and then they drive their businesses through those categories
and maybe extend them to others.
Our position is the same. So, our strategy is basically, first of all, we definitely can do better in the categories that we
already exist such as sparkling. So, to give you some specific actions we're taking to do that, I've highlighted the
OBPPC and that's actually accelerated. We have pilots running on various multi-serve and single-serve packages for
different price points in different parts of China. And as those things roll-out of the pilot, we'll be rolling some of them
nationally. So, those are already in a way in the market and they will be accelerated into the second quarter.
We've also re-looked at our communication strategies and we're going to be communicating more intensely on the
intrinsics of our products as well as you extrinsics. You might have heard about our nickname promotion, that's a
similar promotion to the "Share a Coke" promotion around the world elsewhere, which is getting incredibly positive
reaction from the consumer. And all the other things of improving our route-to-markets et cetera, those are all

underway and we're very confident that, that's going to give us our strength in sparkling.
Now, we also play in juices, as you know, and as Muhtar mentioned, we're the number one player there. We are
re-focusing our efforts back around Pulpy. And we're just looking at an extension of that into mango, which is getting
very strong consumer reaction. So, as we consolidate our efforts behind that you would see continued increase.
Now, obviously, we're not only focused on just our existing categories, we have a pretty successful brand in Super
Milky Pulpy, which is a value-added dairy and we're beginning to increase our focus on that and we're getting high
single-digit growth of that brand and we are building our innovation pipeline for the future. So, it's a fairly robust
strategy. And yes, under lower economic environments, we might have lower growth rates than what you're used to,
but we are ever strengthening our position in China to capitalize on this market for not just the immediate future, but
the very long-term.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And I have – we have Irial also, which oversees Bottling Investments Group. And as you
know, we are one of the three system players in China in terms of bottling. Maybe Irial, you can comment on what
you're seeing down very close to the ground.
<A - Irial Finan>: Yeah, Judy, good morning. Just to build on something Muhtar said earlier, which was around
investment. And I would say to you, from a bottling perspective that we continue to invest heavily in the market, and
particularly, in our execution capability, route-to-market capability, and critically in developing the talent to be
successful in the next years ahead.
So, when you add those to the revitalized marketing strategies, OBPPC, I actually feel very confident about the future. I
mean, yes, we will have bumps along the way, but our business is growing, our challenge is to grow a healthy
long-term business and I think from a bottling perspective, we're really putting in place the infrastructure and the
capability to really drive a success for the future. And – but, that's basically where I'd leave it.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Judy, what I would just say – and finally is, I wouldn't read anything more into this than
what it is. As Gary said earlier, we were fractionally away from rounding up to 2% and we could – it would not have
been hard for us to do something which would not be right for this business and take the volume up to 3% and selling
low, cheap product. That is not what we're about. We're about investing, we're about doing the right thing for this
business and we are about – and I've always said, there may be a bump along the road, the one bump along – we've
grown this business consistently in line every year on an annual basis since 2008, on our way to our 2020 Vision in this
range – in the upper range of our long-term growth plan, despite very, very challenging macroeconomic conditions, and
that's going to happen in 2013 also.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just two quick questions. What are the trends like recently? It seems
like you're pretty bullish in the back-half, so kind of as you exited June and got into July, it looks like some of the
weather normalized. So, kind of what are you seeing more recently? And then kind of minutiae, but the big margin
decline percentage year-over-year in Europe, what's the primary driver of that?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, let me just comment on what you just said. You have – we are not a – this is not
about managing on a day – yes, we manage this business on an hourly basis, but it's not healthy to comment on what
has happened in the last two weeks. Yes, of course, we expect the weather to normalize. As you – or whoever is in the
Northeast now and whoever was in the West Coast of the United States in the last 10 days, you know that weather – it
has – it does normalize. That's probability and statistics, so it just happened all in a very short period of time, where
everything was negative in many major markets, and it will turn – it will normalize and that's what we're saying, part of
what we're saying. So, I have every confidence that when – with the normalized conditions, as I've said, we will – again

– 2013 will be another year when volume will grow at the range of the long-term growth model.
As far as the margins are concerned, I'll turn it over to Gary, in terms of what – the margin issue of what you
mentioned, in terms of the margin numbers in Europe.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, in Europe, it's a structural anomaly. It's actually Innocent. So, when the juice business,
juice having lower margin when it came in, that's what changed the margins. There's nothing more than that.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. Got you. But – so, they should be down going forward though because of that – because
Innocent is now fully consolidated?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yes.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. Great.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: And that's actually the flip side, if you will, of what I said when I was answering John's
question, that if you looked at price – the price, inside a price/mix in Europe, is actually plus 2%. But it's really
Innocent, giving us a lift on price, but it gives the opposite effect on the margin.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Got you. So, from like a dollar-margin perspective, it's almost neutral, but the percentage has
changed because of the price component?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yes. Exactly right.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey, Gary, just a question for you related to share repurchases. With the stock the way it's
performed in the second quarter, did you accelerate or do anything different in terms of timing of maybe pulling
forward share repurchases?
And then I mean, the business right now is kind of bouncing around the low-end of your algorithm and the stock has
kind of bounced around in a pretty tight range here recently. So, is there any consideration to maybe even buying back
more stock than you originally planned just because you've got an opportunity to buy it here at around the $40 level?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah. Great question, Bryan. Well, first, you'll see that we did accelerate purchases in the first
half of the year. As I said, if our annual target was in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range and we actually have
repurchased $2 billion in the first half, we did exactly what you said and we accelerated in the first half of the year.
Where we are right now is we're sticking with the annual target which we originally set at $3 billion to $3.5 billion and
I'd just tell you we'll give you an update on that at the end of the third quarter.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. But not out of the realm of possibility that you could go higher, if you chose to?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: I've learned to never say never to anything.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Muhtar or Gary, question on the gross margin evolution.
I think, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like one of the silver linings here is that the price-pack
architecture work you've been doing over several years has allowed you to put up a pretty decent gross margin number
and offset some of the corresponding earnings discipline that comes from the revenues being what they were in the
quarter. If that is a fair assessment, can you give us a bit of an update on what's going on in terms of innovation, not in
terms of the price of the pack, but in terms of what's really in the bottle? Because that seems to be one of the problems
you're facing, kind of, from a larger share performance absolute NARTD performance perspective?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Okay. Perhaps, Mark, let me take the margin question and then we can come back to the
innovation question. But this is actually – let me get back into actually what I talked about price/mix and margins,
when I was talking about Innocent. The same thing applies actually at a higher level for the total company. So, what
you've got is very positive pricing and you're seeing that and that's being offset by geographic mix. But what you're
seeing is when an operation like North America is minus 1% in the quarter, that actually – this is counterintuitive – but
it actually improves margins, okay? Because North America having the finished product business has lower margins.
So, our expectation is; number one, to continue to get positive pricing and we're going to be rational in pricing and we
intend to stay premium, as I said earlier. But in addition to that, we expect North America's performance to improve in
the second half of the year, which will actually put pressure on margins, which is why we said earlier that we would
expect gross margins to moderate over the second half of the year and it's really the geographic mix of where the
income is coming from. Does that make sense?
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Fair enough. It does. Yeah, absolutely. The geographic headwind is what it is.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yes.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I mean, and also on innovation, I think as we've said before, we don't look at
innovation only as ingredients. We look at it as packaging, ingredients, equipment, even in terms of marketing, social
media, the brand, price, pack, channel architecture, occasion architecture, all of that is working for us.
And also in terms of our new campaign to be part of the solution around the world, working closely with local
governments, national governments, working with the government of Mexico, working with mayors in Chicago and
San Antonio, other parts of the United States, in different states, in Atlanta. And you can look at the patents that we've
been filing of recent. So, we are working and Freestyle and the next-generation of what is behind – what's coming next
after that. We are working on a host of new innovations.
Also ingredients, continuing to work with our partnerships across the world in different incubators around the world.
The best – we always believe here in The Coca-Cola Company, the best ideas are outside.
So, the PlantBottle came from the outside from one of the incubators in India. Many new ideas are coming from
different incubators in Israel, or in China, or in Japan, or in Latin America. We have many – we have substantial
partnerships from here with the University of Georgia to across many institutions around the world in techno parks.
So, yes, we are very, very active and we're content that we have the right pipeline. And maybe I can ask Steve to reflect
on – from a just, sort of, North America and Americas' perspective.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. From – starting with the Latin America perspective, we've got
Coca-Cola Life, which we're kicking off in Argentina and which we're excited about watching the prospects of that.
We're doing some terrific innovation around our Jugos del Valle platform in juices in Latin America. As well as in
North America, we've launched Fruitwater, a brand new product off to a very good start. Powerade Zero Drops have
joined Dasani Drops as a very exciting innovation. NOS Active, which is a fusion between sports drinks and energy,
kicked off in April. Again, off to a very good start.

From a packaging perspective, we continue to innovate around our price package architecture. We've just launched
16-ounce sparkling [ph] icy (61:37) cans in our major packages. We've got Taylor Swift slim cans coming into the
marketplace. We've got 19.2-ounce sparkling cans coming into the marketplace; again, lots of excitement around the
packaging innovation.
In terms of some marketing innovations, we've got Coke Zero, which is going to be launching College GameDay this
fall, which we're very excited about. We've got caffeine-free Coke Zero coming into the marketplace. We feel very
good about that, really building out the Coke Zero platform as an all-day brand.
So, we've got lots in the marketplace and lots more coming into the marketplace. And it builds on one of Muhtar's
earlier points, that throughout this rough period of time we have continued our marketing pressure, we've continued our
marketing investment. We have not cut it, we've increased it and it allows us to continue to innovate and bring new
innovations into the marketplace.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: That's helpful. And if I could simply follow-up on this subject of a stevia-based
sweetener in the brand, on-the-door, so to speak, Coca-Cola, we've seen what you've said recently about globally taking
down the portion of your volume that is in the full-cal portion of your business. Should we infer here that there's an
increased resolve to use organic sweeteners against the main brand here and there's some optimism globally for that
potential?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. I'll just comment on that, that I think it's all about ensuring that you provide the
right choices, at the right time, for the right consumers, in the right environment. And I think that you shouldn't read
that we have an increased resolve to use any specific ingredient. It's all about ensuring that we do have viable lights and
no calorie versions for every one of our major brands available to the consumer, ensure that we – in front of the pack
label transparently, ensure that we have active lifestyle programs as per all our global commitments and ensure that we
have responsible marketing. That's our – those are our four commitments.
And our business, we've said many times, is about brands. Today, we have 16 $1 billion brands, they're growing. We
have, in the pipeline, another 19 brands that are bigger than $750 million in revenue and less than $1 billion. Those are
all going to become $1 billion brands in the next increment of time, because they're growing, and we're confident that
we will have multiple more $1 billion brands than we have today. And I think that's what this business is all about,
adding value through brands to our system. And I'm confident that you will see us add many more $1 billion brands to
our rostrum in the near future.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Great. Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So, I think the general theme of my couple of questions is really what we're all trying to
figure out, which is, what's going to get better from here and why? And not only in terms of volume, but also in terms
of some of the other key drivers of profitability. So, if I may, my first question is around North America. And although,
you say in the press release, you remain committed to rational pricing, your price/mix is only up 1%. And I guess do
you think volumes would've been down more than negative 4%, if you had taken more than 1% pricing, so, taking 2%
to 3% pricing? Or can we hope for that part of the business, the pricing in North America improving going forward?
And as a follow-up to that, in a completely different per cap market like China, following up to Ahmet's point a second
ago, I just want to get a better sense of, if evolving a strategy has anything to do with increased price promotion as well
as it sometimes does with some companies?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yes. Thanks, Ali. I'll start. In terms of pricing, we've always said that our pricing strategy
in North America is consumer-based and it continues to be consumer-based. We captured, if you look at Nielsen, we
captured very good pricing across our portfolio in North America and we think it was an appropriate amount of pricing
by channel. The unfortunate 4% volume decline was, as we said, had a lot more to do with weather and the economy, at

least 60% to 70% having to do with a one-time really poor weather event. So, we didn't put more price in the
marketplace to try and change volume that wasn't there, we put appropriate price increases in the marketplace and we
maintained our margins and we maintained our price strategy going forward.
And we continue to bring new products and new packages into the marketplace to help our whole architecture achieve
the type of pricing that we deserve. And we've given some examples of this in the past and a good one is our 1.25-liter,
which continues to be very successful; a third of the 1.25-liter volume is in fact, incremental volume. So, it's good in
and of itself, but it has also allowed us, if you look at our 2-liter pricing over the course of the past 12, 15 months, we
are out of the $0.99 price promotion for 2-liter and have been for quite some time. So, we are not going to put too much
price in the marketplace. We take appropriate price based on what the consumer and what's right for the consumer and
what's right for the customer and we fully expect that based on the price plans we have in place for the back-half of the
year, based on the innovations we have on the back-half of the year that sparkling volume will in fact, improve from
what happened in the second quarter.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Ahmet?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yeah. Ali, I'd move on to your question on China. The answer is there's absolutely no plans
for increased price promotion. In fact, the reason for having an evolving OBPPC is to have more sustained volume at
the right price point and the right packs for all the consumers.
Now, to give you an example, you might be familiar that there's been a lot of upsizing going on in China. And we have
launched our 300-ml package last year. Now, we will tactically respond to such upsizing to be able to balance our
volume and share performance. But that's a – those are limited tactical moves rather than a strategy to have increased
price promotion. So, that's not really in the cards.
Now to maybe build on just a little bit and also to address some of the innovation questions that I didn't have a chance
to share is that, we have small can; either slim can or sleek can and small PET launches all across the international
territory, all across Europe, all across Eurasia & Africa Group and some of the Pacific markets. That, I believe, is an
important innovation in a way and also allows us to drive revenue and gross margin.
In addition to that, let's also keep in mind that we had some very successful products such as Pulpy that hasn't been
fully launched in all of our international territories. Eurasia & Africa Group for example, has taken that and they've
launched it in Morocco. In a very short period of time, we were able to achieve 20%-plus market share with that
launch. We've just had a recent launch of extensions of coffee into PET in Japan in the CDS channel, recruiting female
consumers. We're quite happy and pleased with the results of that.
We've been innovating in energy drinks in Russia and Turkey, by extending them into PET packages, receivable PET
packages that the consumers want. So, we continue to innovate in different packages, different categories across our
international territory as well as using successful innovations from the previous years.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, Irial, Steve, Ahmet and Gary. Our business continues to grow and to capture global volume and
value share even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. And importantly, we do not manage our business
for the short-term, but rather for the medium and long-term. And as I mentioned earlier, our focus on achieving our
2020 Vision is unwavering with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the
back-half of this year and beyond. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for
joining us this morning.
