noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Investor Relations. Ms.
Nollen, you may now begin your conference.

Now, with the formalities out of the way, let me turn the call over to Bill Johnson. Bill?
William R. Johnson
Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to join you today to discuss our second quarter results, the
company's full-year outlook, and my perspective on the global environment. Starting with the second quarter, Heinz
delivered EPS of $0.90 from continuing operations, with organic sales growth of between 3% and 4%, our 30th
consecutive quarter of organic top-line growth.
These results reflect the nice balance between volume and pricing, and strengthen our three engines of growth:
Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup, and our Top 15 Brands. Second quarter earnings benefited from the favorable
effective tax rate that we leveraged to significantly increase investment in marketing and global capabilities to drive
further growth.
Importantly, we increased marketing spend by over 13% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis, with a particularly
large increase in North America, where I am encouraged by our recent momentum. We also continue to ramp up
investments behind enhanced emerging markets capabilities and our global SAP implementation. Consistent with our
efforts to improve global capabilities and enhance innovation, I am pleased to announce that we are nearing the
completion of our European Innovation and Quality Center in the Netherlands, which will open shortly.
Our business results, as I said a moment ago, were again led by our trio of growth engines: Emerging Markets, Global
Ketchup, and our Top 15 Brands. Emerging Markets delivered organic sales growth of more than 13%, and would have
been up well over 14% were it not for the impact of the planned Long Fong downsizing. Global Ketchup grew 5%, and
our Top 15 Brands grew almost 5% despite the exit from T.G.I.F. Meals, which reduced organic sales by about 90 basis
points.
Emerging Market results were led by Brazil, reflecting the strength of the Quero brand of tomato sauces, ketchup, and
vegetables and the launch of Heinz tomato paste, and China, behind the success of Foodstar. These two
recently-acquired businesses have performed well beyond our initial expectations, and both appear to have considerable
upside. Indonesia, Russia, Mexico, and the Middle East also grew quite strongly in the quarter.
Taking a closer look at Brazil and China, Brazil delivered organic sales growth of 33% in the quarter, with improved
value shares in a number of categories, including ketchup, pasta sauces, and vegetables. Importantly, we have
commenced manufacturing Heinz tomato paste in Brazil and will begin producing Heinz ketchup locally next month to
accelerate its distribution and availability.
In China, our ketchup, condiments, and sauces business delivered strong organic growth of around 20%, driven by the
momentum of our Master, [ph] Long Fong (05:00), and Heinz brands. Our China sauce strategy is focused on these
three core brands, with significant growth potential as we continue to expand across the country. This will be enhanced
upon the completion of the Shanghai factory, which will increase our soy sauce bottling capacity in China by nearly
two-thirds to support continued growth in the world's largest soy sauce market.

Overall, Emerging Markets generated 23% of the company's sales in the quarter, and given our success in Brazil,
Russia, and China, in particular, we are aggressively evaluating both organic and M&A growth initiatives in these
markets.
Our second growth engine, Global Ketchup, also performed well in the quarter, led by solid sales increases in the U.S.,
Brazil, and Russia. We still have considerable opportunity in ketchup, condiments, and sauces, which as a category is
now approaching 50% of total Heinz sales.
We are focused on driving usage and share in our core KC&S business in developed markets, while simultaneously
introducing millions of new middle-class consumers in emerging markets to Heinz ketchup and our core soy sauce
brands. Marketing and M&A initiatives are being increasingly directed against the large opportunity in condiments and
sauces, where we have proven that we have a clear right to win.
And finally, our Top 15 Brands delivered strong organic sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter, led by Heinz, Quero, and
ABC, despite the aforementioned exit from T.G.I.F. Meals. Notably, we have seen improvement in our U.S. business,
with around 65% of our consumer products portfolio now growing volume share. The share improvement reflects
increased brand investment and better execution.
As promised, we are taking significant action to return the U.S. to profitable growth and will continue to do so. We
have made progress on Ore-Ida and Classico, where we have addressed the value propositions while increasing
marketing and innovation behind both brands. We are taking similar action to drive Heinz ketchup growth in the U.S.,
and I am pleased with the response to our outreach in the Hispanic community, where we are building penetration and
trial through multi-lingual advertising and more affordable packaging, like the $0.99 pouch.
We continue to build excitement around our flagship product, with new varieties like balsamic ketchup and jalapeño
ketchup, which we are launching on Cyber Monday through a Facebook campaign. Additionally, to leverage our strong
brand equity and reduce packaging material, we are also introducing new PET ketchup bottles that are inspired by our
iconic 14-ounce glass bottles. The redesigned bottles are being offered in a range of sizes which you will see on the
shelf soon. This is a very clever refresh of our flagship ketchup product that will enhance our merchandising and
marketing capabilities.
The U.S. team has also begun to make progress on alternate channels like drug and dollar stores through improved
distribution and more targeted product offerings aimed at value-oriented consumers. It's important to note that our
efforts to strengthen and improve our largest and most important business are being led by a significantly upgraded
management team, featuring a number of new appointments.
Parenthetically, I am pleased to announce that, once again, Heinz has been ranked number one in overall customer
satisfaction among food manufacturers in the 2012 American Customer Satisfaction Index. Heinz led all food
manufacturers for the 13th consecutive year.
Europe had a somewhat more difficult quarter than we have experienced recently. However, on a relative basis, our
results compare favorably to our peers, primarily due to strength in the UK behind solid innovation and great results in
soup, and the strength of our Russian business. In short, we are holding our own in Europe despite an extremely
challenging economic environment that I will discuss in a minute.
Finally, I want to comment on one other second quarter highlight. This time a year ago, we were discussing challenges
faced by our U.S. Foodservice and Australian businesses, and today I am pleased to advise you that the actions we took
over the past year have significantly improved the results from these two businesses.
Our second quarter results keep Heinz on track to deliver our previously-announced full-year outlook for sales and
profit. For the full year, we expect at least 4% organic sales growth, in line with our results through the first six months;
constant-currency EPS growth of 5% to 8% on a continuing operations basis, excluding special items in fiscal 2012;
and strong operating free cash flow of $1 billion-plus. As a result, we are reaffirming our constant-currency EPS
outlook of $3.52 to $3.62.

Before I turn the call over to Art, I want to share my perspective on the global economy and trends in consumer
behavior. Obviously, we are carefully monitoring the eurozone crisis, like our industry peers, and we are working to
assess whether the current market dislocations are of a temporary nature or systemically long-term. We are seeing signs
that European consumers in general are altering their food shopping and dining habits as the continent struggles with
the debt crisis, steep unemployment, and a variety of austerity and tax regimes. Like their U.S. counterparts, they are
adapting to new economic realities, and they have developed a strong value mindset as a result.
I have challenged our European businesses to see this as an opportunity rather than a roadblock, and believe we will
continue to resiliently and successfully adapt to the economic trends and new consumer behavior in their markets.
Here in the U.S., I have seen some signs of modest economic recovery and improving consumer confidence, although
there is still great uncertainty as the fiscal cliff looms. I don't expect robust economic growth in the U.S. in 2013, but I
am encouraged by the progress in our U.S. business as we invest on our leading brands to drive growth. We need to
remind ourselves that we sell staple products that enhance the foods that people enjoy every day, and we can
successfully adapt to the new value orientation if we are a bit more flexible and nimble in our thinking.
I am still very bullish about the growth in Emerging Markets, where Heinz has grown at a robust 16% rate year-to-date.
Importantly, we are redeploying talent and investment behind our Emerging Market businesses and aggressively
searching for new opportunities, while maintaining an appropriate level of investment in our key developed markets.
To win in this challenging environment, Heinz is focusing as never before on meeting the consumers' changing needs,
accelerating innovation across our brands, and delivering even greater value for our customers. With strong brands and
a balanced global portfolio, I believe that we are as well-positioned to deliver continued growth in a global economy as
anyone. The economy remains challenging, to say the least.
Our strategy continues to be focused on the long-term prize of a significantly larger Emerging Markets business and
global leadership in the very profitable ketchup, condiments and sauces category. Reflecting our focus on driving
global growth and shareholder value, I am pleased to announce that Franck Moison, Colgate's Chief Operating Officer,
Emerging Markets and South Pacific, has been appointed to the Heinz Board of Directors. As the COO responsible for
Colgate's fastest-growing global markets, Franck will bring a strong international perspective, a keen understanding of
global consumer trends, and extensive SAP implementation experience to our board.
In summary, our company remains focused on operating discipline, appropriate investment levels, and profitable
growth, and I believe we have the brands, the businesses, the talent, and the strategy to enhance shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Art and will be back later for your Q&A.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
All right. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, provide a brief update
on the first half, and then discuss our expectations for the second half of the fiscal year.
For the quarter, we achieved double-digit EPS growth from all angles. First, on a continuing-operations basis,
excluding prior-year special items, results increased 11%, to $0.90, and excluding the $0.02 negative impact from
foreign exchange, EPS increased 14%. On a total company reported basis, the EPS increase was even stronger, up 23%,
reflecting $0.08 of one-time productivity charges in Q2 of last fiscal year.
Turning to the P&L scorecard, foreign exchange reduced the top and bottom line by about 2.5%. Excluding this FX
impact, on a constant-currency ex-items basis, sales grew 2.9%, driven by organic sales growth of 3.3%. Importantly,
all of our segments posted positive organic sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin was up 40 basis points, and
constant-currency gross profit grew 4.1%.
We continue to increase our investment in marketing and in additional capabilities. Operating income was up slightly
despite the increased P&L investments. And finally, as mentioned, EPS was up nearly 14%. As projected during last
quarter's call, Q2 EPS benefited from a favorable tax rate, at about 10%. This largely reflects foreign tax planning

initiatives. In short, we delivered solid top- and bottom-line growth, while a favorable tax rate enabled us to make
significant investments in the business.
Looking at the key components of revenue growth, organic sales growth at 3.3% was driven by both volume and price.
Volume growth of 1.4% was led by U.S. consumer products, the UK, Brazil, Russia, and China sauces, partially offset
by declines in the Netherlands and Italy. Price improvements of 1.9% were led by Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, U.S.
Foodservice, and Continental Europe.
And excluding the impact of the prior-year decisions to exit T.G.I. frozen meals and downsize our Long Fong frozen
business in China, organic sales growth was 4.1% for the quarter. And finally, our top line was unfavorably impacted
by two prior-period divestitures and by foreign exchange.
Our 40-basis-point improvement in gross margin was led by the U.S. businesses, along with Russia, Australia, and
Brazil. Market inflation on commodities was about 4% in the quarter, led by tomatoes, potatoes, and sweeteners, and
looking forward, we expect around 4% market inflation on the balance of the year, largely in line with our original
projections.
Now let's take a quick look at top- and bottom-line performance in each one of our key segments. In North American
Consumer Products, we're encouraged at the progress the team is making to drive profitable growth. Organic sales were
up slightly, as volume increased 1.2% and net price decreased 0.8%, as we optimized price points on the Ore-Ida and
Classico brands.
Excluding the impact of selling off the Boston Market license and the asset of T.G.I. frozen meals, U.S. Retail sales
grew by nearly 4%, our strongest performance in nine quarters. Importantly, gross margin was up 70 basis points,
driven by strong productivity, while operating income reflected a significant increase in marketing spending.
Our U.S. Foodservice business posted excellent results for the quarter, with sales up more than 4% and profit up almost
27%. Net price increased about 4%, driven by pricing actions taken in the second half of last year to offset inflation and
volume was roughly flat overall, reflecting current restaurant industry traffic trends. The business posted strong gross
margin and operating income growth as a result of higher sales, effective cost management, and the benefit from
prior-year productivity initiatives.
Across the pond, constant-currency results in Europe were about flat for the quarter. Organic sales were slightly
positive, as double-digit growth in Russia was enough to offset the impact of a weak economy and soft category sales
in Italy. UK volume was up despite cool weather during barbecue season, but net price was down. Importantly, market
share gains were achieved in our large soup, beans, and ketchup businesses; higher gross margins, driven by
productivity improvements, which outpaced net commodity inflation; and constant-currency operating income was flat
to prior year, driven by a higher marketing investment, partially offset by lower SG&A spending.
Asia-Pacific posted very strong results, with constant-currency sales up 4% and profit up almost 27%. Organic sales
growth was 4.1%. Emerging Markets continued to post strong growth, while our developed markets also delivered
organic sales growth in the quarter. Volume was up nearly 2%, led primarily by very strong growth in sauces in China
and Indonesia, partially offset by Long Fong and the timing of Ramadan.
Price was up more than 2%, driven by a double-digit increase in Indonesia to cover commodity inflation. The region
achieved strong gross margin growth, up 130 basis points, driven by Australia, New Zealand, and China. Both
emerging and developed markets posted strong double-digit operating income growth. And as Bill noted, we're very
pleased with the turnaround in Australia. Operating income grew significantly this quarter, a result of the targeted
actions we took to improve commercial capabilities to simplify the business, reduce costs, and focus on better
day-to-day execution.
Now turning to our Rest of World segment, we posted organic and constant-currency sales growth of nearly 20%, with
all regions delivering double-digit organic sales growth. Volume increased by 6.5%, led by Brazil, where we achieved
strong market share growth in vegetables, ketchup, and pasta sauce. Notably, Quero recently became the number-one
brand of vegetables in Brazil.

Mexico also achieved strong volume growth in the quarter, as our ketchup and baby food businesses attained record
market shares in October. The net price increased by 13%, led by strong pricing in South America. Gross profit dollars
increased, but gross margin decreased as a result of high inflation costs in Venezuela, and operating income reflects
lower profitability in Venezuela and increased investments in marketing capabilities in Brazil.
Now moving to cash, operating free cash flow was $155 million for the quarter, up $24 million, driven by higher net
income and slightly lower capital spending. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $62
million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the
year.
Now let's take a very brief look at results for the first half. On a constant-currency basis, year-to-date sales are up 3.5%,
operating income up almost 3%, and EPS up more than 14%. For the first half, organic sales are up 4%, gross margin
has increased, and we've continued to invest in both marketing and capabilities. The year-to-date tax rate is about 14%,
and has helped drive EPS and fund our investments in the business.
And looking at the balance sheet scorecard, capital spending is flat to prior year as a percentage of revenue. Cash
conversion cycle improved significantly, down 6 days to 38 days, largely driven by better inventory management.
Year-to-date cash flow of $131 million is below prior year due to the timing of receivables securitization and cash
taxes. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year, consistent with our typical annual phasing.
Net debt to EBITDA is flat to prior year and remains low, at 2.1 times. And ROIC has increased nearly 200 basis
points, reflecting higher net income and the benefits from last year's productivity initiatives.
Now, let's switch gears, and I'd like to make a couple of comments on the second half of the fiscal year, and as Bill
said, today, we're reaffirming our original top and bottom-line outlook. In the second half, we expect increased
innovation and 4%-plus organic sales growth; accelerating gross margin improvements; incremental investment at
global marketing, Emerging Markets sales capabilities and the SAP program; and a higher effective tax rate, which is
anticipated to be in the low to mid-20%s during the third quarter and a bit higher in the fourth quarter. For the full year,
we expect a rate of around 20%.
EPS should be at about the same level in Q3 and Q4 this year, which is in line with our full-year constant-currency
outlook.
So, in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a challenging environment; driving strong top-line growth
in Emerging markets, Global Ketchup and our Top 15 Brands; delivering higher gross margin despite the difficult
market environment; and making significant investments in the business, enabled by a favorable tax rate.
With that, we'll turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg?

<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: I guess the obvious question is on the tax rate. Can you just help us understand how
sustainable a rate of about 20% is going forward? I realize some of these are one-time and some of these are permanent,
but as we think about perhaps your cash going forward into 2014 and 2015, maybe any parameters you can help us with
on that would be appreciated.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. Ken, I think, as we mentioned on the last earnings call, we feel very good about
the tax work that we've done to date and where we're coming out for the year. We expect this year to be around 20%.
And I think, at this point, our plans in FY 2014 call for right at somewhere in that same ZIP Code. So we believe it's
relatively sustainable, and each quarter, and each month, each year, we continue to work on new foreign tax planning
initiatives to keep the rate low and in line.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yeah. I think, Ken, as we continue to expand even more outside the United States, and
particularly in some of these emerging markets that have low flat taxes, there are real opportunities for tax planning,
and our guys do a very good job of exercising those opportunities and leveraging them. So our view is, going forward,
as Art said, for certainly next fiscal year, I think we feel pretty good about being fairly consistent with this year. I'm not
going to say anything beyond next fiscal year because I have no idea what's going to happen to tax regimes around the
world, but certainly for the next six quarters, the two this year and next year – and the four next year, we should be in
pretty good shape.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from Alexia Howard. Your line is now live. Please proceed.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Good morning, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone. Hi, there. Can I ask about the frozen entrées business? I know
we only get a sliver of the Smart Ones brand within frozen entrées, but it looked quite weak this last quarter. Could you
talk about what you're seeing for Smart Ones overall as it enters adjacent eating occasions, or is it actually still under a
lot of pressure competitively?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Well, let me step back, and let's talk about the category for a minute, and then I'll come
back and talk specifically about our business. In the category, over the last five years, has lost 20 million cases, about a
third of the total category volume. It's lost $500 million in sales. Within that period, our overall business, as we define
it, is up 2.5 to 3 share points. Currently, what we're seeing is very strong performance in our breakfast business, good
performance in some of our sides and in terms of the snacks. In our base entrée business, we are not promoting as
aggressively as maybe we could, and that's a decision we've made. And so the focus has really been on frozen, on
getting Ore-Ida and our snacks business growing, which we did very successfully in the second quarter.
So, generally, Smart Ones was not as strong in the second quarter as I think we would have liked. We'll see how the
season plays out. But my bigger issue, Alexia, continues to be the nutritional category, where the industry has lost
about a third of its sales over the last five years, and so rather than chasing volume in a category that's still not sure
where it's going, we're playing on innovation, we're doing a lot of good things, particularly in breakfast, which is the
fastest-growing day part in the freezer case, and really focusing our other efforts on Ore-Ida and our frozen snacks
businesses, which are performing quite well.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

<A - Margaret Nollen>: Good morning, Thilo.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the success – or how the Doy Pack is doing in the
alternative channels in the U.S., especially given that dollar stores seem to be slowing down?
<A - William R. Johnson>: It's doing very well in the Hispanic markets, where we've supported it with multilingual
advertising, Spanish language advertising, particularly on the West Coast, parts of the Southwest and in the Northeast.
And so I would say it's been a key component of our success in those markets. It's moved into the top 10 SKUs that we
sell in those areas. In other markets, I think we need to do a better job of getting a more prominent distribution, but
generally it's playing in line in most markets with where we thought it would be, and the Hispanic markets, doing much
better.
I think, outside the U.S., Doy Pack continues to be an incredible boon to the business. In Indonesia, majority of our
growth is coming in condiments and sauces, which is being led by Doy Pack, same thing in Russia. The launch in
Mexico has been nothing more than a heroic success. In fact, we can't supply baby food in Mexico. We've just started
up another line in Guadalajara, but we are literally out of stock. We launched three SKUs in baby food last year. We're
now up to five, soon to be seven or eight. Our share is now in double-digits, and the same thing on ketchup, where
we're now at close to a 20% share in Mexico from 0% three or four years ago. And again, most of that's being driven by
Doy Pack. We've launched it in the UK.
So Doy Pack is going to be a clear component in the company's success going forward, particularly given the price
point. And in the U.S., I'm pleased with where we are in the Hispanic markets, and I think we'll see more upside going
forward from Doy Pack. And I think the other thing you can count on is a lot more Doy Pack initiatives around the
company, both in developed and emerging markets, going beyond just ketchup.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: But does the slowdown of dollar stores, does that concern you, given your desire to grow more, or
get more of a presence in alternative channels?
<A - William R. Johnson>: It would, Thilo, if we had a big presence in dollar stores, which we don't. We are just now
getting into dollar stores, and we've cracked Dollar General on Ore-Ida in the substantial distribution gain on 1.5-pound
Ore-Ida bags. And so, for us, as a company that's grossly underdeveloped in dollar stores, no, it is not an issue for us
yet. It is still a significant opportunity for the future growth. And frankly, Doy Pack is still not fully penetrated in dollar
stores. It's done very well in the bodegas and very well in the Hispanic-oriented markets around the U.S. So, no, for us,
it is not an issue yet. Talk to me in two years, and maybe at that point in time it will be, but no, I don't think right now
I'm concerned about that. I'm concerned about getting it on the shelf in dollar stores.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: All right, appreciate it. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe. Your line is now live. Please
proceed.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning. Just my one question, that would be in relation to the North
American business, and you certainly have made some pretty heavy marketing investments. I think we're starting to see
some sales recovery, finally some momentum in the business. And I think you've outlined, Bill, a higher gross margin
for the quarter. I just wanted to understand if that division – I guess to get your assessment of the progression on the top
line, and then if you think that business can grow its profits this year, given the investments you're making.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yeah, a couple of responses there. First, if you back out T.G.I.F. in the quarter, the U.S.
business was up over 4 points in volume growth, so the U.S. business is responding to the marketing, which is, frankly,
a balance of promotion and media and traditional marketing support. And I think we feel pretty good about where we're
headed from a volume standpoint once we get the noise of T.G.I.F. behind us, and we do have to address the Smart

Ones question that was raised earlier.
I think, from a profit standpoint, I would be very pleased this year with the U.S. company coming in, plus or minus, a
few points versus last year. It will just depend on how much investment we make in the second half, and we had a
significant increase – and I want to underline the word significant – in the second quarter. We don't break out
marketing spending by business unit for a lot of obvious reasons, but it is not unreasonable to say marketing spending
in the U.S. was up well into the double-digits in the second quarter, the bulk of that behind ketchup in the Hispanic
advertising and some advertising in the Southeast, and Ore-Ida, in addition to some stuff we've done on Classico and
frankly on snacks.
So I think I feel better about the prospects of the U.S. going forward from a top-line standpoint and a share standpoint;
the most recent share, as I said, 65% volume growth, in my comments. But in the last four weeks, volume share growth
was almost 78% of the total business, so we are seeing a response. But there's no doubt that we are intentionally
pressuring profits in the U.S. this year as we work to restore the top-line growth. Fortunately, we're able to do that not
only because of the tax rate but because of the strength of the Foodservice business and the strength of our Emerging
Market businesses in terms of growing the bottom line.
So I think – one of the benefits of running a portfolio company, like we do, is it gives us an enormous amount of
flexibility in terms of where we reprioritize investment, and so I think you'll see significant investment increases in the
U.S. as we continue to drive the top line.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: We've talked before at great length about Smart Ones and the frozen entrée business. I
guess my question is, in relation to that business, is it increase in marketing, or is it more about an increase in
promotion to really address that, if you will, or fix that issue in that business?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Well, I've been pretty consistent, Chris, for almost four years, saying I'm not going to
chase a declining market, and I continue to believe that. So we're monitoring the market and trying to be as balanced
and nuanced as we can in terms of how we prioritize our investment dollars. And right now I'm getting a significant
positive return on Ore-Ida. I'm seeing a good response in frozen snacks, and I'm seeing a terrific growth upside in
ketchup. And so, as a consequence of that, we'll put the investments behind where we're seeing the growth. If I put a lot
of investment behind Smart Ones, and I'm chasing a declining market, there's just not going to be the return I want.
So, as I said, breakfast is doing well. You continue to see us focus on breakfast. We've got a lot of new activity coming
during the season in terms of innovation and some new products. And then we've got some interesting things over the
longer term that you'll see over the next 6 to 12 months in Smart Ones. I certainly don't want to imply that we're
walking away from the business, because we're not. It's critically important to us.
But I think you can read into that that the dollars we're allocating for investment in the freezer case, we're going to put
first where we're getting our best return, which in this case right now is Ore-Ida and snacks. And we'll manage the
Smart Ones business the best way we can. And right now, I will tell you that I still think innovation and marketing
behind Smart Ones is the way to go rather than get into a football promotion initiative that ultimately nobody wins. But
until the category starts stabilizing again, I just hate like heck to chase volume.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks so much for the time.

Bill was just addressing, which was you mentioned two-thirds of the business is having volume growth, and are you
going to focus on bending that trend on the remaining third, like on Smart Ones, and it seems like for now you're going
to focus your incremental spend on the – what perhaps has a higher ROI in the near term, which is on the two-thirds

that already has a little bit of momentum. Is that a fair characterization?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yeah, I think so. And again, David, as I said, in the last four weeks, we're at 78% of our
business is in volume growth in the U.S. And so what we're trying to understand is where we're getting the best
leverage both from a top-line standpoint and a bottom-line standpoint. It's one of the reasons you saw the margin
improve in the quarter, because our investments behind our leading margin brands, which would be ketchup and
Ore-Ida, gave us a good response in the quarter. And I think, so we're going to continue to balance it. And I've been
very pleased with the turnaround in Ore-Ida. I continue to believe ketchup is still an opportunity in the U.S.
I think the new package launch in the U.S. behind something we have an internal name for that basically leads to
transforming the ketchup category is something that we're very excited about. We've launched 38-ounce and 34-ounce
sizes, and in specialty items in 14-ounce sizes. The consumer response in research has been extraordinary. The
Hispanic response in terms of where we are with our marketing efforts has been great. So what we're doing is we're
choosing and prioritizing against where we think the greatest leverage is to the P&L and to the top line. And so, yeah,
it's not necessarily an issue of triage, but it is going to be an issue, who's going to give me the best return for
incremental dollars.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And then separate question on gross margins in the Rest of the World segment, could you
perhaps talk a little bit about that and what your outlook is in that segment, please?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yeah, it's a story of two tales, really, two cities. Virtually every other business in the Rest
of the World segment grew margin, including Brazil, which grew their margin significantly. It was an issue in
Venezuela. And part of the issue in Venezuela relates to the timing of the elections and the trade backing off in terms of
buying product, and the inflation rate which we have not been able to price up to in the Venezuelan market. So I think
if you back Venezuela out of the Rest of the World, you'll see a dramatically different margin growth story, particularly
in Brazil, where I was very pleased. We grew margins 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter in Brazil.
I think the second thing that you need to keep in mind is we are coming off, in Rest of World, an incredible quarter last
year. We were up 150% last year in operating profit. And so we knew Rest of World from a bottom-line standpoint was
not going to have the kind of quarter we had last year. But I have to tell you the Brazilian business has been nothing
more than a continued surprise to me in terms of how well it is doing. We're seeing continued growth in Mexico, great
performance in the rest of Latin America, ex-Venezuela, and really strong results coming out of the Middle East.
And so I feel pretty good about where we are. But Venezuela is the story of the Rest of World in second quarter in
terms of the dilution on margin, and that will address itself over time as they finish the elections in December on the
state basis, and then we get some clarity on what's going to happen going forward.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: And, David, just to follow up on yours and Alexia's question on our nutritional meals
performance, we do some extensive analysis behind the scenes, because we'll take it SKU by SKU, and as you guys
know, and Alexia, you alluded to, Smart Ones gets reported across probably four sub-categories, and – be it breakfast,
et cetera. We're seeing much better performance all-in than what you're seeing from just the entrée or meal portion of
that business, as we have shifted the portfolio more towards some of these day part opportunities. So we actually are
doing well relative to the category, picking up share.

<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Can you guys update us on the incremental investment plan for the year? When you laid out
the year back on the fourth quarter Analyst Day, the plan for the year was to incrementally put $120 million into the
business; $70 million into marketing, and I think about $50 million into a number of areas to increase your capabilities.
So I'd like to hear about both areas. And then one thing I would say, I think to my numbers right now, I've got
marketing for the first six months of the year up about $10 million, or about 4%, so if everything is in line, then that
would suggest a fairly massive marketing reinvestment in the final two quarters, and I'm curious if that plan has
changed at all.
<A - William R. Johnson>: The plan has not changed, but you're looking at actual currency as opposed to constant
currency. We were up 13% in the second quarter, and we're up year-to-date between 8% and 10%, so I think we're
tracking right where we thought we would be. And I will tell you, some of that marketing may be deployed a little
differently in the second half of the year. We may put some back in promotion, depending on the market and depending
on where we are, but we are still on track for the investments, significant investments in boots on the ground in the
emerging markets. And it's really interesting, if you look at the three markets that benefited the most, China condiments
and sauces, Russia, and Brazil, those are our three best-performing Emerging Market businesses along with Indonesia
during the second quarter and through the first half of the year. Russia sales organically were up around 14%;
obviously, condiments and sauces, as you saw, in China up around 20%; and Brazil up around 33%.
So we're seeing a very good response from that. We've made significant investments in SAP, particularly in Canada,
now in Europe. We've just turned Spain on, following the success in Germany. So we continue to roll out those
investments. Marketing spend, as I said, on a constant-currency basis, is up 8% to 10% so far this year, very strong in
the second quarter.
So we're about where we thought we would be, David. I think the qualification I'll give you is, in the second half, if we
see better leverage on the promotion side, that's where we'll go. Now, having said that, I want to be clear that promotion
spending as defined by deal spending for the company is not up year-on-year through the first half of the year. I won't
be any more specific than that, for a lot of reasons, but we are not up. So the opportunity to deploy differently will be
predicated on the category, the country, the business, and where the opportunities are.
But we're still tracking for a double-digit increase in marketing spending on the year on a constant-currency basis,
which is how we defined it in May, and for a substantial improvement in capabilities around the company, and we're
seeing really good returns on that. Even SAP in Europe is starting – we're starting to see a very positive response from
the investments in the Benelux a couple of years ago. Spain has gone in extremely well. Germany has gone in well, and
it allowed us to consolidate the German business into the rest of Continental Europe when we sold the Sonnen business
earlier this year. So our plans have not changed. The prioritization of how those dollars are allocated may be modified a
bit in the second half.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. I'll stick to the one question and pass it along. Thank you.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Thanks, David.

<A - Margaret Nollen>: Hey, good morning.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Meg, good morning. So if the investment is still $120 million, but you are getting a little bit
more of a benefit on the tax rate than you expected – I guess the prior guidance was 21%, flat year-over-year, and now
it's a little lower – shouldn't you have a little more money to reinvest? And what form do you think that would take? Do
you think you would – would it be going from $120 million of reinvestment to $140 million or something like that?

<A - William R. Johnson>: Well, right now, we're going to stick with the guidance we have because we haven't
moved any of the numbers relative to the guidance, and so I think, in that context, Rob, I don't want to be any more
enlightened or enlightening in terms of how we're going to do that. The other thing you've got to remember, we're
dealing with a world right now that we can't figure out. The turmoil in the world, you tell me how the fiscal cliff is
going to be resolved, you tell me how Europe's going to be resolved, you tell me what's going to happen to currency in
the second half of the year, you tell me what's going to happen to consumer confidence. And so right now we're sort of
sitting pat until we get a better sense, certainly as we approach the end of this calendar year and into the beginning of
next calendar year, how all this stuff unfolds.
Right now, in Europe, you're dealing with various austerity and tax regimes that aren't working very well, and the
efficacy of those is being challenged. We've got consumer unhappiness throughout the European continent, but
particularly in Southern Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula. We're seeing similar things happening in the U.S., as
foodservice traffic now sort of reflects the anticipation of what's going to happen with the cliff. I know I don't share the
confidence in our political process that others seem to be believing in. And so I think, from our standpoint, we're just
sitting until we know where we are.
The other thing I will tell you, tax is never a certainty. While we feel pretty good about where we are, things happen.
And so I think we just want to keep where we are going and work from that. I'm pleased with the execution of the
company. I'm pleased with where we're headed. I think emerging markets continue to look very promising, and if
anything, I will continue to invest in more boots on the ground in emerging markets before I'd probably put more into
specific marketing. The boots on the ground is giving us a very solid, tangible return in all these markets. I'd like to see
us do a little bit more in Indonesia and maybe a little bit more in India, and then we have a lot of other initiatives in
place.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Can I ask a question on cash flow to Art? It's down $98 million year-to-date for operating free
cash flow. But net income's up, the tax rate is down, your CapEx is pretty stable; what was the driver, again, for the
cash flow, and should we see a big improvement? I think you're guiding to $1.1 billion in cash flow for the year. Has
that changed?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. Rob, a lot of it's timing-related, associated with cash tax payments. As you
know, book tax versus cash tax is often very differently timed, so that's certainly part of it. Also the timing in some of
our securitization activities is different this year than in prior years. So, net-net, we expect a strong back half. We're
projecting to $1 billion-plus in terms of operating free cash flow, and I think we want to maintain some flexibility there
in terms of the level of capital spending, particularly as it relates to Emerging Markets. So I think $1 billion-plus we
feel good about at this point.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney. Your line is now live. Please proceed.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Good morning. Thank you very much, Meg and team. Bill, I wanted to get back to the
volume a little bit, and particularly your strategy surrounding that. When I look over the past four years, it's been –
you've seen some significant volume declines across, basically, Europe, certainly Foodservice and North America, and
now here, it's notable, the first quarter, I believe, in a while where you had a negative price mix in those, so you have
moderating pricing. You've seen sequential improvement in volume. So I wonder if – it seems like, broadly, in the food
industry now, consumers have reacted to brands lowering price by improving volume. That's what the data's telling us.
And is there – do you expect a period where you're going to invest in price a little bit more to drive more volume? I
know you've called out some categories that you don't think are worth it, but do you intend to keep that going and
accelerate volume through? It seems like these price investments are working in that direction. Thanks.

<A - William R. Johnson>: Yeah, it's a mix of categories and a mix of countries and a mix of businesses. I think,
generally, historical truths are true, which is that if you lower price, consumers will respond. But I think a lot of what
we're doing is being driven by mix and the way that sizing, the price points in terms of smaller sizes and in terms of
different kinds of recipes and so forth, Jonathan. But, yeah, I think, as I said a few minutes ago in response to David's
question about marketing spend in the second half, if we believe we can generate a better return by leveraging more
promotion as opposed to just generalized traditional marketing, that's the way we will go. But it will depend on the
business. In ketchup right now in the U.S., we're getting a great response from very traditional advertising, as we are in
Ore-Ida after balancing where we needed to be on price. In the Emerging Markets, we're getting very good price. And
the thing you've got to remember in those markets is you have general inflation which is also being reflected in wages
and so forth, so the consumer is not as put off by price, and private label is not a big issue.
But I think, generally, even in the developed world, private label is no longer showing the kind of growth they did, and
it's really going to be a function of creating value in the mind of the consumer, whether that value manifests itself in
terms of better innovation, premium products, superior performance, or a combination of promoted volume and/or
better price points. It's just going to depend on the category and on where we think we're getting the best return. And,
clearly, in some of these businesses, price is going to be a better lever than other businesses. Clearly, in other cases,
marketing is going to be the better lever. And what we're trying to do is evaluate, on an elasticity basis, exactly where
we get the greatest leverage.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Okay, great. And at the risk of sounding contumacious, I'm going to ask one follow-up
question. Can you give us the volume number for the Top 15 Brands organically that you gave us for sales? Meg, do
you have that, or can follow up offline?
<A - William R. Johnson>: I actually don't have that number. Again, the Top 15 Brands, if you exclude – and I think
in this case you'd have to take T.G.I.F. out – we're well up over 5% organically. And since much of that was driven by
ABC, Brazil, and the Heinz brand, I would guess, off the top of my mind, that a third of that's volume-related and
two-thirds of it's price-related, but it could be more like 40/60. But there is volume growth -
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - William R. Johnson>: There is volume growth in there, and there is some price growth in there because of the
mix of the Emerging Market businesses in there.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Hello, Meg. I wanted to circle back to the cash flow statement and build on some of Rob's
questions. CapEx is running a little bit lighter than I think your initial 3.8% to 4% guidance for the year. Is what we see
in the first half more reflective of where the full year is going to come in, or should we stick with that 3.8% to 4%?
<A - William R. Johnson>: We'll be right around the 3.8% to 4% – we could be 3.7%, we could be 3.9% – because
we have a lot of investment in the second half of the year in the emerging markets. We're just finishing the Shanghai
factory, which I'm hoping will be open early in the new calendar year. We have started the Foshan, China baby food
factory, which we're going to try to have open in 2015. We've got a lot of investment going into India. We also have
SAP investment coming in the second half of the year, and obviously the finalization of the Innovation Center in
Europe. There's a fair amount of capital investment established in the second half of the year. Frankly, my perspective
is, the lower I can keep that number, the happier I am, as everybody who works for me knows.

The reality is, given the pressure we have on volume in the emerging markets, we have to provide capacity. As I said,
we put a new pouch line into Mexico, and we have a second one coming very shortly. We have a new pouch line going
into Brazil. We're going to have a second one of those coming very shortly. We've got – we are starting to produce
ketchup in Brazil in the next 30 or 40 days. I think you've also got a fair amount of activity in the Asian markets. China,
in particular; is an area we're going to have to continue to invest in. So I think we'll be right around that number. To be
honest with you, if I had my druthers, I'd try to bring it down, but right now, given the SAP implementation and the
capacity needs I have in the business, I can't.
The final thing is we're pretty much out of capacity on Dip & Squeeze. We're going to look at a fourth line on Dip &
Squeeze. Where that line goes is yet to be determined. It'll be interesting to see where that line goes, and I think you
should not assume that line's automatically going into the U.S. But that is the line that we will have to start talking
about in the second half of the year because we're out of capacity, and the emerging markets are all yelling and
screaming at me for Dip & Squeeze capability. So it's mainly about SAP implementation and about adding capacity in
the emerging markets where we're getting significant growth.
<Q - Jason English>: Thank you for that. One more question, and I'll pass it on. You're maintaining your full-year
organic sales growth guidance of 4%. Your prior-year comparison's become a little more onerous as we get to the back
half. Bill, can you detail some of the initiatives that you have in place that's going to help you drive that growth?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yeah, I think there's a couple of things to keep in mind. One, we're spending a lot of
marketing. We'd better see that kind of volume growth in the second half of the year. Secondly, innovation in the UK is
up 50% year-on-year in the second half. We have a significant amount of innovation in the Emerging Markets,
particularly behind pouch initiatives. We've got a significant amount of innovation coming in the U.S., more which I'll
detail at CAGNY. We have a lot of activity in other parts of Europe as well, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia.
So there's a significant amount of new product activity in the second half of the year and a significant response to the
marketing spending that we've initiated in the first half of the year, much of which really didn't begin until the second
quarter, and you'll see a follow-through in the third quarter.
So I think, in that context, I feel reasonably sanguine – let me underline those two words, reasonably sanguine – about
strong volume growth or strong organic sales growth in the second half of the year. The Emerging Markets, as I said,
last year at this time, relative to the second half, should be much stronger in the second half of this year than they were
in the first half of this year. We're seeing huge pickup in Brazil. Hopefully, the new ketchup line will be ready. We've
launched Heinz tomato paste. It's doing very well. The enabling lines we've now put in Mexico will allow us to start
shipping baby food more aggressively.
What we're doing in Indonesia with the launches in the second half, which are all predominantly condiments and sauces
launches; a lot of activity in terms of our expansion of our condiments and sauces business in China, as well as some
Foodservice initiatives; and the focus on ketchup, the continued strength of ketchup in the European Continent; and
then just the general success of Russia should help us drive volume in the second half of the year. I feel pretty good
about the third quarter. The fourth quarter is really where we're going to have the big measurement year-on-year. But
the forecasts coming in from our operating teams are all pretty optimistic about volume growth or organic sales growth
in the second half of the year, so right now we see no reason to back off that. And I'll remind you we have generated
about 4% through the first half this year, and that's without the benefit of some of the marketing that you'll see in the
second half.

<A - William R. Johnson>: Hi, Ann.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: I wanted to ask about Emerging Markets and the opportunities for M&A and the opportunity or
the potential you could hit your 30% target earlier than fiscal 2016?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Ann, if we don't hit it before fiscal 2016, I will be incredibly disappointed and highly
annoyed with a lot of the people that work for me. We have a – this is the first quarter I can say this now in a while. We
have so many active M&A initiatives in the emerging markets; we literally had a meeting last week to decide how
we're going to put them in priority. We have a number of very close-in initiatives underway in the three markets I
mentioned in my initial comments, as well as other markets where I think we need to improve our footprint. For
perspective, I just came back from a 15-day around-the-world trip, where I was in various parts of Asia and various
parts of Europe, and we are aggressively looking at and aggressively in the process of M&A activity. And, yes, I will
be very, very disappointed if we're not 30% before fiscal 2016. I really will. And this is no guarantee, obviously. People
really don't care about my level of disappointment. But I will tell you...
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Oh, yes...
<A - William R. Johnson>: ...that I would be surprised and unhappy if we're not there first, given what we have both
organically in terms of the opportunity for the new capacity we're adding and the M&A initiatives we have underway.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: That is very helpful, thank you. And if I could sneak one more in there, how are price gaps
with Ore-Ida in the U.S.?
<A - William R. Johnson>: They have narrowed a bit. They're still there, but they have narrowed a bit. And as a
result, in addition to the marketing, the Justice League for Potatoes marketing, which I frankly was not real high on, it's
done a very good job of opening the gates that mothers or families had closed in terms of children wanting to eat
Ore-Ida, has done very well. So the Ore-Ida business has responded well. There's still a gap, but we've narrowed the
gap to where it needs to be.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Karen Lamark. Your line is now live. Please
proceed.
<Q - Karen Ann Lamark>: Good morning.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Hey, Karen.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Good morning.
<Q - Karen Ann Lamark>: Hey, guys. You mentioned, in North America, making inroads in the drugstore and dollar
store distribution channels. How much did that contribute to sales in the quarter, and maybe if you could give us some
color or expectations on sort of the cadence of the sales over the next few quarters? And then a follow-up on that.
<A - William R. Johnson>: All right. Yeah, I don't know how much it contributed to second quarter. It wasn't much,
because we're just now in the process of getting it on the shelf, certainly in Dollar General and some of the other stores.
Pharmacy is coming along quite well. We're still grossly underdeveloped in both channels. So I would say it's more a
second-half story than it is a first-half story. And to be honest with you, I don't have any idea how much it was in the
second quarter. I don't think it was very significant, based on what I'm hearing from the operating team, so I think it's
still going to be a second-half and fiscal 2014 story for the company. But we're so far behind where many of our peers
are that it's still a big opportunity.

And in terms of volume going forward, clearly – and I assume you're talking the U.S., but if you're not, please let me
know. I feel reasonably – again, reasonably good about the activities we have in the second half of the year. I think the
management team in the U.S. has done an excellent job of refocusing on innovation. I was at the Innovation Center in
North America a week ago Friday, and spent the whole afternoon with them on reviewing a litany of the new product
initiatives underway and some of the activities that'll start hitting the market late in this fiscal year, which will have
some benefit in Q4, but really should have the bulk of their benefit next year, beyond pipeline fill.
So, again, a lot of activity in potatoes, a lot of activity in sauces, and a lot of activity in some other areas that I think
will be interesting. If you look at our business, the strongest category growth in any of our businesses in developed
markets is vinegar and barbecue sauce in the U.S. Vinegar is growing as a category at a double-digit rate, as are we,
and so we're going to leverage that and look for opportunities there as well. So, again, I think there's some opportunities
in the second half of the year to drive better volume than we did in the first half in the U.S. company.
<Q - Karen Ann Lamark>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: All right, well, I see we're almost out of time, and I know we're right up against another call. I
know there's several of you in queue. I apologize. We're going to take one more.
Operator
Thank you certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman. Your line is now live. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Right, last but not the least.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Never.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: Happy Thanksgiving, Eric.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Never, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Happy Thanksgiving to all of you and your families.
<A - William R. Johnson>: To you too.
<A - Margaret Nollen>: And to you.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, I guess, with time short, I'll give one question. Bill, you've been adamant about giving
out the cash flow in terms of dividends versus share repo. With seems like the high likelihood that rates are going up on
dividends, how do you and the board feel about the approach to the distribution of the cash?
<A - William R. Johnson>: The same way. I think, right now, if you go back to the Senate bill, the Senate bill capped
dividend tax at 20%, plus a 3.8% Medicare tax. The president wants to take it to ordinary income tax. The Republicans
want to keep it at 15 points plus the 3.8%. So I think there's likely to be some kind of compromise on dividend tax.
Secondly, most of our investors, Eric, are still telling us they'd prefer to see it in the form of dividends and share
buybacks. And so our strategy continues to be, in terms of the deployment of cash, M&A, and as I said, we have an
aggressive pipeline full of M&A, a lot of initiatives underway, several of which I hope would get done sooner rather
than later, but we'll see. As you know, that's a tricky game. And then the second use would be cash, and then obviously
we'll continue to buy back stock in order to prevent dilution from outstanding shares.
But, right now, we don't see a change. I don't know how the fiscal cliff is going to manifest itself, how it's going to
manage out. Obviously, if we start hearing from our investors and we start seeing a dramatic shift, then we'll be flexible
in terms of what's going to create the most value. It's just, right now, our belief is, based on what we're hearing, that
dividends are still the best way for us to deploy cash back to our investors. That may change, and if it does, then
obviously we'll modify our approach, but right now that's where we are.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
