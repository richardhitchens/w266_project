Robert H. Benmosche
Good morning and thank you, Liz.
We have a lot to cover today, but let me start with the fact that it's a major quarter for us. We have paid back the
Federal Reserve. That's two years ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, that requires us to take our final charge of $3.3
billion.
Let me ask each of you to pay attention to the DTA, the deferred tax asset. We have now written off $23 billion. That's
the 80% of the company that was taken by the government to give us the loan in the first place. While we've taken the
charge in this quarter, bringing it to a total of $23 billion over the last three years, what it represents to us is that over
the next few years, we will not pay about a third of that in taxes. So we will report after-tax income to all of you taking
into account what would be the taxes. When it comes into the holding company because of the DTA, we will actually
have that money available to fund our capital management program over the next several years.
So it's behind us. We have it done. We are now dealing with the U.S. Treasury shares as we think about their
monetizing that and paying back the American taxpayer. So we're finished on that aspect. Our debt has been covered by
the Fed. We're ready to move forward.
If you look at the results in the quarter, we continue to show strong operating results of the company. We have a lot of
pluses and minuses that went on, as you all saw. But the fact is the underlying core businesses are doing extremely
well.
If we look at Chartis, for example, we did have significant cat losses in the first quarter, unprecedented as you see not
only for us but for others. But the fact is the top line grew without Fuji about 6.2%. In addition to that, we continue to
deemphasize those lines that have caused difficulty in the reserves in the past. And so we see that at the end of the year,
those lines represented about 6.7% of our premiums. And by the way, in 2006 those lines represented 22% of our
premiums. They're now close to 5% in the first quarter. So we continue to deemphasize those lines. And at the same
time, we're continuing to grow the top line of the organization.
We did, in fact, close on a Berkshire transaction, which we've reported to all of you. You can see that we bought $3.5
billion of coverage basically for about $1.6 billion. But more importantly, we got back $200 million, which says that
we were redundant $200 million at that point in time. And so when we talk about the quality of our reserves at Chartis,
we continue to stress that when we compare what we've done at that end of the year to outside actuaries, we are still
above the midpoint essential estimates of all of the outside actuaries that looked at it, which we historically have never
been. So we have strong reserves.
And some people may say, "But wait a minute, you just added to the reserve development in the first quarter. So if
you're doing okay, how could you possibly add to the first quarter?" And I think it's important that we answer that right
at this point in time because we want to make sure it's clear that we believe with a great deal of confidence that we have
our reserves correct. So Rob, if you could, who is the CFO of Chartis, explain the legal settlement that's anticipated and
why we chose to do what we did in the first quarter on reserve development?
Robert S. H. Schimek
Sure, good morning. The largest component of the prior-year development in Chartis relates to the settlement
agreement that we've disclosed in Footnote 11 of our 10-Q. Following that settlement, we restated our statutory
financial statements dating back into the 1980s, which resulted in an increase in our participation in the workers
compensation residual markets. While we have a significant amount of IBNR [Incurred But Not Reported] already
established for the years that this would relate to, we concluded it was prudent to add to the reserves rather than to use a
portion of our existing IBNR to cover this assessment.

Robert H. Benmosche
So as you can see, this is conservatism on our part, but we want to make sure that we got this right and we keep it right
on a go-forward basis.
I also want to stress, and that's why I think it's important that you understand the deferred tax asset. We do have about
$2 billion of stack capital sitting in Chartis, and it's important that we preserve that $2 billion. And because of the
accounting rules, we did the Berkshire deal primarily to show from a GAAP basis that we would have the profits in the
future such that we could preserve that $2 billion. And so the transaction was done more around the DTA and
preserving our capital at this time in Chartis rather than concern about our reserves and what has been set up for the
asbestos.
So that's pretty much where Chartis is. We have, in fact, reorganized, and its position is better for the future. And so we
want to make sure we focus on commercial as well as consumer. We're focusing on ourselves as a global organization.
While we have a U.S. and international operation, we have to operate far more seamlessly, like our clients do, and
make sure that we're focusing not necessarily on the top line, but getting the right combined ratios and the right
risk-adjusted return for the equity we have committed the business. Peter is in that role now. We've made that change in
the first quarter. And he is off and running and he is going extremely well for us.
If I move on to SunAmerica, again, they had a very strong quarter. You could see in 2010 we had strong positive flows
on annuities, for example. Our life sales are starting to come back, and the first quarter also showed very positive flows
on our annuity products. And we continue to be number one in the banking system on selling fixed annuities, and it's
very well received. And you can see also they have good, stable income.
On ILFC [International Lease Finance Corporation], we show that we sold some planes in the first quarter. And keep in
mind that ILFC is not just about buying and leasing aircraft. It's about managing the fleet. And up until now, we have
not done a very effective job over the last many years of dealing with legacy aircraft. We are now dealing with that, but
you see a charge in the first quarter. And we still have a profit at ILFC, but you'll see us throughout the year selling off
aircraft. But we still see this business on a normalized basis earning about $600 million. But in that $600 million, we
also are assuming about $300 million of impairments or costs related to selling some of the older planes that we have in
the inventory.
But we also announced that we have a 133 new aircraft we're going to be buying to continue to keep this business
strong in the marketplaces, as the leader in the marketplace. And we also have approximately – I think it's seventy-four
787s on order, and they're early delivery of 787s, so that also gives us a strong edge there.
We continue to run this business as an investment. We have the debt worked out. We have the future worked out in
terms of how we manage the fleet. We've got a strong management team in place now. And to the extent over the next
period of time, year or two, whatever it is, if we can monetize some of this asset, we're giving that serious
consideration. So again, it is not core to AIG, but we think we've got it well run, well managed and well positioned in
the company.
United Guaranty, again, we see that business showing a profit this quarter. Their new model is working extremely well
at the front end. They're still maintaining good sales. We see the performance of the new business very strong. They
continue to work on claims management, doing an effective job there as well. We expect that business to enhance our
profitability going forward and not be a drag as it has been in the last couple of years.
So I'm going to turn it over to David now, but I just stress the fact that we have come through unprecedented times,
unprecedented vilification of the company sometimes in the press. The team is strong. The morale is high. Our
momentum is gaining. And so we're pretty confident as we move into 2011 that we'll see a stronger and a more
streamlined and more transparent AIG.
So David?

David L. Herzog
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody.
Let's turn to slide 7. First quarter 2011 net income was $269 million, down from about $1.8 billion a year ago. First
quarter this year included a pre-tax non-cash charge of $3.3 billion for the accelerated amortization of the prepaid
commitment fee relating to the repaying and the terminating of the Fed Reserve Bank of New York's credit facility, and
we did that two years early.
Importantly, after-tax operating income attributable to AIG, our principal non-GAAP measure, which we believe over
time is the best way to view the businesses, was over $2 billion for the quarter versus $637 million a year ago. On a per
share basis, after-tax operating income was $1.30 for this quarter versus $0.95 a year ago. I'll take you through the EPS
in a few minutes because it can be perhaps a little bit counterintuitive, particularly this quarter.
Annualized operating ROE was 10.4% for the quarter, and that excludes AOCI. [Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income] Including AOCI, it was about 9.5%. And that was up from about 4% a year ago. Again, there were some
noteworthy items that we've highlighted in the first page of the press release.
Let's turn to slide 8 to look at the consolidated performance. Again, after-tax operating income was a little over $2
billion for the quarter. Chartis had an operating loss of $463 million after including pre-tax a $1.7 billion of catastrophe
losses, largely from the Japan earthquake and tsunami. SunAmerica posted $1.143 billion of operating income in the
quarter, up a little over 2% from a very strong quarter a year ago.
ILFC had operating income of $117 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $56 million a year ago. ILFC took, as
Bob mentioned, impairment charges of about $113 million for the quarter, due largely to some opportunistic sales of
about 10 aircraft. The impairment charge in the first quarter of 2010 was $430 million. As ILFC manages its fleet and
its age and the age of the fleet and the composition of the fleet, we would expect to see some impairment charges or
possibly losses on opportunistic sales from time to time, but generally not more than about $300 million a year going
forward.
United Guaranty posted a profit of $13 million, driven mainly by favorable prior-year development in the second lien
business, which benefited from operational improvements and claims management. In the first lien book, we had
favorable trends in newly reported delinquencies and steady trends in the cure rates, but that was more than offset by
higher overturns of previously denied or rescinded claims as mortgage lenders and servicers continue to deploy
additional resources to address loan documentation issues on their end.
The other segment had a profit of about $1.5 billion. That was largely driven by about $750 million of appreciation on
our ML III [Maiden Lane III] interest, driven by increases in value in the underlying multi-sector CDO assets in the
portfolio, but it was essentially flat to last year. It also includes improvements in the direct investment books,
comprised of our matched investment program and the runoff of the FP asset book, which is marked to market. And
that had about a $0.5 billion gain in it, largely from tightening of credit spreads in the capital markets.
Our remaining investment in AIA appreciated almost $1 billion in the quarter, slightly offset by the final monetization
of the MetLife position, which had been recorded on a mark-to-market basis prior to now.
Let's now turn to slide 9 and look at after-tax operating income reconciliation. This page shows a reconciliation from
the after-tax operating income of about $2 billion, with net income attributable to AIG of $269 million. The after-tax
impact of the $3.3 billion charge on the amortization was about $2.4 billion. The income from discontinued operations
was $1.6 billion, largely from the sale of the Star and Edison businesses. We had net realized capital losses for the
quarter, mainly from foreign exchange and derivatives not accounted for under FAS 133.
Finally, we need to adjust for taxes. Since we apply a pro forma tax on our operating income, and the items on this page
are shown net of tax. In reality, as Bob said, we're really not going to pay much income tax to the U.S. as we have very
large deferred tax assets, which I'll talk about in a moment. I also would point out that we have a full valuation
allowance on those deferred tax assets at this time. I'll take you through a slide or two in a few minutes to show you

how that works.
Let's turn now to EPS on slide 10. Earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $1.41 in the quarter in
'11 versus income per share of $2.16 a year ago. For details of that, I would refer you to page 5 of our financial
supplement. Earnings per share from discontinued operations was $1.06 in the quarter versus $0.50 a year ago.
Together, we had an EPS loss of $0.35 per share, even though we had net income of $269 million. Because we had two
items associated with restructuring totaling about $800 million that gets subtracted from the earnings numerator in the
EPS calculation in this quarter, the EPS loss occurs. That charge goes to EPS calculation, not through the income
statement. Again, after-tax operating EPS was a $1.30 versus $0.95 a year ago.
I should point out that the weighted average shares increased to 1.558 billion shares for the quarter, up from 136
million a year ago. And that was driven by the issuance of 1.655 billion shares in January to the U.S. Treasury as part
of our restructuring.
Now let's take a look at our capital structure on page 11. With the recapitalization that occurred in January, we've
simplified our capital structure and reduced leverage. Leverage has come down substantially, as senior financial debt to
total capitalization has decreased from 26% at year-end to just under 12% at the end of the quarter. Our book value is
currently $47.66 a share and $43.49 ex-AOCI. And again I want to remind you. That excludes any value for the
deferred tax asset as we have a full valuation allowance on our DTA.
Now let's turn to Chartis on slide 13. Chartis reported a pre-tax operating loss of $463 million, as I mentioned a
moment ago, versus $879 million of income a year ago. The current quarter loss reflects the $1.7 billion in cat losses,
including about $1.3 billion related to the Japan earthquake. And then we had an additional $400 million from the New
Zealand earthquake, the Australian floods, and the U.S. winter storms.
Net premiums written were $9.2 billion in the first quarter of 2011, up almost 20% from the $7.6 billion in the first
quarter a year ago. And ex-Fuji and the impact of foreign exchange though, Chartis premiums increased about 6% in
the quarter.
Catastrophe losses were $1.2 billion higher than a year ago, and prior-year development was essentially insignificant in
the quarter. The four business lines with the largest reserve strengthening at year end saw almost no activity in the first
quarter. The combined ratio on an accident-year basis excluding cats was 98.7%, and it was flat to last year.
The expense ratio improved in part due to impact from the Fuji acquisition and lower domestic expenses. Those were
partially offset by some international increases for strategic investments, improving regional governance, risk
management, and some of the financial infrastructure systems and Solvency II readiness that we're preparing for.
Let's now turn to slide 14 for a view of the Chartis premiums. Let's really focus on the 6.2% increase during the period,
which excludes FX and Fuji. The growth is largely driven by the U.S. region from increased retention and a significant
new customer program underwritten in the first quarter as well as a modest organic growth in almost all of our
international regions. Chartis continues to execute on its strategy to grow its higher margin and less capital-intensive
lines of business; and as required, implementing corrective actions on underperforming businesses to ensure that these
businesses meet our overall profitability measures. In the first quarter of 2011, the international share of Chartis overall
net written premiums was 55%, up from 50% a year ago.
Now I'm going to turn quickly to investments, and I'm going to start with Chartis on page 15. Net investment income
for Chartis was $1.2 billion in 2011, up 10% from a year ago. The primary driver of the increase was improved
investment in partnerships and the effect of consolidating Fuji. Chartis has some excess cash still to be deployed over
the coming months, and we can talk about that as well as the muni holdings perhaps in the Q&A session.
Let's now turn to SunAmerica on page 17. SunAmerica's operating income, as I said a moment ago, was $1.143 billion,
up 2% or so from last year. Premiums, deposits, and other considerations reached $6.2 billion in the quarter, up 31.4%,
which I'll talk about more in a moment.
Net investment income was up $47 million, driven by investment and partnership returns and the Maiden Lane II
residual interest valuation increases. DAC [Deferred Acquisition Cost] amortization was up about 27%, largely driven

by an unlocking in the investment spread assumptions in our group retirement product line as a result of the Federal
Reserve rejecting our offer to repurchase the ML II asset portfolio.
As you can see on the chart on the bottom left corner of the slide, SunAmerica's operating income has continued to be
strong and stable, posting essentially $1 billion of operating income in the last five quarters. The pie-chart at the bottom
right-hand corner of the slide shows the contribution of each of SunAmerica's businesses to its operating income. These
different businesses provide balance and diversification to SunAmerica's earnings.
Let's now turn to slide 18, premiums, deposits and other consideration. SunAmerica's premiums, deposits, and other
considerations I said a moment ago increased 31.4% on increased sales of fixed and variable annuities as well as
mutual funds. Life insurance sales increased 17% for the quarter versus a year ago. Western National, while continuing
to maintain its pricing discipline, increased sales by almost $1 billion, as certain bank partners negotiated lower
commissions in exchange for higher crediting rates, which made Western National's offerings more attractive to
policyholders.
Let's turn to slide 19. SunAmerica's investment income was up almost 2%, driven mainly by the Maiden Lane II
performance, higher private equity and hedge fund returns, partially offset by lower base yields. The slow runoff of
higher yielding assets will put some pressure on the investment yields going forward, although we've taken action to
reinvest excess cash, which should benefit the base rate portfolio in the future. We still have some substantial cash
balances that we will be reinvesting. We've made good progress in April, and we'll start to see impact of that in the
second quarter.
On slide 20, at both VALIC and Western National net spreads improved. Partnership income and a decrease in the
average cost of funds; i.e., our interest crediting rate, more than offset lower base yield and investments.
Now I'm going to take a quick word or two on our taxes, page 22. As Bob mentioned, we have very substantial deferred
tax assets that are available to offset future tax obligations. This slide lays out the gross attributes, the gross assets, and
a framework for utilizing or realizing those assets. All of the assets, as I said, have a full valuation allowance that offset
them. Accordingly, none of these assets are included in our book values. This will become more straightforward as we
apply our framework for assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the coming quarters.
And finally on page 23, commencing this quarter, we once again will use a full-year estimate of income and taxes to
calculate a tax rate like virtually every other company. For the last few years, we used a discrete period method because
of the uncertainty around our annual results.
Because of our tax attributes, we will not be paying very much tax, as I said before. As long as we have a full valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets, we will apply a pro forma type rate on our operating earnings to show you what
the tax rate would be if we were paying or accruing taxes. Because of the impact of the tax-free munis, our tax rate on a
pro forma basis for operating earnings will be somewhere between 25% and 30% for the year. Other discrete items in
the quarter will impact the overall rate in any given quarter. Items that are presented net of tax are shown using that
similar rate. As long as we have a full valuation allowance, virtually all of the tax impacts of the 25% to 30% rate will
be reversed before we show net income.
And finally, I just want to point out. Last night in our Q, we included some expanded discussion in the outlook section
about our aspirational long-term goals.
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.
Robert H. Benmosche
Just before we go to
questions, I'd like to reiterate something that David had just pointed out in terms of the DAC unlocking in SunAmerica
because of ML II. We are, in fact, making very good progress investing that money. Some of the investment is bidding
on aspects of ML II. However, we've found many other sources. And so approximately a third of that money has now

been invested. Generally, the yields are between 8% and 9%. And we're dealing with fixed as well as some of the
floaters that are part of ML II. So we've made really good progress over the last several weeks dealing with this
headwind. So we're trying to neutralize that effect as we get into the second quarter.
And as you look at the results of this quarter, you can see that Chartis still represents about 40% to 45% is the ballpark
of its percent of operating earnings of the company. And therefore, when we look at the company as a whole, we still
believe that the sum of the parts are less than the whole, and the company makes more sense as it is combining all of
the risk diversification between our property-casualty business and the life and annuity business and other businesses
we have. So we're pretty comfortable with the deck we have, and as you can see, pretty balanced.
So let me turn it back to Liz and we'll take questions.
Elizabeth Werner
Thank you. Operator, we can open the lines for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll turn first to Andrew Kligerman with UBS Securities.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Great, two questions. First, I went through the aspirational goals that you highlighted,
and.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Andrew, I think we have a little hard time hearing you.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Yes, can year hear me?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: There you go, thank you.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Okay, great, sorry about that. I read through the aspirational goals that you have, going
from 6% to 10%, and then being able to generate through 2015 roughly $25 billion to $30 billion. And today you're
sitting with a 12% debt to capital. I was surprised that the priorities – or I'm just wondering with regard to the priorities
for 2011, executing one or more primary offerings of AIG common stock. So maybe you could explain some of the
rationale behind that given the earnings power that you've described in your aspirational goals.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Andrew, you have to keep in mind that in December when we said we were going to
pay back the Federal Reserve, and we were going to terminate $30 billion of direct government support as well as the
implied support of the United States government beyond the $30 billion, although some said there would be no more
money, but there was the implication for sure. To do that and unplug – and remember, many of you said two years ago
that AIG was gone and may it rest in peace. And here we are, strong, vibrant, and moving forward. However, not
everybody believes that yet. And so therefore we have to over-solve for the E. And therefore, we have to demonstrate
without any question that we have strong credit ratings, both at the insurance companies and particularly the insurance
companies as well as holding company.
And therefore, we were told, for example, last year that ILFC would never be able to access the unsecured market ever
again. The good news is it never occurred. And we were told that AIG would have a very difficult time accessing the
unsecured markets again after what happened. And again, it never happened a second time. However, we had to make
sure that we could demonstrate access to the capital markets in every form.
Therefore, part of the deal to be able to close with the Federal Reserve and get people comfortable at the rating

is very, very strong going forward. And as you continue to see throughout 2011, as you've seen in 2010, the operations
of the core businesses continue to be strong. We believe they can begin to manage probably in the second half of 2012
the amount of equity we require in this company to support the liabilities that we have. So it's really around that
philosophy, and we want to make sure we project ourselves as a very strong company that could always live up to its
guarantees at this point in time.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Okay. So Bob, so I should interpret that as required as opposed to something that AIG
needs to do, the capital raise there?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: It's something – we just need to show that we can do it and to make sure that we have
more than enough – look, we've gone through a lot of pain. The people in the government that have supported us during
this crisis want to make sure that once AIG goes off on its own, and we are on our own at this stage of the game, that
they like us, but not that much. And so they don't want to ever have come back. And they don't want us to leave here in
any form crippled in any way; that the government sends us on our way and we were not financially strong. So it's
really dealing with those perceptions. We're dealing with it, which is why we say that probably by mid-2012, and that's
why we stressed the deferred tax asset and understanding it because that will be a source of funds that allow us to begin
to buy back the 80% of the company that was basically taken as part of the requirement to give us a loan so that's the
whole concept.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Okay. I'm with it. It would be somewhat dilutive, but I understand. And just lastly on
the partnership income, so you ended the quarter with about $19.4 billion in that class of assets and a 14% return.
What's AIG's objective with that asset class going forward? Do you want to grow that? And what types of returns on
average do you think you can do over time?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Bill?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Yes, hi.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Let me turn it over to Bill Dooley.
<A - William N. Dooley>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Hey, Bill.
<A - William N. Dooley>: It's an asset class where we're comfortable where we are right now. I don't see us growing
that substantially. Both insurance companies have an allocation to that asset class. The one at SunAmerica, I think their
assets are a little bit more aggressive than the Chartis assets. So we target somewhere between an 8% and a 6% return
on that, so this quarter was much better than that. But over a period of time, that's what we're expecting to get on a run
rate basis.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Great.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Is Jay Wintrob there? Maybe Jay would want to comment from SunAmerica's point of
view.
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Yes, two points. Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Hi, Jay.
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: One is the increase in the balances, especially with respect to SunAmerica, is not so much
from allocating new money to that sector. It's from strong appreciation in the fair value over the last two years as the
markets have done well and this portfolio has done very well. But in terms of what we're targeting we don't have any
plans to increase our holdings of alternatives in SunAmerica as a percentage of our total invested assets much beyond
where we are now. We've always been in the 5%-ish range. It's not a hard and fast target. But again a lot of the increase
is really is the appreciation that we've seen in the market as opposed to putting new money to work in the sector in the
last couple of years.

<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Great, thanks.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Andrew, just keep in mind, and I'm sure you know this; that it's really about the
liabilities as well, so that's all part of the match that goes on.
<Q - Andrew S. Kligerman>: Absolutely.
<A - Elizabeth Werner>: Operator, could we take the next question?
Operator
Certainly, we'll move to Dan Johnson with Citadel.
<Q - Daniel Johnson MBA>: Great, thank you and good morning, a couple questions, if you would. Maybe most
importantly, among some of the assumptions that you put in the 10-Q last night was the outlook for Chartis. Maybe you
could help us understand a little bit more of the details behind the plan to both bring down the combined ratio while
growing the top line at the same time. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about where you think you might be growing,
what macro market assumptions are behind those projections. And then I've got a separate question as well, please.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Let me have Peter Hancock. While he's new to the role, he's knee-deep in the data. So
you've got it, Peter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So the assumptions in the outlook are first of all, long-term outlook, it goes out to 2015. But
to some extent, what we're projecting is a continuation of current trends, which is faster growth in our international
business than in our domestic business, faster growth in emerging markets than the international in general, faster
growth in specialty lines, and faster growth in consumer lines versus commercial lines. All of that is against the
backdrop of the significant reduction in premium written in the lines that caused us to strengthen reserves in the fourth
quarter. Those four lines constituted about 22% of net premium written in 2006, and that was down to 6.7% in 2010
and under 6% in the first quarter. So we are changing business mix at a macro level.
Secondly, we are investing in infrastructure in particular the global claims initiative. We've invested over $200 million
in the global claims initiative, which we expect to help us to get our combined down by, the loss ratio in particular,
down by about two points.
And third, we have instituted organizational changes in the way we operate, globalizing our product areas and putting
individuals in charge not only of global commercial and global consumer lines, but within them the sub-lines which
remove barriers to using common infrastructure, which will help us on the expense ratio, and also help us allocate our
financial capital where the returns are greatest relative to risk. So all of these steps we think will achieve the
aspirational goals by 2015.
And then last but not least, we're investing significantly in technical pricing tools to equip our very experienced team of
underwriters with state-of-the-art tools to leverage the data that we have a unique comparative advantage in, which we
haven't used to the degree we could have done in the past.
<Q - Daniel Johnson MBA>: So if I summarize at least on the top line comments that in areas you're looking to grow,
you expect to grow well north of the 6%. But there are certain areas that you're shrinking in, have been shrinking in,
and maybe you will continue to shrink in that will bring down the growth areas down to an aggregate mid single-digits.
Is that fair?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Let me put it this way. Our outlook is based on no hardening in the macro environment. Our
outlook is premised on no radical increase in interest rates beyond the forward curve. And third, while we have for
planning purposes a top line assumption and a combined ratio assumption, that's not how we manage the business. We
manage the business based on targeting risk-adjusted profitability which may, depending on the pricing environment
and the reaction of customers to our offerings and pricing strategy, higher or lower top line growth or different
combines depending on the mix of short-tail versus long-tail business. So to some extent, we are moving away from

any kind of top line targeting. We think that leads you to do business at the margin, which is unattractive. So the top
line will be what it will be. We think it will grow at about 6% based on our best estimates. But we are really instead
targeting risk-adjusted profitability.
<Q - Daniel Johnson MBA>: Understood. Okay, the second question is on the deferred tax asset. I think that's slide
22. There's discussion about changes to the corporate tax rate. Who knows if anything happens there? But what
scenario should we be thinking about that if, as some say, the top rate – excuse me, the corporate rate comes down to
the mid-20%s and certain loopholes are taken out instead, how should we think about the value of the three different
buckets you show here if we took corporate rates say down into the mid-20%s?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Dan, it's David Herzog. Thanks. I think you understand the levers. Again, since we have a full
valuation allowance on it, there won't be any effect on our GAAP book value. And from a utilization standpoint
obviously the present value of that asset will come down commensurate with a reduction in the rate. So again, our
expectation is that we should be able to utilize, should be able to generate, which then will translate into our framework
from an accounting standpoint, that we have a goal to utilize the NOL, certainly to utilize the foreign tax credits, and to
utilize the vast majority of the non-life capital loss carry-forwards.
What again is a bit more challenging to us is in the life capital loss carry-forwards. That $8.1 billion asset is a bit more
challenging for us because of the presence or the lack thereof of gross attributes, gross gains that can be used to realize
that asset. So again I think you understand the lever in terms of what that is. So a reduction in the rate, while it would
be helpful in other respects, but from a realization standpoint it would clearly diminish the value of this.
<Q - Daniel Johnson MBA>: Understood. Well I can come back to it at a later time to understand.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Another – keep in mind; the other thing is that the tax rate that our underlying operating
companies are all connected to the holding company by way of a tax-sharing agreements that have been in place for a
very long period of time. And so that's still the mechanism by which we're going to monetize these assets.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I just want to follow up for a minute on the Chartis comment to reinforce some things
about the outlook and the confidence in the outlook. There has been a lot of talk about a brain drain here at AIG. The
fact is that's not the case. We've had incredible retention of our employees. And more importantly we've had incredible
retention in the worst of times of our clients. If you think about, the fact is that we still have retained almost 92% of our
clients during this period of time. We've retained a little over 80% of their policies. Some of the policies, for example,
we did lose was D&O [Director & Officer] coverage. But I will tell you that over the last year, and it's continuing into
2011 we are getting that D&O coverage back. We're winning more and more of that, as people have seen that AIG is
actually going to be here and they can count on us going forward, and there is no more question about our solvency and
a going concern.
So with the fact that – just a data point that of the top 2000 people that operate AIG today in leadership positions, 57%
have been with our company more than 10 years, 20% more than 20 years. And so we have a strong, experienced, well
established team of leaders around this company that know how to do it and how to do it right. And they're focused,
and that's the benefit we have with our clients because that's what the clients are looking for, the people and the people
that can solve their problems. So that energy is here. Of that top 2000 people, only 3% left for all reasons in 2010. So
we've got enormous retention of that group going forward. And that's the group that's gaining this momentum as we
move in to the first quarter that are producing these results, and that's why we have the strong outlook for the future.
<Q - Daniel Johnson MBA>: Hey, Bob, that's great. While you're there, just on the concept of systemically important
financial institutions, what do you think that's going to mean for AIG and when will we know?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I have no clue when we'll know. I asked that question a while ago and I got that answer,
so I assume that's still the answer. My sense would be that as an insurance company, remember, we are becoming an
insurance company and not a trading company. So the aspects that caused the difficulty have been completely
de-risked. FP is de-risked. In fact, FP today represents maybe a $150 million downside and a $1.5 billion to $1 billion
upside. So that's all part of what got us in trouble.

So my sense would be that we will be regulated by the Fed is my guess. And my guess is the insurance companies will
continue to be regulated by the states and the countries we do business in. And I think what the Fed will be looking at is
predominantly the holding company and making sure that we do the things we need to do to support the enterprise and
not taking inordinate risk at the holding company level. Because clearly the way we're going to drive our ROE over
time is to deal with the fact that we have capital maintenance agreements with our insurance companies, so it's a
two-way street.
So clearly, we've got to make sure that we get our RBC to a level that is acceptable for the insurance company and the
quality ratings we need. And therefore we can also – so that will help us on the E at the insurance company levels
because we'll be able to show strength and our ability to move capital around the company in a very effective way. So I
think my sense is you won't see that – but we don't know. We won't see the kind of Tier 1 capital issues that you see
raising in the banking community at this stage of the game, but we'll have to wait and see.
<Q - Daniel Johnson MBA>: Thank you for all those questions and answers.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Thanks, Dan.
Operator
Next we'll move to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - J. Paul Newsome CFA>: Good morning, everyone, thank you for the call. I wanted to ask about insurance
pricing for the property-casualty business. AIG has historically been the leader in pricing. We saw some glimmers of
hope of a hardy market in commercial. I know you said that your assumption is for no hard market. But could you talk
about what you're trying to do yourself in terms of pricing?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Peter will talk about that.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, I think that we in pricing are already operating in a competitive market, so we can't do
anything per se about the market. What we can do is price individual policies to reflect what we think a fair return on
the risk. But the net result of that is what we observe in the market is relatively stable in the first quarter. Casualty
market, there has been a little bit of increase in some lines. But the most promising sliver of hope is in property cat,
where we've seen in the U.S. double-digit growth in rates in the last three weeks and overseas even more than that so
encouraging trends there. But overall, I think it's too early to call any kind of turn in the market.
<Q - J. Paul Newsome CFA>: And separately, I wanted to ask about, just to clarify it from a cash flow perspective
perhaps, is AIG is at the point where they're generating cash flow or are you still having to put money down into the
subsidiaries? I just wasn't really clear as to whether or not you need the access to capital markets, or at this point you're
self sustaining from a cash flow perspective.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Hi, Paul, it's David Herzog; I guess a couple of things. One, as part of our capital
management protocol and framework that we've put in place throughout the company, we have instituted capital
maintenance agreements between the parent company and the operating companies. And what that does is clarifies and
brings transparency to how we think about capital, capital management. And it helps really operationalize the
diversification benefits of the capital flows within the company.
It also helps support a notion, if you will, of strength from above that we are accumulating a pool of resources at the
holding company in order to support the strength and the opportunities down in the operating company. So the long and
short of it is the operating companies are in a position, and we expect that we will pay dividends from the operating
companies out of operating earnings up to the holding company.
And so the dividend capacity of these operating companies as we sit here today is very significant. So for Chartis, it's in
excess of $3 billion. And for the SunAmerica companies, about $1.4 billion. And the teams, the management teams are
all aligned around achieving those dividend flows from the operating companies to the holding companies. And as I
said a minute ago also, in addition to the dividends, importantly, are those tax-sharing payments. And so regardless of

the rate, there are tax-sharing payments that will flow from the operating companies to the holding company, and the
holding company will not pay taxes because of our very valuable tax assets.
And so that's from an operating cash flow standpoint. And I believe in the Q, you can see the net flow position of the
SunAmerica companies. Maybe, Jay, you want to comment on the robust performance in the quarter.
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Thank you, David. First of all, in terms of a direct answer to what I think was a question
from Paul, the SunAmerica Financial Group Companies have been net cash generators, I think, now for over a year or
so. There is no need for cash being put into the SunAmerica Financial Group Companies. And as David mentioned,
we're actually in the strong dividend paying position, and that's what we started doing already in the fourth quarter of
last year.
On a slightly different topic in terms of the fund flows, as you can see in the business, we had a significant
improvement in not only our top line premium, deposits, and other considerations across basically all of the major
product lines, but also the net flows have become much stronger. They're positive, and the surrenders remain at or
below historic levels. Persistency is very good. So we see continued progress going here even into the second quarter.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Thanks, Jay. And Paul, one other thing I'm going to – we're going to do this in two parts with
respect to Chartis. We put – in the quarter put down about $3.7 billion, and that was really in two pieces. I'll take the
first piece, and I'll ask our CFO for Chartis, Rob Schimek, to comment on the second piece. But there were two pieces.
The $2 billion piece Schimek will talk about, and I'll take the $1.7 billion.
What we did, Paul, with respect to the ownership structure inside the company of the United Guaranty Companies, our
mortgage guarantee company, effectively what we did was injected capital and took a dividend or a distribution if you
will, out of the operating company that owned United Guaranty. So think of it as replacement capital. Cash went in
United Guaranty, which was capital came out. And that capital, the cash that was in the Chartis companies has been
redeployed into appropriate assets for the various insurance companies. So that was $1.7 billion. Effectively, the cash
went in, came back out, and we had other assets in other parts of the company that we were able to redeploy and get
assets into Chartis. So Rob, do you want to – Peter, go ahead.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So just to be clear, prior to this, UGC was owned by Chartis. After this, UGC is now owned
by AIG Holding Company. So that's what that maneuver achieved.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: And it's Rob Schimek. The primary motivator there is that as a subsidiary of Chartis,
UGC was not a capital efficient structure. So obviously, putting it up at the parent company rather than having it down
in Chartis is more efficient overall from a capital perspective for Chartis.
The second element of the capital that was infused into Chartis, as David referred to, was about $2 billion of additional
cash that was put into Chartis. That was put in following our reserve strengthening at year-end. Obviously, the
strengthening reduced the surplus inside of the Chartis companies, but also importantly increased the risk-based capital
charge, for example, that the new reserves we've added attract. And so therefore, there were two adverse effects on the
RBC ratio: one, reduced surplus; and two, higher levels of capital charges. So the new capital that AIG put into the
structure or into Chartis, ultimately provided us with a benefit of getting our RBC back to what we feel is a comfortable
level.
<A - Elizabeth Werner>: Thank you, operator, next question?
Operator
Next, we'll move to Scott Frost with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - R. Scott Frost MBA>: Great, thanks for the clarification on the tax rate. Could you remind me what is, again, the
timetable or I guess restrictions on any kind of monetizing of the AIA or the Maiden Lane III interests? And is it fair or
accurate to say that the DTA could or would be used to offset any taxes on a sale? And I have a follow-up.

<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think philosophically right now, AIA is part of the SPV with Treasury, and we can
monetize that later this year. But part of the issue we're thinking about is strategically how we want to handle that asset.
Right now, it's part of AIG. We have other alternatives we're considering to deal with the SPV. And so our guiding
principle would be that to the extent we could retain our ownership in this fast growing market, we sold off two-thirds.
That doesn't mean we want to eliminate all of it, but that depends on how we deal with the SPV. So clearly, we're
working hard on Nan Shan to make sure that closes. That's $2 billion that will come in. And we're looking potentially at
monetizing other assets that we have so that AIA might be sold much later on, if at all.
<A - Robert S. H. Schimek>: And Scott, with respect to the DTA, it would offset. To the extent there was a gain, it
would help us utilize that tax asset.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Do you also want to comment on monetization of cash flows coming out of Maiden
Lane III and how that shows up.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Scott, the value of ML III is carried on our books. As I think you're probably aware of, as a
mark-to-market asset. So inside the Maiden Lane III SPV, so to speak, are the remaining CDO investments that were
acquired back in November of 2008. The cash flow estimates inside that portfolio are upwards of about $45 billion of
nominal cash flows.
Also, when you apply those cash flows over a long period of time, the waterfall is such that the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York has a first priority senior note that gets paid off at year-end. That was about $17 billion. Then next in line,
so to speak, is obviously their interest. The carry on it is theirs first, and then our $5 billion in the principal that we had
invested. And then our ticking fee, so to speak, gets paid next. And then we share the upside one-third/two-thirds. So
again, the cash flows on ML III likely won't emerge for quite some time given the presence of the large senior note
position. But nonetheless, there's still significant value inside the Maiden Lane III SPV.
<Q - R. Scott Frost MBA>: Okay. And I've got to ask you a question about – thank you for that. And if I could ask a
question about the FP breakout, the way I'm reading it is you've got $278 billion total notional, $38 billion mezz, and
$19 billion CDO Squared. Is that the right – and then the rest of it – and the $221 billion would be the reg cap portfolio.
Is that right? I think it's in the back of the supplement.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Yes.
<Q - R. Scott Frost MBA>: On page 37.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Right.
<Q - R. Scott Frost MBA>: But what I wanted to ask you is do you have any sense of – I know that the portfolio has
been de-risked as much as you can de-risk it. But with respect to, I guess, Basel III, do you have any view as to whether
or not that would or wouldn't give banks there a further incentive to unwind? Is that something that's contemplated, or
do you have any views on that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'll take that, if you like. I don't think Basel III has a material impact on our unwind strategy.
I think that banks have had an outlook on Basel III over the last year and a half. And both ourselves and our
counterparties have had every motivation to unwind and simplify this portfolio. We're getting close to the point where
what's left represents, as Bob said, very modest downside. And we estimate about a $150 million P&L downside and
about 10 times that in terms of upside but some liquidity risk against it. But the contingent liquidity risk is embedded in
our stress tests to some and more than adequately covered by the liquidity cushion that we have with the holding
company. So I think you can think of this as a runoff portfolio that will amortize off and throw off some decent returns
but not recurring income. It's a one-off windfall.
<Q - R. Scott Frost MBA>: Okay. And the last question, if for the non-reg cap portfolio, is there any amortization
schedule that you've put anywhere? I didn't see one but I may have missed it. But do we have any idea as to how that
eventually runs off the non-reg cap part?

<Q - Eric N. Berg CFA, CPA>: Thanks very much and good morning to everyone. Maybe Jay or David or whomever
you deem appropriate, one of the unfortunate developments in the current quarter is that the stock market has given up
quite a bit of its early gains, and interest rates have fallen – I was just taking a look – pretty steeply both on the long
end and the short end of the yield curve. So my question is just how is all this going to affect – I have two questions.
How is this going to affect SunAmerica, especially on the interest rate side?
And secondly, while I certainly heard Jay's comments about – you're not increasing your investments or you have no
intention to substantially increase your investments in partnerships, what is the near-term outlook for partnership
income? Would you expect it to continue to be as strong in the June quarter, or if not as strong, stronger than your
baseline expectations in the June quarter than it was in the March quarter? Thank you.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Jay, you're up.
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Good morning, Eric, a couple of comments. First of all, in the quarter, not that I follow
these things closely, I think the market, the equity market is still substantially up for the quarter even after the most
recent sell off. Interest rates you're correct.
Number two, the most equity sensitive part of the investment portfolio in SunAmerica Financial Group are the
alternatives. The hedge fund results are recorded on a one-month lag. So really the second quarter for us would be the
month of March, April, and May, so you can take a look at the aggregate result there. I don't at this point in time – I'm
definitely not predicting, but I'm not expecting any big issues with alternative investment income based on the results
we've seen for March and early results for April, but there is still May to complete. And private equity, it's just too early
to tell. It's basically dependent on distributions from funds, completion of liquidity events and so on and so forth.
On the interest rates, the interest rates moving down will have some impact on the fair value of the liabilities associated
with VA guarantees. But our hedging program is designed to address that on an economic basis. As far as the volatility
that flows the GAAP P&L, again, too early to estimate that; but again, at this point in time I don't see the market action
as having a dramatic impact on results at this point in time for SunAmerica. I should say that all this activity has not
slowed down the good momentum that was displayed on the top line in the first quarter, and we continue to see good
progress moving into the second quarter thus far.
<Q - Eric N. Berg CFA, CPA>: When you say just a – one quick last one. When you say that you don't expect major
developments on the alternatives, what do you mean by it? Are you saying in effect that you expect a continuation of
what you say in the first quarter? Is that what you mean?

<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: No. Actually, I'm not really going to comment on the – predict the results of a portfolio as
large and diverse as ours. I'm just saying that if you look at the change in value of the – pick the S&P 500 and assume
that the quarter starts on March 1st, to today, I think you had positive results through today, and I think that probably
will be helpful on balance to the portfolio.
For planning purposes, we expect the SunAmerica Financial Group alternative investment portfolio to return
approximately 10%. The results, as you know, are very lumpy. We have achieved – over-performed on the 10% over a
long period of time. Certainly the first quarter is an example of that. We aren't planning for those kinds of returns. I
think the first quarter yield was roughly 16.5% in the SunAmerica portfolio. But for planning purposes at 10%, but the
market will dictate that. And we will call it out in the financial supplement, as we do every quarter. You can take that
into account as the way you look at and model the company.
<Q - Eric N. Berg CFA, CPA>: Thanks very much.
<A - Jay Steven Wintrob>: Thank you, Eric.
