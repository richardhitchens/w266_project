Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to take you through our first quarter performance, which
marks a great start to fiscal 2013. In the quarter, we delivered robust organic sales growth, again driven by our trio of
growth engines in Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup, and our Top 15 Brands; year-over-year gross margin
improvement for the first time in five quarters despite the tough economic environment and higher commodity costs;
continued investment in the business, including marketing, Project Keystone, and more boots on the ground in
emerging markets; and strong constant-currency profit growth, driven by higher operating income and a lower tax rate.
On a reported basis, results were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange.
So, overall, we're off to a very good start to the new year. On a constant-currency basis, net sales grew by more than
4%, operating income increased 5%, and EPS rose more than 15% on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact
of last year's charges for productivity initiatives; in short, strong results in a very challenging environment.
Importantly, Q1 marked our 29th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, at nearly 5%, and I think this is an
important indicator of our focus on growth, the strength of our portfolio, the effectiveness of our commercial programs,
and consistency of performance. Our trio of growth engines – Emerging Markets, Global Ketchup, and our Top 15
Brands – once again drove our organic sales growth. I want to briefly hit some highlights in each of these areas.
Our Emerging Markets posted organic sales growth of almost 20%. The growth was led by Quero in Brazil, Foodstar in
China, and Heinz in Russia. Importantly, in Russia, Heinz is now the number-one brand in both ketchup and in total
condiments. We also had strong organic sales growth in Indonesia and India. Overall, Emerging Markets represented a
record 26% of Heinz sales in Q1, which is our high-water mark in the year for emerging market mix, given the timing
of Ramadan.
Of note, this quarter in Brazil, enhancement of business processes and the implantation of SAP allowed us to eliminate
the one-month lag in closing the books there. So our results include an extra month in Brazil, which was partially offset
by the planned sales reduction in Long Fong related to the significant streamlining we executed in that business last
quarter.
Now, turning to Global Ketchup, we posted 3.7% organic growth, overlapping more than 8% organic growth last year.
Our emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, and China delivered strong double-digit growth, driven by both the retail and
foodservice channels. The U.K. led our developed markets in ketchup growth, aided by innovative line extensions, like
ketchup with balsamic vinegar and, now, Indian Spices.
Turning to our Top 15 Brands, we posted nearly 6% organic sales growth in Q1. As a result, these core brands have
grown to nearly three-quarters of our total portfolio. And it's an important advantage for us in that it allows us to more
tightly and effectively focus our commercial resources and investment dollars.

Now, let's take a quick look at each of our geographic regions. Turning first to North American Consumer Products,
our results reflected solid and encouraging performance in the U.S. Excluding the two product lines we exited last year,
Boston Market, which is included in divestitures, and T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals, organic sales in our core U.S.
business were up more than 3%.
The solid growth is reflective of stronger market shares, and indeed, we grew volume share in 9 of our 12 U.S. Retail
product categories over the last 12-week period, while increasing our average net price.
I'm pleased to report good progress on Ore-Ida as well, where sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate during the
quarter. We've been working with our trade partners to optimize Ore-Ida pricing on the shelf, and this is beginning to
have a positive effect. We also posted mid-single-digit sales growth in Smart Ones and a 2% volume increase in
ketchup.
Operating income was off slightly to prior year, impacted by higher commodity costs, sales mix, and an increased
investment in marketing. And finally, we went live on SAP in Canada during the quarter and incurred some startup
challenges there.
U.S. Foodservice delivered excellent results for the quarter. Organic sales grew about 2.5%, driven by price increases
implemented last year to cover inflation. Encouragingly, volume was stable, and the trajectory has been improving,
driven by more favorable QSR trends and our success in penetrating non-commercial channels.
Operating income grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting higher pricing and lower costs, clearly aided by the benefits
from last year's restructuring initiatives. And as Ed will discuss shortly, we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice
desserts business this quarter, as we continue to enhance our focus on branded ketchup and sauces.
Turning next to Europe, the segment generated very solid constant-currency results for the quarter, with sales up 1.5%
and profit up almost 8%. Organic sales growth was 2%, driven by pricing. The U.K. and Russia continue to drive very
strong growth, particularly on ketchup, while sales in continental Europe and Italy continue to be impacted by weak
economies and categories.
During the quarter, we increased marketing and continued to drive the European change agenda in order to meet the
evolving environment there. Additionally, we successfully implemented Keystone in Germany, while also divesting a
small unprofitable soup business in Germany and consolidating back-office activities into the Netherlands.
Moving to Asia-Pacific, constant-currency sales grew by more than 4%, led by Indonesia, India, and China, and by soy
sauce from a category standpoint. This growth includes the negative impact of streamlining Long Fong, which cut the
size of that business in half, as we exited two of four factories and focused on higher-growth, higher-margin products.
The region posted 30% profit growth, reflecting improved net pricing, productivity, sales mix, and a strong rebound in
Australia, which was aided by last year's restructuring initiatives. Additionally, we continued to increase investments in
marketing and in sales capabilities across emerging markets in the region.
The Rest of World segment reported 32% constant-currency sales growth for the quarter, driven by very strong
year-over-year growth in Brazil, plus the extra month, as well as double-digit growth in Mexico and the Middle East.
Venezuelan sales were down for the quarter as a result of the macroeconomic issues in the country. Rest of World
delivered 3% constant-currency profit growth, lapping more than 100% growth last year, with Brazil's strong
performance being partially offset by weakness in Venezuela.
Now, I've mentioned several recent actions we've taken to continue streamlining, reshaping, and strengthening our
portfolio. These included completing the sale of our U.S. Foodservice desserts business, which we announced at
Analyst Day in May; exiting subscale frozen businesses in U.S. Retail by divesting the Boston Market license and
discontinuing T.G.I. Friday's premium frozen meals; divesting a small unprofitable soup business in Germany; and
rightsizing our Long Fong frozen business in China.
Now, these and many other actions we've executed over the last decade have helped focus the portfolio on those brands
and categories where we have the capabilities and position to win. Ketchup and sauces are the crown jewel, which now

represent almost half of our sales. This is an important shift in the portfolio, which we're continuing to drive
aggressively.
Now, with that said, I'll turn it over to Ed to cover the rest of the financials. Ed?
Edward J. McMenamin
Thanks, Art, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through the first quarter financial highlights, which reflect
strong constant-currency growth in our key P&L metrics. But before I go through the results, as Art referenced earlier,
in May, we completed the sale of our U.S. Foodservice frozen desserts business. It resulted in a $0.07 charge to EPS,
which, along with last year's results, are reflected in discontinued operations.
Now let's walk through the financials. Here you can see three different views of EPS, but any way you look at it, we
delivered double-digit growth. Starting on the left, our results from continuing operations, which exclude the
productivity charges last year, reflect 10% growth to $0.87 this year. On a constant-currency basis, EPS would have
been $0.91, a 15% increase from the comparable base last year. And finally, on a total-company reported basis, EPS
was $0.80 this year, up 14%.
The balance of the presentation will focus on the company's results from continuing operations compared to last year's
results, excluding productivity charges. And as a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal 2012, the productivity charges were $41
million pre-tax, or $0.09 of EPS.
Turning to the P&L scorecard, constant-currency sales were up over 4%, but down 1.5% after a sizable foreign
exchange headwind. Gross margin was 35.9%, up slightly, as higher pricing and productivity improvements were able
to more than offset commodity inflation. Looking forward, as we progress through the year, we expect pricing and
productivity to continue to outpace commodity cost increases, and margins will build significantly throughout the year.
We continued to increase our investment in consumer marketing, which was up 4.5% on a constant-currency basis,
with the incremental spending split evenly between developed and emerging markets. For perspective, we expect a
sizable ramp-up of marketing in Q2 and throughout the year.
Operating income was up 5% on a constant-currency basis, as higher organic sales growth and effective cost
management offset unfavorable commodities, while also supporting increased marketing and incremental investments
in both Project Keystone and emerging market capabilities. After the impact of currency, OI was about flat.
EPS of $0.87 benefited from an effective tax rate of approximately 18% this year, compared to 24% last year. In Q1
and, to a greater extent, in Q2, we expect to benefit from foreign tax-planning initiatives, and our full-year estimate for
the tax rate remains in the low 20%s, with higher than average rates in the second half of the year.
Looking at the key sales drivers, our organic sales growth of 4.8% was fairly balanced between volume and price.
Volume improved 2.5%, driven by Emerging Markets, led by a very strong performance in Brazil, as well as
improvements in the U.S. and the U.K. The Brazilian results reflect exceptional normalized organic growth of 45% that
was further aided by an additional month's results.
The majority of the benefit from the additional month was offset by the planned exits of T.G.I. Friday's frozen meals in
the U.S. and the streamlining of the Long Fong business in China to focus on only more profitable products and
regions.
Higher pricing of 2.3% was driven by price increases in most of the emerging markets, particularly Latin America and
China, as well as in the developed markets of the U.S. and U.K. The divestitures of the Boston Market brand in the
U.S. and the small soup business in Germany decreased sales by 60 basis points. And finally, foreign exchange reduced
our top line by 5.6%.
Looking at sales by category, ketchup and sauces, our most important category, led the way with nearly 6% organic
growth. Meals and snacks reported overall organic growth of 3.1%, and notably, both the ambient and frozen segments

were positive, with contributions from both volume and price in each. Infant/nutrition recorded 2.3% organic growth,
driven by a 12% increase in Emerging Markets. Art covered each of the segments' performance in detail, but here you
can quickly see all of our segments delivered positive organic growth this quarter.
As I noted earlier, our gross margin was up slightly from last year, with a 10-basis-point improvement to 35.9%. The
market basket for our commodities was up almost 4%, primarily due to sweeteners, most notably in Indonesia;
tomatoes and beans in Europe; as well as glass globally. Solid contributions from pricing and productivity more than
offset this inflation.
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures were 3% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year,
and we're still anticipating spending of approximately 4% of sales for the full fiscal year, as we support growth in our
emerging markets as well as the continued rollout of Project Keystone. Cash conversion cycle delivered a substantial
improvement of six days, driven by receivables and inventory, and represents a record low CCC of 36 days, around a
third of where we were a decade ago.
In line with our expectations, operating free cash flow was an outflow of $25 million. This reflects $42 million of cash
paid this quarter for fiscal 2012 productivity initiatives, while last year, QOWC benefited from the timing of
drawdowns on our accounts receivable securitization programs.
Net debt to EBITDA, at 2.1 times, was up slightly to prior year, driven by modestly higher net debt. And I'm pleased to
point out that Fitch recently raised our debt rating to BBB+. ROIC was nearly 20% for the quarter, up 110 basis points
from this time last year, driven by our 10% increase in net income this quarter.
In summary, we're pleased with our results in Q1, delivering almost 5% organic sales growth, constant-currency
operating income growth in excess of 5%, and double-digit EPS growth.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Art to update you on our full-year outlook.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, Ed. Now, just a couple of remarks on our outlook before we open it up to your questions; with Q1 behind us,
let's take a look at what we expect for the balance of the fiscal year. Beginning with Q2, we expect another quarter of
organic sales growth, at around 4%; improving gross margin, based on the combination of net pricing and productivity
more than offsetting commodity inflation; implementation of our planned incremental investments in marketing,
Project Keystone, and sales capabilities in emerging markets to drive top-line growth and further strengthen our
foundation for the future. Marketing spending, in particular, will increase significantly in Q2 behind a number of new
initiatives in the U.S., U.K., and emerging markets.
The Q2 tax rate will be very favorable, at a low-double-digit rate, based on the flow of our foreign tax-planning
initiatives. And note that while our tax rate will be quite favorable through the first half of the year, we still anticipate
that our full-year tax rate will be in the low 20%s. And foreign currency will continue to be unfavorable. Overall, we
expect constant-currency EPS growth of around 10% in Q2.
Importantly, for the full year, we are reaffirming our FY 2013 constant-currency targets. This reflects the strong start
we made in the first quarter and our confidence in our brands, our people, our plans, and our ability to respond to
ever-changing market conditions around the world.
So, to sum up, our fiscal year is off to a strong start. Our key growth drivers of Emerging Markets, Top 15 Brands, and
Global Ketchup continue to provide strong and consistent growth. The savings from last year's productivity initiatives
are coming in according to our expectations.
We expect sequential improvement in our year-over-year gross margin results. And finally, we're on track to execute
the $120 million of planned investments we discussed in May to help drive the business for sustainable long-term
growth.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Meg, and then we'll open it up for your questions. Meg?
Meg Nollen
Great. All right, Shanelle, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe, Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning, Chris.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: How are you? I just wanted to ask a couple of quick questions, and the first one just
relates to the emerging markets. You had obviously very solid growth again in this quarter. I'm curious if you're seeing
any slowdown in some of the markets, like China, where we keep hearing about a slowdown. Certainly, it's been more
focused on industrial sort of companies, but I'm curious if you're seeing that kind of linger into the consumer world.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Chris, as you saw, we posted 19% organic growth in our emerging markets, and I
think even if you take out some of the one-time decisions, like the extra month in Brazil and things, it was still at about
a 15% organic growth.
<A - Meg Nollen>: And Long Fong, right.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: So we feel very good about where emerging markets are going. I think, to your point, a
lot of the discussion of slowdown in China – and I guess they've slowed down to a GDP growth rate of about 8% at this
point, which most countries would love to have – but I think it's more on the industrial side. Frankly, the exploding
middle class in these emerging markets are just coming into their own in terms of ability to afford packaged food. And
so I think we are very, very well-positioned, and we feel very good about the ongoing trajectory of what we think the
growth rates will be of our kinds of products.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: And particularly when you look at – Russia and Brazil had outstanding results this
quarter, and we continue to see them grow.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Right.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I had just one quick follow-up, if I could, just to be clear on the revenue guidance for
the year. Your comment for at least 4% organic revenue growth guidance, does that include the T.G.I. Friday's exit? I
guess Boston Market has a little lingering here in the first quarter. And then, also, you had two less shipping days last
year; are those comparison factors? Are those embedded in that 4% guidance?
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yes.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, that's all rolled in, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: All rolled in, okay. I just wanted to make sure of that. Okay, thank you for your help.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Right. So really, if you strip those away, it's significantly higher than 4%.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Yes.

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer, UBS.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: David, are you there?
<A - Meg Nollen>: Hello, David.
Operator
David, if you can unmute your line?
<A - Meg Nollen>: I hope that's what it is. All right. Well, let's keep him in queue and see if we can't – we'll move on
to another. David -
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Oh, there he is.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I was stuck on mute. Sorry about that. Quick housekeeping
question, I didn't pick up on the slide, the marketing reinvestment of $120 million, is that front-weighted for the year?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Is what?
<A - Meg Nollen>: Is it front-weighted.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Oh. Oh, yeah, let me clarify. The $120 million, David, if you recall from Analyst Day,
about $70 million of that was marketing and the rest in other investments within the business. And the marketing really
is going to – as I tried to allude to, will ramp up through the remaining quarters. So marketing spending was up on a
constant-currency basis in Q1, but it will be up very significantly in Q2 and then in the remainder of the year, basically
timed with the timing of our programs, the ideas, and ready for the initiatives. So we're feeling good about the
trajectory and the plans for going forward.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, you're going to see Heinz spend in marketing like you've never seen us before. And we're
very excited about all of the launches and the brand support that is coming out, and in fact, we're going to show you a
lot of that at the upcoming Back-to-School Conference. So, get ready; it's on. Heinz is on the Olympics. We've done a
number of things, so very exciting.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, so we fully expect to spend at least that $70 million of incremental marketing
that we talked about in May.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: The Europe division, you mentioned that conditions were tough there. Are conditions, in your
opinion, in terms of the consumer, getting worse there, and are you expecting even budgeting for increasingly difficult
consumer environment through the fiscal year in that region?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: David, it's kind of interesting; Europe is sort of a tale of two cities for us. If you go to
either end of the continent, we're performing extremely well. So, Russia in the East, in particular, had a great quarter.
We feel really good about the momentum in Russia both from a top-line and a gross margin standpoint. And the U.K.
business continues to be a fortress for us, given the strength of our brand equities there and the power of the innovation
and execution within the business.

So, at both ends of the continent, we feel very good about things. To your point, it's a tough market in the middle of the
continent. Continental Europe and Italy, consumer confidence is low, unemployment is high, and so it's a challenging
market there, and I think we continue to evolve our products and our packaging to meet that environment. And I'm
really pleased that we got a good, strong head start on driving the European agenda with what we're doing with
Keystone, what we're doing with the supply chain consolidation.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Innovation center.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: With the innovation center, so lots of things going on to address it. So I'm not so sure
that we expect things in the middle of the continent to get too much worse, but we're sure not expecting it to get better
anytime soon.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And the profit growth that was high-single-digits organic, the story there is largely the
productivity and the restructuring from last year flowing through, or is a significant portion of that still the promotion
efficiency efforts that have been ongoing?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think it's all of the above.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yes.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: We're certainly getting the restructuring benefits that we had expected, so that's a good
thing. We're continuing to drive productivity initiatives this year, particularly value engineering. Strong organic
top-line growth in some of our markets is certainly helping out as well. And again, with regard to Europe in particular,
it's driven at both ends of the continent.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jason English, Goldman Sachs.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. First, a quick housekeeping item. Brazil, can
you quantify the impact that had on both the top and bottom line this quarter, just the one-month move?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, the one month was worth roughly $35 million on a gross basis. And keep in
mind, though, that a lot of that was offset by the decisions we made in Long Fong and the exit of TGIF meals, but
roughly $35 million at the top line. The bottom line is less than $0.01, so basically immaterial.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Right, and that's just because we're reinvesting in that market, the profits back in to grow and
capture the middle-class growth.
<Q - Jason English>: All right, thank you. That's helpful. And a question on North America, Dave Woodward has
been there for not too long yet; I imagine he's still trying to get his feet firmly planted. Any early read on what we may
expect to see differently coming out of that market with the new leadership?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think Dave is bringing great energy and enthusiasm to the role, and he's working to
drive what he would call a demand-driven recovery. So I think he's focused on the big brands, and you saw that we've
exited a few of our smaller, less advantaged brands, so we're really gearing the focus on those big brands. We're getting
the price/value offering correct across the portfolio. Once we do that, we're increasing the marketing support behind
those key brands. And then, undergirding it all, we're driving strong productivity to provide some fuel for growth.
So I think we're doing the right things. You saw that volume shares were up in 9 out of 12 categories, so we're pleased
with that, while our average price is up. So investing in the business, driving some innovation, and we're – I think
there's work to be done, but we're pleased Dave's on the case.

<Q - Jason English>: And do you think you can still get to your mid-single-digit constant-currency profit growth
guidance for the full year with some of those initiatives?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think all of those things that we've talked about are in our guidance for the full year,

Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hi, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to start off with the gross margin outlook. I think you
guys had said that you expect a 50 to 100-basis-point expansion on the year. The quarter was up something about 20
basis points. So can you bridge how the pacing goes? Ed, I think you even mentioned in your script about the dramatic
expansions that go forward because of pricing and productivity, but can you guys just expand on this a little bit so folks
can get a little comfort that these expansions are on track with your plan?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. Yeah, David, let me hit that first and then Ed can add some color. Our gross
margin was largely in line with our plan in the first quarter. We do expect the year-on-year increase in gross margin to
gain sequentially, and that's really driven by three key things. I think you'll see somewhat better pricing in the back half
on a net price basis. We'll have a different and more favorable business unit and product mix as well. And we've got
this heavy focus going on in terms of value engineering that combines with the restructuring programs and savings that
we had from last year, so all of those things work to our benefit.
The other thing we're seeing is, over time, we're seeing the gross margins improving in our newer businesses, in Quero
in Brazil and Foodstar in China. As usual, when buy these businesses, the gross margins tend to start out relatively low,
but the opportunity is to drive those northward. We're certainly seeing that, and so we expect that to continue.
One other thing I might add is that we're beginning to leverage the scale and efficiencies of our consolidated European
supply chain hub, so we feel good about where we're going there. We had our new global head of procurement, John
Dickson, join not too long ago, and I think he's starting to make some traction. So, net-net, we feel good about the
leverage and the trajectory as we look forward.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. Then I'd follow up with a question on cost savings in input costs. The cost savings
question, I believe, this year, you're looking for total cost savings of $250 million. Can you just update that? Is that still
the number? Is it any better? And then what did you realize in the first quarter, and how does the pacing of that go
throughout the year? And then just a quick update on input cost inflation, how much is hedged, and what's the rate of
market inflation that you guys typically quote? I know you said the quarter, but what's the full year?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. In terms of productivity from, particularly, the supply chain, I think we're on or
better than target so far, and we believe we have some opportunity there. We'll see as the year goes along, and we'll
play that out. But productivity is running according to plan or better. And in terms of market inflation, I think the
market inflation estimates are still pretty much in line with what we had talked about at Analyst Day, and if I'm
recalling right, that was around 4%?
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: 4%.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, I think you've seen a lot of inflation in a lot of commodities out there, and fortunately for us,
we've locked in a good portion of our year. So the market inflation could be somewhere in the neighborhood of

4%-plus, call it 4% to 5%, but that's highly dependent on several of these crops out there. The big impact, as Ed had
mentioned previously, sweeteners, and in particular, Indonesia, so palm sugars is very, very strong right now on
pricing. But the good news for us is that we have – that will come in largely in line with expectation because we have
largely taken that off the table.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Yeah, I think that the procurement guys have gotten ahead as they saw things going
up, and we're covered a bit more than we would normally be this time of the year, and the way things are looking, that's
very advantageous. I think also, going back to the productivity issues, we were going through the major plant moves
and that sort of thing last year; the operation guys were focused on that. Now that they have got that running, what
they're focused on is, call it the normal type of productivity that sort of went fallow for a little bit, that they can really
focus on and really will start delivering benefits in the second half of the year, on top of the productivity restructuring
charges from last year.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, I think that's well-put. And, David, you've heard the headlines about corn prices
because of the heat and drought and things like that, but to Meg's point, we are virtually all hedged on a lot of those key
commodities, so we really are pretty confident in our outlook on the commodity costs.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, to your question on [ph] sculpting (33:13), back-half-loaded.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney, Janney Capital Markets.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Good morning, everybody. Thank you.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Art, I know you covered this a little bit. I just want a – can you give me detail about what
are the two or three big factors that drive the swings in this tax rate. Because it's just – you have a real low – is this
consistent with what you thought coming into the year, that taxes would flow this way? And what causes them – the
intra-quarter variation so much? And I'm just thinking how much of that lasts into – is this structural stuff that lasts into
fiscal 2014 and 2015, or stuff that is dependent on some of the factors discrete to 2013?
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Well, Jonathan, if you go back to last year, we had a similar discrete transaction in
Q2. We were able to execute a similar transaction in Q1 of this year, and we're planning for another one in the
following quarter. Some tax-planning initiatives are spread evenly over quarters and over years. Others are very
discrete. But the two that we're referring to here are discrete. What the tax guys are looking at is to continue to examine
programs into the future years to try to keep that rate down in the low 20%s.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Absolutely. And we had the benefit this quarter, as we did last year 1Q, the U.K. again took its
corporate tax rate down some 200 basis points, doing the right thing to incent businesses, and so we're very pleased
with that. But you see the benefit of that because that has a bit of a retroactive impact and a one-time big benefit in the
quarter.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: And I think that's another advantage of our having most of our sales overseas. These
foreign tax opportunities do present themselves, and we have a team that's scaling the world to look for taking
advantage of those.

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. I think that's the key point, is, given our significant global mix of sales in
international that allows us a lot more tax-planning opportunities in those foreign jurisdictions. And frankly, the foreign
jurisdictions seem to understand that a lower tax rate is a good thing for their economy, so that's what they're moving to
do. To your other point, we constantly look for opportunities to drive down the tax rate over the long term. You saw
that we had tax rate in the low 20%s last year. We expect it to be this year, and we're certainly working on initiatives to
continue that going forward in the future years. Now, we'll talk more about that as the year goes along, but that is
certainly the expectation and the plan, that we would continue driving those kinds of numbers.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Remember, Heinz is two-thirds international or non-U.S. sales, so our tax rate will vary
accordingly.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, by the way, I wish that the timing of these things was perfectly predictable, and
even through the quarters, but that's just not the reality of ways taxes work.

Our next question comes from Ken Goldman, JPMorgan.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: So, to follow up on the tax rate, the implication there, it sounds like, if you're talking about, I
don't know, 12%, 13% for the second quarter, if I'm hearing the low-double-digit number right, to get to about a 23%
number for the year, you have to do about 30% tax rate in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure that math
is correct.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: It would be upper 20%s.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Upper 20%s.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Right, but the tax guidance for the year is flat, and last year was 21.7%.

<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay.
<A - Meg Nollen>: So – okay?
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Got it, so that's helpful. And then the question I have as a follow-up to that would be, there's a
lot of companies out there now that have a lot of international sales. You certainly are in that group, and you've done a
great job building your global portfolio to get there. But not every company is able to find these discrete transactions,
as you call them, as often as you do. And I think the credit goes to your tax department, genuinely, for finding them,
but I'm curious, what do you credit that to? What are you able to do that – without disparaging other companies, that
maybe other companies aren't able to find? It does seem like you're able to get lower taxes than other companies on an
average basis, even other companies that may have even more of an international exposure that you do. So I'm just
curious if you can help me understand that a little bit.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Well, we have a team downstairs that is very focused on it. In addition, we have a lot
of outsiders that come in and present opportunities. When we go into the various countries, we try to get very familiar
with what their law is, what the opportunities are. We engage local tax experts, and we take it very seriously. It is an
opportunity, when you've got the geographic expanse that we have, to take advantage of that. So most of these ideas are
not internally generated; we listen attentively to other people with ideas, see if they work with our portfolio, and try to
capitalize on them the best we can, so a very active team.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, I suspect business unit mix is an advantage for us, but I think, at the end of the
day, we have a great tax team that does exceptionally good work.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: And very quickly, Meg, when you talk about expecting constant-currency EPS growth of about
10%, what's the base on that? There've been some divestitures, some SKU rationalizations. Is it the $0.81 base, or how
do we look at that from 2Q 2012?
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yes, it is based off the $0.81, roughly, yes.
<Q - Ken Goldman>: Okay, thank you.

North America, how you'd characterize things at the moment; are you feeling any more or less confident than you were
three months ago in being able to achieve whatever level of pricing was embedded in your initial fiscal 2013 plan? And
should we consider the level of pricing we saw in North America in Q1 to be sort of reflective of what you're looking
for, for the full year?

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Matt, to your point, it's a competitive world out there. There's no doubt about it. And
the developed markets, including the U.S., are certainly a challenge. But I think it's all about balance. It isn't a
black-and-white thing, and it varies by category and it varies by country. So it goes business-to-business, and we're
trying to be very nuanced in our approach, so list pricing actions, in some cases, are not in the cards. On the flipside of
that, we have driven, I think, very effectively against making our promotion spending more efficient and more
effective, in many cases both for us and for our trade customers. So I think Dave Moran's been doing a nice job with
this team over in Europe on that. Dave Woodward certainly is focused in that arena. We're focused on it in Australia as
well.
So I'd say it's a difficult environment, but I think we've got the tools and the knowledge to be more nuanced and more
effective at it than maybe we would have been in the past. And then, fundamentally, you've probably got more pricing
power in emerging markets, just based on the fragmented trade environment and the more fragmented competitive set
we see in those markets. So we believe we're on track to our plans for pricing, but it's certainly not an easy
environment.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, I think, as always, the consumer's going to pay for what they perceive to be value, and we
have to get that value equation right. In some cases, that means prices go up; in some cases, that means we get a little
more competitive. And the key is the innovations, the brand support, driving the consumer to the shelf, doing all the
right things by the brand. And I know Dave Woodward and the North American team is striving for this long-term
sustainable growth in their business, so stay tuned.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, thanks. And a very quick housekeeping, apologies if I missed this, but can you
provide any updated FX guidance, either on the sales or EPS line, for the full year?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, I think when we talked to you guys in May, we had expected that the FX would
be an impact of about $0.06 for the full year. You saw that we got hit with $0.04 just in Q1 alone. If recollection serves
me correctly, if the rates stayed around where they are now, you might see another nickel over that $0.06 that we were
talking about, another $0.04 to $0.05. Having said that, we tend not to really adjust our outlook for Forex this early in
the year, because you're starting to see a lot of volatility, and frankly, over recent days, we've seen some of the currency
rates move slightly in our favor. So it's hard to say. It's early in the year yet, but I think there's probably another $0.04
to $0.05, if nothing changed on currency, for the full year.

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson, Consumer Edge.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Thank you very much. Hey, everyone.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Good morning, Rob.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Good morning. So, just a couple of quick questions for you; I guess the first is just on cash. I
know you said – I think you put in the prepared remarks and discussed that you'd have cash at $1 billion-plus now. I
know it could be very small change, but before, you were saying, I think, $1.1 billion. And then in line with that, I also
saw, I guess, the cash balance at the end of the year was a little bit higher than we're seeing in Q1. So I was wondering
if you could just kind of provide a little color as to why there should be just incrementally more pressure on operating
free cash flow.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. And let me be clear. We didn't consciously change anything in our guidance, so
what we said in May, that is our outlook for cash flow. I think Q1 was impacted by three things, as Ed alluded to. First,
we had the carryover productivity spending from the restructuring activities last year. That was $40-some million,
which put our cash negative for the quarter. Capital spending was up a bit, and then there was some timing of

receivables securitizations.
But, if you remember, we are a very back-half-oriented company. If you go back over the history of Heinz for the last
10 years, given the crop cycles in the Northern Hemisphere, we tend to be back-half-loaded in terms of cash flow. So
we feel like we're on track for that. We've got a strong history of delivering cash. So we're tracking to it; as always, a
lot of hard work to be done, but we're on track.
Your other question was on cash balance? Refresh my memory, Rob, what -?
<A - Meg Nollen>: Right. So 4Q to 1Q, but that's just we're buying inventories. As crops are coming in, we're setting
up for the year, so that – and the carryover productivity cash, so that's normal.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: That's normal cyclicality.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect. And then I guess the second question is just a bit broader, is, look, you
pre-released yesterday; EPS constant currency is up a little over 15%. You're saying, I guess, for Q2 that you expect a
low-double-digit tax rate, but then for the full year, you expect similar to what you guided to at the investor day, so that
should be in line, going up in the back half. It sounds like there's a little bit more investment coming in Q2 and really in
the back half.
So, if you're not increasing guidance on constant currency from 5% to 8%, even though you did 15% in Q1, and then
Q2 would seem like it would have to be a little bit higher than guidance, too, just because of the tax rate again; are you
just playing it safe in Q1 because it's early in the fiscal year? Or is what we should be expecting and modeling is
basically a deceleration of EPS growth into the back half of the fiscal year, really because the tax rate rolls off?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Well, keep in mind two things, that first, the tax rate does get higher in the back half,
no doubt about that. So that's largely a timing issue. But we are investing heavily in the business in the back half of the
year, so some of that $120 million investment is more back-half loaded than front-half, just given the timing of the
initiative. So it's a combination of investment and then the timing of tax. But I think, look back at our history, we have
always shied away from moving guidance in the first – our outlook in the first quarter. It's still early yet in the year.
We'll see how things continue to progress. It's a volatile world out there. So I think we'll talk to you further on that at
the end of Q2. But, as we say, we have a history of trying to invest in the business to make sure that our growth is
sustainable over the long term.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Sure. So, as you're modeling, don't get ahead of your skis, please. This is a company that focuses
on its targets. We've got a pretty broad target, [ph] $3.52 to $3.62 (47:48) constant-currency guidance, and when the
company tends to exceed, we tend to reinvest to drive sustainable growth. So we've got a lot of very strong investments
this year, but to our point, it's the first quarter.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Right, it's early.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Fair enough. Thank you very much.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Ed, I just wanted to follow up on -
<A - Meg Nollen>: You dialed slow today.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I'm sorry?
<A - Meg Nollen>: You dialed slow today.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Indeed, indeed; well, it's late August and all. Just wanted to follow up quickly on, I think it was
Ed's comment where he mentioned that in frozen I think both volume and price were contributors in the quarter. I just
want to make sure I have that right, and if I do, when was sort of the last time you had that combination or that balance,
if you will, in the frozen space? And was there anything in this quarter in particular that was either one-off about that,
that I shouldn't expect that type of better balance going forward through the year, whether it's promotionally oriented or
what have you? Or are we just getting back to a better balance given some of the changes in the price points and things
that you're doing?
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: No, you did hear right; that is what I said. When is the last time that occurred, I can't
tell you offhand.
<A - Meg Nollen>: It's been a while, Andrew. There's a lot of discipline. There's been a lot of hard work by the brand
team, doing the right thing on the shelf, a lot of great innovation that's out there. There are so many nuances in the
Nielsen data that we know you can't see. The main thing I would point out to you is Nielsen data is cash register ring,
and so if the retailer makes some adjustments to their margin levels, that will reflect in Nielsen data. You think it's us,
but it's not us. So Heinz is doing the right things. The frozen team's working hard, the innovation's driving. But, to your
point, we haven't seen that balance – I'll have to go back, I don't have – it's one of the factoids I don't have with me.
You stumped me. But we'll go back and -
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: [indiscernible] (50:04).
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah. We'll go back and look for that. But kudos to the North American frozen team; they're
working really hard.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, and I think, Andrew, to that point, we're pleased...
<A - Meg Nollen>: [ph] With the whole frozen. (50:18)
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: ...that both frozen and ambient were up. Ambient was up a bit more than frozen, but
frozen being up nonetheless. And I think part of that is that we continue to focus the portfolio on our bigger brands.
And so this is all about investing behind the core brands, the power brands that we can get some real bang for the buck
on. And, over time, I'd like to continue that because that's where I think the growth can be driven quite successfully.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: And also keep in mind that the Long Fong business that we discussed was actually a
headwind to the frozen volume during this quarter.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Right.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Right, and thank you for you pointing that out. Last thing, and it's admittedly more qualitative,
but I know also in addition to a change at the top of NACP, you also had a fairly recent change in head of sales there,
with John Hans. And I'm trying to get a sense of perhaps what's kind of most clear and present in terms of opportunities
that you get a sense coming from him as well?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I think that he's bringing a high level of energy; he's plugged in. He's got a track record
of strong innovation and doing some great things in the U.K. We have every expectation that he'll do that in the U.S. as
well. And so – but he's early days in implementing changes, that he'll continue to figure out exactly what he wants to do
and we'll keep you posted.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, I think John's very excited about the emerging channels. There's been a lot of work that's
been done – or alternate channels, if you will, by the North American team and the U.S. team. And so he's really

embracing that and the opportunity that's present for Heinz, because that's not an area we had focused historically.
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: Yeah, and keep in mind, John came out of the U.S. business a few years ago and he
was one of the guys who was instrumental in kicking off the trade promotion reduction program that we've talked about
at USCP for a number of years.
<A - Meg Nollen>: And that discipline and rigor, so it's a welcome to John back to the U.S. and a lot of good
initiatives underway.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much and I'll see you guys next week.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Sounds good.

Our next question comes from Robert Moskow, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. How are you doing, Meg? I guess my – we did some work on operating income growth
trends in the packaged food industry, and I'm sure you've seen this too, but Heinz's income growth has only been, by
our math, about 10% over the last five years, when I strip out acquisitions. The group is 28%. And I guess this is
another quarter where operating income is flat, albeit there's a currency hit. And as I look at the guidance for the rest of
the year, it doesn't look like operating income is going to be a major driver of earnings growth. And it's what I use in
my models to do my valuation, and I think it encompasses a lot of what drives value. And I'm just wondering,
internally, how important is the operating income growth to executive compensation, and when you look at your
performance versus your peer group, are you seeing the same thing?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, Rob, operating income growth is a key element of compensation for all of our
executives that run businesses. So, yeah, there is no lack of focus on it. I can't recognize the operating income numbers
that you're talking about. Certainly, there's ForEx noise in there; there's divesture noise in there.
<A - Meg Nollen>: And investment.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: And investments in the business. So I think all of those things play in, and we may
need to compare notes on that front. But operating income is a key focus for us, and frankly, even with strong
investments this year, we expect very solid operating income growth.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, Rob, we saw your note come through, and I just haven't had the time to focus on it yet. A, I
think the number's understated; we'll get with you on it and see if we can't figure out. But, B, understand that this a
company that's investing, and remember that Keystone has been gearing up over the last five years. And we've been
spending to really get highly efficient and leverage the scale of this organization. We have tremendous productivity
coming in the coming years from Keystone alone. But it is a key goal of this organization to get our margins in that top
tier, and we're going to go after it. So I saw that come through, but we'll be happy to work with you and narrow that
down for you, help you out.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I'll show you how I came to it. But here's another challenge for you guys. I've heard
reinvestment a lot today, and certainly at the Analyst Day too. But then I look at the reshaping of the portfolio, like the
exit of T.G.I. Friday's, exit of Boston Market, exit of the – streamlining Long Fong. These are areas where, a few years
ago, there was significant investment in those projects. So have you – I guess that's my challenge, is like, do you feel

like this amount of reinvestment that you're doing now, we're not going to look back three years forward and say we
have to streamline again?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: No. I think, Rob, we're getting focused on those core top 15 brands, so we're really
trying to focus where the biggest payback is. But to your point, over time, the world changes, and the realities change,
consumer tastes change, industry trends change. We will always try to be out front of those trends and those changes so
that we're not getting dragged along behind trends; we're anticipating, we're getting out in front of them. We think those
are the right things to do to continue to strengthen the portfolio. The investments are going behind our biggest brands,
not some of these smaller brands.
And I think one of the key statistics to keep an eye on our metrics is that percent of our total sales that are in those top
15 brands, because those are the big powerhouse brands that I think have the leverage and the scale and the brand
position to win. And so, more and more, if we can focus the portfolio on those brands, and then focus our resources –
marketing and otherwise – on those, I think it's the right thing to do. But we're going to continue to evolve and adjust
with the world that we're faced with.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Absolutely. And we've been talking to shareholders over the last several weeks – and months,
frankly – who have actually praised us for moving quickly and making decisions. So we're trying some new things, and
if they work, we continue to support them; if they don't, we make our move, and we shift those dollars and reallocate
them. And so I think Heinz is allocating its capital and its marketing dollars well. And the investment in systems is a
mandatory; it's something we have to do. As you know, we don't have a single ERP system where we can consolidate
our global world, and that makes our world more difficult, and we've got to get that inefficiency out. So that spend is
necessary.
Regarding other investment spend, we evaluate; we're highly disciplined. And as you know, Bill thinks this industry
overspends in given areas, and he's going to make sure that we're getting a return for this money, and if we are not, he'll
pull it and he'll move it elsewhere.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Let me ask you just two quick modeling questions. One is the Venezuela, how much of
a drag is that on fiscal 2013 compared to what happened last year? And then lastly, marketing spend, you say you're
going to be up $70 million; quantitatively, is it going to look a little bit less because of currency, on a comparison
basis?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Let me say something about Venezuela first. Venezuela was down in the first quarter,
and as I recall, both sales and profit-wise. You've got an environment there that's a little bit up in the air. They've got a
big elections coming up in October, and I think consumers are sort of sitting back and waiting to see how things trend.
So that may stabilize as we go forward, Venezuela is not a big business for us, so it's not a huge impact, but it's not -
<A - Meg Nollen>: [indiscernible] (59:04)
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah, it certainly didn't help in Q1. In terms of the marketing spend, on a
constant-currency basis, we've talked about at least $70 million. To the extent that currency moves in the other
direction, it could moderate from there. But I'll tell you, I suspect that we're going to have enough great ideas and
enough good brand initiatives that we may go past that $70 million. We'll see.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. So when I look at, I think, $460 million of advertising expense or marketing expense in
fiscal 2012, should it look more like $530 million for fiscal 2013 when it's all said and done?
<A - Edward J. McMenamin>: On a constant-currency basis, yes.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yeah. Yeah, that would be right.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, got it. All right, thanks very much.
<A - Meg Nollen>: All right, thank you. I'll take one quick one. I love that you're adhering to the one-part question,
guys.

Okay. Our next question comes from Ann Gurkin, Davenport.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Great. Good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Hey, Ann.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Congratulations on your great start to your year.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Thank you.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Thanks.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: I just wanted to ask one more thing about M&A opportunities; any change in the pipeline,
timeline expectations for opportunities for M&A, either domestically or internationally?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: No, I – good question. We're working on -- it is a very active pipeline. We've got a lot
going on, on that front. And frankly, we're thrilled with the performance of our two most recent acquisitions in Quero
and Foodstar, so we'd love to get more just like them. Obviously, I can't speak about specific opportunities, but there's a
number of them that we're working. The pipeline is very full. Especially in emerging markets, we tend to be very
thorough and patient to ensure that we end up with the right strategic fit and we don't overpay.
So we're excited about it. We're working on things. We'll keep you posted. We continue to work and focus on emerging
markets and also in our – really two of our core categories, ketchup and sauces and infant/nutrition. But lots going on,
and again, we'll keep you posted as time unfolds.
<A - Meg Nollen>: Yeah, it's frustrating you can't get them across the line. These are relationships and negotiations.
But we're not going to rush it. We're going to do the right thing.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: That sounds great. Thank you all very much.
Meg Nollen
All right. Well, we look forward to seeing many of you next week at the Barclays Back-to-School Conference in
Boston, where Art will present Wednesday, September 5. The timeslot is now 9.45 a.m. And, as always, Mary Ann and
I will be around today to answer any follow-up questions, the whole IR team; the main line is 412-456-6020. Have a
great day.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks.
