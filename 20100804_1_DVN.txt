MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being
recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Devon's second quarter 2010 earnings conference call and
webcast. I will begin with some housekeeping items as usual, and then I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO,
John Richels, for his overview. Following John's remarks, Dave Hager, our head of Exploration and Production, will
provide an operations update. And then finally after Dave's comments, Jeff Agosta, our Chief Financial Officer, will
review Devon's financial results and our outlook. At that point, we'll open it up to Q&A.
I want to point out that our Chairman, Larry Nichols, and other senior members of the management team are with us
today as well for the Q&A session. And as a reminder, we will ask each of you in the Q&A session to limit your
questions to one and one follow-up. We'll keep the call to an hour, so if we don't get to your question, we'll be around
the rest of the day to answer any questions you may have remaining. A replay of this call will be available today
through a link on Devon's home page.
During the call today, we'll update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results for the first half of
the year and our revised outlook for the second half of 2010. In addition to the updates that we're going to provide on

the call, we will file an 8-K later today that will have the details of our updated 2010 guidance. The guidance section of
our website at DevonEnergy.com will also have the updated forward-looking information. That information is under
the Guidance link found within the Investor Relations section of the website.
Before we get to the discussion of the quarter, we're obligated to remind you that this discussion will contain
information about our expectations, plans, forecasts, estimates. All this is considered forward-looking statements under
U.S. securities law. And while we strive to give you the very best estimates possible, there are many factors that could
cause our actual results to differ from the guidance that we're going to provide; and so we would encourage you to
review the discussion of risk factors that can be found in the 8-K that we are filing today.
One other compliance item, we will refer to various non-GAAP performance measures in today's call. When we use
these measures, we're required to provide additional disclosures under U.S. securities law. If you would like to review
those disclosures, they are available on our website.
I also want to remind everybody that the strategic repositioning that we are currently in the midst of affects the
financial and operational data for all periods reported. Our decision to divest the international operations resulted in the
related production being excluded from our reported production volumes for all periods presented. The revenues and
expenses associated with those international operations are collapsed into a single line item at the end of our statement
of operations labeled Discontinued Operations.
Conversely, while we have divested all of our assets and operations in the Gulf of Mexico, oddly enough, the Gulf
results are required to be reported in our results from continuing operations through the close of the sales. Said another
way, the results from continuing operations reported today include both our North American onshore assets that we are
retaining and the results from our divested Gulf of Mexico operations through the date of the closings of those sales.
Most of our comments today on the call will focus on the results from continuing operations, but we will also provide
some additional commentary specifically referencing our North American onshore results, and we provided
information in the press release that enables you to isolate those results so that you can see what our go-forward
business will look like. For those interested in a more detailed view of our international results, we've also provided
information in today's press release regarding that.
As far as the Street earnings forecast go, most analysts reporting estimates to First Call have excluded discontinued
operations. The mean estimate of those analysts, that is the mean estimate for earnings excluding discontinued
operations, was $1.39 for the quarter. Our adjusted earnings came in a nickel lower at $1.34 per share. The main driver
was a higher than expected deferred tax rate in the second quarter. Second quarter included a true-up in deferred taxes
for the first six months of the year. This non-cash deferred tax expense did not affect our cash flow in the second
quarter. And after the adjusting items, cash flow from continuing operations came in at 3.02 per share, which was well
above the First Call estimate of 2.80 per share.
With those items out of the way, I'm going to turn the call over to John Richels.
John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Vince, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid quarter for Devon. Second
quarter production from retained properties, that is our North American onshore properties, exceeded our guidance,
growing to about 620,000 BOE per day, and that's up nearly 6% over the first quarter of 2010. With the better than
expected performance from our retained properties, we're raising our 2010 production guidance for our retained
properties by 2 to 3 million barrels to a revised range of 223 to 224 million barrels equivalent.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter. That's a 40% increase over the
second quarter of 2009. And second quarter net earnings were more than double that of the prior year, coming in at
$706 million or $685 million after adjusting items. And finally, our marketing and midstream business delivered
another solid quarter, generating 125 million in operating profit.

Perhaps equally important is the progress we made during the second quarter with the strategic repositioning that we
announced last November. In the second quarter, we completed our exit from the Gulf of Mexico and finalized our sale
of the Panyu field in China. To date, we have received aggregate pre-tax proceeds of approximately $4.6 billion. The
remaining $5.3 billion of signed transactions yet to close consists of our divestitures in Azerbaijan and Brazil and our
remaining assets in China.
Last week, we received the necessary approvals for the $2 billion sale of our interest in the ACG field in Azerbaijan to
BP, and the closing of that transaction is now scheduled for August 16. In Brazil, the sale to BP continues to move
through the multi-layer approval process of the Brazilian government, and we remain on track to close that around year
end. Aggregate proceeds from the divestitures will approximate $10 billion or roughly $8 billion after tax, and this is
well above the 4.5 to $7.5 billion of after-tax net proceeds that we expected when we announced our repositioning last
November.
As we have always said, our objective is to redeploy our capital through the combination of E&P projects, share
repurchases, and debt repayment that optimizes growth on a per debt-adjusted share basis. Year to date, we have
reduced our debt balances by some $1.7 billion, which includes the repayment of all of our commercial paper balances
and $350 million of senior notes.
In addition to repaying debt, we've been active with our share repurchase program that was announced in early May.
During May and June, we repurchased 7.6 million common shares at a cost of $495 million. If you include the shares
we purchased in July, we have now purchased 11.9 million shares at a cost of $761 million. This represents nearly 3%
of our outstanding shares. At this pace, we're well on track to complete the entire $3.5 billion share repurchase
initiative within the 12 to 18 month timeframe we initially expected.
As we indicated when we announced the strategic repositioning last November, we're also investing a portion of the
divestiture proceeds in our go-forward North American onshore business.
As part of the asset sale to BP, we announced that we were applying $500 million of the sales proceeds to purchase
50% of BP's interest in the Kirby oil sands leases, which are immediately adjacent to our highly successful Jackfish
project. We finalized the joint venture agreement with BP during the second quarter, and we changed the name from
Kirby to Pike just to avoid confusion with some other industry projects in the Kirby area. This acquisition substantially
increases our footprint in SAGD [Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage] oil, and extends Devon's visible growth in SAGD
oil production for the remainder of the decade. Dave will talk more about the activity that we have planned at Pike later
on in the call.
We're also investing a portion of the divestiture proceeds to deepen our oil and our liquids-rich gas inventory in North
America. In fact, for the year 2010 we have leased or are in the process of leasing more than 450,000 net acres in oil or
condensate rich plays in addition to the Kirby/Pike acreage. Almost half of this acreage lies in the Permian Basin,
where we have leased 58,000 additional net acres in our Wolfberry oil play, 115,000 additional net acres in the Avalon
Shale play, and 19,000 additional acres in the third Bone Spring play; the balance of the acreage in oil plays in the
Permian Basin and elsewhere that we won't be ready to talk about until we have completed our leasing programs.
During the second quarter, we are also leasing additional acreage in the Cana play. Recently, we entered into
agreements to acquire about 50,000 additional net acres in the liquids-rich portion of the Cana. This brings our position
in the Cana to roughly 230,000 net acres, representing many years of drilling inventory. As many of you know, some
industry observers have characterized our Cana play in western Oklahoma as one of the most economic shale plays in
North America. The liquids-rich portion of the play offers a significant oil or condensate component as well as natural
gas liquids.
When we entered the year, we expected our 2010 E&P capital including expenditures associated with the divestitures'
assets to total about $5.6 billion. Originally, you might recall we expected to spend $1.5 billion of this budget on the
assets being divested. However, the faster than expected progress with the Gulf divestitures and our upcoming close on
the sale of ACG has allowed us to redirect about $800 million of that capital to onshore North America, primarily for
the new resource capture in the areas that I just covered.

In addition, we've allocated roughly $200 million of the divestiture proceeds to our 2010 capital budget. That brings
our 2010 E&P capital budget to $5.8 billion, including the $700 million of capital that we're spending this year on the
divestiture properties. Of course, this does not include the $500 million Kirby/Pike acquisition, which was done as part
of the BP transaction.
It's worth noting that while the $700 million of capital associated with the divestiture properties will be reported as
capital spending by Devon in 2010, the terms of the purchase and sale agreements allow us to recover that capital from
the purchasers in the form of purchase price adjustments.
When we analyze our 2010 North American onshore E&P capital spend in terms of product mix, roughly 80% is
focused on crude oil, condensate, and liquids-rich projects. Of this 80%, roughly half is focused on crude oil and
condensate projects, and the other half is focused on projects where natural gas liquids production is the dominant
driver of the economics. The balance, that is the remaining 20% of our budget, is largely focused on securing term
acreage or derisking natural gas plays in our existing portfolio.
When you step back and view the repositioning of the company as a whole, following the close of the pending asset
sales, we will have sold roughly 10% of Devon's proved reserves and production with after-tax proceeds from these
divestitures exceeding 20% of our enterprise value. Assuming completion of the balance of the share repurchase
program at today's stock price, we will have reduced our share count by 12% while significantly strengthening our
balance sheet and deepening our inventory in some of the highest margin oil, condensate, and liquids-rich gas plays this
North America. This puts us in an extremely competitive position for the future, regardless of the macro environment.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a review of our quarterly operating highlights. David?
David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of company-wide drilling activity. We exited the
second quarter with 65 Devon operated rigs running. During the second quarter, we drilled 315 wells, including 306
development wells and nine exploration wells. All of these wells were successful.
Capital expenditures for exploration and development from our North American onshore operations were 1.1 billion for
the second quarter, bringing our total through the first six months to $2.1 billion, excluding the Kirby/Pike acquisition.
This level of activity increased second quarter production from retained properties by 6% over the previous quarter and
8% over the fourth quarter of 2009.
Moving now to our quarterly operations highlights, at our 100% Devon owned Jackfish thermal oil project in eastern
Alberta, our second quarter daily production averaged a little over 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties. Following the
close of the quarter on July 10, we had a minor wellhead release of steam and bitumen. A small hole in the wellhead
likely caused by sand erosion resulted in the release. Cleanup is about 90% complete, and we expect to finish it in the
next couple weeks.
Our technical team has completed an ultrasonic testing of all the Jackfish wellheads, and determined that the issue is
isolated to three wellheads on one pad. We will be making the necessary modification to the wellheads; and subject to
regulatory approval, expect to bring the affected pad back on stream in the next couple of weeks.
The production impact from the incident is minimal, about 5,000 barrels per day while the pad is off line. However,
third and fourth quarter Jackfish production will be impacted by a plant turnaround scheduled to begin in September.
Accordingly, our net Jackfish production is expected to average about 23,000 barrels per day for the second half of
2010.
With construction of Jackfish 2 roughly 85% complete, the project is about $100 million under budget, and remains on
schedule for first oil in late 2011. We expect total project cost through startup for Jackfish 2 to come in below the
industry average at approximately $30,000 per flowing barrel. For Jackfish 3, we expect to file the regulatory
application in the next few weeks. Pending regulatory approval and formal sanctioning, we could begin site work by

late 2011, with plant startup targeted for late 2014. I will remind you that Devon has a 100% working interest in each of
these three Jackfish projects.
At Kirby/Pike, this is our 50:50 SAGD joint venture with BP that Devon operates; we estimate gross recoverable
resources there of up to 1.5 billion barrels. To determine the optimal number of development phases needed, we will
initiate a drilling program and begin shooting 3D seismic over the Kirby/Pike acreage later this year. With the addition
of Kirby or Pike to Jackfish, we expect to grow our net SAGD production to 150,000 to 175,000 barrels per day by
2020.
In our Lloydminster oil play in Alberta, we drilled 14 new wells in the second quarter. Lloydminster production
averaged 41,000 barrels equivalent per day in the quarter, a 4% increase over the first quarter.
Moving to the Permian Basin, as John mentioned earlier, we have been actively acquiring acreage in several of our key
oil plays. In our Wolfberry light oil play in west Texas, we have added 58,000 net acres since the beginning of the year,
and now have 200,000 prospective net acres in the play. We have four operated rigs running and drilled 26 wells during
the second quarter. The second quarter activity included our best well to date in the play. The Helen Crump B-11 came
online, flowing over 500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While we are still in the early stages of evaluating our large
Wolfberry acreage position, results to date have been encouraging.
Also in the Permian Basin, we have been building a position in the Avalon Shale play. To date, we have assembled
235,000 prospective net acres in this condensate and liquids-rich gas play. Although we are still in the early evaluation
of the play, initial drilling results indicate an attractive, repeatable play with outstanding economics. The best wells we
have drilled to date have IP-ed at over 500 barrels of condensate per day, 500 barrels of NGLs per day, and 3 to 5
million cubic feet per day of gas. Well costs in the play run between 3.3 and $4 million. We expect Avalon wells to
have average IPs of 300 barrels of condensate per day, 300 barrels of NGLs per day, and 2 million cubic feet of gas per
day in the heart of the play. We expect per-well recoveries to average over 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent. These
characteristics give the Avalon Shale great return potential. We expect to participate in 32 Avalon wells this year,
including 20 that we will operate.
While we have not talked about our Granite Wash position in the past, we delivered some very encouraging results
there during the second quarter. We brought two Devon operated Granite Wash wells online, with an average 24-hour
IP of 29 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 585 barrels of oil or condensate and 1,330 barrels of NGLs.
With the recent success in both the Cherokee and Granite Wash A sands, we are stepping up our activity in the area.
We currently have two rigs running in the play, and plan to add a third rig that we will move from the Barnett this
month. We have an inventory of about 150 Cherokee and Granite Wash A locations and 200 additional undrilled
locations in other Granite Wash formations. Since we hold our position in the Granite Wash with existing production,
we are under no pressure to drill. However, given the attractive rate of returns generated by these wells in this
environment, we are reallocating capital to this play. We now plan to drill 16 Granite Wash wells this year.
Moving to the Cana Woodford shale in western Oklahoma, as John indicated, we are in the process of acquiring a
significant amount of additional acreage in this play. Most of this new acreage is primary term and located in a
liquids-rich portion of the play. We are currently running nine operated rigs, and will bring additional rigs into the play
over the next few months to secure this term acreage.
We continue to see outstanding results from Cana and believe that the field offers some of the best economics among
gas plays in North American shale. In the second quarter, we brought ten operated wells online with average 24-hour IP
rates of 6.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 86 barrels of condensate and 350 barrels per day of NGLs.
Second quarter net production from Cana averaged a record 105 million cubic feet of equivalent per day, including
1,000 barrels per day of condensate and 3,000 barrels of NGLs. This was up 43% on a sequential quarter basis.
Earlier this year, we initiated an infill pilot program at Cana to help us better understand optimal well spacing. This was
a joint project with another operator that consists of nine total horizontal wells being drilled and completed within one
square mile. Five of these wells were spaced at 500 feet apart and the other four wells at 660 feet apart. Excluding the
first well in the section that had been producing for some time, the average 30-day IP from the eight new wells was 5.4

million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 46 barrels of condensate per day and 245 barrels of NGLs per day.
These results are encouraging. We will continue to monitor the performance from these wells to determine if the results
support this reduced well spacing.
Moving to the Barnett Shale field in north Texas, we are currently running 17 Devon operated rigs. But as I mentioned,
we will be moving one of these rigs to the Granite Wash later this month. We plan to run the remaining 16 rigs in the
Barnett for the rest of 2010.
We continue to be very selective with our Barnett drilling, focusing our activity in the liquids-rich areas. Our net
production in the Barnett exceeded 1.1 BCF equivalent per day, including 39,000 barrels per day of NGLs and
condensate. Although hidden by the rounding, the second quarter daily rate was up 3% from the first quarter. We
continue to expect our Barnett production to reach our previous record production of 1.2 BCF equivalent per day
during the third quarter.
Shifting to the Haynesville Shale, after derisking much of our held-by-production acreage in the Carthage area during
2009, our 2010 activity has focused on our term acreage in the southern area. In addition to the Haynesville potential,
we are evaluating the southern acreage for Bossier Shale and James Lime potential. In San Augustine County, we
brought our first Bossier Shale well online in the second quarter, with a 24-hour IP of about 8 million cubic feet per
day. In southern Shelby County, the Haynesville Motley 1-H was brought online at more than 7 million cubic feet per
day.
To help secure our acreage in the southern area, we have begun farming in industry partners on a promoted basis on
some of our term acreage. Given the service cost environment in the Haynesville and the deep inventory of other
attractive opportunities in our portfolio, we believe this is the most prudent path to take.
And finally, in the Horn River Basin of northern British Columbia, we continue to methodically secure our 170,000 net
acres with drilling. We have drilled but not yet completed four of seven planned horizontal wells for this year. We plan
to bring these four new wells on to production by year end, and the remaining three in the first quarter of 2011. Our
producing wells at Horn River continue to perform very well, supporting an EUR [Estimated Ultimate Recovery] of 7
to 8 BCF equivalent per well.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Agosta for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?
Jeff A. Agosta, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that
affected our second quarter financial results and provide our outlook for the second half of the year.
As Vince mentioned earlier, we have reclassified the assets, liabilities, and results of operations from our international
assets into discontinued operations for all accounting periods presented. As a result, most of my comments will focus
on our reported continuing operations. Our reported results from continuing ops include both our retained North
American onshore assets and a partial quarter's result from our Gulf of Mexico operations that we exited during the
second quarter.
Looking first at production, in the second quarter of 2010, Devon produced 58.5 million barrels of oil equivalent from
continuing ops or approximately 643,000 BOE per day. Excluding volumes from the Gulf, our retained North
American onshore properties produced 620,000 BOE per day. This exceeded the high end of the guidance range
provided during last quarter's conference call by roughly 15,000 BOE per day, about 9,000 of which was attributable to
a favorable royalty adjustment on natural gas production in Canada related to prior periods. The balance of the
production beat is due to better than expected results from both the U.S. onshore business and Canada.
Based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect full-year
production from our North American onshore properties to climb to between 223 and 224 million barrels of oil
equivalent. We expect our production to range between 610 and 620,000 BOE per day in the third quarter, and 625 and

635,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of our third quarter estimate reflects an increase in sequential
quarter production after adjusting the second quarter for the out-of-period royalty adjustment that we have reported.
Moving to price realizations, in the second quarter the WTI Oil Index remained strong, averaging $78.16 per barrel,
better than 31% increase from the second quarter of 2009. During the quarter, regional differentials widened compared
to the first quarter, especially with our heavier crudes in Canada. However, our second quarter oil price realizations
were right in line with the midpoint of our guidance at 80% of WTI or $62.35 per barrel. For the third quarter, we
expect our oil price realizations to approximate 95% of WTI for the U.S. and 70% for Canada.
In the second half of 2010, we have 79,000 barrels per day or roughly 70% of our expected oil production hedged, with
an average floor of $67.47 and an average ceiling of $96.48 per barrel. Looking ahead to 2011, we have collars in place
for 33,000 barrels per day, with floors of $75 and average ceilings of $109 per barrel.
On the natural gas side, the second quarter Henry Hub Index averaged 4.09 per MCF. Our company-wide gas price
realizations before the impact of hedges were 89% of Henry Hub or $3.62 per MCF. In the second quarter, we had 61%
of our natural gas production hedged, with a weighted average protected price of $5.82. Cash settlements from this
hedging position boosted our average realizations by $1.06 per MCF, bringing the second quarter price up to $4.68.
For the remainder of 2010, our natural gas hedging position will continue to protect roughly 60% of our gas production
at an average price of $5.98 in the third quarter and $5.87 in the fourth quarter. For 2011 thus far, we have entered into
price swap hedges totaling 225 million cubic feet per day at an average price of 554 per MCF. Later this year, we
expect to add to our 2011 hedge position.
Looking briefly at NGLs, our price per barrel in the second quarter averaged $30.90 for about 40% of WTI. We expect
third quarter realizations to be similar to the second quarter. Seasonal factors should improve NGL realization
somewhat in Q4. However, supply growth in the U.S. could put negative pressure on NGL prices over the longer term.
Shifting now to expenses, second quarter lease operating expense came in at $442 million. This equates to $7.56 per
barrel or 2% higher than the first quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the second half, with higher cost Gulf
properties now divested, we anticipate LOE will decline to between $7.20 and $7.50 per BOE.
For the second quarter, our DD&A expense for oil and gas properties came in at $7.28 a barrel, a 5% decline from last
quarter. Overall, our DD&A rate benefited from the sale of our Gulf assets, which lowered our depletion base. For the
remainder of 2010, we are forecasting that DD&A expense will be between $6.90 and $7.20 per BOE.
Moving on to G&A expense, we continued to reduce G&A expenditures in the most recent quarter. Second quarter
G&A was 130 million or 25% lower than the year-ago quarter. For the first half of the year, G&A declined by nearly
$70 million when compared to 2009. This reduction is largely attributable to lower personnel costs and efficiencies
realized through our strategic repositioning. Based on the positive results for the first two quarters of 2010, we are now
lowering the top end or our full-year guidance by $20 million. Our new full-year estimate for G&A is a range of $580
million to $600 million.
Looking at interest expense, we reported $111 million for the second quarter. Of that expense, $19 million resulted
from the early retirement of $350 million of 7.25% senior notes, which we redeemed in June. Excluding this one-time
charge, second quarter interest expense totaled 92 million. For the remainder of 2010, we expect interest expense to
decline to a range of 80 to $85 million per quarter.
Looking at income taxes, our reported second quarter income tax expense from continuing operations came in at $261
million. This implies a 43% tax rate on $613 million of pre-tax income from continuing ops. The most significant item
that influenced our quarterly tax rate was a non-cash $52 million charge related to the expected repatriation of foreign
earnings. Additionally, a non-recurring taxable gain on the sale of our Gulf assets affected our current and deferred tax
allocation for the quarter. This gain on sale shifted $622 million of second quarter tax expense from deferred into
current.
When you back out the impact of all the unusual items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates, you get an
adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 35%. This rate on non-GAAP earnings includes a true-up adjustment to bring

the year-to-date tax rate up to the 33% we now expect for the full year. In today's news release, we provided a table that
reconciles the effective items that are generally excluded from analyst estimates.
Going to the bottom line, earnings from continuing ops adjusted for special items came in at $597 million or $1.34 per
diluted share. Operating cash flow from continuing ops totaled $1.3 billion for the second quarter, a 40% increase over
the second quarter of 2009. In addition to our operating cash flow, we also received 3.3 billion of pre-tax cash proceeds
from the closing of divestitures in the Gulf and China. We utilized these sources of cash to repurchase $495 million of
common stock, reduce debt balances by $461 million, and fund all of our capital demands, including the $500 million
acquisition of 50% of BP's interest in Kirby/Pike.
We ended the quarter with cash on hand of nearly $3 billion and a net debt to adjusted cap ratio at a multiyear low of
only 14%.
Overall, we are extremely well positioned to continue to operate our business from a position of considerable financial
strength. Continuing to execute on the plan we announced last November positions us for strong growth per debt
adjusted share in 2011 and beyond.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering Holt. Please
proceed.
<Q - David Heikkinen>: Good morning, guys. I've seen a lot of acquisitions this year in your areas of operations, and
you guys have cash available and have been competitive buying some properties. As you think about bidding processes
and amount of capital you commit to acquisitions, can you talk at all about how competitive you've been, any amounts
that you think you could actually invest this year, or any thoughts around the overall budget for acquisitions?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: David, it's John. As you can see, the areas that we've
gone into this year have been areas where we either had a presence and wanted to increase it or areas that were not
subject to the same kind of acquisition climate that some other areas were.
When you look at our asset base, as you know, it tends to have some fairly similar characteristics. We tend to have
fairly low entry costs and a relatively low royalty burden, and so we tried to continue to focus on that. The roughly
$700 million or so that we will have spent this year on acquisitions really helps to augment that base and give us the
kind of critical mass in those areas that we need in order to really be as efficient as we can. So we haven't tended to try
to get into bidding wars in some of these high profile plays because we just don't think that we could be competitive in
that environment in any event.
<Q - David Heikkinen>: Just to follow up, that $700 million year to date, can you give any distribution per region to
try to tie it to the acreage additions that you've had or at least in the Permian where you have given acreage? I know
some of the other areas are more competitive and you may not want to detail.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: David, this is Vince. First of all, the 700
million that John mentioned was our full-year budget now, including the acquisitions of acreage that we've made year
to date and also those that we expect to close in the second half of the year. The weighting to date, year to date has been
in the Permian Basin and the Cana. We are avoiding specific acreage cost discussions because we are still leasing

acreage in those areas, hope to lease more. But the weighting has certainly been in those two areas, and outside the
Cana has been on condensate oriented plays or oil plays.
<Q - David Heikkinen>: I tried. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gilman of Benchmark Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Guys, good morning. I'd like to follow up on the prior question, at least in my first one. It just
seems to me that this is probably a time not to be aggressively trying to acquire oil or liquids-rich acreage but rather gas
acreage, thinking a little bit longer term, and trying to invest at least contra-cyclically. I wonder if you can just
comment strategically on that.
Secondly, more specifically, give me an idea when royalty payout occurs on Jackfish 1 and the assumptions that you
might be making in answering the question.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mark, I'll take a crack at the first one. As you may be
aware, we already have a very, very large position in North American natural gas. Matter of fact, we're in a real
fortunate position when you look at the companies in the sector where we have roughly 40% of a 13.5 billion barrel
resource base that is in the form of either oil condensates or liquids-rich plays, and 60% that is more in the gassy one,
so we've got quite a bit of that. And what we're trying to do is simply allocate our funds to the expenditures that give us
the best return at the time. We think we've got a lot of running room in the gas area as well. It doesn't mean that we
won't continue, as we always have, to continue to augment positions in those areas. But we've got a lot of running room
in the acreage that we already have.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: On the royalty payout on Jackfish?
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Mark, this is Vince. We looked around the
table at each other, and nobody is really certain. John, you're certain on the answer?
<Q - Mark Gilman>: On Jackfish 1?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mark, I think we're getting right to the royalty payout
level now. The way the royalty setup is in Alberta is now we pay I think 5% on our production to payout. And now that
we're two and a bit years into production there, we're just about reaching that payout level.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: And one, two, and three are all...
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sorry, on the first phase only.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: And one, two, and three are separate projects for royalty payout calculation purposes?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, that hasn't been determined yet. We're making our
application for Jackfish 3. And through that application, we'll determine whether these are separate projects or not.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. The capital commitments, John, that you have that you
discussed on the discontinued operations, can you give us some color a little bit on how you basically get that capital
back, and whether or not there's any commitment to maintain levels of activity, and just generally what it means to your
activity levels and things? Obviously you're not going to own it for the longer term. That was my first question.

<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Sure. This is Dave. First, that is just
simply to get the capital back, that's just simply a purchase price adjustment because the effective date of the
transaction is January 1, 2010. So that's just part of the purchase price adjustment, a very simple process and we are
communicating actively with the purchaser of the discontinued assets that have not closed yet, and that's primarily BP
on the Brazil assets. There's an agreed upon plan that we had prior to the divestment of these assets, and we are
executing that plan. We're having discussions with them, but there's really no source of contention at all about what
we're doing. They like the plan. That's why they bought the assets, and we're continuing on with the plan, and there's
really no issue about what the next step should be between now and close.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: This is going to be a little impertinent, but let's assume you had another discovery down there
from an exploration well. Is there any recourse to change the negotiated price on the asset?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: No, there's no recourse, and of
course either way, whether we have a discovery or a dry hole. And I think, frankly, we were able to very fairly
represent the potential of all the wells that we're drilling right now and we think we got paid for it.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, great. My follow-up is completely unrelated. It's I guess Pike and the potential
development planning. I just wondered if you can give a little bit more color. You talked about the level you expect to
get by the end of the decade. But what's the likely timing on Pike in terms of when you might actually think about
breaking ground on that project?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: We have quite a bit of work to do
yet before we know for sure on that on what the timing may be. Obviously, we're going to enter a busy winter with our
additional strat drilling and 3D seismic we're going to do out there as well as some engineering work. But given all that,
I can give you a rough and tentative timetable provided that we have adequate reservoir delineation through this
winter's drilling program. We could have an application for the first phase of Pike somewhere in late 2011. Now how
large that phase is has not yet been determined, and it will depend somewhat on the results of this winter's drilling
program. But then with that, you might have regulatory approval somewhere in early 2013. And then you could begin
facilities construction, have first steam somewhere around mid-2015, and potentially reaching peak production
probably on that first phase somewhere in late 2016.
All that's a tentative schedule, and we have a lot of work to go yet to know if we can accomplish that. But again, that
would be the first phase, and whether the first phase is 35,000 barrels a day or 70,000 barrels a day or something like
that, we don't know yet. We have to do the work this winter, and that will give us a lot better handle on that.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I would just throw into that, when you think about it, if
you look at Kirby or Pike and Jackfish together, and I think you know we've talked about this before, we had been keen
to acquire that acreage, that Kirby/Pike acreage for many, many years, and it really came together as a result of this
larger transaction we did with BP. We've got continuous projects coming on, the second phase of Jackfish, the third
phase of Jackfish, and then several phases of Kirby. And we feel pretty darn good about that Kirby acreage. As Dave
said, we've got to do a lot of delineation drilling, but we have a lot of wells there already that we had core samples from
250. Dave was just saying 250 wells. So there is a lot of wells there that we have core samples from. So we're pretty
enthusiastic about this development prospects on this acreage over the next five to ten years.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Terrific. Very quickly, when do you go to a 15% tax rate out there, John?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It depends on whether these projects get lumped
together as one large project or individual projects. We haven't finally determined that yet with the regulator.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great. I'll leave it there, thank you.

<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: Hi, guys. Just thinking more about 2011 natural gas hedges, it sounds like you guys have started
to put some hedges on, and it roughly looks like about 10% of production. Are you guys still targeting a corporate level
of 50% hedged? And is there a price that you guys would not add natural gas hedges at?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Our goal still, as we said earlier, our goal is to have
about 50% of our production of both natural gas and oil hedged each year. We set that out as a goal. When we do it,
how we do it may change. And I think our view as well has been that we're going to try to lock in prices that give us
some real protection and don't just give protection within – at the bottom end of a range that we believe to be likely for
the year.
Darryl is here. Darryl, do you want to add anything to what the market looks like today and where we might be going
with our hedges in the next little while?
<A - Darryl Smette>: I think you covered it. As Jeff I think pointed out, we have 225 million a day hedged via swaps
at $5.55 or thereabouts on the gas side. We do intend to get up to that 50% level. Our view is that we could have prices
anywhere from $4 to $6. We're in the middle of a real heating season – or cooling season period right now, and right in
the middle of potential hurricanes which actually have had the tendency historically to move price quite a bit. So we'll
probably be in the market in the 5 to 5.50 range over the next few months, and do expect to get to that 50% level by the
end of the year.
<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: Any preference for collars or swaps in that regard?
<A - Darryl Smette>: Right now, we're targeting mainly swaps on the gas side and we do have a preference for collars
on the oil side, as is indicated by I think 33 or 35,000 barrels we have hedged already. So we tend to like swaps on gas
and collars on oil.
<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: Okay, thanks. And then jumping over to the Avalon, can you guys just comment on how many
rigs you guys are currently running; and considering things are going well, where you think that rig count heads into
2010 – 2011? Excuse me.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Hopefully it's going up. We're
running one rig right now. We're going to be adding a couple more rigs here later on this year. We're really just getting
the first results of our operated wells. We have participated in a handful of OBO wells that give us a good indication of
the potential. We want to get some results from our operated wells also. But with the potential liquid content that we
see in the heart of the play here, this could be a very attractive play for us economically. And if it all works out, I can
see us significantly increasing our activity next year on this play. But we just need to get a little bit more results. But
we're very encouraged with what we know so far, and think it could be a pretty big play for us in the future.
<Q - Scott Wilmoth>: And just one last on Avalon, can you just speak generally about the geologic makeup of
Avalon, just some general characteristics?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: I can give you a few stats here, if
you like. Avalon is essentially the source rock for the Bone Springs out there. I can give you a few stats here if you
like. It tends to have prosty generally in the range of around 8 to 15%. It is a shale. It's a fairly thick shale. It's a fairly
homogenous shale out there. The thickness on it ranges on the New Mexico side probably anywhere from around 125
to over 300 feet thick. Similarly, on the Texas side of the play, which is much less mature from a drilling standpoint at
this point, we noted it's a very liquids-rich play on the New Mexico side. It is less known how liquids-rich it is on the
Texas side of the play, and that's part of what we're going to be determining with our drilling program when we add a
rig on that side as well. But it's a thick, homogenous shale with good prosty, normally pressured, but with apparently a
very high liquids content.
The depth of it, if you're curious here, is also on the order of around 7 to 10,000 feet on the New Mexico side; a little
bit shallower on the Texas side, more like 6 to 7,000 foot.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Following up on some of the earlier questions on leaseholds and just maybe as a clarification
question, how much did you actually spend in leaseholds in the first half? What has been implied for the second half,
and does that get you to where you want to be in your key plays you're pursuing, or is this something that you see as
ongoing over the next few years?
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: I'll tell you what, while we're looking up the
amount spent in the first half versus the second half, let me just tell you philosophically, Brian, that while we think we
always need to have a leasehold acquisition component to have a sustainable business, we've done a disproportionate
amount of leasing in 2010 to what we would expect on an ongoing basis. And to the extent that additional acreage at
reasonable prices is available in these very attractive plays, we would continue to take on additional acreage. We
always have to work towards a balance of resource capture and resource development, and we're very mindful of that.
So while we have some opportunities to beef up our positions here, we will balance the capital going forward.
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Brian, I'd just remind you that we look at this as part of
this ongoing repositioning. The repositioning involved not only the sale of our Gulf and international operations but
also some increase in our positions in some of these areas. And as Vince said, we've got to do this all the time. What we
also have to do though – it may make some other projects that we have non-competitive. We may want to move them
out or farm them out or do other things with them, so there is probably a disproportionate – there has been a
disproportionate amount that we've done this year as part of this reallocation process.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Brian, coming back to the first part of your
question, the acreage acquisition throughout 2010 outside of Kirby is roughly equally spaced first half of the year to
expected second half of the year.
<Q - Brian Singer>: Great, thanks. And then as a follow-up, you generally made the comment since the restructuring
that despite the divestitures, your liquids versus gas mix wouldn't change much, probably considering the growth of
Jackfish. With the activity in leasehold changes and the more liquids focused spending shift, do you expect that this
should further shift your production mix more towards liquids, and can you quantify how much and where you see it
and when you see that happening?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Certainly to the extent we have more acreage in these
oil, condensate, and liquids-rich plays, it does increase that. But I would go back to pointing out, as you know, we've
already got such a large portion that's oil or liquids-rich that it's not like we're going from a very small proportion to
suddenly doubling it, so it will make a difference. I don't know exactly how much of a difference that will make, Brian.
But as you looked at our – we've talked before about our 32,000 drilling locations before in these resource acquisitions
that we made this year, and 13.5 billion barrels of resource potential. That was already about 40% focused on oil,
condensate, and liquids. So by adding this, it certainly augments it, but it's not like we're suddenly trying to get into the
oil, condensate, or liquids business. We were already in it.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Brian, I might point out that while we're about
a third of our current production is oil and liquids, about 40% of our proved reserves are oil and liquids. So we're
definitely – based on our proved reserve mix, our production mix would move that direction all things being equal over

Your next question comes from the line of Ray Deacon of Pritchard Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Raymond Deacon>: Hi, good morning. John, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the Cana in
terms of when you would expect to have a good idea on the down-spacing and whether that is going to work. Is it six
months?
<A - John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. Let me turn that over to Dave to answer that
question, Ray.
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Six months is probably a pretty
good estimate. We want to get a good production history on these wells before we really make a decision on it. I will
remind you that at least when we talk about our perspective or the potential in Cana, the potential does not include any
resources associated with this down-spacing. So if this down-spacing is successful, and I think we've characterized
Cana before, it was about 8.8 TCF equivalent. If this down-spacing is successful, then we could add to that total
significantly, hopefully.
<Q - Raymond Deacon>: Got it, great. And I was wondering, I guess given the large increase in acreage, I was
wondering what do you see as a sustainable growth rate based on a $5 gas and $75 oil world at this point given the
repositioning in your CapEx?
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: This is Vince. The problem with the question is
we're really trying to optimize growth per net adjusted share, so there are a lot of variables into how we allocate capital
going forward. We've got the potential in our resource base given enough capital spend to deliver double-digit top line
growth for a long period of time. Whether that's the right decision or not depends on our outlook for oil and gas prices,
where our equity is trading, and a variety of other factors.
<Q - Raymond Deacon>: Okay.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: We're not going to pin down a number on that.
<Q - Raymond Deacon>: Okay, got it, and I guess just one more bigger picture question. With the industry's focus on
liquids plays, what's your outlook for – do you think ethane, butane, propane will continue to trade at a premium to gas,
or are you looking to hedge as your volumes ramp for those products?
<A - Darryl Smette>: Yes, this is Darryl. Obviously at least in the short term, over the next year or two, we do believe
there could be some additional pressure on liquid prices, primarily ethane. There's a limited market in terms of they
make plastics and they're used in refineries and that's about it. It doesn't have the degree of flexibility that a propane
product would have. So we do think that there is a possibility if there is a continued increase in capital spend on these
projects throughout the industry that you could see some downward pressure, primarily on the ethane side of the
business. But we still think that it will trade at a 20 to 25% premium to natural gas if you're looking at gas prices in the
5 to $5.50 range; so a little bit of downward pressure but still trade at a premium.
<Q - Raymond Deacon>: Got it, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from John Herrlin from Société Générale. Please proceed.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Yes, thank you. With Jackfish 2, you mentioned at the beginning that you had a good savings in
terms of the development. How was that manifested? Was it just lower labor costs, or what was going on there?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Hi, John. This is Dave. I'd say it
was a different approach to project management I would say that was the overall contributor to that, where we did a lot
of the project management. We did more internally versus externally on Jackfish 1, and that really allowed us to have
greater control of the overall project and greater control over the cost. And so we just really incorporated a lot of the
learnings we had on Jackfish 1 into Jackfish 2, and we'll use those again in Jackfish 3.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay, great. With Avalon, Dave, how long are the horizontals? How big are the fracs? Also you
didn't mention the organic content. How does this formation compare to say the Barnett?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: I don't have all that data in front of
me. I'm sure we can get back to you. The horizontal length we're planning to drill is about 4,000 feet on these wells.
TOCs, total organic content, on these, John, I better double-check before I say some numbers, but it's pretty darn rich. I
can tell you that.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Okay, great. Last one for me, you're in a lot of plays that are competitive. Are you locking in
consumables like pipe or trying to lock in more rigs in terms of your future spending since you have stepped it up?
<A - Darryl Smette>: Yes, John, this is Darryl. We have some longer term contracts on some of our rigs. I think right
now, we have 23 under long-term contracts. Those contract lengths vary from a year up to three years. I think Dave
said we were running 65 rigs, so obviously we have a lot of rigs that are not under long-term contract. And while we
may move some of those rigs under long-term contracts up a little bit, I don't think it would be very much historically.
We've tried to stay somewhere between 40 and 50% on our long-term rigs. The bigger issue as related to cost has to do
with the fracing costs, and those costs went up significantly. While they started being quite high in the Eagle Ford and
the Haynesville, that has certainly progressed to the rest of the country now.
Our experience has been in dealing with these people that on providing the services that they don't want to lock in any
long-term projects unless it's at a real premium price even in today's market. They still believe costs are going to go up,
and so we have not had really any positive response from any of those service providers in terms of wanting to lock in
long-term contracts at current prices. So I don't imagine we'll probably do that.
There are some things that we are locking in. We're locking in some fuel prices for some of our rigs and things of that
nature, but some of the bigger service costs in terms of the fracing and stuff, I don't see that that's going to happen
anytime soon.
<Q - John Herrlin>: Great, thank you.
<A - Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay. Operator, we've got time for one more
question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Philip Dodge from Tuohy Brothers Investments. Please proceed.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Good morning, everybody, two quickies; first on the Barnett, your production guidance for the
September quarter, 1.2. Going forward, how many rigs would you have to employ to maintain that level?
<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Right around that level where we
currently are, 15 to 17, somewhere in there.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: No change, okay. And then the Horn River, you gave EUR number of 7 to 8 BCF per well. Could
you tell us what lateral length and number of fracturing stages are embedded in that EUR?

<A - David A. Hager, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production>: Yes, we're still optimizing the
number of frac stages that we would have in the Horn River. We think it's going to be most likely somewhere in the 8
to 11 area. We're getting a little bit over an MCF per frac stage, and it's just really a cost tradeoff there on what
provides the best economics. On the lateral length for the Horn River shales, again we're optimizing that. We anticipate
it's going to be somewhere in the range of around 4,600 to 5,900 foot.
<Q - Phil Dodge>: Okay, thanks very much.
Vincent W. White, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Okay, we're a couple of minutes past the top of the hour, so we'll wrap up the call for today. Thanks for joining us, and
as we said earlier, we'll be around the rest of the day for any follow-up.
