Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Overall we had a very good third quarter. We delivered strong sales across
our key brands. Revenues were $3.9 billion, a 7% increase last year excluding the diabetes business that we still had in
2013. Equal important, throughout the quarter we made significant progress in delivering our pipeline with important
clinical and regulatory milestones and several business development agreements.
With respect to Eliquis, the combined efforts of our sales and marketing and medical team contributed to its strong
performance around the world this year and approval for the VTE treatment in both the U.S. and Europe this quarter
provide another strong platform for success. The strength of our data and our progress to date support our continued
high expectations for Eliquis.
With respect to hepatitis C, we have a clear opportunity in Japan where hepatitis C patients have had limited treatment
options. We received approval for our dual Daklinza+Sunvepra regimen in July, and launched in September. This dual
regimen, which was developed to meet the distinct need of a significant proportion of a Japanese patient population has
the potential to play a major role in curing HCV patients in that country. We are only at the beginning, but the initial
performance indicators give us reason to be optimistic.
We are also off to a good start in Europe where the European Commission approved Daklinza for use in combination
with other products across multiple genotypes and where we have launched in Germany and a few other countries. In
the U.S., we have withdrawn our new drug application for asunaprevir while we continued to pursue FDA approval of
Daklinza focusing on distinct patient populations with a mathematical need. We look forward to presenting important
data at the upcoming AASLD meeting in Boston. And with respect to our immuno-oncology platform, we made
important commercial, clinical and regulatory advances in the quarter. From a commercial perspective, Yervoy had its
best quarter ever with $350 million in sales, a significant increase over last year, and continues to be a key treatment for
patients with metastatic melanoma.
From a clinical and regulatory perspective, we reached a number of key milestones for Opdivo. We completed
regulatory filings for melanoma in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., the FDA has granted us priority review and
breakthrough therapy status, and in Europe our marketing authorization application has been granted an accelerated
review. The European Medicines Agency also recently validated our application for Opdivo in non-small cell like
cancer based on our 063 study.
At ESMO, we announced the early result from CheckMate-037, the first Phase III trial of a PD-1 inhibitor. And we are
looking forward to presenting additional data for Opdivo at upcoming medical meetings, including lung cancer data
later this month, next week in Chicago, the first demonstration of overall survival in melanoma in November at SMR,
and the first hematology data in December at ASA.
And finally, as you know, we have always considered business development being an important source for innovation
for us. During the quarter, we finalized a number of new agreements both within immuno-oncology and in other
therapeutic areas that are important for us. Charlie will describe them in a minute. Again, taken together, this was a
very good quarter across the board. We are framing the value and reinforcing the strength of our balanced approach of
delivering strong results today while building a solid foundation for tomorrow.
And now I will turn the floor to Charlie.

Thank you, Lamberto. Good morning, everyone. As Lamberto noted, we had a strong quarter. Our key brands did
particularly well with Eliquis, Yervoy, Orencia and Sprycel each posting double-digit sales growth versus the same
period last year. Let me provide a few highlights.
Eliquis sales were $216 million. We saw continued strong growth during the quarter and have recently launched our
new indication for VTE treatment in the U.S. and Europe. Our expectation is that the new indication will be an
important catalyst for continued growth. While our focus will remain on cardiologists, the progress we've made in
new-to-brand prescription share for AFib and the VTE indication should help as we expand more into primary care. In
the U.S., net sales for Eliquis were $113 million, up 20% sequentially from the second quarter. In AFib, our
new-to-brand share among cardiologists is now approaching 45%. Overall, Eliquis total prescription volume and
new-to-brand volume continues to grow faster than any other [ph] NOWAK (07:10).
Outside the U.S., net sales were $103 million, up 34% from the second quarter. Yervoy sales grew 47% to $350
million. Yervoy had its best quarter since launch, and the recent weekly sales trends remain strong. U.S. sales were
$191 million, up 47% from the same quarter last year and up 10% from the previous quarter. We continue to make
significant gains in first-line use among community oncologists as they become more comfortable treating patients with
Yervoy. Sales outside the U.S. totaled $159 million, also up 47% over last year's quarter, as we continue to see strong
demand growth in all key markets.
Both Sprycel and Orencia were strong, with sales increasing 22% and 18% respectively. Certainly the highlight in our
Virology business was the launch of our dual regimen in Japan and Daklinza in Europe for hepatitis C. We reported
$49 million in sales during the quarter and early results are encouraging. In Japan, we are focused on the approximately
300,000 patients who are currently diagnosed, half of whom are being actively managed by a physician.
In Europe, we have launched in several markets and early trends are positive, particularly in Germany. We continue to
face growing competitive pressure across our HIV franchise, including continued erosion for SUSTIVA due to generic
competition in Europe.
Sales for Baraclude were down 14% mostly due to the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. and softer demand in China. Due
to the loss of Baraclude exclusivity in the U.S., we anticipate a negative EPS impact of about $0.06 for this year and
$0.10 for 2015. A couple of additional points on revenues in 2015: included in the mature product category are
revenues related to a few agreements entered into over the last several years. The structure of those transactions provide
a revenue stream primarily through this year, and we expect revenues will decline by approximately $400 million in
2015. On the other hand, we had previously expected loss of exclusivity on SUSTIVA in the U.S. in March of next
year.
While the resolution of patent litigation, we now expect that we will have exclusivity in the U.S. through 2017 which
should more than offset the 2015 impact of the mature products I just mentioned.
I would like to spend a moment discussing some business development highlights. During the quarter, we announced
several deals to strengthen our immuno oncology portfolio. These collaborations with Jansen, Novartis, Celgene and
MD Anderson, coupled with earlier deals with Incyte and Celldex, among others demonstrate our commitment to
explore a full range of opportunities including different combinations across multiple tumor types to help us realize the
full potential of our immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer.
Now a few comments from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was up 240 basis points compared to the same period
last year, mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our global diabetes business. Marketing, selling and
admin expenses decreased 5% to $931 million as our increased investments in Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our HCV
franchise were more than offset by reduced expenses in diabetes. Our tax rate was 24.2% during the quarter compared
to 17.8% for the same period last year. The difference is due to earnings mix plus the expiration of the R&D tax credit,
which has not yet been extended for 2014. As previously discussed, our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate due to changes
in earnings mix.
Regarding guidance for 2014, we are confirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.70 to $1.80. Based on
current trends and assumptions, it is likely that we will come in closer to the higher end of the range. Our guidance

assumes current exchange rates and that the R&D tax credit will be extended by Congress in 2014. The only line item
change in our guidance is the tax rate, which we now expect to be between 19% to 20%. The increase from previous
guidance is driven by our earnings mix.
Now we'd be happy to address your questions.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Charlie and just like to remind everybody that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, both Giovanni and Francis
are here to handle any questions you might have. Travis?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for
questions. We'll take our first question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Oh, great. Thanks very much. So just a question as it specifically relates to thinking
about metrics in third line lung cancer. Just hoping that you could give us a little bit of a rundown of Bristol's thoughts
on the information that you have in terms of the one-year survival metrics, two-year survival metrics for the squamous
non-small cell lung cancer patient population and also as it relates to the CheckMate-017 study, any update on the
timing of the readout? And any sort of – is it possible that the events are coming in more slowly and that this could slip
out, or do we still expect CheckMate-017, the interim look, to occur this quarter? Thanks a lot.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Seamus. Thank you. It's Francis. First of all, let me take the 063 study. We're
looking forward to presenting that data next week at the Thoracic Oncology meeting. As you know, it's very difficult to
compare across trials in this area, because 063 is a highly pretreated third plus line of therapy with no really other
approved options or recommendations. But we've looked at this, a roughly similar patient population would suggest
that historical objective response rate in the low to mid single digits. And you may recall at ASCO This year, we
presented an analysis of the SEER registry of Medicare data that showed that perhaps less than 20%, in fact 18% of the
third line squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients were actually alive at a year.
Let me move on to CheckMate-017. As you commented, the timing of the analysis on this study is event driven, and
that means that the patient mortality will determine when we do the analysis. As we've seen in previous IO studies, the
mortality rate continues to slow down. Our present projection and of course this is a projection, but our present
projection is that we will trigger – or the data management committee will trigger an analysis towards the end of the
year. And I think it's just worth commenting that of course there will be some time, some weeks while they do their
analysis. So we remain on track with the present projections to have a year-end triggering of that analysis. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Seamus. Travis, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. First, two quick ones for Charlie. Can you just – sorry if we missed this,
but the other income line, can you break that out between the interest and other stock? And then on revenue guidance,
is Daklinza the offset to the Baraclude generic hit that I'm pretty sure wasn't in your guidance previously? And then
lastly, I just had a bigger-picture question about the anti-PD-1 space. Are there any observations you can make about
Merck's go-to-market strategy so far that sort of shape how you're thinking about your Opdivo go-to-market strategy?
Thanks.

<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Giovanni, why don't you take Merck question first and Charlie will continue with the rest.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes. Good morning. This is Giovanni. With respect to the question on go-to-market strategy,
obviously our go-to-market strategy for Opdivo will be formed primarily by the very large experience we had with
Yervoy and the fact that we have developed a vain overhead customer model. When we launched Yervoy metastatic
melanoma and we've developed a very significant experience in terms of the ability to educate physicians in
immuno-oncology. So we are obviously looking at building on the very significant experience that we have with
Yervoy and further developing our go-to-market strategy with Opdivo when we get approval. I'd just remind you that
as a result of clearly the strength of the data the survival advantage of Yervoy and the strategy we followed to educate
physicians in the academic setting and the community for Yervoy, we continue to see very, very strong trends in both
settings. It's really too early for us to comment on the launch of Keytruda but as Charlie said, our recent weekly trends
in terms of sales continue to be very strong.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, just quickly on, Gregg, and you can follow up with John and his team on the details
of the other income. Our interest income expense in the U.S., that specifically is relatively the same as it was in the
third quarter of last year. And as we've commented before, the transaction services agreement that we have with
AstraZeneca pretty much starts to wind down significantly by the end of the third quarter. So we really won't see much
further income from that TSA income on a go-forward basis.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Greg. Travis, can we go to the next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Jami Ruben with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, Francis, for you, are you still committed to initiating a
Phase III combo lung study Yervoy/nivo in lung, and at some point will you show us the data from that, I guess it's
your 012 trial, that I would expect you would use to determine which combination or which strategy to go forward with
that Phase III trial? And then secondly, do you think that – is there a read across from the third line squamous to the
second line trial that hopefully reads out by the end of this year? And if you could confirm whether or not we will
actually see overall survival with the third line squamous study next week. Thanks.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Jami. Thank you. So first of all, let me talk about the 012 study which as you
recall is a multi-arm study looking at different combinations in lung cancer. It's still ongoing. It's still producing clinical
data that's informing our design of our Phase III study in combination. We have sufficient information to complete the
design, and we're heading towards completing that by the end of the year. I can't actually comment at this point exactly
on the design, but you will be able to read about it in clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] (19:44) when it gets posted
probably at the beginning of next year.
As far as the 012 data, we've not yet decided the venue or the timing of the one plus one data, for instance, although
you may see some of the data from the Avastin/nivo study at the Thoracic Oncology Symposium next week. As far as
the read-through between the third line and second line, I think I would say that it is difficult to compare across
different patient populations to repeat the third line study 063 actually includes fourth line and fifth line patients,
patients who are actually progressing as they went into the study. The second line is a less severe population although it
does really include all comers, both in terms of PDL-1, PDL positive and negative. So overall, as we get more data we
remain confident in the Yervoy/Opdivo lung combinations and we're looking forward to initiating this study. Thank
you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Jami. And Travis, can we go to the next question?

Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A few questions, please. Just hoping to clarify on the interim look. So on
the interim or any interim looks that will be done on 017 and 057, will you have access to what that data shows, or will
you otherwise be informed in any meaningful way of those findings apart from if there were to be early stoppage? Or is
that something that only the DMC and potentially FDA looks at? Second question is I think you and your competitors
monitor each other's moves very closely in the PD-1 space. I'm hoping you can give us your thoughts on whether
Roche and Merck might be able to file their own products for approval in lung in early 2015 which seems like it could
be possible. And then just a clarification on the nivo plus Yervoy combo trial, should we assume that will be in PDL-1
negative patients or in all comers?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Tim, good morning. So let me just talk first about the interim data look. The trigger for this is
a predetermined number of events. As I've already mentioned, that is slowing down. That's something we've seen
before with Yervoy. It's of course good for patients. And it will trigger the data monitoring committee to do the
analysis. We, even though this is an open study, it's blind to us. We have no access to the data unless it hits the stopping
rules, as you say. As far as the moves of our competitors, I'm totally focused on our program and clearly can't really
comment on what they may do or what they may not do. And as far as the combination timeline, I'd just reiterate that
we're looking to have the study design and preparation completed by the end of the year, and you will be able to read
the fine details of that when it's posted to clintrials.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] (23:28) presumably in that first quarter.
Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Tim. Travis, can we go to the next question, please?

Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just had two here. First you've expressed some excitement
about the opportunity for PD-1s in hematology cancers and we're going to see some initial data at ASH. So I look at
these markets, we're seeing a rapidly-evolving standard of care. Can you just talk a little bit about where you see the
PD-1s ultimately fitting into treatment paradigms here? And the second question was on tax. The company has
obviously done a great job and has one of the lowest tax rates in the group. In light of just the recent tax scrutiny that's
been out there, can you just talk about how you're thinking about your tax rate over the next several years? I know for
this double Irish stuff, et cetera, it may not apply, but just generally speaking how do you think about your tax rate over
time? Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Charlie, a not unexpected question on taxes.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Okay, yeah. Thank you, Chris. As you know, we're not giving any guidance at this point
on any particular line item. We're in the middle of our budget process and we'll talk about our 2015 tax rate in January
in the normal cycle. I would say overall, and I've said this before, that our tax rate is primarily influenced by earnings
mix but also there are one-time items and also very importantly our tax planning opportunities which allowed us, as
you pointed out, to have a fairly good tax rate compared to our peers. And these tax planning opportunities are
something that we will continually assess. So until we get to January, I don't think there's more perspective I can
provide you on the tax rate.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: He was asking about the Irish tax, the double.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, I mean, we don't have anything related to the Irish double tax.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Chris. Let me first say that we were very happy to receive breakthrough
designation for Hodgkin's lymphoma from the FDA and are looking forward to presenting that data and the
non-Hodgkin's data at ASH in December. This is clearly in a late stage group of patients, and it's – you'll have to wait
and see what the data is. But I think there is good rationale as well as the data we have to start out at the late stage, but I

think it will be potentially attractive because of the potential for long-term survival and the underlying biology of
hematological tumors. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Good morning. Three questions, please. Firstly for Francis, regarding the 017 trial, should I
assume that the early stopping rule for the interim has a similar P value or confidence interval compared to that of the
final analysis? Obviously depends which stopping rule you're using. Second, could you remind us when we should
expect the first CD137 data? And then finally could you update us please on the filing strategy and timings for Yervoy
in the Adjuvant melanoma setting? Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Andrew. So I'm not going to get into the detail of the stopping rules either for
the interim or the final analysis. As far as the 137 urelumab data is concerned, those trials are ongoing, and we will –
haven't yet decided when and where we might present that data. Certainly we're considering, for competitive reasons,
perhaps not being as forthcoming as we might have done in the past. And let me just move to our plans for the
Adjuvant melanoma filing. As you know, the data we presented at ASCO in the 029 study was actually quite strong,
and we are having productive discussions with the FDA and plan to file the Adjuvant melanoma data for regulatory
approval. As we traditionally do, we'll provide further information when it's accepted by the FDA. But we believe that
Adjuvant melanoma is a significant area of unmet need and is an important part of our strategy in melanoma.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, and this is Giovanni. And obviously from a commercial perspective, Adjuvant
melanoma is treated in many of the same academic institutions where we have established a really strong presence
through Yervoy. As Francis mentioned, it's an area of very high unmet medical need. And as we think about preparing
for a potential launch, obviously our focus would be on sub populations of patients at high risk where we believe that
Yervoy can have a very, very meaningful role to play.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Andrew. Can we go to the next one please, Travis?

Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with the ISI Group.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Wow. That's a first.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Sorry, guys. Can you hear me?
<A - John E. Elicker>: Yeah, we got you, Mark.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay. I apologize for that, John. Francis, thanks for all the disclosures. This call has
been very clear. Really just really appreciate that. If I may ask just one more question on the 017 trial. Can you just
clarify – I wasn't sure from your remarks. It sounds like you'll have the data in-house, the interim data in-house by the
end of the year. Are you still certain that you'll be able to disclose something to investors by the end of the year? And if
indeed the trial continues due to the fact that this is an interim analysis, can you help us out? When do you believe
roughly the final analysis would be triggered, please?
And then actually one question for Lamberto, if I might. Just, you know, the M&A environment is heated up then
cooled down, et cetera. Can you just update us on Bristol's willingness to think about doing an M&A transaction that
might be on the larger side so something that's clearly not defined as a tuck-in? Thanks a lot.

<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Mark. So thank you for that question. And I do want to clarify this. We will
not have the data in house unless the study stops. So this data analysis is triggered by the events and is performed by
the data monitoring committee. It looks like from our projections, and of course they're still a projection because the
mortality rate is slowing down, that we will trigger that analysis about the end of the year. Then of course there's the
time for the analysis beyond that. So there will not be a disclosure when the analysis is triggered. It'll be if and when
the study is stopped when the analysis is done. And as far as the final analysis is concerned, I mean, it becomes even
less certain in a way because obviously it's still an event driven study. So we would imagine towards the end of next
year, but that is a very distant projection. Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So about M&A, it is right. There's a lot going on outside there. And our point of view has
not changed. We continue to look at opportunities of acquiring products, technologies, pipelines, in areas that are
significant and key to us. We do not consider – we never consider investments as a goal for us, because as I said, we
are interested in products and technologies. In terms of size, we are looking at opportunities of different size, and we
believe that we have the financial capacity to go to a large size operation if we find the opportunity worth investigating.
But we are also continuing to look at smaller opportunities and we have announced some, and we will announce some
more in the near future. Charlie, do you want to add something here?
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: No, I mean, I would only add that if you look at our track record, we haven't really done
anything of size, but we've always said we are agnostic to type of deal, structure of deal, and size of deal. I would just
conclude it with that.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Travis, can we go to the next question, please?

Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ronak H. Shah>: Hi. Good morning. This is Ronak filling in for Vamil. Two quick questions. One is on the
patent side. Can you give us an update on your litigation against Merck related to Opdivo? And what are the relevant
milestones we should be watching and the timeframe for resolution? And then second, just to get a better sense of your
strategy in first line melanoma, have you seen the results of CheckMate-069 at this point and have had any discussions
with regulators on that data? And if not, how do you plan to leverage that trial moving forward? Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Very quickly on the IP, we believe in the strength of our IP position. We will continue to
defend it and there is nothing new to announce here. We made it clear that we are not going to block anything that
could be negative for patients but obviously we are going to defend our intellectual property rights, and we are going to
do it here and in Europe and elsewhere.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Ronak, good morning. We do have the data analysis in house for the 069 study, and I'm
encouraged by the data. We're working with investigators to determine the venue and timing of the presentation and
publication. But I would say that it's premature to disclose any details of our regulatory strategy at this time. Thank
you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Ronak. And can we go to the next question please, Travis?

Our next question comes from Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Thanks very much. So I have a couple questions. First what I have down on the
timeline for the 057 non-squamous Phase III trial is that the completion is estimated on clinicaltrials.gov to occur next
summer yet you were I think speaking previously about an interim look early next year. So my first question is could
you update us on those two timeline events? Second, can you explain why the interim look is so close to the conclusion

of the trial? And then my second question is a little bit longer, or my next question is a little bit longer one and it's
about Yervoy.
So there are sort of two views about the outlook for Yervoy in the near term. One view from an expert that we had
hosted is that Yervoy use in the community may step up because patients have to fail Yervoy before going on to
Keytruda and thus maybe the use of Yervoy could step up in the near term. A different view is that the threshold to stop
Yervoy may be lower than before for some patients because there's obviously an alternative. And so for a patient who
is struggling with the side effects of Yervoy, they can drop the therapy at the first sign of toxicity and switch to
Keytruda, so Yervoy sales could decline in the near term. Could you please give us your view on which scenario is
more likely over the next few quarters? Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Dave. So let me clarify exactly what's going with 057. It's very similar to 017
insofar as it's an event-driven study and that the event rate is slowing down. Perhaps it's slowing down even more than
017. So there is an anomaly there. As I said, we will – we're projecting an interim analysis in the first half of next year,
and of course it would not be rational to expect a final analysis in the middle of the year according to clintrials.gov (sic)
[clinicaltrials.gov] (36:27). So it's like 017, the final analysis will also project out further as well.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yeah Dave, this is Giovanni. With respect to your question on Yervoy melanoma, obviously
this is a very dynamic marketplace with some events happening and we believe significant developments going
forward. I would start from our current position. So when you look at Yervoy today, we have very strong trends. Over
60% of our business in the community is in the community, and that is the most rapidly growing segment today; 70%
of our use is in the first line setting. And so the first point is that clearly the role of Yervoy in metastatic melanoma is
very well established across first and second line and both the academic setting and the community setting. We're also,
I must say, seeing not only very high penetration in BRAF wild-type but we've also seen a very good increase in the
use of Yervoy in the mutant segment in the last couple of quarters.
We've always said that it is possible that in the short term, there is volatility in the use of Yervoy, but remember that
Keytruda is approved in a very specific patient population in patients that have failed Yervoy and that was confirmed
recently in the latest update of the NCCN guidelines, and obviously we are very focused on the medium and the long
term. And there we continue to be very focused on the fact that combination use in the first line setting can provide
very, very strong hope for patients' survival in the first year after the therapy started. So hopefully that adds a little bit
on our perspective there.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Thank you, Dave. Travis, can we go to the next question, please.

Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. I have three, if I may. First, two for Charlie.
How should we think about royalties for nivo in Japan? I see it's registering in your financials this quarter. Could this
be a meaningful opportunity for you? And then looking ahead, how should we think about your margins longer term?
Obviously Eliquis will be a drag given the partnership structure, but your product mix seems to be shifting towards
more higher-margin products. And as immuno-oncology becomes a larger contributor, is it fair to expect significant
margin expansion opportunity? And then the last one for Francis, based on everything you have seen so far, is there
anything to suggest that more advanced lung cancer patients are more likely to be PDL-1 positive because of prior
treatments and just to clarify will we have two-year OS data from the 063 study? Thank you so much.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah. Thank you, Alex. So on the Ono collaboration, as we disclosed in the last quarter,
we are partnering – Ono had the rights to nivo in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and we partnered with them with
three of our earlier stage compounds to form an alliance where it's in combination we will share equally between the
two companies and where it's used as a single agent, the lion's share will go to each partner in which they share the
product. So that's the Ono collaboration. As it relates to gross margin going forward, as you point out, we have Eliquis,

which is below 50% margin based upon the deal that we have with Pfizer, and the rest of our products are slightly
higher than our overall corporate margin. So you have to really look at the overall mix of products going forward.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So Alex, let me just comment that we don't have the PDL-1 status in this patient population.
There isn't any particular reason to consider they'd be more likely or less to be PDL-1 positive or not. Certainly we've
seen in other studies that we seem to have that representational portion of PDL-1 positive patients that are the same
more or less across them. As far as the landmark data in terms of one-year or two-year, you will see in the abstract
when it's presented, published next week, six-month data but the presentation will be on the one-month data.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: One year.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: I'm sorry, the one-year data. So six months in the abstract, 12 months in the presentation.
Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Alex. Travis, I think we have time for a couple more.

Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have three questions. There is an expectation that Bristol's long-term, multi-year
tax rate will be high teens. In fact I think Bristol may have actually said that at one point. If not, please correct me, but
has that expectation changed? Second, to hit the top end of Bristol's 2014 guidance range, Q4 EPS needs to be only
$0.42, but down 18%, making it by far the worst quarter of 2014. Other than Baraclude, which also impacted Q3, I'm
not sure why this would be the case. So can you amplify? And then the third question, Bristol competitors talk a lot
about OX40 and GITR, yet Bristol doesn't have any – at least later stage programs in these areas. Is that because Bristol
simply hasn't come upon a good molecule? Is it due to IP, or does Bristol question the value of the target and if it's the
latter, why is Bristol skeptical? Thank you.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Thanks, Steve. Charlie. So I'll answer the first two parts of your question. So in regard to
tax, yes, previously I've stated that we expect the tax rate not indefinitely, but over the medium term to be in the high
teens. Clearly that's a function of the factors that I mentioned before, which is earnings mix, and we did see a little bit
of up-skew towards higher product earnings in a higher tax rate area. So that's impacted it slightly. The diabetes
business going away actually hurt the rate a little bit as well.
But on average, looking at all the different factors that I mentioned including our tax planning strategy, I still feel in the
medium term that that's a good barometer to use. As it relates to trends, vis-à-vis how we are looking through three
quarters and then in the fourth quarter, a few things to recognize: the bolus of the Baraclude impact is going to happen
in the fourth quarter. We also, as I mentioned earlier, the diabetes royalties, the way they're structured and the – so we
get a pretty good royalty on the first $500 million. We really don't get much as we get through the balance of this year.
We also have the transaction services agreement with AstraZeneca, whereby that pretty much drops off in the fourth
quarter.
And then we do have commercial investments that we are continuing to make in the business around Yervoy, as we
begin the preparation for the launch of Opdivo, Eliquis DVT, and also as you look at the R&D spend through three
quarters and what we see in the back half of the year, we do see, particularly in regard to IO, expanded patient
enrollment, continuation of new study starts, including several clinical collaborations exploring combination regimens.
And then we do have some costs related to comparator arm studies. So by and large, we do see an increase in our
overall expenses from a trend wise in the fourth quarter.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Steve, good morning. Let me just reemphasize that we totally believe that combinations of IO
agents will play a critical role in bringing this potential long-term survival to the broadest number of patients. And of
course, you've seen that in terms of our Phase III starts and potentially data over the next 12 months to 18 months.
We've also got early development, three early development combinations ongoing and a large portfolio in discovery

and actually in pre-clinical development. And I think notably this year, we've as broad as that is, we've actually
supplemented that with some collaborations, most notably Five Prime and the Dana Farber. So, yes, we're committed to
bringing forward a broad portfolio of potential immuno-oncology combinations. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe switch gears to hep C, can you talk about how
you see your triple regimen being competitively positioned, especially in light of a treatment landscape that's moving
toward shorter duration regimens? And then as you're assessing the market opportunity, to what extent do you see price
being a competitive lever for those competitors who lack clinical differentiation? Thanks.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So thanks, Colin. We're reviewing the recent emerging clinical data from our two global
3DAA studies, which you recall is unit C1 and unit C2. And those will be presented soon at the upcoming AASLD
meeting. And we'll be evaluating our Reg D strategy in the U.S. as well as other countries in the context of this very
fast moving environment.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes. And I would say to answer – this is Giovanni. Good morning. To answer your question
on our strategy and particularly with respect to pricing, a couple of comments there. The first one is from a strategic
perspective, our priority remains to identify areas of unmet medical needs, of high unmet medical needs, and develop
regimens that address those. And as we've discussed before, obviously that is different depending on the region and the
market.
With respect to pricing, our belief is that the value continues to be the primary driver in this market like in other
markets. And so we are very focused on delivering regimens that deliver high value from a clinical perspective. But
obviously we are working in Europe, in Japan, in other geographies with payers to ensure we work and partner with
them to ensure that our products are reimbursed.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Colin. Travis, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Our last question today will come from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.
<Q - Charles Butler>: Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Francis, just one somewhat broad question again on
Opdivo. Certainly at ESMO there was a great deal of discussion around the theme of PDL-1 positivity, but more
importantly around enriching populations or trials related to PDL-1 positivity. And as you think about the combination
trial, which you said would be announced at least early next year in clin trials, but also in other data sets, what's your
view around enriching for PDL-1 positivity? Or do you dismiss that theme totally? Thanks very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Tony, good morning. Our approach to this has been and I think let me just zoom out a little bit
to our biomarker strategy. Our entire development program has incorporated biomarker testing as you know, and we
want to understand better not just the objective response rate but also the linkage of PDL-1 positivity to the overall
survival. So all our patients have tumors tested and PDL-1 positivity measured.
It's clear that in some cases, PDL – there is a better response rate with PDL-1 positivity. But also both in monotherapy
and particularly in combination therapy, we've seen that patients who are PDL-1 negative do get responses. And we do
know that those patients, PDL-1 negative patients, do contribute to overall survival. So our approach to this is to collect
the data to do the study, and we'll look at the data and put together our regulatory submissions based on what that data
shows. Thank you.
