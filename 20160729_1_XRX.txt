Ursula M. Burns
Good morning. Welcome to Xerox's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On our first quarter earnings call, I
laid out three priorities for the year: achieving our 2016 financial plans, implementing our strategic transformation, and
executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and
taking decisive action to achieve these objectives. Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and
significant progress on all of our priorities.

We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance, and margin expansion in both our business
segments, putting us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We also reached major milestones in our separation
process and for our strategic transformation program, and remain on track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am
more confident than ever in our ability to create two companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets
and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's
financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value
and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into
two Fortune 500-scale independent, publicly-traded companies by year-end and implementing a three-year strategic
transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost
reduction initiatives across our businesses.
During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation
program targets. As a recap and starting with the separation, we named the two companies that will be created through
the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing company will be named Conduent Incorporated and the Document
Technology company will retain the Xerox name.
We also identified the CEOs that will lead the two new businesses after the separation. Ashok Vemuri, who officially
joined us at the beginning of this month, will become the CEO of Conduent. Ashok comes with a successful
background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations.
Jeff Jacobson, whom most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business, will
become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly relevant expertise that will be critical to executing
the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look
forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the two companies and prepare
them to stand alone. With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each
company, and Ashok and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams.
At the end of June, we filed our initial Form-10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing kicked off a review
process with the SEC and we expect to update the filing in the coming months with additional information.
We have now scoped all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional details. We are lowering our
pre-tax one-time separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by
our team executing the separation process. And we have quantified one-time tax-related costs associated with the
separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range.
Finally, we estimate dis-synergy costs to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset
by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now.
We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over
three years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are
already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these
activities. All-in-all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter, and I
want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders along with the Xerox management team for
their efforts.
Now I'll provide a high level overview of our second quarter results before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details.
In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in
well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.15, up $0.06
compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares, a lower tax rate, and higher operating
profits.

Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4%, with minimal currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in
Services and an improvement in the Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points
year-over-year to 9.3%, led by a 240 basis point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential
cost and productivity improvement across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program.
We generated cash flow from operations of $177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy
cash balance of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our businesses and brought several
innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with drupa, the biggest printing
industry trade show, which occurs every four years, taking place this June.
We recorded strong sales in the production equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our
partnership with Koenig & Bauer-Sheetfed Solutions Group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital
carton printing, a growing area of the printing market.
On the Document Outsourcing side, Xerox's Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier
of the Year by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S., based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for
the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing, retail,
and higher education industries.
In our Services business, Everest Group ranked us as the Top Business Process Services Provider in its BPS Top 50
report just this week. The group also named our Contact Center Outsourcing business, an industry leader, for the fourth
year in a row.
Analyst firm HfS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the High Performers category for Contact Center
Operations and Finance and Accounting-as-a-Service, and just this week, we were named to the HfS Winner's Circle
for Human Resource Operations-as-a-Service.
In Transportation, our work for SEPTA, the Philadelphia-area mass transit system went live last month. The program,
which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox, is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new modern
payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the
subway, trolley, and buses.
Our Healthcare Services business introduced a new offering, Virtual Health Solutions, allowing providers to integrate a
comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services
introduced a new analytics-as-a-service platform. The Analytics Hub provided corporate counsel and law firms
real-time visibility into the big data that they manage every day.
As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work building next-generation solutions and capabilities and
successfully implementing business that we have won.
I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance.
Leslie F. Varon
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as
well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap-up.
Overall, quarter two was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew, with EPS above our guidance range. Doc
Tech trends improved and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture
greater productivity and turnaround the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our two businesses, but quarter two
was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year.
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a marked
improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency, while Services revenue
declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment.

Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments,
partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin.
Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These
expense reductions combined with the gross margin improvement resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis
points year-over-year, and a 5% operating profit growth.
Adjusted Other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense, while equity
income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of
17.8% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax
credits and the successful resolution of several audits.
Bottom-line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26, and was $0.07 higher
year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares, and higher operating profit.
Turning to Services, segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year, as significant margin improvement
more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency.
Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services.
BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change
as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. Our
drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower than target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to
renew several underperforming contracts.
Total signings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year
decline was driven by lower new business signings which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS
signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin, and deal terms, particularly in
customer care.
Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6%
segment margin. That's a considerable improvement, up 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points
year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost actions flowed through and we saw good contribution to the
margin increase across most business areas, including Document Outsourcing, where margins were similar to
Document Technology. These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from
customer care, where we are taking action to turn around this set of capabilities.
So key takeaways on Services: Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and
bottom-line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation
initiatives, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue
growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in
place growth initiatives for the BPO business.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter, with both revenue trend and
margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and
annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches,
as well as better sales to small- and medium-size businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly
better than quarter one results.
When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement
from quarter one. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company
post-separation.
Turning to activity, within Entry, A4 color MFD installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets.
Mid-range color MFDs grew 6%, driven by the new i-Series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%,
driven by growth in Entry Production color products.

Following a very successful showing at drupa, we expect a greater weighting toward higher-end production presses in
the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better install growth, as it will drive fewer units, but at higher value
which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time.
Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This
is in line with our historical and full year margin expectation. We knew that quarter one was an anomaly resulting from
the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by transaction currency headwinds. Quarter two
margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last two quarters and more modest
transaction currency impact, as well as equipment price declines at the lower-end of our historical 5% to 10% range.
So, overall, a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus
and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional
savings moving through the year.
Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the
strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by
working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing, a $62 million
Health Enterprise settlement payment resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation-related payments as
well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture.
It's important to note that quarter two and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position
us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent
on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock
dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we
move through 2016.
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter two with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line
with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the
end of quarter two was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to
maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.
While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the two future companies, all the financing assets and financing
debt will go to the new Xerox company, while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more
about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the
separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with a strong alignment to
each company's financial profile and market opportunities.
And to touch on capital allocation, we have a strong shareholder returns track record, and, in April, we increased our
common dividend by 11%. As we prepare for our separation later this year, and as we've said previously, we're not
planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the two companies with the most optimal capital structures.
Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2
Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that
Conduent carve-out financials will also reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services
segment. Conduent results include the Student Loan business which resides in our Other segment. That business is in
run-off and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated.
I'll now share with you our quarter three and our full year expectations. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted
earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted
earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline.
We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document
Technology, and anticipate for Services that we'll be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of
the revenue range. For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate
full year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter three.

Last quarter, we told you that we expected pre-tax separation costs would be in the range of $200 million to $250
million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across the rest of the business and have,
therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million
in pre-tax separation costs.
We've also now scoped the tax-related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal
entities to affect the separation, and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million.
Turning to cash flow, we're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash
flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration
and the strong quarter four working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation
expectations remain the same.
So in summary, quarter two solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our
trajectory entering the second half.
Ursula M. Burns
Thank you, Leslie. In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance which demonstrates our
focus on execution and provides good momentum as we enter the second half. We exceeded our adjusted EPS
guidance, made progress on margins, and reaffirmed our full year targets, all while executing our separation and
strategic transformation, which will together strengthen Xerox and the post-separation companies.
Moving to the second half of the year, our priorities remain unchanged. We will deliver our 2016 guidance,
successfully complete our separation by year-end and meet our cost savings target for 2016 for our strategic
transformation program. You will be hearing more from us over the balance of the year as we continue to hit critical
milestones.
We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?
Jennifer Horsley
Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Leslie today is Jeff Jacobson, Head of our Document Technology business; and
Bob Zapfel, President, Xerox Business Services.
Before we get to your questions, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck which
provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I
would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so that we can get to everyone.
At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for
questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line
is now open.
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Thank you. Ursula, can you give us an update on your thoughts around M&A heading into
the split, both in terms of your desire to do acquisitions as well as if anything's changed around the view that you had
previously that both businesses are not up for sale post-split and that both make the most sense as independent public

companies going forward?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Let me start with the middle question, which is the potential for sale of the businesses
post-split. I think that we should probably wait till split to talk to the new leadership of those two companies to figure
out what their plans are as they proceed forward. As far as our plans for M&A, we have still $100 million in our plan
for M&A, semi modest plans for 2016. We acquired $18 million so far this year, and we're still in the market and still
have plans to try to spend the $100 million both in Doc Tech distribution primarily, and in Services small tuck in
acquisitions if we can find them in the areas that are important for us. I think I answered all of your questions.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Yeah, Matt, it's Leslie. I'd just add a couple of things. Obviously, with the focus on separation,
you can appreciate we are focusing less on acquisitions in the near-term, but for sure, it is important longer-term for
each of the businesses. So, Ursula said that we've been light in the first half having spent $18 million. We do have our
sights set on some opportunities in the second half.
<Q - Matthew Cabral>: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on the third quarter guidance in particular, can you
just drill down a little bit more and help us understand the puts and takes around both revenue and the margin profile
for both segments in the September quarter, particularly following the strong performance that you saw in Q2?
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Yeah. So, Matt, you know we have stopped giving quarterly revenue and margin guidance. We
stick to full-year guidance at the segment level, although we do continue to provide earnings guidance in the quarter. I
think what you saw in quarter two, and I'll start with Doc Tech, is an important improvement and moderation in the rate
of revenue decline, both for the Technology segment, down 6% versus the down 9% in the earlier two quarters and,
importantly as well, down 3% including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will
look like going forward.
We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full-year
expectation for the Tech segment of down 5% to 7%. On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the
margin in quarter two and you saw a margin that's in line with our full-year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what
has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full year margin.
On the Services side, we said that we expect margin will be towards the high-end of the 8% to 9.5% range, but revenue
will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues were flat at constant currency. Our full-year range for the
Services segment is flat to up modestly, and we've said we'd be at the low-end of the range.
So we believe that quarter two was an important proof point, and you will see continued progress in quarter three and
for sure in quarter four, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about currency, and more from a Doc Tech
perspective, in terms of both what you're seeing from a pricing perspective, because given where the yen has gone, one
would assume that maybe pricing will be a little bit better this year since the Japanese competitors won't be able to be
quite as aggressive? And then also from a Fuji Xerox perspective, clearly it hit you in – below the line, but just how we
should sort of think about COGS movement? And I know there's a lot of restructuring that can offset it, but I'm just
trying to sort of gauge it as we go through the year?
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Yeah. Hi, Shannon. So a few things on currency. What we said about quarter two was we did
see equipment price pressures at the low-end of our historic 5% to 10% range. So we saw that as a positive signal;
obviously the strength of the yen helps us in the competitive arena in the marketplace. Importantly, on transaction
currency, what we saw in quarter one was it was a significant pressure on Doc Tech segment margin, and in the fact
pressured margin by about 100 basis points.

That margin pressure in quarter two was much, much more modest. It was about 20 basis points, and I think you
recognize that in terms of the yen, we have both the currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox, so it means
that we see more modest impacts as we go through the year, both when the yen strengthens as well as when it weakens.
And we have hedging in place which also mitigates some of the impact. So we're pretty pleased with how we're
positioned as it relates to the yen, vis-à-vis our Japanese based competitors.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. And then so if it stays at like JPY103, you feel pretty good about sort of everything
that's in place because it's obviously moved a lot in the last few weeks?
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: It for sure has. And so once again, we have hedges in place. They obviously run out over time,
and so it will mitigate the impacts, and a currency risk sharing agreement with Fuji Xerox. And as you pointed out, to
the extent that the yen is stronger, it actually benefits our translation of Fuji Xerox equity income.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Right. Okay, great. And then maybe one for Ursula. Just as you think about – and not
specific cash flow generation numbers obviously, but the cash flow generation characteristics of the two businesses,
and as you start to sort of pull the companies apart, has anything sort of changed in the way you're thinking about it? Or
how we should think about it, as I guess all the restructuring comes through? I guess I'm just kind of struggling with
trying to figure out what the right split is between the two businesses both sort of now and then when we get through,
or you guys get through, the significant restructuring you're doing?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I think that you can think about these two businesses in the following way. The Technology
business is a strong cash generating business. It's a very strong annuity-based model. While we will be investing more
actively in the Technology business, it will not substantially have significantly changed the ability for us to generate
cash in the Doc Tech business with DO.
In the BPO business, its cash generation ability is a little bit weaker than the Tech business. We'll be investing more
actively in that business as we separate and they go into Conduent. So nothing has changed from – our perspective
hasn't changed on those two businesses and how we view the cash movements there.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: So, Shannon, the other thing I would mention is that 2016 is not a "normal" year for operating
cash flow generation at Xerox. Our cash expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion are muted by three things. Number
one is the impact of the separation costs, which is a couple of hundred million dollars. Number two is the impact of
higher than normal restructuring, which is probably worth another couple of hundred million dollars. And number three
are the Health Enterprise settlement payments, which should pressure cash flow this year by about $100 million.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question?

Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Ursula and Leslie, you've reiterated guidance for Services
revenue growth of 0% to 3% constant currency. Given the deceleration in constant currency Services revenue growth
you saw in the quarter, what factors in the back half of the year will help you weigh-in within your range?
<A - Robert Zapfel>: George, it's Bob. So I would say we had a couple of pressure points in the second quarter that
will moderate as we go forward. And we were at minus 1%, as you know, in constant currency for the second quarter to
be at the low-end of the range, we need to be above 0% as we close out the third and the fourth.
The pressure points in the second were really around – we had a very tough compare in public-sector, the help – in
terms of some equipment sales that we'd had in the prior year, we have the Health Enterprise in Montana and
California, things have changed. That will dissipate as we go through the back half of the year. And then we also got
out of some kind of revenue flow that was not profit producing, that won't really moderate, but we'll basically be able to
cover for with our signing.

So we do expect that we can meet the range that we had established. And as you know, we've really been able to
translate some of that revenue thoughtfulness in terms of what we want and what we don't want, to pretty solid margin
improvement in the 240 basis points that we delivered year-to-year in the second quarter, we see the ability to continue
to drive at the top end of the margin range.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you describe how your pipeline in BPO
is performing, and whether you see any large deals or initiatives that could serve as a near- or intermediate-term
catalyst for bookings and revenues?
<A - Robert Zapfel>: I would say our BPO pipeline has improved sequentially during the year, so the good news is
that we do see sequential pipeline improvement both in Document Outsourcing and in BPO, in all honesty, a little bit
more aggressive on the Document Outsourcing side. But from a signing standpoint, we expect to drive new business
growth in the third quarter. From a signing standpoint, we have seen a little bit of headwinds in terms of with the
separation, decisional delays, and we're just working through that. So expect to deliver better results in the third quarter
year-to-year. But I wouldn't say that there's now some next New York MMIS that is so large that it would dramatically
change the signings trajectory.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Good to talk to you guys. Just on the Services margins, they
were obviously good. Just seems like there's a prioritization of margins over revenue growth. I'm curious if there's a lot
more that can be done here in terms of moving away from some of the lower margin business if things are coming up
for renewal or what have you. Is there more or is this – was there anything unusual that we saw this quarter...?
<A - Robert Zapfel>: No, I think – I would. I'm sorry. It's Bob again. I think there wasn't anything particularly
unusual. We are being more stringent as we look at new opportunities or renewals. If we're not able to make reasonable
margin, it's time for renewal – we've got to convince the client that the service is worth more and they should pay more.
And if we're unsuccessful with that, then we would rather move in different directions. So I do think that we'll see that.
We'd still like to drive more new business growth though. This is not a one-dimensional play, we're trying to not grow
and improve margins. We are trying to and expect to see some improvement in the second half of the year in terms of
our constant currency revenue growth dynamics.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And the margin improvement is not solely from the fact that we've made decisions on
business – on new business or resigning of contracts, it's also pure operational management literally looking at the cost
base and managing the cost base downward independent of signing or not signing new business.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Understood. No, that's good. Just really quickly, the sales cycle, just to be clear, just on the
BPO front, any big changes in the sales cycle from the past quarter?
<A - Robert Zapfel>: I would say we did some extension, especially in June, where not only separation but where
some of the clients where the Form 10 didn't come until June 30, wanted to – Ashok has now been named so that's very
helpful in terms of clarity on the new CEO. But we did have a little bit of push-out in June. But as you saw, our overall
results were still reasonably okay on a trailing 12-month year-to-year basis. But I would say we did see a little bit of
extension in June on some of our pursuits.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Tien-tsin.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team at Xerox. A lot of work I'm sure. I
have two questions and they're kind of related. I'll ask them at the same time. First, on the lower renewal rate, it sounds
like from your prepared comments that it was a decision not to go after lower profitability work. Should we expect that
to continue? And is that kind of one of the main reasons why the Service profitability is underperforming so much? It's
just a legacy of bidding too low or going after too low of products or contracts? Or is it more that your costs are
misaligned or things like that?
Then the second question is, you just mentioned an extension of some deals did not close in the June quarter. Did they
close in early July? It kind of seems hard to believe that someone would wait to close it based upon the new name of
the Xerox or who the new CEO is. And if that's the case, it seems like there's a risk that they may be actually went
away to a competitor. So did they close or did they go away? Thank you.
<A - Robert Zapfel>: We had a good start in July in terms of conversion of opportunities that we had initially been
targeting in June. In fact, a very large contract signing just yesterday. So I would say that, that piece. And on the
renewal rate, I mean we're 85% year-to-date. We were a little bit lower in the second quarter, and I think that we still
see the ability to run in the 85% to 90% range and if you get the right ones. So I would rather be 85% with the right mix
that we re-won than be 90% with the wrong mix. And so, I think we'll be able to deliver in the range as we look
forward in the third and fourth quarters.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Jim. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Two, if I could. The first is, can Doc Tech
actually get close to flat revenue in the second half of the year? And the reason I ask is because you're talking about
seeing pretty solid momentum through the June Q. And you just put up [indiscernible] (43:08) of new products that are
going to ramp, I presume, through the second half of the year coming out of drupa. And you just put up a 3% decline
up from the 3% comp. And the comps get pretty easy in the second half the year. You have kind of 4% or 5% declining
comps in the second half of the year. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there. And then if it can't get back to down close
to flat, maybe it's down 1% or something like that – not totally flat – I'd love to hear why that can't happen. And then I
have a follow up. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Hey, Ananda. How are you? This is Jeff. Good to hear from you. Yeah, I think we have to
remember, so first, from the Tech segment standpoint, we've reported guidance of 5% to 7% at constant currency.
We're staying with that. I think you're talking more about where we put Document Technology and DO together where
we did improve from a negative 5% sequentially to a negative 3%. I think you have to remember is annuity is over 70%
of our business. Okay? So to turn that ship takes some time. So you certainly – we won't be seeing that in the quarter or
even next year. I mean it's going to take a big part of the ESR turning. We do have plans in place for when we come out
as Xerox the new company for things we'll do. We'll certainly be a little more aggressive in M&A, appropriately so.
But it will take some time to turn the 70% annuity to where we need it to be to get to where you're pointing.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Okay. Got it. Yeah, you're right. I did read that wrong. So I have a follow up on that. I'm
going to hold that follow-up, though, because I want to ask you the next one. So, a clarification on my math here. If you
do the midpoint of the September Q guide, you do the low-end of your 2016 guide, I think by my calc you need to do
$0.30 Q-over-Q in December Q, which if I recall correctly, is it kind of the highest end of what you guys have done
historically. So the question is, number one, given the strength of the June Q, is there some Services in any context
bake into the September Q? And number two, if there's not, then how do you actually – just walk through the

mechanics of how you do $0.30 to get to the low-end of the guidance range for the December Q.
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: So, Ananda, it's Leslie. First of all, it's been really hard to hear all of the elements of your
question. But I think that the gist goes like this: to get to the low-end of our guidance using the midpoint of our quarter
three guidance looks like our typical quarter four seasonality, and we would say agree. So the way we're thinking about
this is that we will have the normal second half over first half uptick in profitability, and that will enable us to get at a
minimum to the low-end of the guidance.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Thanks, Ananda.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Thank you, guys. Thanks so much.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a question for Bob, and maybe if I
could follow on to the question that Tien-tsin asked and maybe dig in a little bit more into the margin side of the
Services business. And I think we're relatively comfortable with some of the Services. One of those double-edged
swords on the Form 10 is you saw how well some businesses were performing, but certainly the Commercial business
would – stuck out kind of like a sore thumb. So with regard to improving the performance of that business, I think you
focused on it a little bit, signing better and more profitable contracts. But how much can be done on the cost side? And
what might be the trajectory of the margin improvement as you kind of work to improve that business? And then I have
a follow up.
<A - Robert Zapfel>: Yeah...
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: Brian.
<A - Robert Zapfel>: Brian, I'm sorry. So it's Bob. On Commercial, as you know, kind of the largest component from
an offering standpoint of our Commercial business is customer care. The Other components, HR outsourcing, learning,
litigation, F&A are largely making good progress and are reasonable from a margin standpoint. So a big piece of our
margin turnaround for the Commercial customer set – because it really is a customer set that buys a portfolio of
offerings – is really around the recovery plan that we're driving in customer care.
We've brought in from the outside a couple of exceptional leaders. We've got a big team over this, and we think it's not
going to be an immediate that next month we go from 0% to 10% margins, but we think we've got a set of actions in
place that will really lift the margin profile of that component of Commercial. We are honestly kind of blessed here.
We've got a great client set. We're ranked in the top quartile. So our problem is more our internals. Have we got the
cost management crisp enough? But that's a business that we're able to win in, and we've got a set of actions, and I do
believe that we can then elevate back to reasonable margins in the Commercial component of our BPO, not as high as
we get in Public or Healthcare where we've got a lot of separate industry-based IP and solutions, but reasonable within
the portfolio of BPO Co. or Conduent going forward.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up – I appreciate the color. As a follow up, the stuff that's
bucketed in the Other, some of the legacy runoff like Student Loans and other things that are in that kind of "Other
category", how much of a drag on consolidated corporate margins can we expect from those businesses? When might
that stuff go away and at what rate might we see that decline?
<A - Leslie F. Varon>: So it will be a significant drag on Conduent's quarter two financials. So when you see the Form
10, Student Loan, as they anticipated, is in runoff and declining significantly year-over-year, and we expect that will
continue throughout the rest of this year, but by 2017 should no longer be an issue.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is now open.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the BPO question. If I look really in two
vectors, if I look longer-term post-separation, Bob, if you just think about the pipeline now, is there enough to generate
year-over-year growth in that business on an organic basis? And related, if the cash flow – all BPO businesses have a
lower cash flow and M&A is clearly a big part of the industry right now and has been for some time, what is going to
be the ability of the Services business to leverage M&A to try not only increase your growth rate but, more importantly,
to increase the capabilities and skill sets and reach and all that goes with it.
<A - Robert Zapfel>: So, let me start with the pipeline and the organic growth component. I would say that the
pipeline is sufficient to get to modest organic growth, and we need to do more to build the pipeline to elevate that
growth rate to what would be our more likely long-term targets. I think on the M&A component, it's a little bit too
early. We're going to be in the cycle, as we get ready for Investor Day, to talk more about the capital structure debt,
everything else. So I wouldn't want to comment at this point relative to what the M&A prospects would be for
Conduent.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Keith, let me make something very clear, the strategy for this business, BPO, before we
decided to separate and post-separation, one plank of the strategy is going to be acquisitions. It is a business that has to
acquire to fill out capabilities and to grow revenue and that will continue to be the case as we move into the Conduent
business.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay. And, Ursula, my question was more philosophical. Is there going to be enough
free cash flow to support that strategy post-separation was really the nature of the question?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Keith, that's the question – I mean, that's the strategy. That's the plan. That's how we're trying
to structure these businesses, and how we are trying to lay the foundation in 2016 and a capital structure that allows us
to operate Conduent strategically to win.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And one of those elements is clearly to acquire is to have an active M&A business.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay, great. And just one clarification I wanted to follow-up with. Could you remind
us what the limitations – one of the first questions was, will they remain independent entities post-separation, but what
are the limitations from a tax basis on the ability to complete a transaction post-separation, the tax-free nature of the
spin?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Well, I think that that's something that you should probably call us and talk to Jennifer about
later. We have it all comprehended it, and Jennifer can bring you through the details. I think it would be a little bit too
complicated to get through right now.
<A - Jennifer Horsley>: Right.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi. Good quarter here. Congratulations on the improvement in the margins. I just wanted to
kind of dimensionalize what the possibilities are for the Services margin in particular. Bob, I was wondering if you
might have any metrics you could share about utilization. You don't disclose that in the Form 10, at least in the
preliminary Form 10. How should we think about that going forward? Your head count's down a lot. I would think the
utilization would be up, even if you don't want to quantify it, if you could qualify it. And I'll just do my follow-up now.
Could you share what percentage of your contracts were, as either a percentage of contracts or a percentage of your
Services revenue, are losing money? Some of your competitors disclosed that. It's just very hard to model the Services
going forward. Clearly, great progress, but without those two elements. Thanks. Thank you.
<A - Robert Zapfel>: Okay. So first on the utilization question. You are right to notice that our head count dynamics
have turned favorable. That is related not only to utilization. Honestly, we probably got more of the head count
reduction out of non-production workers, more in the way of middle management, if you will, than just purely on
production worker component.
We don't disclose utilization mostly because it's different in every business. The targets between customer care and
transaction processing and HR outsourcing, but a big component of our strategic cost transformation play is around
robotic process automation and trying to leverage technology to then increase that utilization rate.
So we're managing. We're really, really trying to be very, very disciplined on head count management, and that will
clearly be a component of the ongoing margin lift that we need to drive both in Xerox Services and then downstream in
Conduent.
Relative to what proportion of the contracts are below water, we've really gotten a lot more sophisticated in looking at
fully-allocated P&Ls which has helped us in identifying something that maybe didn't look so bad from a contribution
margin standpoint, we really need to do even better on. I wouldn't want to give you a hard figure, but it's not a high
proportion of the contracts. It's not as, though, out of our – out of all of our contracts that there is a big number of them
that are below water, and the ones that are, were on very aggressive, active recovery plans.
<Q - James Friedman>: That's helpful. Thank you.
Jennifer Horsley
Thanks, Jamie. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Ursula, anything more to wrap
up?
Ursula M. Burns
Yeah. So, as [ph] Jen (56:19) said, thank you for your questions. This was a strong quarter for Xerox with margin
improvements across our businesses and encouraging signs of improvement in the Technology revenue trend. Going
into the second half of the year we are highly confident in our ability to deliver our three priorities, which are, meeting
our financial guidance, creating two strong companies – two strong independent companies, and driving our strategic
transformation. We look forward to providing you with updates on our progress and more detailed looks at the
post-separation company financials and business strategies in the coming months. Thank you, everyone, for joining our
