MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 NYSE Euronext Earnings Conference Call.
My name is Chanel and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will
be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. For the Q&A session, we ask that
callers limit their questions to one to allow for broader participation. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at NYSE Euronext. Please go

or circumstances after this conference call.
We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures during this call. These non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled in the
tables attached to the text of the earnings press release that we issued earlier today. We believe that these tables provide
investors useful information about our business trends. However, our non-GAAP measures do not replace and are not
superior to GAAP measures.
For the call today, Michael Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer will review the financial results for the quarter. Tom
Callahan, CEO of NYSE Liffe U.S. will then provide an update on launch of interest rate products on our U.S. futures
exchange. Duncan Niederauer, our Chief Executive Officer, will conclude with some comments on the businesses and
provide an update on the business combination with Deutsche Boerse. We will then open the line for your questions.
When we go to the Q&A session, please limit your questions to one to allow for broader participation. We are
incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website, and Mike, Tom and Duncan will
refer to these slides during their remarks.
With that, let me now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We're pleased to share our second quarter 2011 results
with you, characterized by increasing revenue diversification, disciplined cost control and strong capital management.
For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.61 per share and net revenue of $661 million down, from $0.64 per share and
$654 million in net revenue in the prior-year period.
You'll recall that Q2 2010 trading volumes benefited from a strong spike in volatility from the advent of the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe as well as the Flash Crash in the U.S. Strong non-volume related revenues combined with the
weakening of the dollar year-over-year increased our net revenue by $51 million, helping to more than offset the
impact of decline in trading volume across most of our venues. Of particular note during the quarter, our Technology
Services business increased revenue by 14% and registered operating margins of 30%.
On the expense front, we continue to show cost management discipline. Our expenses increased $12 million, or 3%, to
$419 million. On a constant currency and portfolio basis, our expenses declined 3%, or $14 million, compared to the
second quarter of 2010. Global head count is below 3,000, despite completing several smaller deals since the middle of
last year, including the acquisition of a corporate board member and the joint venture with APX to create NYSE Blue.
With our strong free cash flow in the second quarter, we retired $200 million in commercial paper, which reduced our
debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.7 times, the lowest level since the merger of NYSE and Euronext. A significant
contributor to our free cash flow has been the reduction in capital expenditures, which were $31 million in Q2, down
from $70 million in the prior-year period.
So in summary, our results were solid year-over-year against a backdrop of an average of 17% decline in trading
volumes across our four primary venues. Slide four provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter of 2011.
For the quarter, net income and EPS were below prior-year, but in line with the first quarter of 2011. Second quarter
2010 results benefited from a net $54 million pre-tax gain from disposal activity, principally the sale of our 5% stake in
the National Stock Exchange of India.
This quarter we reported an $18 million charge from merger expenses and exit costs, which included $12 million
related to our pending business combination. Year-to-date, a total of $27 million has been spent on the pending merger.
Now, I'll review our financial results and from this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit
costs, gains from disposal activities and discrete tax items.
Slide five provides you more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date. Diluted EPS for the
quarter was $0.61, down 5% versus the prior-year's $0.64 and below the $0.68 in the first quarter of 2011. The first half
of 2011, EPS is a $1.28, up 9% versus prior-year. Volumes decreased dramatically last year following the second

quarter volatility.
We believe this presents a favorable backdrop for second half growth, as the lower volume comparables will
accompany continued strength in non-volume based revenues. In June 29th, we closed the sale of a 52.8% stake in the
NYSE Amex Options business. For the quarter, we reported 100% of the profits from this business, as the transaction
closed on April 1st of the second quarter, our diluted EPS for the second quarter would have been $0.02 lower.
This transaction provides a facility to the partners to require us to purchase of portion of their investments at specific
intervals over a five-year period. We expect to repurchase 10% of the partner's stake in the third quarter. We are
extremely pleased with the performance of this venture, which has increased its market share from about 6% at the time
we acquired the American Stock Exchange and 15% at the end of Q2.
Our diluted share count increased to 253 million shares in the second quarter, as a result of the issuance of
approximately 340,000 shares of former Amex members in connection with the sale of the former American Stock
Exchange headquarters.
Slide six provides a consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar weakened this quarter
versus prior-year, to both the euro and the pound. For the second quarter, 49% of our net revenue was denominated in
either euros or pounds and 51% in U.S. dollars. Currency impact on net revenue was favorable $33 million versus
prior-year and favorable $11 million versus the prior quarter.
On a currency neutral basis, second quarter net revenues were down 4% and operating income declined 9% versus the
second quarter of 2010. Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives and Cash Trading and Listings segments were
down 12% and 2%, respectively, and the Technology segment grew 9% versus Q2 prior-year.
On slide seven, we show the positive impact of non-volume related revenue, which reflects the increasing
diversification of our model. The $18 million in incremental net revenue generated by non-volume related activities
help dampen the impact of lower trading volumes across most of our venues.
Second quarter 2010 trading volume benefited from much higher levels of volatility driven by the sovereign debt crisis
and the Flash Crash. This incremental revenue came from a variety streams, including technology services, listings and
other revenues such as corporate board member and NYSE Blue.
When trading volumes do return to more historical norms, we will get the full benefit of our diversification efforts,
which helped us weather down volume cycles. July volumes are already showing a more favorable trend. NYSE
Euronext volumes for US Options and European Cash Trading were each up over 15% on July 2010 levels, while
LIFFE CONNECT volumes were similar and only US Cash was lower.
Slides eight and nine detail the financial performance for our derivative segment. Global derivative volumes decreased
12% year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in trading volumes in European derivatives. European derivative
volumes were impacted by lower equity futures, reduced risk capital and lower volatility.
Net revenues declined by 6% in the quarter. Derivatives accounted for 32% of our net revenues and 41% of our
operating income in Q2. The increase in fixed operating expenses for the derivatives segment was driven by the
migration to the new datacenters, some software upgrades being implemented this quarter and new business
development spending.
The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives was $0.74 per contract in the second quarter, compared to
$0.64 in the second quarter of 2010 and $0.69 in the first quarter of 2011. The increase versus the second quarter of last
year was due to the weaker dollar. Including the favorable impact of currency fluctuations, the capture would have been
$0.67 in the current quarter. Rate per contract in US options was $0.165 per contract in the second quarter, in line with
the prior-year and first quarter.
Similarly, slides 10 and 11 show the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listing segment. Cash Trading
and Listing's net revenue was $327 million in the second quarter of 2011, up 2% versus the prior-year period and in
line with the first quarter of 2010. These results were achieved despite declines in US and European Cash Trading

ADVs of 35% and 11%, respectively.
Lackluster volumes were more than offset by positive currency moves and strong non-volume related revenues, which
included growth in Listing's revenues and new revenue streams from Corporate Board Member and NYSE Blue.
Market share was down slightly in Q2, for both US cash and our four European markets compared to the prior-year;
market share for both venues, however, increased versus the prior quarter. Tape A share in the US was 35% and
European cash share was 71%. Revenue captured for the US cash trended up to $0.039 per 100 shares handled for Q2,
well above the $0.03 recorded in the second quarter of 2010.
Since the second quarter of 2010, we have implemented dynamic tiers based on overall US consolidated volumes and
removed the inversion at the highest tier on Arca. These changes, combined with the higher client take fees on NYSE,
Q2 rebalances for some of the larger indexes and a favorable mix have been driving higher capture rates. While we are
pleased with this development, we expect second-half capture rates to soften somewhat from the Q2 levels. Revenue
captured for European cash of $0.74, increased 13% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the positive
impact of currency fluctuation, capture was basically flat year-over-year.
Slide 12 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information
Services and Technology Solutions' revenue was $122 million in the second quarter, an increase of $15 million or 14%
from Q2 prior-year. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in safety and collocation revenue, and revenue
growth from managed service sales from TSE, WSE, and Sigma-X.
Operating margin was 30%, compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2010; adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%. We
recently announced an agreement to acquire Metabit, a Tokyo-based provider of market access services to the Asian
market. The acquisition supports our growing focus on Asian markets and strategic goal of building a global liquidity
network. We expect to close the transaction around the end of August. Year-to-date revenues are running 10% above
the prior-year period. We continue to target a growth rate of 15% for full-year 2011.
Slide 13 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses were up $12
million versus last year on a reported basis. 42% of our expenses in the second quarter were denominated in either
euros or pounds. If adjusting for FX and the impact of transactions, such NYSE Blue JV and the acquisition of
Corporate Board Member, fixed operating costs were down $14 million or 3% from the second quarter of 2010. We
continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvements that will further reduce
operating expenses.
Year-to-date, our fixed costs are flat compared to prior-year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of currency and
changes to our portfolio, our expenses are running 4% below prior-year levels. As a result, we are confident of our
ability to meet our full-year cost guidance of expenses below $1.65 billion on a constant dollar, a constant portfolio
basis. The first half of 2011, we reported costs of $834 million; if adjusting for $19 million of unfavorable FX variance
versus prior-year rates and $8 million in incremental costs from the March 2011 NYSE Blue joint venture, first half
constant dollar, constant portfolio costs were $807 million.
Slide 14 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2011. The company ended the quarter in a strong financial
position, well positioned for our combination with Deutsche Boerse. As a result of our strong free cash flow in the first
half of 2011, we retired our remaining commercial paper during the quarter, leaving the company without any
short-term debt as of June 30.
In the first half, we've repaid $366 million of short-term debt. Given the extremely low borrowing cost for commercial
paper, this should have the minimal impact on reported interest expense. With the retirement of our outstanding
commercial paper, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 1.7 times, down from 2.2 times at the end of 2010 and the
lowest level since NYSE and Euronext merged.
Second quarter capital expenditures remained low at only $31 million, compared to $70 million in the prior-year
quarter. Year-to-date capital spending is $67 million. While we do expect capital spending to pick up in the second
half, we are on track to be well below of full-year guidance of less than $200 million. Last week, the board declared a
$0.30 quarterly cash dividend in the third quarter of 2011, which is payable on September 30th.

With that, let me turn the call over to Tom Callahan for an update on one of our most important new initiatives.
Thomas F. Callahan
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to provide you with an update on the continued growth
of our US Futures platform. We've already accomplished more than any other new exchange in the US interest rate
futures space, just a little over five months into the launch of our new interest rate products. Before diving into our
results to-date, we have to first level set the discussion with background on our strategy as shown on slide 15. NYSE
Liffe US has four core pillars of its strategy, which closely relate to the NYX corporate strategy of building a capital
markets community.
That strategy is based on four key objectives, known internally as The CODE: Connect, Operate, Deliver, Enable.
These pillars strongly interrelate and it's always been our belief that without any one piece of the strategy, the others
don't work. Connect: underpinning our execution plan is a strong technology platform that leverages existing
connectivity for our core Liffe clients. Having NYX systems as the cornerstone to all aspects of our exchange ensures
that we bring a stable globally-distributed high-performance platform to the market.
Operate: our strong value proposition has provided a catalyst for a variety of customers to support our new platform.
This helps create a diverse liquid market with open interest that's growing virtually every day. The most difficult hurdle
for any new exchange is creating a consistent base liquidity and our customers are telling us that we have accomplished
that.
Deliver: NYPC delivers one of the core value propositions for NYSE Liffe US, capital efficiency via single-pot
margining between cash and futures. At a time when capital efficiency has never been more important, this innovation
is tremendously relevant. Enable: NYSE Liffe US has been built through a variety of partnerships. For example, the
partnership with MSCI to power our equity indexed futures complex, which was recently expanded with the successful
migration of MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets indices from another exchange, the semi-neutralized structure
of the exchange whereby NYX owns NYSE Liffe US in partnership with six sophisticated market participants and the
joint venture between DTCC and NYX, which created New York Portfolio Clearing.
Turning to slide 16, we highlight the progression of our interest rate products since launch. We launched interest rate
futures on our platform starting with Eurodollars on March 21, 2011. We've had strong support in our Eurodollars since
launch, with approximately 65,000 lots of average daily volume. Our US Treasury Futures were re-launched on July
7th; ADV since re-launch is 30,000 lots. Volume growth drivers include strong market support from a diverse set of
market participants, growing open interest of 29,000 lots as of July 29th.
Open interest in both products is strong and is growing rapidly. Open interest for the rates complex is now over
700,000 contracts and our total exchange is rapidly approaching 1 million contracts, with 805,000 as of July 29th. As
evidenced by our growth of open interest, we have a diverse range of market participants transacting volume every day
on our platform, with a geographically diverse group of market makers, banks and end-user customers.
Lastly on slide 17, we provide you with the five key areas that will drive our future growth. Our strategy going forward
starts with building on the existing success we've had on our platform. New customers are accessing our markets
regularly and we are pleased to welcome ABN AMRO and Citi as new NYPC clearing members just this week. We're
excited to launch Eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2012. We're working to expand the capital efficiencies
afforded to include customers in addition to the current clearing member house positions, hopefully to go live in early
2012.
New products: we're working on a variety of innovative new product ideas. And finally, the MSCI expansion, we
haven't really spent a lot of time on this asset class today, but we're optimistic about the potential for our equity index
futures complex. We successfully migrated 70,000 lots in open interest from CME to our platform in June 2011 in the
emerging markets and EAFE futures. Over $3 trillion in assets under management are benchmarked to MSCI indices
globally, so we're quite optimistic for the development of these futures markets. So with that, let me turn the call over

to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
All right, thanks a lot, Tom. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody, greetings from London. Just doing a quick
tour through Europe, so we thought we'd do the earnings from here today and then my team and I will be in Frankfurt
tomorrow doing some work on the merger. But before I get to the combination with DB, I did want to take a minute on
slide 18 just to comment on several key developments in our segments, which, I believe, go a long way towards
highlighting the fact that despite the tremendous efforts that we're all engaged in on the merger, we have tried to isolate
these efforts within our organization so that our business people can stay focused and continue to execute. I'm
personally very proud of what we've been able to accomplish in the first half of 2011 and I want to thank my colleagues
for all of their hard work on behalf of all of our shareholders.
First on the Derivatives business, you just heard from Tom with regard to how we are doing on Liffe US and NYPC.
And, in addition, I'm very pleased to know that we successfully closed the sale of the stake in our NYSE Amex Options
business that Mike alluded to earlier. Our partners in that venture will be integral in helping us implement new order
types and market structure changes that will enhance our Exchange and further grow our market share.
On the Cash Trading and Listings business, we continue to see growing momentum in our Listings franchise. We were
number one globally for IPOs for the second consecutive quarter and I'm proud that NYSE has won 155% of the
technology IPOs year-to-date, up from a previous record high of 44% in 2010. Our recent big tech wins include
LinkedIn and Pandora.
Additionally, year-to-date we continue to see transfers from other exchanges, with a total of eight transfers
year-to-date, including HUDSON VALLEY HOLDING CORP., which began trading on the NYSE today and Regency
Energy Partners, which will begin trading at the NYSE on August 9th. There have been no transfers going the other
way so far this year. During the quarter and late last week, we experienced several outages in our European cash
markets. We have identified the root cause of these outages, we have stabilized the environment and we are putting in
place the infrastructure that will prevent these outages from occurring in the future.
Lastly on slide 18, a bit of our Information Services and Technology Solutions business. Happy to report that we are on
track for full-year revenue growth of 15% and our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2015. We will hit this target by
continually expanding our global liquidity network, through our hub expansion program and acquisitions like Metabit
that we announced just last week. We will also continue to embed ourselves in the trading fabric of our clients, with
initiatives like our cloud launch, which creates the first capital markets community platform.
Shifting to slide 19, I wanted to spend the next couple of slides talking a bit about the merger process with Deutsche
Boerse. Slide 19 focuses on where we stand with regard to integration planning. With the strong support of our
shareholders behind us, we are moving beyond the votes and focusing on the various regulatory streams that we have to
work through as well as our integration planning.
On integration, we have already made some tough decisions together, which have been laid out in the Business
Combination Agreement, so the framework for operating NewCo is already in place and it is very clear who is
responsible for what through the closing.
Next, a key list of integration planning topics was identified early in the process and resulted in an increase in our
synergy targets, as we found more similarities than originally assumed. For example, we were able to find more
common ground than we expected on our future IT architecture. Already in the second quarter we have affirmed a joint
and dedicated integration planning team, named the senior managers in-charge of running the integration planning
effort and established full-fledged integration teams, including divisional experts and project support personnel.
The future management team is also working to set the goals and priorities for the integration planning process until
closing, so we feel very confident as a team that we have set ambitious and achievable targets. With the overwhelming
support for the transaction provided by shareholders from both companies, management attention has shifted towards

receiving the requisite Non-Objection Declarations from regulators as well as preparing the ground for a swift and
effective integration post-closing.
Lastly, while the integration teams will continue to drill down into the synergy targets, we will also begin to focus on
some of the softer aspects of the integration, including setting the foundation for the harmonization of our two cultures.
This is a complex cross-border deal and our goal is to create a culture of performance that matches our leadership
position in the global Exchange space. Given both companies strong and rich histories of operating in international
environments as well as the specific examples of teamwork that I have just outlined as our teams begin to work
together, a good example of which was winning overwhelming approval from the shareholders of both companies, I am
confident that we will be successful in integrating our cultures.
Shifting to slide 20, I wanted to spend a few minutes outlining the European Commission review process and the
benefits of our combination for all customers, end users and the markets. A particular focus for us is the European
Commission review process, which really has been ongoing for some time, through pre-notification discussions after
we announced our transactions and recently with our Final Competition filing, which we submitted in late June. This
week, the competition authorities in the EU are expected to complete the first phase of their investigation, during which
they have collected opinions from our peers, customers, competitors and other stakeholders.
Some of the views that the Commission has collected have already been disclosed publically and it should not surprise
any of us on this call that our competitors have been the most vocal about their concerns regarding our pending
business combination. This was expected and we have absolute confidence that the Commission will carefully consider
the source of these objections. Let's make it clear that we expect to be notified by the competition authorities later this
week that we will embark on a Phase-II process.
For our part, we continue to run a very diligent and comprehensive process in close collaboration with our colleagues at
DB to respond to requests from the Commission. Our deal was the right answer for the European capital markets;
putting our two companies together will create tremendous benefits for all customers and end users in terms of capital
efficiency and operational simplification and cost reduction. Secondly, it will strengthen and improve efficiency of the
EU capital markets in terms of liquidity, lower volatility and cost of capital. And it's important to note that any negative
impact on competition is not significant, given the global nature of derivative markets, the increasing competition
between OTC and listed markets generally and in derivatives specifically, and the simple well-known fact that NYX
and DB1 don't really compete against one another.
The only area of overlap in our current business models is in some single-name derivatives and, of course, we are only
two of many players in those markets. With respect to competition issues, we don't want to front-run the regulators, but
my guess is that their focus will be on what conditions may be placed on us not how to make or break the deal. This is a
process that lends itself to speculation and we understand that. Not surprisingly, a lot of this speculation has been
driven by our competitors, as I mentioned earlier, and much of it is focused on remedies, in particular some who have
opined on whether we'd be asked to dispose of certain businesses, like our NYSE Liffe or Eurex Derivatives franchises.
Obviously, European derivatives are a critically important part of our combination, providing synergies, capital
efficiencies and other significant shareholder and customer benefits. And of course, as in any deal, at some point the
logic of the combination would not hold together, but we think the regulators are weighing the issues carefully and will
provide a thoughtful and balanced approach. So, in short, we are giving them what they need to consider the issues
presented, but we can't and won't predict the outcome of their deliberations but we will continue to collaborate.
We are confident that the benefits that our combination will provide to clients in the market overall do and will
continue to resonate with regulators and we look forward to continuing our constructive discussions with the
Commission and the case team in Brussels, still hopeful that we will be able to close our transaction in 2011.
Lastly, just some concluding remarks. In closing, our results for the quarter were solid and we are pleased with the
progress we are making on our strategy to create a global capital markets community that will empower our clients to
innovate and collaborate. As a result of our diversification efforts over the past several quarters, our business model is
much better positioned to weather lackluster trading volume cycles, as we saw particularly in this quarter.

We have additional drivers of growth gaining traction, with interest rate futures on NYSE Liffe US and NYPC. The
Clearing and Post-Trade businesses will continue to be a particular area of focus for us as a combined company and we
have strong growth coming from our Technology segment in 2011 and beyond. We continue to see momentum in our
Listings franchise, securing the number one position in global IPOs for the second consecutive quarter and, lastly, with
our respective shareholder votes behind us, we are fully focused on the regulatory approval process, targeting a close
for our business combination with Deutsche Boerse in 2011.
With that, we'd be happy to open the line for your questions. Thanks for listening.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Roger Freeman. [Barclays Capital,
Inc.] Please proceed.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi, good morning. I guess my question would be around NYSE Liffe and NYPC in
total. Can you give us ballpark or quantify how much those businesses are in a negative profit position right now, in a
loss position? And secondly, on NYPC, can you just talk to the growing open interest versus sort of stable volumes and
market share? What's the nature of the open interest, is that sort of chunky block -- a block rate demand?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Why don't I – I'll take the first part about the financials and then I'll over to Tom. So,
what we've indicated in the last couple of years is that NYSE Liffe has been in investment mode and that we've
reported about a $30 million operating loss for that business. And remember, we own 58% and we have minority
partners who have 42% of that business. So, although we don't report the profitability each quarter as the interest rate
business is just starting, it's in its infancy, I think we're doing a little better than that $30 million loss that we reported
last year, but we're still in a large investment position at this stage.
<A - Thomas F. Callahan>: Sure. In terms of the growth of open interest, we said before we even launched the
platform that our success would be measured as much by our growth in OI as by our volumes because we made a
strategic decision back in 2009 when we designed the platform to really have capital efficiency as the centerpiece of the
new Exchange.
So, the fact that both our partners and our customers are recognizing that and are really making a long-term
commitment to the platform by moving open interest is enormously gratifying and exciting for us. We're seeing new
partners coming into our market virtually every single day and as they do, the open interest, as you can see from the
chart in the deck, is steadily increasing every single day. So, 800,000 lots of open interest across the exchange, 700,000
lots at NYPC for a platform that is five months old, is just great progress and great early momentum and I think it
validates the strategy of delivering operational and capital efficiencies through the NYPC platform.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto, Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yeah, good morning, guys. I don't want to do it, but I'll stay on the topic of NYSE Liffe
here since we have Thomas. You talked about the number, I guess, the loss, Michael. But we still have – here's the
questions, we still have the free market making or at least some liquidity providers are still free until I think '012. And
then, so I'm just trying to see what type of volume do you need to breakeven either before '012 or once the – is it the fee
– once you start charging fees in March of '012 that could move it or how much volume do we need? And then, also
this re-launch of [ph] treasury (37:38), I know there was an issue with the contract and can you just remind us the how
the capital efficiency is with Eurodollars as well as we know about the treasuries.

<A - Thomas F. Callahan>: Sure. So, I think there might be three questions in there, Rich. So, I'll try to hit them one
at a time. I think what you might been referring to in-terms of the fee holiday was the first three months of NYPC,
where there was a fee holiday on clearing fees that went from March 21st to June 21st. So, that has since expired.
In terms of the profitability of the overall platform, it really comes down, as you know, to the ecosystem of different
types of customers because, of course, you have market makers all the way to end-user customers. And the thing that
we have been most gratified by, outside of the growth in open interest that I discussed previously, was the amount of
end-user customers, the non-members that are coming into our platform. We have done over 300,000 lots of customer
block trades from large US asset managers.
So, the fact that we are seeing that kind of commitment from real end-user customers, really, I think is a great vote of
confidence in the new platform. But, of course, in terms of the rate per contract that helps us enormously as well. I
think the final question was around capital efficiency and do the Eurodollars benefit from the capital efficiencies of
NYPC. The answer is absolutely. The largest source of margin at FICC is actually their repo clearing business and
repos have a very high correlation with the Eurodollar contract. So, there is a terrific amount of capital efficiency there
and I think that helps explain the open interest growth that we've had. And then, in terms of the relaunch of the treasury
complex, when we launched the platform on March 21st, the big difference between treasury futures and Eurodollar
futures is, of course, treasury futures are physically delivered.
Customers wanted to see the NYPC could manage its first physical delivery. It did that successfully in June and really
more than anything that helped build confidence, once we got through that period into July, for customers to really start
increasing their level of activity. And that's why you saw, when we relaunched the platform on July 7, our volume in
open interest start to increase immediately.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yeah, I think while – you're saying that all the trades were – all the waivers for the trades
were ended in June. In think on your website it still has trade fees waived for approved market makers until March 21?
<A - Thomas F. Callahan>: So I mean that's on the Exchange side, Rich, not on the clearing house side. Of course, for
the people who make markets in our platform and sign market making agreements, there are fee waivers and that's very
standard in the futures industry and that will, of course, continue, because you always need market makers. But what I
was referring to in terms of the end-user customers and the early adoption that we've seen, obviously, those are
fee-paying customers and the more of those we get, the better the balance sheet of the business will look.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to quickly shift gears to the deal, in particular, that slide where
you highlight the benefits for end users. Now, when I look at the reduction in capital requirement, in particular, that $3
billion, I mean, looking at that and talking to some broker folks in the industry, it sounds like people are generally very
excited about this. And I think they made that case heard in their antitrust submissions. I think the big issue is to really
have confidence with some of these numbers though, so hoping to see if there will be anything else that you can
provide in the future. I mean, if I look at that $3 billion number and look back what CME and CBOT did it in 2004, I
mean, I probably can come up with a number like that myself.
So I think what people struggle with, in particular on the dealer side, is can we put portfolios together, show them to
you and you can tell us hey this is really what we're getting, in particular, given that there are different regulatory
frameworks between Eurex and Liffe and other challenges quite probably will take some time to put that together. So
any comments there will be great there. Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yeah, Alex, it's Duncan. I'll take that one. So we certainly intend to be very transparent
on that and as we get closer to closing or shortly after closing when we are talking about migration plans, combinations

of clearinghouses and giving the clients a roadmap of when all that can happen, when we're one company, it will be a
lot easier to go a lot deeper.
So far, obviously, we've wanted to be cautious. We came up with that number that we've quoted by doing sort of what
you suggested, where we went to a few big customers and we said look, we can't really look at each other's positions
right now, you know what positions you have in both places, why don't each of us give you the data and then let's run
some correlations, let's run some analyses and let's see what we come up with. So we felt pretty good that €2 billion or
$3 billion was a fairly good number out of the gate based on some testing that we did.
But I imagine we will be able to put a much finer point to that as we get closer to the closing and into the operating as
NewCo. And it's a great question because it's a significant benefit to the marketplace and it's obviously in our interest to
be honest about it, but also, be as clear with as many as we can that that's a real savings not an illusory one.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: So do you think and this is the same question, so do you think there will be any opportunity to
give more detail to the participants so that they can still comment or follow-up in Phase II during the antitrust?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yeah, I think we haven't approached it that way to-date, but we can. It's a good
suggestion. We have gone to several individuals and I think we'd be prepared to do that under the outline of the ground
rules that I just went through where we're not looking into each other's clearinghouses prematurely, that's inappropriate.
But, certainly, the end-user can see that for all of their clients and do that analysis.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Right. Very good. Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: Hey, good morning.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: So, in June, CME Group announced that they were going to start to offer the
Euribor contract. I was wondering if you could comment on how you think you guys are currently competitively
positioned to defend against that entry as well as any implications that might have on the antitrust concerns with your
merger.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Well, it's Ducan, Patrick. I'll take that one. I'll answer the second half of that first. I
would think that it's, in terms of the impact on the merger, it's been duly noted by the competition authorities in
Brussels that there have been a few competitive efforts in the last few months, either embarked upon or announced. So,
frankly, we think it's an example of like other examples that there is an opportunity to compete. At the same time, we
think what we've learned in NYSE Liffe US and in NYPC, as Tom went through in his material and this really gets to
the first part of your question, if you're going to compete, we certainly understood, we had to bring an innovative
solution to the market place.
I think listing lookalike contracts and not really adding any value from the capital efficiency point of view or whatever
it might be, we think are fairly easy to defend against. So when we were trying to be an attacker in the US jurisdiction,
we spent a lot of time trying to think about what more it had to be than just listing Eurodollars and treasuries. We didn't
think that was much of a competitive threat to the incumbent, so I think what you saw us do was spend a lot more time
on something that was innovative, not just simply list a lookalike contract and attempt to compete.
Tom, would you add anything to that from your point of view with your derivatives hat on?
<A - Thomas F. Callahan>: I would say, I mean, of course, CME is an incredibly powerful global competitor so we're
talking the threat very, very seriously. We thought it was interesting that they chose to clear the products in Chicago,

which is an inverse of when Liffe unsuccessfully back in 2004 attempted to launch Eurodollars cleared in London and
that proved to be a challenge for us at the time. So it will be interesting to see how European customers react to a
Chicago-cleared Euribor contract. But, regardless, we're staying very close to our customers and we're taking the threat
very, very seriously.
<Q - Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line Johannes Thormann of HSBC.
<Q - Johannes Thormann>: Good morning, everybody. Johannes from HSBC. One question concerning your balance
sheet, please. You have successfully reduced your debt-to-EBITDA ratio. What is an appropriate level for your
company and will you continue to decrease or at which point do you think you will increase the dividend policy also in
the light of the merger with Deutsche Boerse? Thank you.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Okay. I'll handle that. Johannes, we have mentioned in the past that our current comfort
zone and our targeted leverage is around 2 to 2.25 times, so the 1.7 is below the norm and expectation for our business.
We have announced a special dividend so, clearly, we are building balance sheet capacity so that when we complete the
merger, we'll have the necessary cash to pay the special dividend. You shouldn't read into the strength in the balance
sheet as being the way we would run our business necessarily on a standalone basis but, clearly, it is as part of the plan,
vis-à-vis the merger and, as a I said, developing capacity.
<Q - Johannes Thormann>: Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Congrats on the shareholder votes. Mike, just a quick one
on the financials, can you discuss the impact from the Amex transaction, assuming no changes in its profitability
position, just maybe what would've earnings been if the deal had closed at the beginning of the June quarter? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Sure, yes, so I believe we mentioned in our talking points, so we're saying had we closed
the transaction April 1 instead of June 29, we would've reported a $0.02 less earnings per share. So the minority interest
on the partner's portion of the profitability. So, if volumes stay the same, that's what you can expect in the third quarter
and going forward.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Sorry I missed it.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: That's okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Harris [Goldman Sachs & Co.].
<Q - Daniel F. Harris>: Hi, good morning, guys. Hey, Duncan, you talked a bit about the issues that you guys have
been having with Euronext on the technology side with the sporadic outages and the index calculations. I was
wondering if you could delve a little bit deeper into what that was. But more so, also, I think that as part of the merged
entity, you're not going to be using UTP going forward. Can you talk about the decision process on that versus what the
alternative is, obviously, with Deutsche Boerse technology? Thanks.

<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Sure. I know you guys are everywhere, but you clearly know some things about our
merger that we don't know yet because we didn't know that decision had been made about UTP, but thanks for letting
us know, we appreciate the heads-up. I think – I'm going to let Dominique, who's sitting here with me, talk about how
we've diagnosed these issues, what we think the route cause was, what we've done about it, et cetera. And then I'll have
him kick it back to me and we'll talk a little bit about how that may be impacting the discussion we're having around the
common trading and clearing architecture, okay? So, Dominique, why don't we start with you?
<A - Dominique Cerutti>: Yeah. So, indeed, we had on the European side four incidents to be clear in June, July and
we take that very seriously. Three of the incidents and the one you're mentioning are originating in a complex cause.
We made, since you're asking, we made an update on [ph] micro corp (50:40) that was mandatory on one of our
software and it has created some packet loss.
We have the best expert on our camp and from the vendors to analyze that, and it is this change combined with high
market volume and some new behaviors enabled by the new capabilities that we're offering to members that are
triggering some instability in some legacy software that we still run, so that's what had happened. I don't want to go
deeper, it would be quite complex. Again, we have analyzed the situation, we have taken mitigation actions in the short
term and maybe more importantly, we're running a taskforce and we expect result in the next 30 days to check whether
or not we have other vulnerabilities in our system and make sure that we will come back to best of breed stability.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: All right. And then, to get to the second part of your question, I think we continue to
have discussions about, as I've said to some of you before at various analysts' meetings, et cetera, we view the common
trading and clearing architecture as having many components starting with, what we call the Common Customer
Gateway, to the safety network, to the trading engines, to the back-end systems, to the data dissemination tools, to the
clearing platforms, et cetera. And we continue to have very healthy dialogue with our colleagues at DB, some of the
decisions about which pieces will be using have already been made. I think what we have said publicly is the system
we end up using won't be UTP or what DB runs right now; it will be probably be an amalgam of all of the above. But I
think on some of the components, we've already made the decision. Larry, you want to add anything to that since you're
on the call, too? As to where we in that decision?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: No, I think that's the right way it to say it. We're going to a comparing functionality, the
considerations really are: functionality points, paying of client migration and really that matters a lot. We don't want to
put client through a big migration here, and then ultimate cost saving and you can be guaranteed that this is going to be
a best of breed and no matter what, best of technologists on both sides. The problems we've been having in Europe
really are related to not only microcode but legacy systems have nothing to do with UTP and really haven't colored this
discussion. I think it's been a very healthy discussion not just among the technologists, but also among the businesses,
because the businesses are really concerned that functionality gets preserved and that their clients are not disturbed in
this process.
<Q - Daniel F. Harris>: Okay.
<A>: Okay, thanks, Dan.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander, KBW.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. If I could touch on the expenses because
going back – going way back, this was officially – the second quarter was officially the end of the integration phase for
Euronext and NYX. But I'm just wondering if it is kind of all fully done and behind you now, or if maybe there are still
some data centers, old ones that need to be run off. And because your expense guidance was not changed but, clearly,
the FX is driving it higher, just trying to get a sense of the run rate going forward and maybe opportunities to lower it
from this level.

<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Sure. This is Mike. Yes, I mean, we – it's a challenge as we from time to time acquire a
company or the euro or dollar fluctuate. We can keep updating the guidance, our guidance was using 2010's average
exchange rates, where we reported 1,6,7,8 in costs and the portfolio we had at the end of the year, we were guiding that
our costs would come below [ph] $1650 (54:33) and as I indicated on the call, adjusting for all that, we were at [ph]
$807 (54:37) in the first half.
So we're clearly below our guidance and in line with our guidance. As Duncan mentioned, we continue to focus on
opportunities to run our business more efficiently every day. To your question, there are still some legacy data centers
and other assets that we are exiting and there is some savings, they're not going to be as large as they were the last
couple of years but there are some avenues for further cost reductions related to the transition and the integration that
we'll start to see and experience as we get down to the end of the year.
So I think maybe at the end of the third quarter when we have three quarters under the belt, we can give a more precise
expense number but I think rather than trying to project which way the currency is going to move and/or we just added
Metabit, we might – whether or not we make any more acquisitions, I think it's fair way to do it is to report the numbers
as we do it today and provide the reconciliation of our deck and how we're doing against our guidance.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: All right. Just to jump in for one second here, I think it's really important that at certain
point, it becomes hard to figure out what is a integration savings, meaning from Euronext/NYSC merger, and what is
just continuing to operate your business more effectively. And we continue to believe that we can continue to cut our
costs as we move forward, even had we not done this DB deal. That's part of what you do if you're running your
company properly, and we think we still have room to run. I think we continue to do that among the backdrop of
investing in some new businesses and making some new acquisitions.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Right, which is great point. Just one more follow-up on what Larry said, our technology,
our commercial technology business is not a fixed-cost business. So as we aspire to be – have a $1 billion of revenue
there and we take on new managed-service accounts, we are taking on costs. Our focus there is revenue growth and
margins, it's not in keeping the costs fixed. So we've been able to absorb those incremental costs while continuing to
bring down our overall expense base.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
And your final question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris Harris>: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Clearly, you've had some excellent success in
options with Amex remutualization and growth in maker-taker, but it looks like some of that momentum is slowing a
little bit here and just wondering if you could share with us what strategies you plan in implementing in options to kind
of further your share growth? And as maybe a follow-up to that, would you ever consider selling a stake in Arca
Options, given the success you've had at Amex? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: So, I think – to jump in there, this is Larry again. First, you're seeing the effect of options
being very competitive and we have a lot competitors out there who have varying models. What you're also seeing
overtime is a blending towards the middle between pure maker-taker, meaning the Arca model, and pure directed flow,
like Amex. So, you see then, as the directed flow guys have adopted some functionality that looks more maker-taker
like and vice-versa. So, we're going to continue to see that and we all push to continue to try to differentiate our
platforms. We think that we have some interesting developments in the works and we're going to continue to push on
those. It's a competitive market, but it's also a growing market, and so that's a good position to be in.
<Q - Chris Harris>: Fair enough. Thank you.
