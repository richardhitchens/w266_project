Peter D. Hancock
Thanks, Liz, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'd like to discuss the quarter's results, our priorities, financial
objectives, and our view of economic forces impacting our businesses. As we look back over the full year, the earnings
growth of our core insurance business, our DTA utilization, and accretive share repurchases resulted in 12% growth in
book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA. Our fourth quarter and 2014 full-year accomplishments reflect our
commitment to value-based management and focus on growth, profitability, and risk.
As just one example of executing on value-based metrics, I'd like to highlight our execution of debt retirement at
spreads exceeding those of our debt issuance. This strategy resulted in over $500 million of incremental economic
value for shareholders despite an approximate $800 million GAAP charge to net income. This quarter, you'll also see
that our re-segmentation highlights our focus on customers. Our customers look to us as their lead insurer rather than
just another source of capacity. And you'll hear more on our commercial and consumer customer focus from John and
Kevin.
Our fourth quarter included both accomplishments and challenges. We saw the early signs of expenses moving in the
right direction, both the commercial and consumer P&C businesses, delivering accident year-loss ratio improvement
from the same period last year. We executed on a number of positive capital management actions. And yesterday, we
announced a new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization.
Our fourth quarter results also included evidence of our risk management discipline across the company. Specifically,
accident years 2005 and later continued to develop favorably. We continue to accelerate the DIB unwind, with a focus
on maximizing economic value and we moved excess capital from our life insurance companies to the parent.
We also recognize the challenges that persisted this quarter, and we remain focused on them. Specifically, certain older
accident years have resulted in additional reserve strengthening. We provide details on the older accident years in our
earnings presentation, which David will speak to. Consistent with our practice since 2011, this quarter's actions are
based on new information coming from a thorough and independent reserve analysis. We believe that the stable
development of more recent accident years highlights the value of our reserving practices and our underwriting
discipline.
Our priority is to deliver sustainable ROE improvements as we look to 2015 and beyond. For the full year 2014, ROE
excluding AOCI and excluding DTA was 8.4%. Over the course of the year, excess alternative returns and
lower-than-expected catastrophe losses added about 1 percentage point to this full-year ROE. Excluding that 1% gives
us a good starting point to discuss ROE expansion going forward. Over the next three years, we're focused on achieving
annual ROE improvement through our commitment to managing growth, profitability, and risk. We seek to deliver a
consistent level of expense savings through our technology, process redesign, shared service centers, and simplification
of our organizational structure.
Turning to page three of the earnings deck, we outline our financial objectives for the next three years. Based on the
outlook for our businesses and the current environment, we believe that we can achieve 50 basis points or higher of
annual improvement in ROE ex-AOCI and DTA through 2017 from a normalized baseline of 7.4% for 2014. Our
ability to be higher will be driven in part by the timing of emerging benefits from our investments and the growth in
savings resulting from these investments as well as catastrophe losses and investment returns that are in line with our
expectations.
Our long-term ROE objective remains 10%. Our view on general operating and other expenses is that we can achieve a
3% to 5% annual decline on a net basis through 2017, which allows for growing our investment in technology and
systems. David will provide further comments on our outlook for general operating expenses.
Finally, we expect book value per share growth, ex-AOCI and DTA, to exceed 10% annually through 2017 as a result
of improved profitability, further capital and risk management actions and our DTA utilization, assuming our ability to
deploy excess capital continues. We maintain a disciplined risk appetite for new businesses and acquisitions. Our
acquisitions have not been capital-intensive and have provided unique capabilities, clients and distribution and are not

driven by a desire for acquiring assets or short-term earnings.
I'd like to close with a few comments on the impact of external forces on our business, and how we react to the
changing environment. The reduction in inflationary expectations is good news for claims trends and underwriting
results. Growth in the U.S. is also encouraging, and we will pursue new business with our disciplined approach.
Offsetting these positives is the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment and a decline in property casualty
rate increases. Kevin will speak more about the impact of the current interest rate environment.
While there are positives and negatives to our operating environment, we believe our discipline, commitment to our
customers and our ability to meet the wide range of their needs will serve us well in the long run.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to David.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review the highlights for this quarter's results, our
recent capital management actions and balance sheet strength, and our outlook for 2015 capital management.
Turning to slide four, you can see our total insurance operating income was up slightly versus a year ago. After-tax
operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion or $0.97 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter, our operating return
on equity adjusted for AOCI and DTA was 6.8% and, as Peter mentioned, 8.4% for the full year.
Reported net income was $655 million and included a charge for retirement of debt of $824 million, associated with
our liability management actions. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and DTA, grew just – to just over $58 a share,
12% higher than a year ago, again driven by our earnings, our DTA utilization, and accretive share repurchases. I will
highlight a few noteworthy items for the quarter, and John and Kevin will provide more details on the commercial and
consumer operating results.
Turning to slide five. We summarize prior-year development in our property casualty reserves. Net adverse prior-year
development for the quarter was just under $300 million, including premium adjustments of about $50 million, and
relates primarily to accident years 2004 and prior.
Commercial insurance reported prior year development of about $197 million, including those premium refunds. There
were four classes of business that contributed almost equally to the adverse emergence, and those include Primary
Workers' Compensation, Healthcare, Pollution Products, and certain Financial Lines.
Consumer Insurance had a modest favorable prior-year development of about $35 million principally from our private
client group business. The run-off segment now reported in Corporate reported net adverse prior-year development of
about $135 million, driven primarily by Pollution Products within the runoff environmental book and the retained
asbestos and assumed reinsurance portfolios.
As we have seen in the last couple of years, the overall adverse development was related to 2004 and prior. As of this
year-end, we have experienced less than a 2% change in our initially recorded year-end ultimates for each of the last
eight accident years. In the third quarter, we disclosed that we expected a $250 million to $350 million negative impact
on our workers' compensation discount due to the fall in interest rates as of September 30. In the fourth quarter, we
reduced our workers' compensation discount by a little over $560 million due to the combined impact of this fall in
interest rates and faster paydown of our reserves.
In our U.S. Life business, we added a little over $100 million to the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported
death claims which reflected continuing efforts to identify deceased insureds and their beneficiaries, primarily related
to legacy small face amount policies pursuant to the resolution of a multistate audit.
Turning to slide six, which represents the Corporate and Other operations, we saw mark-to-market – a decline in
mark-to-market earnings from our Direct Investment book and Global Capital Markets this quarter. We continue to
wind down the Direct Investment book and Global Capital Markets. And in the fourth quarter, we redeemed about $2.5

billion of debt to bring the full-year total to about $7.5 billion using cash and short-term investments allocated to this
book.
We expect ongoing wind-down to result in the release of capital to parent over time. We expect that the earnings
contribution from the Direct Investment book will also decline as the portfolios continues to wind down. The parent
company investments in AerCap and PICC continue to deliver and resulted in about $250 million of pre-tax operating
income in the quarter.
Total corporate expenses net were $236 million in the quarter, down on a sequential basis largely due to the incentive
compensation accruals discussed in the prior quarter. Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter declined
to just over 21%, driven primarily by tax benefits related to foreign operations.
As Peter mentioned, managing our expenses while investing in our future are key priorities for AIG. As a baseline,
slide seven shows total operating – general operating expenses for 2014 from our new disclosure in the financial
supplement. Our top investments are included in the reported general operating expenses, and totaled a little over $650
million in 2014.
For example, the Japan integration is included both in the general operating expense and is included in our investments
as we describe them. We're focused on reducing the business-as-usual expenses, which we define as GOE, less these
investments sustainably over time, as well as focusing on the overall expenses and the expense reduction that Peter
referenced, all the while making the necessary investments to fund growth, profitability, and enhanced risk
management.
Our capital management highlights begin on slide eight. During the quarter, we deployed $1.5 billion towards the
repurchase of approximately 28 million shares of common stock, bringing the full-year repurchases to $4.9 billion. An
additional 3.5 million shares were delivered in January with the full completion of the ASR which we initiated in
December.
In addition, the Board of Directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $2.5 billion which reflects
the strong capital flows from our Life Insurance companies, as well as the reduction in risk in our Property Casualty
business. With respect to debt capital management, we continue to manage the cost and maturity profile of our debt. As
a result of the actions we've taken in 2014, we've reduced our run rate interest expense by roughly $250 million, and we
expect the annual interest expense for 2015 to be just under $1.1 billion.
As shown on slide nine, we ended the quarter with financial leverage ratios, including hybrids of just over 15%, or a
little over 16% when giving effect for the January issuances. We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital
management, and expect that an improving earnings profile will continue to positively affect our coverage ratios going
forward. The year-end RBC ratio for the fleet of U.S. companies – U.S. Life companies, is estimated at around 490%
after giving effect for the fourth quarter and January distributions which is closer to our targeted operating RBC level.
Cash flow to the holding company remains strong as you can see on slide 10. We received cash dividends and loan
repayments from our insurance subsidiaries of $2.9 billion during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date to just over $8
billion. We also received $700 million of distributions and fixed maturity securities, bringing that total for the year to
just over $1 billion. In addition, in January, our businesses paid $2.8 billion in dividends.
Looking ahead to 2015, we expect $6 billion to $7 billion in potential share repurchases and shareholder dividends.
This total does not include any potential monetization of non-core assets. This is subject, of course, to Board approval,
ongoing discussions with rating agencies and any regulatory approvals that could be required.
As part of the natural evolution, we have moved to a more dynamic approach for the deployment of our capital which
reflects our capital utilization for risk, deployment of capital in our businesses and capital flows. We expect dividends
from our insurance subsidiaries in 2015 of $4 billion to $5 billion in addition to the distributions received thus far in
2015 that I mentioned a moment ago.
Further, we expect tax sharing payments between $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually over the next several years which
reflects tax planning strategies and updates to our taxable income projections and also reflects our capital gain

recognition that realize all of the capital loss carryforwards. We continue to expect that our tax attribute DTA will be
fully utilized by 2020 or 2021. We expect our operating effective tax rate for 2015 to be 33% to 34%.
So, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John Q. Doyle
Thank you, David. This morning, I will discuss our Commercial results which include the operating segments Property
Casualty, Mortgage Guaranty, and Institutional Markets. You will see that we have moved our insurance runoff
business, which had been part of the PC Other to Corporate. This is consistent with our focus on managing runoff lines
to capture the greatest economic value for AIG.
Certain expenses and investment income that were previously reported as part of PC Other have been allocated to
Commercial and Consumer to be consistent with how we manage the business. The total Commercial segment pre-tax
operating income was $1.2 billion in the quarter, driven by improved property casualty and favorable mortgage
insurance results, offset by weaker returns in our Institutional Markets business.
Beginning on slide 12 with Property Casualty results, the quarter benefited from lower cat and severe losses and
improved operating efficiency. Net premiums written, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and return premiums
on loss-sensitive business, declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to our continued underwriting
discipline in U.S. Casualty. This was partially offset by new business growth in Financial Lines and Property.
Financial Lines grew in all regions, and importantly in targeted growth areas such as multinational, small business, and
M&A. Property grew in all regions and segments outside of the U.S., particularly middle-market property and highly
engineered risk. Our intense focus on enhancing customer service in these lines, for example, engineering and loss
control services, is increasingly becoming a differentiator for AIG.
Overall, rate change from the prior-year quarter was essentially flat. Rate change in U.S. Financial Lines was just over
2%, while in U.S. Specialty, it was up about 2% as well. U.S. Property rates were down nearly 6% in the quarter.
Outside of the U.S., overall Property Casualty rates decreased slightly. With respect to the rate environment, our
management of business mix, enhanced pricing and risk selection tools, and improved claim service gives us
confidence in the accident year loss ratio trends and continued growth in risk-adjusted profitability.
For the full year, the accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 65.6%, or roughly flat from last year, following a period of
positive improvement. In the quarter, we experienced modest elevated attritional loss activity in our short tail lines.
General operating expenses improved in the quarter, primarily due to efficiencies from organizational realignment
initiatives, partially offset by investments in technology, engineering, and analytics.
The structure of our corporate cat placement was consistent with the prior year but procured at an improved rate. We
also continued our strategy of accessing the capital markets, entering into our third cat bond transaction, which totaled
$500 million in new issuance. This new bond offering was met with substantial investor interests. Collectively, our
current cat bonds provide $925 million of indemnity protection.
Net investment income for the quarter declined 7% from the same period last year to $1.1 billion, reflecting the impact
of lower new money yields, lower invested assets, and reduced contribution from alternative investments. Net
investment income for the quarter included approximately $100 million of income from a rights offering in AIG's
strategic investment in PICC.
Turning to slide 13, Mortgage Guaranty reported another strong quarter of operating performance, with operating
income of $171 million. Mortgage Guaranty benefited from decreased first-lien losses, an increase in first-lien
premiums earned, and a second-lien litigation settlement. The improvement in the loss ratio also included $30 million
of favorable prior-year reserve development. Mortgage Guaranty remains an important part of our operations given its
strong returns and its strategic insights into the residential mortgage market.

Turning to slide 14, Institutional markets pre-tax operating income declined to $118 million for the quarter, primarily
due to lower investment returns on alternative investments. The decrease in net investment income was partially offset
by higher fee income, driven by growth in assets under management primarily from the stable value wrap business.
Premiums and deposits in the quarter grew from the same period last year.
Now, with regard to 2015, we expect modest growth in the aggregate as we continue to optimize our business mix. We
also anticipate an additional 1 to 2 point improvement in the Property Casualty accident year loss ratio in 2015 from
ongoing execution of value-based initiatives, progress in underwriting and claims excellence, and expectations for
improved short tail losses, although I would caution that results can vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of
the short tail business.
We also expect to achieve improved operating efficiency while making investments in technology, engineering, and
analytics. And as David mentioned, we see this quarter's decline in net investment income as a trend that will likely to
continue into 2015 as our loss reserves decline, and we continue to invest in this interest rate environment.
To sum it up, the Commercial team continues to advance its strategic initiatives and to build on the momentum to
become our customers' most valued insurer.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin to discuss the Consumer results.
Kevin T. Hogan
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from our revised financial presentation, our Consumer
results now bring together all of AIG's insurance products and services for consumers whether individual or
group-based contracts that were previously reported in the Life and Retirement and Property Casualty segments.
We've created this global consumer platform with the broad distribution reach under a common leadership team, and
remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities including our targeted growth strategy.
In the fourth quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Ageas Protect Limited, a leading provider of life protection
products in the UK, and entered into an agreement to acquire Laya Healthcare, an Ireland-based healthcare company,
which we expect to close in the second quarter of 2015. These acquisitions will help drive continued expansion of our
consumer portfolio of insurance solutions designed to meet consumer needs for financial, health, and retirement
security.
We believe Ageas will help strengthen our capability in the UK where we already offer personal accident, health and
travel insurance coverage to consumers as well as customized insurance solutions for high-net-worth individuals
through AIG Private Client Group. Laya Healthcare serves more than 23% of the Irish private health market, offering
life, dental, and travel insurance as well as health and wellness coverage, which nicely rounds out our available
products in Ireland, and provides a platform for expansion into health insurance in select additional markets around the
globe. Combined, our Consumer businesses delivered $923 million of operating earnings during the quarter. I will
cover highlights for each of our three operating segments and share some views on 2015.
Before discussing results for the quarter for our retirement businesses, which begins on slide 16, I wanted to remind
you that as part of our re-segmentation, we revised our presentation of retirement results to reclassify a portion of
policy fees along with the related portion of DAC amortization from operating income to non-operating income.
This reclassification of policy fees, which relates primarily to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit embedded
derivatives in our variable annuity products, offsets the fees from these embedded derivatives with the associated
change in fair value of such derivative liabilities. This reclassification reduced pre-tax operating income for the full
year of 2014 by a total of $215 million or roughly $50 million per quarter but had no effect on GAAP net income. We
believe this treatment is in line with current industry practice.
Operating income for Retirement was $722 million for the quarter and reflected growth in fee income resulting from
higher assets under management and a decline in net investment income. Policy fees rose from their prior year quarter

on growth in assets under management driven principally by strong net flows and variable annuities and retirement
income solutions, and market appreciation.
The decline in net investment income was driven primarily by lower returns on alternative investments as well as the
decline in base yields as reinvestment rates are below the weighted average yield of the overall portfolio. At current
levels, we would expect a 4- to 6-basis-point quarterly decline in base yields. We also expect net investment income to
be lower in 2015 by approximately $200 million due to the significant distributions of excess capital to parent in 2014.
Turning to slide 17, the quarter benefited from effective spread management achieved through disciplined new business
pricing and active management of crediting rates. The outflow of older policies which carry higher crediting rates than
current rates offered has also contributed to reducing our cost of funds, which we have reduced in both fixed annuities
and group retirement over the last 12 months. Assets under management ended the year at $224 billion, 3% higher than
a year ago, driven by the strong variable annuity net flows and overall separate account investment performance,
partially offset by net outflows in fixed annuities and group retirement.
Net flows for fixed annuities have been affected by the low interest rate environment. We expect that sales of fixed
annuities, although up on a sequential basis, will remain challenged in the current low interest rate environment as we
continue to maintain new business pricing discipline. We also experienced two large group surrenders in our group
retirement business related to retirement plan consolidations, which we believe are part of the normal competitive
pressures in this business. In addition, recent market results suggest pressure on new sales of variable annuities,
although our index annuity sales continued to gain momentum and macro trends continued to support growing
customer need for quality income solutions.
Slide 18 presents results for our Global Life business, which now includes Fuji Life in Japan. Life pre-tax operating
income of $80 million decreased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a charge of $104 million in the
fourth quarter to increase reserves for incurred but not reported death claims that David mentioned earlier. This reserve
reflects continuing efforts related to a previously disclosed multi-state audit and market conduct examination from
2011.
The decrease in pre-tax operating income also reflected a decline in net investment income compared to the fourth
quarter of 2013 primarily from lower alternative investment returns as well as a decline in base yields. With respect to
Life sales, Japan delivered good growth with a 4% increase in sales from the fourth quarter last year and a 7% increase
in premiums. For the full year, Japan represented almost half of the new business sales for our Global Life business.
Life Insurance in force reached over $1 trillion at the end of the year, more than 9% higher than prior year on both
organic growth and the acquisition of Ageas Protect.
Turning to slide 19, Personal Insurance reported operating income of $121 million, which reflects improved
underwriting income from a year ago, partially offset by lower net investment income. Net premiums written grew 2%
from the same quarter a year ago excluding the effects of foreign exchange. We saw growth in the Automobile and
Personal Property lines of business, partially offset by declines in certain classes of accident and health business as a
result of our focus on maintaining underwriting discipline in pricing and terms and conditions.
The Personal Insurance accident year loss ratio as adjusted was 52.1% for the quarter and 6.1 points lower than the
same quarter a year ago, reflecting improvements across all lines of business. Improvement in the accident year loss
ratio for our U.S. Warranty Programs business was offset by an increase in related profit-sharing arrangements, which
increased the acquisition ratio. We continued to experience lower-than-expected losses in Japan Automobile, which
benefited from reduced frequency, and across the portfolio, both catastrophe and severe loss experience were better
than our expectations. Looking ahead to 2015, we believe that the full-year 2014 accident year loss ratio, excluding
impact of cats and severe losses, is more indicative of our expectations for personal insurance than the current quarter
ratio.
The general operating expense ratio declined 1.7 points from a year ago, primarily due to efficiencies from
organizational realignment initiatives, partially offset by increased technology-related expenses. While we are pleased
that we have begun to see benefits from our initiatives thus far, as David mentioned, we are focusing on delivering on

further operational efficiencies as we move forward.
Our Japan integration initiative is an important part of this story given the size and scale of our Japanese operations.
We currently estimate that Japan integration costs will amount to $150 million in 2015 consistent with previous
disclosure. However, as the final date of merger is subject to approval by the relevant authorities, specific timing of
benefits to emerge remains uncertain. We are carefully managing every aspect of this complex initiative, and remain on
track to deliver an internal rate of return on this investment that will exceed AIG's hurdle rates and achieve a return in
the low double digits.
We have already begun to see certain benefits arising out of these investments such as the recent launch of a new
agency front-end system that is now available to over 1,500 agents, and will be expanded across our distribution
network in the coming months.
To close, for our Consumer businesses, we remained focused on managing growth, profitability, and risk by executing
on our strategies, maintaining a prudent risk profile, and emphasizing capital-efficient growth opportunities.
Now, I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up for Q&A.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you. Operator, could we open the line for questions, please?
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thank you. So, Kevin, just following up on what you just said now, on the Consumer loss
ratio, the full year being more indicative than the fourth quarter. The expense ratio was higher in the fourth quarter than
in the full year. So, kind of, if you juxtapose those two, that would imply that personal lines you would be running over
100%. Is that where you expect to be running that business or is there something on the expense side that we should be
considering where 4Q may not be a good starting point? Thanks.
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: No. We're not anticipating running this business over 100%. We anticipate overall continuing
improvement in the expenses in Personal Insurance associated with the efficiencies that we have gained. And in terms
of loss ratio, there was better-than-expected experience this year, particularly with respect to Japan automobile. And so,
it's that particularly anomaly that we don't anticipate to repeat in 2015.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: I got it. Thanks. And then maybe, Peter, the $650 million – or maybe David, the $650
million that you – or so that you talked about in investment in 2014, could we get an idea of what that was in the prior
year and what have been the returns that you have seen? So, the expense saves that you've generated from the
investment so far just to get an idea of sort of how that process is tracking.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Sure. We didn't discuss 2013 because it's a bit of – the comparison is not really one-for-one
because there are many projects and initiatives that we're doing in 2014 that we're not in existence in 2013, so it's a bit
of apples and oranges, so to speak.
So, the returns that are coming out – again, varying stages. So, for example, the biggest items in there are, for example,
our movement to shared services, the Japan initiative, and certainly the shared services in some of the finance
functions. Those are the biggest ticket items. So, we're beginning to see payback in each one of those at various stages.
Again, some come sooner than others. The finance centers have more immediate payback. It's closer to a near – within
one year of the spend, you're seeing the initiatives. So, we haven't quantified the exact benefit yet, but again, it's going
to vary by each one of those projects.

<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think the important theme is that we've set expense targets that we just disclosed on a net
basis. So, effectively, we are maintaining and increasing the level of investments while reducing the net number by 3%
to 5%. So, the business-as-usual expense is declining faster than 3% to 5% as we step up the level of investment on
return – on projects where we feel comfortable that we have a good expected return above our hurdle rate. So, we're not
sacrificing long-term growth and efficiency in order to get this net expense reduction.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. Great. And then just connecting, David, your comments on deployment this year, the
$6 billion to $7 billion, just trying to square that to the buyback authorization of $2.5 billion. So, is the expectation that
you put the buyback authorization out, you exhaust it at some point this year, and then continue increasing or putting up
new authorizations as you go through?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well, as I've said, the expectation for the full year is $6 billion to $7 billion both in total for
share repurchase and shareholder dividends. And again, I made reference to a more dynamic approach. So, we wanted
to reflect the very robust distributions to the holding company, and importantly, the reduction in risk in our P&C
business. And so we increased the amount of authorization – or asked for authorization – the amount of authorization
we asked for to the first quarter. So, we will deploy that as appropriate, and then, again, based on facts and
circumstances, seek additional approvals throughout the year.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. Thanks. And just last quick one. Any impact from energy-related investments on
either private equity returns, book value that we should think about just given the three-month lag in private equity.
Thanks.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: No, nothing material.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions. One is in the U.S. Consumer business, and I know
the acquisition expense ratio was up because of these profit-sharing commissions, but the loss ratio, relative to the past
couple of quarters actually didn't get better. And so, was there some sort of catch-up in that number? What kind of
acquisition ratio should we expect going forward? It was a bit different than where you had been running.
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Yeah, Jay. Thanks. The sequence of loss ratio improvement is not substantive, but
year-over-year, it is substantive. And the profit share is, of course, a look-back mechanism. And so, I think where we
are right now, we've restructured the underlying programs in the U.S. warranty business essentially instituting
deductible and other risk management arrangements which will change the profile of the loss ratio and acquisition ratio
over time.
<Q - Jay Arman Cohen>: Got it. And then secondly, the comment about a 1- to 2-point accident year loss ratio
improvement, I guess, on the Commercial side for 2015, and I guess it was John that said that, can you kind of discuss
the drivers of that improvement?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Sure, Jay. It's mix of business, really being the primary lever. It's also increased confidence in
some of the risk selection and pricing tools we've implemented over the course of the last several years. It's from
improved claim service, outside of – primarily outside of the United States. We made big investments in our claims
team and claim technology to improve how we run off the results outside of the U.S.
And then lastly, we expect the short tail losses which as I mentioned were slightly elevated this year, the attritional
short tail losses to move back to a more normal state. So, it's a combination of those things. But as I also noted, given

Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you and good morning. First for David, the lock up of the AerCap shares begins to expire
this month, and I heard that you made a mentioned that $6 billion to $7 billion of share repurchase and dividend in
2015 didn't include monetization of non-core assets? So I was hoping you can update us on your view in terms of when
or if you can start to sell down that AerCap stake of $4 billion? Thanks.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Sure. The if part is pretty easy. It's per the contractual lock-ups which the first one-third
expire actually next week. That's the if – or that's the how we could. We haven't commented on the monetization of this
non-core asset. I'll maybe ask Peter to share his views and perspective on it. As we have done before – or said before, it
doesn't change our view of this as a non-core asset, but we want to – we'll be very thoughtful as we think about
maximizing value for our shareholders. So, Peter, anything you want to add to that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that we've had a good track record over the last five years of making very thoughtful
disposal decisions in the light of the value that we could realize, and a patient approach to disposing of this non-core
asset is what we think makes sense. It's quite accretive to our coverage ratio from a ratings perspective. And in our
stress tests, while as a concentrated equity position, on the face of it, it would seem like a hot potato, I would not
describe it that way because we have extremely comfortable capital cushions from a stress-testing perspective.
So, I think we have time on our side, but we recognize it's a non-core asset. And if we receive a favorable offer for it, of
course we will dispose of it, and then redeploy that capital to our core operations.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: All right. That makes sense. Then on the ROE expectation, if I think about 50 basis points of
improvement starting at a 7.4% level for this year, normalized, I'm just trying to get a qualitative perspective of why,
Peter, you and the Board feel that that's adequate to potentially not get to 9% before even 2017?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, we have a long-term goal of getting north of 10%, as I stated, and most importantly,
getting it above our cost of capital. And so, we look at the interaction of what we're doing to reduce our cost of capital,
in particular derisking the company and focusing the quality of earnings on really repeatable sources. So, sure, we
could get to the target quicker, but it would probably be at the expense of sustainability of earnings, quality of earnings,
and we've judged that this is an appropriate pace that continues to demonstrate our commitment to improving returns
while doing so in a sustainable way. And so, we've made careful trade-offs to improve the returns and to be very
transparent about that process.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: All right, and then last one. On the Life risk-based capital ratio, currently 490%. When we hear
from other large life insurers like MET and Prudential, they're targeting more in the 400% to 450% range. So, I'm
wondering if you still might have more room to bring down that RBC in the Life business.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Thank you, Jay. As we have said, I think in the past, our range, target range is somewhere in
that business between 425% and 470%. That's a range. So, we're at 490%. We've taken very substantial amounts of
capital out of those companies. So, the short answer is yes, we still have more room to reduce that. But again, we're
pretty clear and we're clear with all our stakeholders what that range is, and we're going to be very methodical and
measured about how we do that. But we've made clear what our range is. We've obviously taken very substantial steps
to get close to that. Remember last year, we were north of 560% or 568% a year ago. So, we've taken meaningful steps,
so I think those actions should give you some sense of how we're thinking about it.

<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you.

Moving on, we'll take our next question that will come from Adam Klauber from William Blair.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. Good morning. The retirement in Life, generally it was a weaker quarter or income
was lower than it's been really over the last five or seven quarters. Should we think about this as more of a typical
quarter or should we think about it, look at the context of those segments more on an annual basis versus the fourth
quarter?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Look, I think, I mean, a part of the difference in the income came from
the performance in the alternatives and partnerships, which I think is kind of a normal course of the business. We have
seen a little bit of yield compression, but nothing unusual in this quarter. We did have the IBNR reserve, the ongoing
activities from 2011 associated with the identification of policyholders and beneficiaries, which is a process involving a
third-party vendor that provides us information. We have to engage in the matches, and as that process comes to near a
conclusion, we have to respond to the matches that are occurring and the identification of those policyholders. A lot of
these are very small face amount policies. A lot of them can go back a number of years and matching is not an
automated process. And those are some of the anomalies.
As I mentioned that the current rate environment, and by that, assuming a 10-year T around 1.80%, this is where we
expect a drift of 4 to 6 basis points per quarter in the base yields. That's a trend that will depend upon what the future
rate environment is.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay. And then in group retirement, you mentioned a couple large accounts left or were
consolidated. Do you think there'll be more of those, or are they one-off? And did that have any impact on the quarterly
financials?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: So, we don't – first of all, I think it's important to note, we don't anticipate a substantial impact
on earnings from these larger cases. And with respect to the larger cases, they don't always come up for revisitation.
We see nothing on the horizon at this juncture. Of course, we can't anticipate where consolidations may occur. And as
you know, there are consolidations in a number of industries especially healthcare associated with the recent
developments in those industries. So, we do see them as part of a normal aspect of the environment, and they are
essentially one-off items.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay. And then in the Commercial Insurance on the P&C side, we saw good progress on the
expense ratio. You mentioned you're going to continue to work toward that but in investments. So, again, it's – is this
year, is the progress we've seen this year better than we can expect going forward, or is it possible to see that type of
progress go forward on the expense ratio?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: As I mentioned in my opening comments, Adam, we'll see some GOE improvement next year. I
don't anticipate that it will get the same dollar amount that we improved during 2014, and, of course, the ratio will
depend on other factors. But we do expect to continue to get more efficient.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question. It will be from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi. Good morning. So, Peter, thank you. I appreciate – I think we all appreciate the clarity in
your goals. And I wanted to spend just a minute or two talking about them. Like Jay, I guess I'm kind of surprised
about the pace of recovery that's implied by the bridge to 10%. And I wonder – I mean, first of all, make sure we

understand that.
But I also wonder more fundamentally, why is AIG's long-term goal only at 10%? I mean, if I try to put this simply,
many of your monoline peers in Life and P&C all consistently generate solid mid-teens ROEs. Why shouldn't
something higher be the long-term aspirational target? I mean, is there's something about the business mix or
infrastructure challenges or capital requirements that's really going to be a permanent headwind for the company or is
this something we just need to be patient, and we're going to see upside to these goals over time?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I think that given where we're starting from, to speculate beyond three years is
challenging. The 10% in an environment if we have persistent deflationary pressures, low inflation and low investment
yields, in our view, is actually quite comfortably above what the cost of capital is likely to be at that point. So, our goal,
as we say, in overall terms is to have sustainable ROE above our cost of capital, which is also a function of our risk
level.
And so, if others are running at much higher ROEs, I suspect it is because they choose to run their balance sheets with
more leverage and are willing to take more risk, and we think that we would like to position the company as a very
balanced portfolio of diversified risk so that we can weather swings in the pricing cycles, swings in the economic
cycles and be opportunistic in times of crisis where we think that there are tremendous one-off opportunities to add
value.
And I think that maximizing ROE inhibits that financial flexibility but making sure that the ROE is comfortably above
the cost of equity of the company, and from sustainable sources, as opposed to short-term risk-taking of any kind. So,
we are very committed to improving the quality as well as the quantity of earnings and being transparent about that
shift of mix.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. I'm wondering if we could – just briefly similar sort of concept in a way thinking about
sort of focus on returns in the environment. I think you guys disclosed pricing was down relatively notably in Property
and Commercial business. I think overall you guys were flattish. How do we think about you guys maintaining your
pricing discipline in the context of everything else you're trying to do when you're also still trying to grow? How do we
know sort of if you're going to focus on margins first and sort of long-term health of the franchise second?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I wanted to signal that very much in the $2.5 billion buyback because we talk about
one of the factors that led us to step up the pace of buyback was the fact that we had reduced risk in the business, and in
particular in Commercial. And that's because we walked away from certain property renewals where we felt we were
not getting adequately return – rewarded for risk. And so, what we're really saying is that being disciplined comes with
it, a sense that the capital that we have is precious and we will not deploy it if we're not getting an adequate return on it.
So, prompt return of capital that's not deployed at adequate ROEs is our way of demonstrating to you and internally
that we're not about volume, we're about value.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's great. Thanks for the clear signal.
Operator
And moving on, we'll take our next question that will come from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. I just had some questions about the early debt retirement and
when it occurred. Was there some debt that you retired in the quarter that already paid a coupon during the quarter, or
more succinctly, can we look at the 4Q run rate of interest expense as at this point a benchmark for looking into 2015?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Josh, it's David. As I said in my opening remarks, we expect, based on our full-year
expectation, to have interest expense of around or just inside of $1.1 billion. So, again, you can look at the fourth
quarter as a reasonable proxy for that level.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: For 1Q, and then go down from there?

<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. And just so – again, that's why I'm trying to give a level of insight. I think it's important
to note that our leverage ratios are very much inside our target area, our target zone, and matter of fact on the low side
of that. So, I think we've got plenty of financial flexibility, but we are obviously focused on balancing leverage and are
covered. So, I think those are the critical points you should take away.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Great. And on the incurred but not reported death claims, there were related charges taken
both in 2Q 2011 and 4Q 2011. What solace should investors take that we're getting close to getting this as an issue
that's behind them?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Well, that's true. I mean, this has been an ongoing process of working with the new process for
identifying deceased policyholders and their beneficiaries. We have much more experience now with the vendor and
with the matching process, and we went through an extensive analysis. We're getting down to the last, I think,
processes with the vendor, and we have some insight into what we believe is going to be coming in the matching
process in the future. So, right now, this is our best estimate of what we think will bring us to the conclusion of this
process. But until we get the files from the vendor and engage in the physical matching, we can't provide a 100%
guarantee.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And that charge includes the interest on unpaid claims that's accrued since that time?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Yes, it does. In fact, that was an aspect of one of the reserve increases that you noted before.
And so, we do fully incorporate interest in the reserve.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Good morning and thank you. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on
what's going on at VALIC. I understand the large cases that were lost. But I guess in particular, it appears you've been
pretty aggressive in managing crediting rates, and I'm wondering if maybe that is having an impact on the business just
recognizing the flow of surrender activity and overall flows. And it also seems like the ROA has been trending down as
well. So, maybe just an update on the health of that business.
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Actually, we consider the health of the Group Retirement business actually quite strong. We
continue to recruit advisors. We have had, I think, good success with the process of expanding some of the product
portfolio that we're able to represent in that business. And while it is true, we are and we continue to be disciplined in
our new business pricing, we don't see the loss of these large cases as relevant to that. We continue to invest in this
business.
We invest in our record keeping capabilities, and also our advisory capabilities. And we're also introducing a kind of a
retirement information center to help educate our customers there. The most important part of the margins in this
business are in the smaller and medium-size cases and in the ongoing contributions. So, we do not get necessarily
distracted by some of the consolidations that occurred in the large case area.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: So, other than the large case activity, it's pretty much business as usual there?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: It's certainly a competitive environment, and we are monitoring very carefully the
developments in that business. But like I said, we continue to invest in that business, and we are comfortable where we
are. Clearly, the yield environment is something that impacts that business as well. And we are investing in substantial
technology to improve our position.

<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Great. And then just finally, on the Life RBC ratio, was the decline for the year driven
entirely by dividends up to the parent or were there any adjustments made for low interest rates as well?
<A - David L. Herzog>: The short answer is no. That's – substantially all of the decrease in the RBC was related to the
dividend flows. We did provide additional reserves for cash flow testing. But those were insignificant relative to the
rest of the decline from distributions.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Operator, I think we only have time for one more question, please.
Operator
Certainly. We'll take, then, our final question from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Good morning. Peter, I just wanted to ask you a few questions about your 9% ROE
goal for 2017. Should we view that as a – is that a goal? Is that a plan? What are you contemplating for interest rates?
Does that assume rising interest rates, flat? Can you just give a little color there?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So, first of all, I wouldn't describe it as a goal. Our goal is – our broadest goal is to have a
sustainable ROE comfortably above our cost of equity. And secondly, we've restated our long-term goal of 10%. The
forecast, which is what I provided, over the next three years, a 50-basis-point improvement per year is premised on an
interest rate environment that reflects the forward curve in the market. So, whether the market's right or wrong, your
guess is as good as mine. We tend to run a fairly carefully matched duration book of the company. Don't speculate on
interest rates, but I think that the interest rate assumption that we've used in our financial planning is based on the
forward curve.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. And this is just an editorial comment by me, but I think one thing being lost
here is the fact that you also mentioned you're expecting 10% book value growth. So, I would just comment that 50
basis points of improvement per year with 10% book value growth is actually a pretty solid level of earnings growth
implied, for whatever that's worth.
David, and just to clarify, if I understood your comments correctly, the $2.5 billion buyback authorization is expected
to be the pace in 1Q. And then should we then expect a fall-off – I assume that's funded by the excess that was taken
out of the Life company and then should we expect a fall-off to get to that, I guess, $6 billion to $7 billion of total
capital return including dividends for the balance of the year? Is that the right pace to think about?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Tom, it's Peter. I think that the concept of the buyback being funded is I think combining
solvency risk with liquidity risk in a way that I wouldn't. As you noticed in the last quarter, we issued a substantial
amount of very long-term debt at a very effective level, so we have comfortable liquidity in the holding company. And
so, as we look at this scale of buyback, it's not really constrained by liquidity. It's really driven by risk.
And so, as we look at how the risk profile of the company changes, the RBC levels and dividends up from the
subsidiaries is simply one indicator of enterprise risk. But the more we, the rating agencies and the Fed, look at the
company as one combined enterprise, we start to see that we have substantial capacity to cope with the risk level of the
company because the company has been substantially derisked over the last five years, and we continue to derisk the
company.
And as I mentioned earlier, as we exercise discipline in terms of new business writing, we may find, if the pricing
environment in the P&C side is softer, further capacity because of less risk, that may not be reflected in the short term
in RBC ratios. So, I just want to make sure that we recognize this is not literally dollar-for-dollar funding. It's
separating the liquidity management, which is comfortable with a view towards managing enterprise risk well within
our risk appetite.

<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Understood, Peter, on the sources and uses comment. Am I right about the pace
though that you all expect?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So, I think that the pace you can infer from David's $6 billion to $7 billion for the full year
which would suggest that it's a somewhat accelerated pace in the first quarter. But reminding yourself that it excludes
any non-core asset disposals or accelerated unwind of the DIB.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks. And then one last one. Kevin, one thing that stood out in your
businesses was a pretty strong improvement in International. There was a drop off in revenues, but then margins also
picked up. Can you explain what was happening there?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Well, I think, Tom, an important part of the improvement does come from Japan. And we
have been working on the overall rate adequacy in that environment in addition to enjoying an unusual year with
respect to the automobile loss ratio, that was a feature of a change in the way of non-claim discount bonuses work,
that's actually driven down frequency for the entire market. And then the fuel prices which ironically were high at the
time also reduced the amount of driving, and that led to a substantial improvement there.
I think in terms of revenue, there is an underlying improvement in our growth, but it is not as dramatic as the
improvement in the loss ratio as we've instituted many of similar underwriting tools as to what Commercial has
successfully used over the last couple of years.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. And so, it's Japan auto driving the improvement. So, is this – do you think
this is a good new run rate? Would you expect continued margin improvement from here?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: The Japan auto is unusual in that the prices of fuel were high. They are not anticipated to stay
high, so we do not expect frequency to stay that low. But, Tom, the improvement in the underwriting actually comes
across the board. It's not limited to Japan. The implementation of the tools that I mentioned are having an impact on
rate adequacy and portfolio quality across the board as we actively manage the portfolios. So, don't anticipate the loss
ratio as of fourth quarter as a run rate. There's a number of anomalies. We had a very benign cat environment, severe
losses below our expectations and also the unusual situation in Japan.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Okay.
