answering your questions.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mary.
Mary T. Barra
Thanks, Randy. And thanks to everyone joining us today.
It's an understatement to say that the first quarter was challenging for General Motors. As you know, we recalled
approximately 7 million vehicles in North America and we face economic instability in some markets across the globe.
Nevertheless, the company remained profitable and I'm very proud of the way the team has kept its focus on the
customer. Not a day goes by that we don't act on and do what we think is best for our customers, what they need and
what they deserve when they buy a GM product.
I will touch on all of these points as I review the quarter and update you on the status of the ignition switch issue. After
that, Chuck Stevens will take you deeper into our results. Then we will answer as many of your questions as we can.
If you turn to slide 2, you'll see a summary of our first quarter results. To begin, we delivered 2.4 million vehicles
around the world, up 2%. Sales in Europe were up and we saw record sales in China. This was offset by lower sales in
North America and South America and in GMIO outside of China.
Our global market share was 11.1%, which is down 0.2 points from a year ago. However, Opel/Vauxhall gained share
in 10 European markets, including Germany. We also gained 0.1 points of market share in China thanks to the growth
of Cadillac and the ongoing success of the Buick and Wuling brands.
Turning to net income, we earned approximately $100 million despite the $1.3 billion pre-tax charge for product recalls
and a $400 million special item due to a change in the exchange rate which we use to measure the financial statements
at our Venezuelan subsidiary.
Looking next at our EBIT-adjusted results, we earned $500 million in the quarter. EBIT-adjusted in North America was
$600 million, which is down from the $1.4 billion we earned a year ago. The decline is more than explained by the $1.3
billion recall-related charge.
Europe incurred incremental restructuring expense this quarter versus a year ago and lost money, as expected.
However, Opel/Vauxhall is getting stronger. For example, revenue in the region was up 7% and Opel's revenue was up
9% and operating losses have been reduced.
Looking down the road, we continue to be encouraged by improving customer sentiment and economic growth in the
U.K. and key Eurozone markets. All of this keeps us on track to achieve breakeven results by mid-decade.
In China, our equity income was up about 9% compared to a year ago. However, our consolidated international
operations lost money. Stefan Jacoby and his team are actively addressing the issues in this part of the business and we
expect improved performance as we move forward.
GM South America lost money in the quarter due primarily to restructuring costs in Brazil and the ongoing challenges
of Venezuela. Once again, GM Financial delivered strong results, earning $200 million before tax. And finally, our
adjusted automotive free cash flow was $200 million, which is significantly up from a year ago.
Let's turn to slide 3, where we have summarized highlights from the quarter. They include a common stock dividend
and other examples that underscore the momentum we have in key markets around the world. As I mentioned earlier,
GM sales in China set a new record in the first quarter and our 2014 deliveries surpassed 1 million units early in April.
This is the earliest that we have moved into the seven-figure range.
Buick and Wuling are doing particularly well, and Cadillac sales more than doubled. At Chevrolet, we expect sales
growth to accelerate with the introduction of the new Trax crossover, which launches this quarter. The Trax is a key

product because crossover and SUV demand in China is expected to grow at about a 10% annual rate and reach about 7
million units by 2020.
In Europe, our improving market position can be traced directly to the Opel Mokka and our new Insignia flagship.
Cumulative Mokka orders have now surpassed 215,000 units since its launch in the fall of 2012 and the Insignia has
topped 85,000 units since its launch in the fall of 2013.
In the United States, meanwhile, we earned record average transaction prices in the quarter, which reflects a significant
5,000 year-over-year increase in full-size pickup ATP, according to J.D. Power PIN estimates. Per our plan, we are
selling a much richer mix of crew cab and premium-contented trucks today than we were just a year ago.
We are also starting to see the benefit of the new heavy-duty Chevrolet and GMC pickups that launched in the first
quarter along with our all-new full-size SUV. I know many of you are concerned that negative publicity surrounding
our recent recalls will slow our momentum in the United States. Although it is early, it appears we have not
experienced a meaningful impact on sales and we continue to be optimistic about 2014 because our award-winning new
products are performing well and we have more on the way.
Our dealers are an important part of this equation as well and we just received more third-party proof of just how good
they are. In its 2014 U.S. Customer Service Index study, J.D. Power ranked all four GM brands above industry average.
Not only that, Cadillac was the highest-ranked luxury brand and Buick was the highest-ranked mainstream brand.
Okay, let's talk more about the recall. I want to begin by stating in no uncertain terms that the ignition switch recall and
the factors led up to it are unacceptable to me, to my leadership team and to our Board of Directors. It doesn't matter if
the roots of the issue are more than a decade old. This leadership team is responsible for making things right and we
will.
To get the job done, we have assembled a cross-functional team of experts to focus on the recall issue so the rest of the
organization can drive the business forward. The recall team is being thorough, aggressive and proactive on behalf of
our customers and our stakeholders.
As you know, former U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas is leading our internal investigation and his investigation is on
track. When the facts are in, we will be transparent and we will hold ourselves accountable. I also expect to have
recommendations from Kenneth Feinberg in approximately the next 45 days. Mr. Feinberg's counsel will help us
evaluate our legal and civic duties. We will work through the issues and update you as soon as we can.
As has already been reported, we began repairing vehicles earlier this month and we expect our ability to supply repair
parts will continue to increase throughout the spring and summer. Consistent with our recent communication to
NHTSA, our plan is to produce enough repair parts by October 2014 to have the ability to repair the majority of
vehicles impacted by the ignition switch and ignition cylinder recall.
Until their vehicles are repaired, we have advised customers to remove all items from their key rings, leaving only the
vehicle key. The key fob should also be removed. We have conducted more than 80 individual ignition switch tests to
demonstrate that the vehicles can be driven safely if these steps are followed. We have also advised customers that
when they exit their car to make sure it is in park or, for manual transmissions, in reverse gear with the parking brake
on.
Of course our dealers are empowered to put people in courtesy vehicles or rental cars, if that is the right thing to do for
the customer. To date, GM has provided more than 36,000 loaner or rental vehicles through our dealerships. Based on
the expected timing of customers coming to the dealership, the need for loaners should be significantly reduced by the
end of the third quarter. The cost to replace the ignition switches and the cylinder and pay for the loaner cars accounts
for about $700 million of the charge we took in the quarter. The balance of the charge is for the other recalls we
announced in that quarter as well.
The overarching objectives for this recall are to repair the cars as quickly as we can and win back the full trust and
confidence of our customers, our regulators and other stakeholders. That's why GM's goal is to have the best product
safety practices in the industry.

In July 2012, we simplified our product development leadership structure to remove silos and complexity. In January
2013, we launched a comprehensive program to retool our product quality and durability validation process.
To accelerate our drive to leadership, we organized and restructured our global product development team during the
last six weeks. In March, we promoted Jeff Boyer to the new position of Vice President for Global Vehicle Safety, and
he is leading a stronger, more aligned and cohesive global safety organization.
Jeff's job includes oversight of the safety development process for GM's vehicle systems, the confirmation and
validation of safety performance and the post-sale safety activities, such as recalls. His team will also be creating new
methods and analytical tools to help us identify safety concerns earlier and assess them more effectively.
We also know that a big target of putting the safest vehicles on the road is to ensure we have a culture where every
employee knows they can bring vehicle safety issues and other ideas forward. This led us to create the Speak Up for
Safety program, which launches in May.
For Speak Up for Safety, we will recognize employees for ideas that could make our vehicles safer. We will also
recognize them for speaking up when they see something that could impact customer safety. The program will include
a global 24/7 hotline and a micro site dedicated to vehicle safety. This will provide a direct conduit to our safety
organization and our problem tracking system to ensure a closed-loop reporting and review process.
This week we also rolled out fundamental changes in the way we develop vehicles. Going forward, our Global Vehicle
Engineering organization will consist of a Global Vehicle Components and Subsystems team and a Global Product
Integrity team. The objective is to improve cross-systems integration and deliver more consistent performance across
vehicle programs and ensure functional safety and compliance of all our vehicles. As Mark Reuss said when
announcing the restructuring, a vehicle is a collection of 30,000 individual parts. Fully integrating those parts into a
cohesive system with industry-leading safety and quality is the key to winning in this customer-driven business.
Finally, we will now require all engineers to have their Design for Six Sigma black belts by the end of 2015. I hope you
can see that all of these changes and initiatives will help us accelerate the momentum we carried into this year and
throughout the quarter. For sure, there have been setbacks. That's part of our business.
Nevertheless, our overall progress has been sure and steady. Our cars, trucks and crossovers are winning awards and
new customers around the world. Our product launch team is going to make us an even more formidable competitor as
we move forward and out largest and most profitable regions are strong. The parts of the business that have weighed
down our results are turning around and third parties are recognizing something we have known for a long time: we
have great dealers who deliver exceptional customer service. This is the payout for years of hard work and it shows in
the resiliency that our company now has.
With that, I'd like to invite Chuck Stevens to take you through the quarter in a bit more detail.
Charles K. Stevens
Thanks, Mary. Slide 6 provides a summary of our first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the
period was $37.4 billion, up $500 million due primarily to the acquisition of Ally international business, while
automotive revenue was flat year-over-year. Our operating income decreased to a loss of $500 million primarily due to
the $1.3 billion charge associated with product recalls and the Venezuela currency devaluation charge of $400 million.
Net income to common stockholders declined $700 million to $100 million and our diluted earnings per share came in
at $0.06.
Automotive net cash from operating activities was $2 billion, a $1.5 billion increase from the same period in 2013. For
our non-GAAP measures, including the impact of the $1.3 billion of recall-related charges, EBIT-adjusted was $500
million in the first quarter and the EBIT-adjusted margin was 1.2%. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $200
million for the quarter, a $1.6 billion increase from 2013 primarily due to improved working capital.

Slide 7 identifies special items for the first quarter that had an impact on our earnings per share. At the top of the slide,
our net income to common stockholders was $100 million and our diluted earnings per share was $0.06. As we advised
in our March sales filing with the SEC, we had a $400 million charge associated with the devaluation of the
Venezuelan bolivar in the first quarter of 2014 and a $200 million charge in the prior year's first quarter. This charge
had a $0.23 and $0.09 unfavorable impact on earnings per share in each of the quarters respectively.
On slide 8, we remind you of our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we
list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 1.2%, which includes the negative
impact of the $1.3 billion in recall-related charges and an unfavorable 3.5 percentage point impact on margins.
Consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.5 million vehicles in the first quarter, down about 5.5% from the prior
period. Our global market share decreased 0.2% to 11.1% for Q1 2014.
On slide 9, we provide an explanation of the $1.3 billion decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT-adjusted. We
earned $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to EBIT-adjusted of $500 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Volume was $400 million unfavorable, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in GMIO, GMSA, and GMNA. Mix
was $300 million unfavorable, primarily due to country mix in GMIO and product changeover in GM North America
associated with Q1 launches.
Price was $1.8 billion favorable due primarily to the strength of North America. Total costs were $2.1 billion
unfavorable due primarily to incremental recalled-related charges of $1.2 billion, increased material costs associated
with new products of approximately $1 billion, and $200 million in incremental restructuring costs.
Other was $400 million unfavorable, primarily due to foreign exchange. Slide 10 gives our year-over-year
EBIT-adjusted performance by segment. I would like to highlight that we changed our reporting structure to reclassify
the results of our Russian subsidiaries previously reported in our GMIO segment to our GME segment. The prior
periods have been revised for comparability.
GMNA EBIT-adjusted was down $900 million to $600 million in the quarter, including $1.3 billion in recall charges.
GME came in at a $300 million loss, including $200 million of incremental restructuring costs. GMIO decreased to
$300 million and GMSA recorded a loss of $200 million for the quarter.
GM Financial continued to deliver solid profitability with $200 million in earnings before taxes, and our corporate
sector was $100 million expense, for the total of $500 million EBIT-adjusted in the quarter.
We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 11. For
the first quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 17%. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis are up
marginally compared to the prior-year period.
On a percentage of ATP basis, our incentives for the quarter were 10.9%. This puts us at a 106% of industry average
levels for the first quarter of 2014. This is down from 115% of industry average in the prior-year period as we manage
through the sell-down of the prior generation of full-size trucks.
Turning to slide 12, we show GMNA's EBIT-adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide,
revenue in this segment of the business was $24.4 billion, up $1.4 billion from the same quarter in 2013. That's an
increase of over 6% driven by record average transaction prices. GMNA's EBIT-adjusted margin was 2.3% for the
quarter, which included the negative impact of 5.4% associated with recall-related charges.
Our U.S. dealer inventory was 815,000 units at the end of the first quarter, or about 83 days' supply, which is basically
flat on a day supply basis compared to the same period last year. GM North America's wholesale vehicle sales were
807,000 units for the quarter, a 22,000 unit decrease from the first quarter of 2013, and North American market share
came in at 16.5%.
On slide 13, we provide the explanation of the $900 million year-over-year decline in GMNA's EBIT-adjusted. GM
North America's EBIT-adjusted was $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2013. Volume was $100 million unfavorable

due to the lower wholesale vehicle sales. Mix was $100 million unfavorable primarily due to limited availability of
some of our full-sized SUVs, such as the Escalade, as many of the new models launched later in the quarter.
Price was $1.7 billion favorable, driven by recently launched products such as our full-sized trucks, Cadillac CTS and
Chevrolet Impala. Cost was unfavorable $2.3 billion, primarily due to $1.2 billion in incremental recall-related charges,
$1 billion in material costs associated primarily with recently launched products and increased promotional expenses
associated with the Winter Olympics. Other was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to FX. This nets to an
EBIT-adjusted of $600 million.
On slide 14, GME reported an EBIT-adjusted loss of $300 million for the first quarter, including $200 million of
incremental restructuring costs. Revenue was $5.6 billion for the quarter, up over $300 million and 6.6% due to the
success of our recently launched products and improving market conditions, as the industry increased 5.1% compared
to the prior year.
EBIT-adjusted margin in the segment was a negative 5.1%. Europe's wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were
291,000 units, up 16,000 units from the first quarter of 2013. Our European market share in the first quarter was 7.3%,
a slight decrease from the prior year driven primarily by the wind down of the Chevrolet brand.
On slide 15, we provide the major components of GME's $100 million year-over-year decrease in EBIT-adjusted.
Volume was favorable $100 million, driven by sales of the Opel Mokka and new Insignia flagship. The impact of mix
was flat quarter-over-quarter. Price was unfavorable $100 million as we continue to see competitive pressure in the
European market.
Cost was $100 million unfavorable as incremental restructuring costs of $200 million were partially offset by favorable
material performance. Other was flat quarter-over-quarter as the unfavorable FX impact of the Russian ruble was
mostly offset by the favorable impact of the British pound.
This totals to GME's EBIT-adjusted loss of $300 million for the first quarter of 2014. Overall, continued improvement,
all things considered. We now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 16. In the first
quarter of 2014, EBIT-adjusted was $300 million, including equity income from our joint ventures. This was down
$200 million as weakness in consolidated operations more than offset the strong performance of our China joint
ventures.
At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from our consolidated operations was $3.2 billion. This was a $1.1 billion
decline from Q1 2013, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes and approximately $200 million in unfavorable
foreign exchange primarily associated with the Australian dollar and South African rand.
GMIO's EBIT-adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 8.8%, down 6.9 percentage points from
the prior year. This was primarily due to unfavorable mix in the Middle East related to product launch timing. Our net
income margin for our China joint ventures was 11.2%, down 0.5 percentage points from the prior year. GMIO's
wholesale vehicle sales were 162,000 units for its consolidated operations and 934,000 units for our China joint
ventures, where the number of deliveries in the quarter reached a new record.
Our market share in the region was 10%, a 0.2 percentage point increase from last year. Our market share in China
remained a very strong 15.2% for the first quarter, up 0.1 percentage points from the prior-year period.
Turning to slide 17, we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume was $200
million unfavorable, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in the Middle East, India and Thailand. Mix was $200
million unfavorable, primarily due to lower sales of full-size trucks and SUVs in the Middle East, due primarily to
launch timing. Price was flat compared to the prior period. Cost was favorable $300 million, primarily related to
reduced manufacturing, lower depreciation expenses and savings related to the wind-down of the Chevrolet brand from
Europe. Other was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to the Korean non-controlling interest and FX.
On slide 18, we look at GM South America's EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide,
revenue was $3 billion in the first quarter, a $700 million decrease from 2013. This was due primarily to unfavorable
foreign exchange associated with the weakening of local currencies in Brazil and Argentina and reduced volume in

Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. The EBIT-adjusted margin in the segment was a negative 5.2%, unfavorably
impacted by instability in Venezuela and restructuring in Brazil.
GM South America's wholesale vehicle sales were 208,000 units, 25,000 less than the first quarter of 2013. South
American market share was 16.3% in the quarter, a 0.9 percentage point decline from the prior year, primarily due to
Argentina and lower production in Venezuela.
On slide 19, we look at the components of the $100 million decline in profitability in our South American segment. The
net impact of volume was unfavorable $100 million, due primarily to reduced wholesale vehicle sales in Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela. Mix was flat. Price was $200 million favorable as we took action in Argentina and Brazil to
partially offset foreign exchange in those markets.
Cost was flat compared to the prior-year period. Other was $300 million unfavorable, primarily due to unfavorable
foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina. This totals to a $200 million loss for GM South America in the first quarter.
Slide 20 provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the first quarter. After adjusting for
non-controlling interests, preferred dividends on Series A and deducting GM Financial, our automotive income was
$100 million for the quarter. We had $400 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization
expense was a $1.4 billion expense.
Working capital was a $400 million source of cash. The $1.3 billion increase in this category is primarily related to one
less payment cycle and increased vehicle production in the quarter. Other was a $100 million use of cash, a net $700
million improvement from the prior year due primarily to the incremental recall accruals. This totals down to
automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $2 billion. We had $1.8 billion of capital expenditures in the
quarter for a total adjusted automotive free cash flow of $200 million.
On slide 21, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the quarter with $27 billion
in cash and current marketable securities and $10.4 billion in available credit facilities for a total available liquidity of
$37.4 billion.
Our book value of debt was $7.2 billion and the book value of our Series A preferred stock remained at $3.1 billion.
Our U.S. qualified and nonqualified pension plans are underfunded by $7.2 billion and our non-U.S. pensions are
underfunded by $12.2 billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability decreased to $6.2 billion in the first quarter.
Slide 22 provides a summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial reported their results this morning and will
be holding an earnings conference call at 12 o'clock. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the first quarter came in at 7.9%,
a modest increase from the prior-year period and slightly above industry penetration.
Our U.S. lease penetration increased 3.2 percentage points to 24.2% in Q1 as we took advantage of higher residual
values on our recently launched new products to begin closing the gap to competitive leasing levels. Lease penetration
in Canada was at 23.4%, up 13.3 percentage points from the prior year as we moved to a level more in line with
industry averages.
GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations rose to 70% and GM Financial's percentage of GM's
U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 21% in the quarter. GM Financial's annualized net credit losses
remained low and improved to 1.8% and our earnings before tax adjusted were $221 million for the first quarter, up
$41 million from the prior period.
Turning to slide 23, although our overall results were overshadowed by the impact of recall charges, we had very
strong financial results this quarter. Setting aside the recall-related charges, the total company core operating
performance is on plan for the year. GM North America is on plan and early results indicate that our recently launched
products are being well received in the market. We continue to expect light vehicle SAAR to be in the 16 million unit
to 16.5 million unit range.
Consolidated International Operations are on plan as we continue to work through the expected challenges of managing
the launches of our full-size trucks and SUVs in the Middle East as well as the restructuring efforts in the region.

Europe is performing ahead of plan as the industry continues to improve and the success of our recently launched
products continue to deliver results. Products such as the Mokka and the redesigned Insignia led the Opel and Vauxhall
brands to their highest market share in several years this past March. China is also performing ahead of plan, where we
continue to set sales records. GM South America is considerably weaker as the environment in Venezuela and other
markets continue to be challenging. Additional challenges that we'll need to manage include unknown market impacts
in the U.S. due to the recall actions, foreign exchange headwinds in Russia and South America, and political and
market volatility in several emerging markets. Needless to say, we have much work to do but Q1 was strong, all things
considered.
Now Mary and I will take your questions, after which we will have some closing remarks. Thank you.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yes, we can.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Well, I have a couple of things that I'll throw out there. One is North America, can you
talk about that $1 billion of content cost increase in the quarter? Should we be netting that against the $1.7 billion of
price to basically conclude the 35% of that pricing as kind of dropping to the bottom line? Do you need to have that
level of pricing going forward or do you expect to have $1 billion a quarter of content growth?
And then secondly, at one point, Chuck, you had indicated that you were expecting a net cost reduction of around $1
billion in North America in 2015 versus 2014 and there were a few components of that, fixed costs and logistics and
purchasing. Is that still the case or are some of the changes that are being made to product development or warranty
accruals going to have an effect on some of those cost savings expectations?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, let me take your first question or the first part of your question first, Rod. As we've
talked about before, a lot of the net pricing on new products, and remember net pricing that we show is the impact in
the current quarter for those products that have been launched in the last 12 months. So you're right, the $1 billion of
material costs related to content really needs to be netted against the $1.7 billion or so of net price associated with
newly launched products, resulting in kind of a net roll-through to the bottom line of $700 million.
I think we've talked about this before. We would expect to see in the first half of the year pretty significant
year-over-year improvement in pricing driven by launched products, and then we'd see it tail off in the second half of
the year because we'll be through the full 12-month launch cycle of the full-size pickups. At the same time, you'll see
on a year-over-year basis the material costs associated with content drop off as well.
So that's how to think about that. On the cost reduction, $1 billion, I don't recall saying that was all in 2014. I think I
indicated that in our glide path going forward to 10% EBIT margins that we expected to pick up about 100 basis points
of cost between 2014 and 2015, driven to a large extent by material and logistics savings, primarily material cost
optimization, with fixed costs over that timeframe in the next couple of years being relatively flat efficiencies and
non-marketing-related SG&A like Global Business Services, IT, and some manufacturing efficiencies offsetting
headwinds in incremental marketing and D&A, and I would say that plan still holds and that's what we're executing to.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Hi, a couple of questions, and I actually think the two are related. The first is around kind of
the price versus cost trade-off you're making, or you made first quarter in pickup trucks. And the second is then overall
cadence of earnings in GMNA and overall. Then the first question is your share in pickup trucks, roughly 34%, 35%
first quarter, but it looks like you had very good price even net of content costs. Is that the kind of tradeoff you're going
to be looking to make going forward through the year or do you see stepping up on the volume and down a bit on the
price as we go in to the spring selling season?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I would say first and foremost we're going to continue to demonstrate incentive and pricing
discipline and I think we've seen that through the launch of the full-size pickups thus far and it's rolled through our
results. At the same time, we're going to be competitive, and we talked about the February 6 call that we had, the need
to address some of the competitive challenges at the lower end of the market, especially Silverado. If you actually look
at share year-over-year, Sierra is up year-over-year, Silverado is down, and that's primarily at the low end of the
market. We've taken action in March and April to address that. So far, based on early PIN reads, we've picked up about
160 basis points to 170 basis points a share on a retail basis, full-size pickup. So we're starting to get traction, but we
need to do that, Brian, in a very balanced way. We do not want to give up the gains that we've made on mix, moving
our crew cab mix up and the higher-contented premium vehicles that we're selling. And we think we can accomplish
both if we're smart about our go-to-market execution. Relative to earnings cadence, I think it's fair to say back in
February, and January for that matter, we indicated that Q1 was going to be in the range of 10% to 15%. I think it's safe
to say we performed better than the 15% as a percentage of our total earnings for the year, broad-based across the board
improvement versus our expectations across all of the regions, fundamentally cost-driven. So I think what we're going
to see the rest of the year for both North America and the Corp. is a more normalized Q2 through Q4 earnings.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: So does that imply that there is a step down off of the seasonality, that is those are going to
be seasonally weaker, hence you're maintaining your overall guide, or you're going to see how the year goes and there
might be room to move up?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would say that we have not changed our view for the year, which was overall,
excluding the impact of recalls, we expected earnings to be up in aggregate, relatively flat margins. What I'd say is we
changed the shape of the curve. We performed better than we expected in the first quarter. So we'll have to trim some
of the expectations Q2 through Q4.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First question is a two-part question. First, on the recall, I
mean 7 million units obviously creates an enormous amount of showroom traffic and opportunity to kind of convert
that traffic into new sales. So could you outline perhaps how successful have you been so far in getting folks coming in
and holding hand, and obviously helping them with a real issue, but also perhaps helping to convert a sale in the
process?
And the second is, following the expiry of the NOL rights program under Section 382, could you confirm whether
General Motors has anymore poison pill type of mechanisms in place that could be used as defense in case of any
stake-pulling or is there no such thing at this point? Thank you.

<A - Mary T. Barra>: Adam, I'll take the first question as it relates to the 7 million unit recall, and actually it's 6
million actual vehicles, but when we – and then you look at the total amount of issues that we'll recall, we do see that as
a huge opportunity. It is a little too early, we're in the early days, it was just a couple of weeks ago that we started
having part kits come in so we can do repairs. Our dealers are well positioned to do that. We've had excellent dealer
communications and actually really reworked our processes to be very responsive to the customer in that we're shipping
part kits by VIN to dealers to make sure that we get to the customers and we don't have one dealer that has excess parts
and another that's waiting for parts. We have also put the tools in the hands of the dealer that they can offer employee
pricing to that individual or someone in the household. And I'd say anecdotally, right now, we're getting feedback from
customers that – in fact, I spoke to one last night that had had their vehicle repaired and sent a note to me saying they
are a loyal GM customer. So again, your point is well taken. It's going to be how well we manage it. I think with this
our dealers have been externally recognized for the type of customer service and satisfaction that they're providing.
They're geared up to do this and I'm confident that they're going to be demonstrating our focus on the customer as we
go through this and it will have positive results.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks, Mary.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: And Adam, on the second part of your question, we don't have a poison pill.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Good morning, Itay.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Good morning. So maybe shifting over to Europe, it looks like, excluding restructuring, GM
Europe was pretty close to breakeven. I know Russia is now included in there. So first can you quantify the Russia
impact? And could GM Europe actually be profitable excluding Russia and, if so, what does that mean in terms of the
outlook for breakeven in GM Europe perhaps outside of Russia for the next couple of years?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: First, we haven't changed our guidance on breakeven in Europe, including or excluding
Russia. It's mid-decade. Second, I'm not going to provide country-level profitability, Itay. The regional results in
Europe, we lost, excluding the impact of recalls, we lost $100 million, which is $100 million improvement versus the
first quarter of last year. I would say that's certainly a good sign. We're starting to get traction. The industry has
performed better than we expected and we're performing better than we expected. And I indicated in the other
considerations section of the deck that we expect Europe to perform better than planned for the year and I think, you
know, we're seeing some of that in Q1. But from an overall perspective, mid-decade breakeven is still our objective.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yeah. I'd just like to also answer that, I mean, I think if you really look at the strength in
Europe is really product-driven and I think Karl-Thomas Neumann has done a great job of shifting the conversation
from some of the issues at Opel to the products. To me, a really important signal is the strength of the Insignia, which is
the flagship, and that's being very well received. So I think that is a very strong signal, but it's a product-driven
recovery and the shift in the messaging over there is to the product.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Absolutely. And a quick clarification on North America, if I may. Is target still to gain market
share for the full year? I think that was the target you laid out in January. Is that still part of the pricing plans and how
you go to market for the rest of the year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: That is still one of our objectives through the year, to grow market share year-over-year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning. Just a question for both of you, sort of two aspects on the recall. Mary, I just
wonder if you could comment on what impact you think your recall and maybe the recalls throughout the industry
might have on product development costs and speed, basically the cadence of product intros? And then Chuck, it looks
like there is not a lot of this that was added back, so it looks like a lot of the cash was spent in the first quarter. Just
trying to understand the timing of the cash conversion of the accrual, the $1.3 billion for the recalls during the course of
the year.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: So if I understand your question correctly, the rates of product development, I think if you look
at the announcements that we've made, I see the organization acting more efficiently. When you look at the way the
Jeff Boyer organization and the Global Vehicle Safety and then the Product Integrity team is going to pull it together.
We have had the chief engineers very involved as we looked at this structuring change that Mark just announced
recently with the Product Integrity team and the team devoted to the components and sub-system. So I think it will
speed along. I don't see it changing the engineering costs to develop new vehicles. And then when you look at the
Safety organization and our ability, the people we're putting in place and the way we're going to work across the
organization, I think it's going to allow us to increase our speed once we understand an issue. And ultimately, if you
discover an issue and you first discover it more quickly and then root-cause it more quickly, overall that's going to be a
lower impact as well. So I don't see an increase related, if I understood your question correctly.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Yeah, that's it. And then Chuck, just on the timing of the cash payments?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, so the Q1 cash flow did not include a significant level of cash costs associated with
the recall, pretty minimal, primarily related to any payments that we made on courtesy transportation and/or loaner. The
fundamental cash spend associated with the recall will start to fall when we're repairing vehicles. So if I look at the
cadence, it's going to be weighted Q2 through Q4 pretty evenly for the rest of the year. That's when the cash costs are
going to roll through the results.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then just one follow-up question on North America, on slide 13, mix was a slight
negative. Obviously you had the HD and the large SUVs launch. I mean, when do we actually see the benefit from
those flowing through on mix? I mean, I would imagine we'd see some of that in the first quarter, but is the bulk
coming in the second quarter?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I would think that we're going to see improved mix, on a go-forward basis, Q2 forward.
But a lot of the improvement associated with the full-size utilities and HDs will fall into price in Q2 on a
year-over-year basis, and we'll start to see favorable mix again on a year-over-year basis in Q2 being driven by full-size
pickups that were launched last year in the latter part of Q2.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe that a member of the Canadian

you, you'd be a good listener, like in the case of the U.S. Treasury. So I'm curious if you can say whether they have
approached you, and then if you can't, maybe just more generally what are your feelings about whether you think
there's currently a buying opportunity in GM stock for either the corporation or for investors?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: The Canadians have not approached us yet. We read probably the same press release that
you did. I think the best way to answer that question, Ryan, is we've demonstrated the willingness to be opportunistic in
the past and we'll have to see how this develops with the Canadian share sale. I think your second question was around
do we think, from a General Motors perspective, it's appropriate to go into potentially the open market and buy back
stock, and I think there's a number of other issues that we need to deal with right now before we think about that. And
I'll leave it at that.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay, then. Great. And then just on China, very strong margin there, 11.2%. I had thought
over the last couple calls that we discussed that you were experiencing some headwinds there relative to new facility
expansion expense, the investments that you're making to drive Cadillac sales, could pressure margin near-term but
help medium-term. Should we think about that differently now? Have you cycled past that?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, I think what we said for China for the year is we expected margins to be similar to
2013 levels, somewhere in, call it the 9% to 10% range. Q4, the margins were 7.6%, and that was driven by some
startup-related expenses and we've kind of cycled past that. Generally, Q1 is a richer margin quarter, if you think about
the cadence. But I think we're still feeling pretty good about margins in the range of 9% to 10% or relatively flat
year-over-year in China.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Great, thanks. And just last question, follow-up to that. And I know that your
consolidated IO EBIT walk doesn't really break out the drivers within China but sort of lumps equity and income
together. Can you maybe kind of talk about how those pieces are moving over there? How is price changing
year-over-year for the full year or however you'd like to break out price and mix and cost, et cetera, just high level?
Thanks.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, high level, volume is favorable. Mix is favorable as we start to sell more Cadillacs
and SUVs. Price is a headwind. The net pricing dynamic in China, the heuristic has generally been around negative 3%
per year. So we expect that to be a headwind. Material cost will be a tailwind and fixed costs will be a headwind as we
continue to expand our manufacturing footprint.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Broad strokes.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Yeah, appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: I was on mute. Yeah, a couple. Just on the charges, I mean housekeeping. It sounded
like what you took, the $1.3 billion applied to 6 million vehicles in total. I mean, I understand that this is something
that's evolving, but as far as you can tell with all the issues and costs that are visible now, is this largely sort of behind
us as a one-timer in the first quarter or would you expect to have subsequent catch-up charges in following quarters?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: As we look at the whole process, what we've done is really redoubled our efforts to make sure
if there were issues that had been lingering that we got in, we understood it. We put more people in that organization to
make sure we quickly get to issues. I can't predict the future to say what will happen as we go forward, but what I can
say is we will respond to big or small issues as quickly as we can and in doing that, with the speed of responding,
allows us to, I think, really minimize the impact as you get to a smaller population. So that's what we're going to do
going forward and we're going to remain focused on the customer as we look at these issues.

<A - Charles K. Stevens>: And Patrick, relative to your question, the $1.3 billion that we took in Q1 covers what we
think is going to be the overall cost to repair and courtesy transportation for the recalls that we announced in the first
quarter.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay, no, that's helpful. And just on South America, maybe we can spend a little bit
of time there. Obviously, it's very little visibility on the macro front, but I know you've been restructuring Brazil. But
are you considering maybe more assertive actions, like potentially rethinking the Venezuela manufacturing footprint,
even if you're not rethinking sales in Venezuela, or stepping up the level of restructuring activity in the region? Because
it does sound – and then maybe if you have a sense of what your expectation, even if it's sort of something with wide
parameters around it, what your expectation for that market might be that you're rolling with, that would be helpful.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Let me start kind of 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. At the end of
2011, early 2012, we embarked on kind of a four-pronged approach, specific to Brazil but also across the rest of the
region, on how to take and continue to drive the improvement in the region. Product, with a real focus on product
launches, and I would say that the most recently launched products are doing extremely well in Brazil and in the rest of
the region. They now account for about 75% of our volume. So we are very pleased with how we've approached that.
Second was to really work on our fixed cost, and we continue and will continue to make progress and take actions from
a fixed-cost perspective, both SG&A and manufacturing. In the Q1 results we had a roughly $50 million charge for
continuing restructure and we finished up the closure of the San Jose passenger car facility.
We just got an agreement with Gravatai on a three-year labor deal with 0% real economics associated with it. So we
continue to work through that. The third piece was really to work through our material cost, localization and logistics,
and we continue to work through that. I would say, it's unfortunate, we made significant progress in Brazil and other
markets over the past couple of years, but the economic environment has moved just as rapidly as we've been making
changes or making improvements, and we'll continue to do that. We're very strong in Brazil. We've got a great dealer
network. We've got a great portfolio now, a very strong brand, and that's a place that we're going to focus on to win.
Relative to Venezuela, look, we like Venezuela when it's running normally. It hasn't run normally for the last three
quarters. Clearly that's weighing down our results. We see no resolution in the near-term. We continue to work very,
very closely through the Brazilian government and also directly with the Venezuelan government to try to determine
when things will return to some level of normalcy there so we can build and sell vehicles. It can be a very constructive
market, so we're weighing our options very, very carefully there. If there's an opportunity going forward for some
normal business, we certainly don't want to pull out and go back in. We've shown before when we do that typically it's
not a good outcome, but we need to just continue to monitor that.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: That's helpful. And just on the market, one of the suppliers that reported earlier sort
of had a 10% down light vehicle estimate for the region, which struck me as pretty severe. Any kind of ranges as to
what you guys are thinking about in your base plan now?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. As I indicated on the other considerations chart, we expect South America to be
weaker than expected. So if we go back to January, our view at that time three months ago was that South America
should be improved year-over-year. That's not going to happen. We're not going to have improvement year-over-year
in South America. We see no resolution in the near-term to Venezuela. And I would say I don't necessarily agree with
the 10% industry downtick, but I would say the industry is softer than we expected in Argentina and Brazil.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. Terrific. Thanks a lot, guys.

<Q - Colin Langan>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You commented earlier that you're still targeting higher
market share in North America and in April it was coming in strong. Are you not anticipating any market share loss
following the recall? I mean, how are you thinking about the near-term market share impact with all the negative
headlines?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, as we look at the strength of the product portfolio that we have, coming out, we're just
really in the middle of still bringing out the full-size trucks, the heavy-duty trucks, the SUVs. We have more launch
products coming, and we see strength, both from the reception and then also from external assessment of those
vehicles, and we haven't seen anything meaningful to date and we plan on continuing to serve these customers well as
they come in. And that, coupled with our products, we're going to focus on that to minimize if any impact occurs, but
right now, again, we haven't seen anything meaningful.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And any color on a potential civil settlement, maybe in terms of the timing you might
announce something [indiscernible] (56:08)?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: As I said, we expect to have recommendations in 45 days or so. So I don't have anything more
to comment. As you can imagine, it's a complex situation as we evaluate both the legal and civic aspect of this. But we
are working with him and as soon as we have something to share, we will get it out.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And then just thinking about restructuring, what is – the $1.1 billion that you initially
guided to, is that still the right number and how should we think about that, how it plays out through the year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, the $1.1 billion is still the right number. And as we indicated, the majority of that is
really related to the planned closure of our facility in Bochum, with the balance being spread and the other regions
outside of North America, we indicated that the weighting would be more front-end loaded. We had all-in about $300
million of restructuring in Q1. So I would expect that as we move through the rest of the year, it will start to come
down a bit, but still in that $1.1 billion range.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And any actions in GMIO, because obviously the consolidated operations remain a bit weak and
you did have the exit of Chevy. Is there any plans in place there and when should we expect a restructuring in that
region?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, okay. First, obviously a big one is the wind-down of Chevy Europe. We also
announced the cessation of manufacturing operations in Australia and we're working through that as we speak. That has
a bit of tail on it because we're going to continue to wind that down over the next two years or three years. Stefan
Jacoby and his team went country by country and started to work through some of the issues that we have. And the way
I think about consolidated operations outside what I just talked about, the Chevy wind-down and Australia, is we've got
to get the portfolio right. We recognize that. We've got portfolio weakness in Southeast Asia and in India, in South
Africa and some of these other markets that we need to deal with. So that's first and foremost.
It starts and ends with great products and then we need to put in place the right business model around that, which
means manufacturing footprint, dealer network, the right level of localization, the right commercialization or
industrialization of that portfolio, and that's all work in process. I would expect to see, as we move from Q1 through the
rest of the year, some improvement, primarily driven by improved results in the Middle East. The rest of the
improvement in the consolidated operations, that's going to fall into 2015 and 2016. This is going to be a multi-quarter
journey.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I would just add on, I just went through with Stefan each of these countries yesterday. And if
you look at it, in addition to everything that Chuck talked about, we've got the right people. I think you all know this is
a detailed business. As Chuck said, you've got to have the right product, you've got to have the right understanding of
the marketplace and going to market every single day. I feel very confident with several country leaders that we now
have in place under Stefan's leadership, they're just going to keep – again, it's a multi-quarter journey, but they're
definitely on the journey and they're looking at it the right way. So I think you'll see positive momentum there.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. This will be our last
question. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Thanks so much. One quick one. While I wouldn't expect it to be larger, are there any costs
associated with dealing with the suppliers related to the recall?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: What do you mean costs associated, related to ...
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: I mean I guess how are you handling that transaction with the suppliers?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. What we're doing is doing everything that we can do to ensure that we're getting the
right parts produced as quickly as possible so we can take care of our customers. So we are paying and funding what
needs to get done in order to make sure that we're getting the supply.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: And I would say we've had tremendous cooperation with the suppliers, working right from the
senior leadership of the company, great participation and they are completely supporting our goal to get parts as
quickly as we can to get these vehicles repaired as quickly as we can. So it's been working quite well.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: And just a technical point, the cost associated with those parts, that's in the $1.3 billion.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. Perfect. And then just as you think about some of the other regions, and I harken back to
your comment in North America with the pricing with an offset for some of the content thing, you've talked about how
improvement in other regions of the world needs to be product-driven as well. And I realize each of these markets are
different, so I don't know if you want to sort of go market by market or maybe specifically could focus on Europe,
which I think is the closest to a turn-around, should we also expect that that sort of relationship where you're able to get
a little bit of price but then you have to pay for it a little bit on the content side or is that market such that you're not
actually going to be able to fully price for the content to be competitive?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, I think that's a question that you need to answer on a specific product level. For
instance, as an example, the next-generation Insignia, depending upon the content technology that we apply to that
vehicle, has the ability to recover more price than the next-generation Corsa. So we have to be very smart about how
we apply content, how we industrialize it, how we make sure that we're getting the lowest possible cost because not
every segment can afford the kind of pricing improvements that we've seen on full-size pickups or full-size SUVs or
the CTS, sort of vehicles like that.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I would just add to that, I think it's getting the right content on the vehicle for the segment. And
that's a tremendous amount of work done to have a much better re-buy segment by market. What is the key content that
is going to be valued by the customer and therefore they're willing to pay. And then to look at that, especially as we
look at some of the products that are going to continue to be launched over the near-term, a lot I'll say better work done
to leverage our global scale in the material cost aspect of those products. So it's a balance between the two, but with the
right content and then really leveraging our scale in a way we hadn't done in the past.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. And then, Chuck, just one point of clarification. When you said Europe is tracking
ahead of plan, is that sort of core Europe or Europe as we used to think it or is that net of Russia, which is now
inclusive and you've indicated that could be potentially a headwind?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, just to be clear, that's Europe, which includes Russia. We've restated our priorities
also, and ahead of plan is versus what we talked about back in January from a Europe perspective, so that's versus our
plan – again, mid-decade breakeven.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.
Mary T. Barra
Thank you very much. Well, first of all, I really appreciate everybody's questions today. And I'd like to close this call
with a simple message that I think really encapsulates everything that we covered today and everything we're doing as
we move forward.
If you look at General Motors, as we moved past the bankruptcy, we have really been a company that has demonstrated
being proactive at every turn. And we continue to do that. And I will tell you I have been in many global employee
forums and talking to employees via email and other mechanisms, there is definitely the culture and I see this as an
opportunity to even accelerate our culture change to make sure that we are fast responding and a truly integrated
organization really dedicated to having great products. We'll continue to face down every issue we have, both internal
and external, and also more aggressively pursue the opportunities, because there is challenges in the marketplace, there
is opportunities in the marketplace, and we're going to continue to minimize the challenges and really go after
opportunities I think in a way we haven't always done. So I hope today's discussion gives you more confidence in our
customer-focused strategy. We are living it. And it's easy to say it and put it on a piece of paper; as you go through
difficult times you have to prove it, and we are demonstrating that every single day. I hope you also have confidence in
our 2014 outlook and our long-term potential. So thanks for your time, and I'll turn it back to Randy.
Randy C. Arickx
Thanks, Mary. Thanks everybody for your time today. We appreciate it very much. Thanks, operator.
