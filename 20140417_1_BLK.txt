MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute
to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew J. Mallow
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Before Larry, Gary and Rob make their remarks, let me remind you that
during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and we call your attention to the
fact that BlackRock's actual results will, of course, or may, of course, differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And as we usually warn you, BlackRock assumes no duty, and
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
So, with that, let the call begin.
Gary S. Shedlin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the first quarter of
2014. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business

results. And as usual, I'll be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.
BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.43, up 21% compared to 2013. Operating income was $1.1
billion, 15% higher than a year ago, reflecting continued revenue growth and a decline in G&A expense.
First quarter nonoperating results reflected a $69 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments,
which were impacted by the monetization of a non-strategic opportunistic private equity investment. The first quarter
as-adjusted tax rate was 30%, and we continue to believe this remains an appropriate planning assumption for 2014.
Underpinning our results was continued organic growth, despite volatile market conditions in the first quarter. We saw
$27 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of approximately 3%, with
organic revenue growth once again outpacing organic asset growth, notwithstanding the volatility which impacted
iShares during the quarter.
Our highly diversified multi-client platform generated more than $5 billion of net flows across each of our retail,
iShares and institutional businesses. First quarter revenues were $2.7 billion, up $221 million or 9% from a year ago
and were driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees and revenues from BlackRock Solutions. We once
again experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all long-dated asset classes.
Base fees increased $162 million or 8% from a year ago, as average assets under management increased as a function
of organic growth, market appreciation and the acquisitions of the Credit Suisse ETF and MGPA real estate businesses.
Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, in part due to change in our AUM mix, which was impacted
by relatively weaker beta in markets with higher fee products and a lower day account in the first quarter.
Performance fees for the quarter increased $50 million from a year ago, primarily due to a performance fee associated
with the planned final liquidation of the opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund that was partially
liquidated in the fourth quarter. This fund now holds only a residual balance with limited additional performance
potential.
BlackRock Solutions' revenues of $154 million were up 22% year-over-year and were roughly flat compared to the
fourth quarter. Our Aladdin business, which represented 71% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, was up
10% year-over-year. Sequential results were once again impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues as
we continue to onboard a number of very large clients onto the Aladdin platform.
Our Financial Markets Advisory or FMA Group continues to post strong revenues. While this quarter reflected a higher
level of revenue associated with asset disposition assignments than prior quarters, the FMA Group continues to develop
a more institutionalized advisory model with a focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the
changing regulatory environment.
Expenses for the first quarter rose $80 million year-over-year, driven primarily by increases in revenue-related items
including compensation and direct fund expense, partially offset by a decline in G&A expense. Compensation expense
increased from a year ago, broadly in line with growth in the overall business. As we have previously noted, the first
quarter adjusted compensation-to-revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll
taxes, which increased year-over-year due to appreciation of BlackRock's share price.
General and administration expense declined $18 million year-over-year due to a number of factors, including the
impact of closed-end fund launch costs in last year's first quarter, a current one-time benefit from the reversal of a U.K.
related, real estate-related retirement obligation which is no longer required to be funded and lower other expense,
partially offset by foreign currency exchange movements.
Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items,
including marketing and promotional spend, which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2014.
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 41.4%, 140 basis points higher than a year ago. Notwithstanding the
lower level of G&A expense in the current quarter, we continue to demonstrate benefits of scale in our overall business.

We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by reinvesting in our business and returning
excess cash to shareholders through a consistent and systematic capital management policy. As previously discussed,
we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.93 per share of common stock. We also repurchased an
additional $250 million worth of shares during the first quarter and are committed to maintaining a steady level of
repurchases during 2014.
BlackRock's financial results reflect the breadth and depth of our investment and distribution platforms. Our first
quarter results reflect continued focus on key strategic themes including income, outcomes, alternatives and strategic
beta, as clients look to both active and passive deals to meet their evolving long-term investment needs.
We continue to see strong growth in global retail. Retail long-term net flows were $14 billion for the quarter,
representing an 11% annualized organic growth rate and were positive across all asset classes.
International retail once again demonstrated strong results, generating long-term net inflows of $9.8 billion,
representing a 25% annualized organic growth rate. Equity flows of $4 billion were led by our top-performing
European equity suite; while fixed income net inflows of $2.5 billion were driven by demand for our short duration,
unconstrained and high yield bond products. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.7 billion reflected continued momentum in
our Global Allocation fund, a key component of our bundled outcome-oriented family of products.
U.S. Retail's quarterly long-term net inflows of $4.2 billion, representing annualized organic growth of 5%, were led by
fixed income's continued success in our duration-managed product suite.
We also saw accelerated interest across our diversified retail alternative platform, with $1.5 billion of net inflows.
Importantly, our Global Long/Short Equity fund, managed by our SAE team, saw accelerated flows in the quarter, with
each of Global Long/Short Equity and Global Long/Short Credit attracting more than $700 million of net new assets
during the quarter.
Global iShares generated $7.8 billion of net new business in the quarter, driven by fixed income flows. In the face of
market volatility, iShares continued to deliver the efficiency, liquidity and performance our clients expect from the
leading global ETF provider.
In total, iShares' equity flows for the quarter generated nearly $1 billion of net new assets, with flows into developed
markets more than offsetting outflows of nearly $8 billion from EEM, our flagship emerging markets ETF.
In recent weeks, however, we have witnessed a change in emerging markets sentiment and flows have reversed, with
approximately $4 billion coming into EEM since quarter-end. The global ETF industry's [ph] again (09:08) strong fixed
income flows during the quarter, and iShares was well positioned to capitalize on investor demand, with a diverse suite
of offerings across duration and style. For the quarter, we captured the number one global market share of industry
fixed income ETF flows, generating approximately $6.6 billion of net new assets, including $4.6 billion from Europe.
Our Institutional business generated $5 billion of net long-term inflows for the quarter. Strong passive net inflows of
$17.6 billion were partially offset by active net outflows of $12.6 billion. Overall, results were characterized by a
number of sizable client inflows and outflows, driven by a variety of factors.
Within passive, we saw both re-risking and increased usage of liability driven investing for LDI, as clients rebalanced
their pension plans, taking advantage of strong equity markets and improved funding ratios. As markets and interest
rates continue to rise, we expect to see more of this type of immunization activity. That said, we also saw the
redemption of a single large LDI assignment in connection with the annuitization of a client's pension obligation.
Active outflows were driven by several factors, including corporate events and legacy performance issues. Active fixed
income flows were impacted by a single $6 billion outflow driven by the acquisition of the client by an entity affiliated
with a competing asset manager. Fundamental equity flows were negatively impacted by a large sub-advisory
redemption, which was linked to legacy underperformance.
Finally, despite continued strong overall performance, we also experienced outflows of approximately $4 billion in
SAE, including a significant client redemption, but we were able to leverage the breadth of our platform to capture a

larger passive mandate from the same client.
Larry will discuss performance in more detail, but we believe that our current investment performance in both active
fixed income and equities is strong and competitively well positioned.
During the quarter, we also saw continued growth in targeted institutional sub-segments, including defined
contribution, where we generated more than $8 billion of net inflows with particular strength coming from our LifePath
target-date suite and passive equity offerings.
In Institutional alternatives, net inflows into hedge fund of funds were offset by capital return and other illiquid
products. However, strong fund raising continued in illiquid alternatives, with more than $1 billion in commitments
raised for the fifth consecutive quarter. Across Retail and Institutional clients, we saw almost $2 billion of core
alternative flows during the first quarter, the highest category flows we have seen in four years.
Overall, the quarter again demonstrated the consistency and stability provided by our diverse platform, and we continue
to believe that we are well positioned for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn it over Larry.
Laurence D. Fink
Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. While the first quarter marked the fifth
straight rate quarterly rise for the S&P 500, equity markets experienced significant inter-quarter volatility. Central Bank
policy continued to be a key focus area, global economic indicators fluctuated relative to expectations and the market
attempted to digest heightened geopolitical concerns, all of which impacted asset prices.
Volatility continued in early April as valuation concerns and short-term de-risking drove the worst week for domestic
equity markets since 2012. And I expect this type of volatility is likely to impact markets for the remainder of the year.
The industry has seen positive mutual fund flows throughout this latest market setback. That's a good sign that
long-term investors are actively engaged, helping to offset hedge fund deleveraging.
In the midst of these challenges, BlackRock's clients' goals remained consistent, focused on investing to improve their
financial futures. More than ever our clients, both institutional and individuals, need to think beyond the next news
cycle and the next quarter to meet their long-term investment objectives.
BlackRock's focus on long-term strategic themes like outcome-oriented investing; retirement and longevity allows us to
have a differentiated conversation with our clients and to provide them with the advice they need to meet their
long-term goals. Our client dialogue is enhanced by our ability to integrate technology and risk management into our
investment approach and harness our collective intelligence across the entire firm.
BlackRock attracted $27 billion in long-term net new flows in the first quarter, which again reflects the diversity and
the breadth of our business, with positive contributions come from all client types, all asset classes and all regions.
We have more products on more buy lists than ever before. The level of RFPs we're involved in and the level of client
interest across our platform from active and passive, and increasingly in alternatives, continues to rise. And we're
seeing momentum in important long-term asset classes, like infrastructure, where investments we've made on our
platform are beginning to pay dividends. My focus and the focus of BlackRock's leadership is on capitalizing on the
opportunities that we see to deliver the solutions our clients need.
We recognize these opportunities must start with a strong investment performance, and performance is at the
foundation of the BlackRock culture. We've structured our business to give portfolio managers the technology, the risk
management tools and a forum of information sharing, and giving them autonomy to promote the superior investment
performance that our clients expect.

One significant differentiator for BlackRock is BII or the BlackRock Investment Institute. By bringing together our
investment professionals through daily meetings, topical investment forums and knowledge-sharing events, BII
heightens the best ideas from our top investors, and shares some of the most interesting conclusions with our clients.
We're focused on fostering an environment of information sharing to benefit our portfolio managers, which will
ultimately enhance performance for our clients. We are benefiting from that enhanced performance across our fixed
income business where 89% of our active fixed income AUM is above benchmark or peer median for three years.
We're also seeing strong performance in many areas of alternatives, multi-asset and equities, including European and
Asian equities, and we fully expect the same from our new equity teams in the U.S.
We've talked at length about the work we've done to address performance issues in our U.S. equity business; yet this
quarter we saw $4 billion of outflows related to a legacy performance in that business, primarily driven by a loss of a
very large sub-advisory assignment.
We recognize that our fundamental equity performance was not in line with our clients' expectations. It required a
significant investment in talent. We made these investments and we remain encouraged by the performance of our new
teams. Since the new teams joined BlackRock over the past two years, our U.S. basic value improved from the 51st
percentile to the 7th percentile. Our Large Cap Core from the 76th percentile to the 60th percentile, and our Large Cap
Value from the 97th percentile to the 37th percentile. These are the trends that we continue to expect, and through these
trends, we expect to see investors asking BlackRock about what we could do for them in active U.S. equities.
As we know from our experience in restructuring our active fixed income business several years ago, the process is
costly and it takes time to build long-term scalable track records. The results we are seeing today in terms of fixed
income performance and flows highlight the rewards from successfully executing on this type of overhaul. BlackRock
is committed to bringing in the top-tier alpha producers and we are confident that the moves we've made in our active
U.S. equity business will position ourself to achieve that goal.
Fixed income represents a meaningful opportunity for BlackRock. The fixed income ecosystem is going through
significant changes. The industry is witnessing a heightened period of client interest and, on all fronts, BlackRock is
positioned to win. The competitive landscape in fixed income is evolving, which highlights the importance of strong
performance. As we start to see a shift in the performance paradigm among industry leaders, BlackRock has the
products and the investment performance in place to attract flows from both retail and institutional clients.
As we've discussed in prior calls, the industry has experienced a shift from traditional, long-duration fixed income to
more flexible, unconstrained products as clients assess the risk of duration they have on their portfolios. This theme
drove a substantial portion of double-digit organic growth we saw in our Global Retail business.
International Retail, we saw growing momentum in our Unconstrained Fixed Income Global Opportunities fund, which
raised over $900 million during the quarter. And in the U.S. our flagship, Strategic Income Opportunities fund
continued to generate strong investor demand, with $2.7 billion of flow in the quarter. SIO has generated $10 billion of
flows in the last five quarters and now stands at nearly $14 billion of AUM. What began as a retail theme early last year
is now resonating with Institutional and defined contribution clients as well. We invested nearly $1 billion into SIO
during the last quarter.
Fixed income demand on the institutional side is also being driven by early signs of pension clients taking advantage of
approved funding ratios to rebalance and immunize portfolios. And BlackRock experienced strong LDI flows this
quarter as a result. Clients are also increasingly looking to ETFs to manage their fixed income portfolios. A Greenwich
Associates' report on the institutional use of fixed income ETFs found that one of five non-users planned to start
investing in fixed income ETFs in the coming year, while two-thirds of existing users have increased their usage since
2011. Survey responders named iShares as their preferred provider of fixed income ETFs, with pricing, the liquidity
and breadth of product offerings their top considerations.
Fixed income is a growth business for BlackRock and it has our largest flow category in the first quarter. The breadth
of our product offerings and performance, meaningfully in excess of our key competitors, positions us well for the
continuing rotation within fixed income and to gain market share as the landscape continues to evolve.

Our platform breadth and diversity of our deep relationships with clients are also a differentiator for BlackRock. Gary
spoke about some of the large flows we saw in Institutional business this quarter and BlackRock's ability to bring a
variety of products and service-oriented solutions to clients often position us to recapture what would otherwise be lost
opportunities.
In the case of one pension risk transfer to an insurance provider, although mandates moved away from BlackRock due
to successful execution of an LDI mandate, we won at BlackRock Solutions this time and can perform monitoring and
valuations on that same asset pool. This service transition was made possible by our existing relationships, our strong
management capabilities and risk-management capabilities and reputation, which includes providing Aladdin or
Aladdin risk support services to 12 of the top 35 insurance providers globally.
As a fiduciary, it is critical that BlackRock not only provides the investment performance and solutions our clients
need, but also to take a leadership role in advocating for the best interests and those of the broader markets in the
economy. That's why last month, I sent a letter to CEOs of every company in the S&P 500, urging them to focus on the
long-term, to make investments in their businesses that will create opportunities and drive future growth.
BlackRock believes it is our responsibility and obligation to maximize the value of the assets our clients entrust in us,
and that prudent management practices and strong leadership by Boards of Directors promoting companies' long-term
successes and to lead a better risk-adjusted return for our investors.
BlackRock is also working actively with regulators to help build constructive solutions that improve the financial
ecosystem for all investors. We recently submitted a letter, a comment letter to the Financial Stability Board to address
concerns over the impact asset managers might have on market stability. While we share the FSB's desire for a safer
market environment, and we agree with their focus on products rather than firms, we argue that leverage rather than
size should be the primary screen when determining the appropriate level of regulatory scrutiny. We will continue to
engage with regulators and policymakers to help ensure that regulation is appropriately focused on where risk may
exist at the product and at the product level and the practice level.
Looking forward, we remain committed to partnering with our clients around the world to deliver them all that
BlackRock has to offer. Last week, we hosted our Institutional Client Conference where we spoke with more than 100
clients on paving new paths to achieve outcomes for those who entrust us with their assets. On June 17, we will be
hosting our second Investor Day to discuss key drivers of future growth for BlackRock.
I'd like to close by taking a minute to talk about BlackRock's focus on our talent. Talent is something we as a
management team and our Board of Directors review continuously in order to build a deep bench of senior executives.
We view setting high standards for talent as a core responsibility to best serve our clients and investors. We are excited
to have a variety of senior leaders stepping into new roles, and to welcome a number of senior hires to BlackRock.
Those new hires include Salim Ramji, who was a senior partner in McKinsey & Co., who'll be joining the firm later
this month as our new Global Head of Corporate Strategy.
Chris Jones will be joining BlackRock as our Chief Investment Officer and Head of Fundamental Equities for the
Americas and Co-Head of our Global Fundamental Equity team. And Helen Zhu recently joined to help BlackRock in
our Chinese equity business. Our talent strategy reflects a focus effort we've taken to develop our people and enhance
our culture. We are committed to rotating leaders into roles that present them with new challenges, broadening their
responsibilities and maximizing their impact on the firm.
These efforts to develop and invest in top-tier talent will serve to drive BlackRock's long-term growth and to enhance
both the experiences of our clients and the value we deliver to shareholders. As always, I want to thank our employees
for a dedicated service this quarter and helping our clients build better financial futures.
With that, I'll open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Good morning. First, I'd like to see if you could talk about the level in the outlook
for Institutional fixed income investment dollars in motion. You called out in the press release the shift towards
Unconstrained and you talked in the call about short-term strategies. But taking this from other angle, would you expect
the amount of money in motion to increase further given the high-profile performance and management stability issues
at PIMCO? And to what extent has this already started? And based on your past experience, what kind of scale of
opportunity is there here?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I don't ever comment about our competitors and PIMCO's a fabulous investment firm
and Bill Gross has been a friend of mine for over 40 years, not that quite long, about 38 years. So we're in a great
position. We're seeing increasingly more dialogue from institutional clients than we've ever seen before. We began to
see accelerated inflows on the retail side. But now, we are in more dialogue with more consulting firms, advisory firms
too, pension funds. So corporations are looking at how they should look at fixed income. Some of this movement is
towards unconstrained into like SIO products.
And let me just speak about BlackRock and reiterate; having close to 90% of our products above their benchmarks and
some of them are in – many of them in the top quartile now is a reason why people are coming to BlackRock, both
institutionally and retail. Where we are beginning to see some increased dialogue though, Ken, is in the defined
contribution side, where this is an area where we had very little penetration on the fixed income side. We had large
penetration on the index equity side. So we are now enjoying more flows, retail and institutional, and in all components
of institutional. And I believe we will begin in the second and third quarter seeing an acceleration in terms of money
and motion as you called it in the fixed income universe.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Great. Thank you. And then to follow-up, can you talk about the performance of the
core alternatives strategy so far this year. We're seeing some hedge fund strategies suffering pretty weak absolute
returns earlier in this year and I'm interested to hear how your various strategies are performing and maybe which areas
are performing better and which areas are performing worse?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, you're correct in saying that there is some hedge funds that have done very poorly and
that was heavily oriented towards the macro strategies. Our macro strategy hedge fund had relatively poor performance.
However, our single hedge fund strategies, our fixed income hedge fund strategies have all done quite well. In fact,
they took advantage of some of the pain within the marketplace over the last two months.
I would say overall, we perform very strongly in our hedge fund strategies, our Multi – our Long/Short Equity, our
Long/Short fixed income hedge funds – where we're seeing some very large flows, both retail and institutional we had
good performance. So we continue to see acceleration in conversations in the alternative space too.
Two areas that I would like to highlight on the alts side, where we're beginning to have a total change in dialogue; one
is our real estate area, where we've had performance issues about five years ago, and we have had changes to leadership
there. We did the acquisition of our teams and we are now in more dialogues on real estate than we have been in many,
many years, and infrastructure.
Infrastructure, we brought along a team over three years ago and we are now starting to see accelerating flows into our
infrastructure alternatives area. We're about $2 billion and I expect to see a doubling of flows over the next 12 months
to 24 months in our infrastructure area. This is an area that I think is going to – we're going to have to continue to
invest in. As we think about the world going forward, there's a greater and greater need for infrastructure in the
developing world, in the developed world and most certainly in the U.S. And we believe this is a great asset category
for many of our investors, and so we look at this as an area of extreme growth.

Your next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Hey. Good morning, Larry. Just want to circle back on institutional fixed income,
specifically LDI. I thought it was interesting that the mandate wins here, seem to be really concentrated in passive and
not active. So first, do you think we need higher rates for this wave to really accelerate? And then, will these wins do
you think reside mostly in the passive business or mixed between active and passive?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, LDI is a means in which you are trying to minimize risk. And I do believe, because of
the growth in passive fixed income strategies in the ETF area and then obviously in the index side, it's a great product
for moving into LDI.
So I would say there would be a higher propensity for investors seeking passive strategies than active strategies for
LDI. But I think you're going to see, in some care areas, a growth of maybe the unconstrained product areas into LDI
also as a way of having a diversification in terms of fixed income strategies. But you should assume, when people go to
an LDI strategy, they're essentially de-risking and a component of that de-risking is staying pretty current on to an
index and this is why you're seeing a higher propensity that go into passive strategies.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Thanks. And just my follow-up here on the liquid alts business, which is mostly a retail
phenomenon. Which specific types of platforms and investor bases are really demanding these products? I'm really
thinking about both your Long/Short Credit and Long/Short Equity Funds?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I'll let Rob talk about that.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So, the retail base is thirsty for alternatives and so Long/Short Credit and Long/Short Equity,
but both global, are important for the retail base. And we've launched since 2011, six 1940 Act alternative products.
They continue to raise money. In the first quarter alone, it was $1.4 billion, and that's driven, as I mentioned, by the
Long/Short Credit, which has had very good performance as well as the global Long/Short Equity funds. And each of
those has raised over $700 million, putting them in the top selling funds. So it's really a retail thirst and, of course, that's
coming from what else is available to them, which is low rates on the fixed income side and sometimes using dividend
funds as a surrogate. So they need that double-digit returns and that's where we're seeing the interest from.

Your next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Good morning. First question is on, I guess about a year-and-a-half, maybe two years ago, you
made a move to combine the ETF with the retail distribution force. And just curious if there's any way of quantifying or
color you could give on what impact you may be seeing that have in terms of helping to drive ETF flows? And do you
feel like you're still at the early stages of that or is that kind of a full run rate so to speak?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So we're still at the earlier stages in that. And what it gives us the ability to do is have more
holistic conversations with our clients, because clients own both passive and active whether they describe that in index
funds, ETFs or active portfolios. So most clients have been focused more on asset allocation and this way, having
people that can talk both sides of that conversation really resonates with them, creating portfolios that are much more
sticky going forward or that when there's an asset allocation, they will asset allocate within BlackRock, because we can
offer the full plate of products.

It has taken a while to get that underway, because it requires a significant amount of training, combining a sales force
to have that, and also to, in a sense upgrade, our sales force to be able to talk more holistically. So, while we've seen
success, it's still in the early stages and we expect more to come on that.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Okay, great. And maybe to follow up. You've had really strong retail organic growth outside the
U.S. Can you maybe give a little bit of color on maybe by geographic region or country kind of where you're seeing
that, and kind of if there's any specific markets that you're particularly encouraged by? I mean I know there's the own
equity business I guess in the U.K., but any color there would be helpful?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Rob, it's been very broad-based, it's just so gratifying. It's throughout EMEA and Latin
America actually. Areas of great growth have been really, I would say, the core of Europe, Italy, Germany,
Switzerland, where we saw very good flows. So it just continues to dominate. And then even in Asia, out of those retail
flows, about $2 billion came from different countries in Asia. So it speaks very broadly about our global footprint and
our growing brand recognition in LatAm, in Europe and in Asia.
And we continue to drive a strong position, as an independent asset management platform working with our
distribution partners worldwide. But also, let me also say what is the key driver to the success is the expansion of
high-performing products, whether it's our performance in fixed income, our performance in European equities, active
equities where we're on the top decile for five years, and our growing success in Asian equities, where we have Andrew
Swan now with about two and a half years under his belt at BlackRock with exceptional performance. So it is about our
positioning worldwide globally, but it is also – the underlying key component of that success is a growing success in
our active product suite.

Your next question is from the line of Matthew Kelley with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Matt. How are you?
<Q - Matt Kelley>: Good, Larry. How are you?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good.
<Q - Matt Kelley>: First, I wanted to just touch on the ETF landscape, and there's been a lot of activity for both
iShares and competitors. So I'd just be curious how active we should expect you to be on the new product launch
perspective and where your efforts are focused both by product and region and where you see the most interests from
some of your competitors. And maybe that's a better question for Rob, but either of you.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah. Let me just give you a macro view and I'll let Rob get into the granularity of products,
the new products. But if you look at it, we had real large movements within the ETF space in the first few weeks of
January. We had up to $8 billion of outflows in EM, which was pretty disconcerning. Since then, we've had $4 billion
of inflows.
But importantly, since quarter-end, which is all public, so I could talk about it, we've had $10 billion of net inflows in
our iShares products. So year-to-date, we're over $17 billion of net flows. At quarter-end, we were approximately $7.5
billion, so huge change in momentum.
And so getting into the competitive landscape change, generally when you have, I would say, more of an international
flavor of investing, we benefit. When it's more of a domestic flavor, some of our competitors benefit. But I would tell
you, we're in a very good position to remain a leader in the ETF business in 2014.
Rob, why don't you go talk about some of those products that we're launching and we're proposing and...
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So we focus on what our clients' needs are in the changing landscape and in the markets. So
we have eight new products already this year. So we are currency-hedged to our enhanced international equity of

products, and the other are fixed income. Obviously, there was a very big demand for short duration due to the fact that
most people hinted interest rates at some point to have a higher probability of rising. And there's also been a lot of
interest in the municipal area.
So we're going to be very opportunistic, we're going to follow the lead of our clients. And in some cases, we're going to
grow market share and, in some cases, we're going to take market share, where we may have been late to the game, but
we see an opportunity and people respect the brand, our ability to have the best tracking errors and liquidity in the
marketplace. So we're going to go out in both of those. But we're going to continue to have our nose close to the
marketplace and we will be very active in new products that we believe that we can have scale.
<Q - Matt Kelley>: Okay, great. And then my follow-up is, I'd just be curious to get your thoughts as a management
team on the recent changes to the U.K. budget and impact on the pension market over there and where you're kind of –
where BlackRock is positioned to potentially benefit from any of those changes as they come through?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Well, I'm glad you asked that, because this is a huge opportunity for us. And we've spent a lot
of time and effort developing retirement products around the world and I think you've heard Larry talk a lot about the
need for retirement products. What you're talking about is really the U.K. pension reform, where there'll be less money
going into the annuity product and more money going into products that are created for retirement.
And as you know, you've heard us talk about our extensive U.S. DC experience with our LifePath products and our
CoRI products. We estimate that this opportunity in the U.K. alone could be about $25 billion in assets that might have
gone into annuities that now will be, as Gary likes to say, money in motion. So we intend to put a lot of effort on
putting together more retirement products to capitalize on this market. And I think BlackRock is uniquely positioned
because of our multi-asset strategies and our product development specifically tailored to the retirement area, of which
almost two-thirds of our assets at BlackRock are retirement related.

Your next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris M. Harris>: Thanks very much. Good morning. So Michael Lewis caused quite a stir with his book that
came out this month. And, Larry, just wondering where you guys stand on the whole debate about market structure;
whether you think the markets are rigged or whether you think the regulators should be doing more to kind of level the
playing field, if you will. And just kind of asking this question because given your size, obviously you guys have a lot
of influence as to how the market structure unfolds.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, we've invested tens and tens of millions of dollars for making sure that the
high-frequency traders did not arbitrage us. We looked at it as a fiduciary responsibility in making sure that we always
provide our clients best execution and we only do execution with the reputable counterparties and market venues.
So this is something that we've been focused on for years. Obviously it's a piece of – it's a book that creates, obviously,
greater public awareness, and we think there should be greater public awareness on these activities. But this is
something we've been focused on for years. It is not – our behavior has been consistent that our job as a fiduciary is to
get best execution.
We believe that market structure should always be there to be protecting investors. We believe in the concept of the
equal access of information. We believe in the concept of simplification of order types and message orders. So this is
something we've been living with. It may be in the public purview, but this has been a component of the market for
years and years and years and I think I spoke about this in the past few quarterly updates that we have been vigilant in
making sure that we're building adequacy in terms of our trading platform, that we are providing best execution for our
clients.
That's what I care about more than anything else, that we are there making sure that with all of the new technologies,
that we are not being arbitraged or that we have more friction costs in our execution.

Because of the high preponderance of our equity holdings, our index, as you know, we have to be so mindful of friction
related to trading. And so, this is why we've been very aggressive making sure we have – that we focus on best
execution. And I think this is a story that should be discussed, but this is a story that we've been aware of for years and
have addressed it internally in terms of our platform.
<Q - Chris M. Harris>: Understood. Thank you very much for that. And just really quick follow-up on the business;
you called out the performance of some of your newer team members, and they're really having a very good impact.
Just kind of curious to get your thought, how long do you think it's going to take for the better performance to really
start moving the needle on flows? Do you think it might take something like three years to really start getting a lot
better or, in your experiences, could we start seeing a bigger uplift before then?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: We have almost a bifurcated market, in alternatives, you could have no track record and
announce a strategy. And if the strategy makes sense, we've seen this in the marketplace that people are able to raise
money. So it really depends on the product itself. We are beginning to see some nice flows and certainly much more
dialogue in our Asian equity platform, where we have just under a three-year track record there. It takes more than a
year for the key, I would say, a product like Large Cap Core and Large Cap Value and it maybe a three to four year – a
two to three year type of process. After three years, I think you then get on many buy lists across the board.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Some of these teams though, actually that have joined us have a following.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So even though they didn't have a track record here, they're bringing with them track record.
So we are – now that they're on board, we're seeing those people be more willing to move now that they know they've
settled in with us. So we'll see some flows from there as well.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: And that's a key; if they continue to have the performance that they had at their prior place,
we can benefit early. But in terms of our witnessing what happened in fixed income, in that case it was really more than
a three-year process in which we needed to reprove ourselves. Because we had such a strong position in fixed income,
we lost it, and it took three to four years of building that team back and building the performance back. So I don't think
there's any one straight line that's the way that we could review all the different products. It really depends on the
circumstances around the team and the product itself.

And your next question is from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Marc.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Great, thanks. Good morning. Larry, can you talk about the growth of fixed income
unconstrained? It's interesting that you're now seeing, I guess, some institutional interest for SIO. Is that a trend,
number one? Do you expect that institutional interest will continue to drift toward unconstrained? Are you seeing that
maybe with allocations? And then relatively, are you concerned at all about capacity and maybe trading friction in
fixed-income as the quest for returns in yield goes more sort of off index, if you will?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Unquestionably, we are in more dialogue with more public and private institutional plans
than ever before on the concept of some form of unconstrained. It may not just be SIO; there are other products. We
have FIGO, we have other types of products, so we are – and we are looking at creating more unconstrained type of
products – so it may not just be in one. And we're beginning to see more interests on the defined contribution side for
unconstrained. So I think this is going to accelerate in a very large way.
Unquestionably, any one specific product like an SIO will have – this could not be a $100 billion fund – it was never
designed to be something like that. But do we have quite a bit of bandwidth and capacity for the nearable future?
Absolutely. And so, we're not concerned about capacity at the moment in any one of our products. But this is just
beginning this groundswell moving towards an unconstrained type of fixed income product. I think this will accelerate

and I think it will become a very large – well, it is a very large component of our dialogue with institutions worldwide
today. The second part of your questions, Marc, was that – did I answer that?
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Just in terms of trading, friction on trading.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Oh trading, yeah, friction cost. There's no question, as balance sheets of the dealers are more
contained, you see wider bid/ask spreads in fixed income. I don't think this is a long-term problem. It may be a
short-term problem. It will move – it will create more movement towards exchange trading for fixed income. And I do
believe this is one of the reasons why more interest in ETFs and fixed income. So you don't have to focus on a bond;
you could focus on ETFs that have maturities or ETFs that are connected to benchmarks. And so this is one of the
reasons why we think fixed income ETFs will grow dramatically over the course of the next few years.
But there's no question, there is times of great illiquidity in fixed income, as dealers have cut back their capital
associated with fixed income. And at times, it represents larger friction costs than other times, but I do believe that will
create a faster evolution towards more exchange traded fixed income platforms.

Your next question is from – your final question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hello, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Gary, maybe a few number questions. So I think you mentioned and we
saw it in the release, just on G&A, there were some items and a real estate benefit. And then I think non-op gains were
a bit elevated and then same thing with performance fees. So I guess any color around some of those lumpy items?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Sure. So on the G&A expense, as we mentioned, the current quarter reflects what we call a
dilapidation reversal, which is a function of a building we had over in London, that obviously artificially reduced
expenses for the quarter. As we also mentioned, there were some lower expense due to timing of just spend. The most
major component there is our M&P spend that we called out on a variety of quarters.
The fourth quarter, as you know, was actually impacted in many cases by the opposite. So we had higher M&P
spending, during timing, you had some lease exit costs and a variety of other accruals. So I think if you listened
carefully, which I'm sure you did, in the fourth quarter, we tried to walk you through what portion of our fourth quarter
G&A increase was kind of tied to our continued growth of the business, and we really haven't changed our view on that
at the moment. So I think that the type of analysis you guys generally did in the fourth quarter looking into the first
quarter, we still stand by.
On the non-op side, you correctly mentioned that the non-op was driven by the monetization of a non-strategic
opportunistic key investment. That was really tied to some years ago where we had a little bit of a different strategy
around potentially growing our alts business, which obviously has changed at the moment, and so I would say again
there, that the Street generally was fairly consistent in terms of its estimates of our non-op with the exception of that
one-time item.
And I think on performance fees, we've really talked about it. I mean, we mentioned it in the fourth quarter. This is
really the final piece of that liquidation and at the moment, we would expect most of the performance fees to be
generally recurring in nature tied to our [ph] core (55:00) business.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: But as you think about alts business, we are going to have return of capital, successful
monetizations of these things. This is normal course of business in alts and this is why we have to continue to have an
engine of growth of new products and this is one of the key components of...
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: And in connection with that again, another $1 billion of commitments that were in the quarter,
which takes that up for now five consecutive quarters. So keep in mind that those numbers are not hitting our net new
business flows until the capital is actually deployed. And once that capital is deployed, it then obviously becomes

Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence D. Fink
Just thank you for your commitment and investing in BlackRock. As I said earlier, I think the quarter is an example of
the diversification of our business model and of having a strong presence in active and passives and fixed income and
equities and alternatives, and it really shows up quite well in our first quarter.
And probably the other two major points that I would like to leave everybody; during the course of the quarter, as we
had this extreme volatility in market movement, every day during that volatility, we had consistent inflows, which leads
me to say that much of the market movement was more of a hedge fund oriented fast money type of behavior.
Long-term investors were committed to putting money to work, and we saw no change in investor behavior in the first
quarter.
Also, as a statement as we look towards the second and third quarter, we have never been in more active dialogue with
more clients, with more consultants, with more distribution partners about BlackRock products, probably in our
corporate history. And hopefully, we can show you at the end of the second quarter that those dialogues turn into
commitments.
Once again, thanks for all the support and I want to thank all the employees for all the support. Thank you.
