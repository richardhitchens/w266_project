MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on
mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer period.
[Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew J. Mallow
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry
and Gary make their remarks, as usual let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of
forward-looking statements. And we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ
from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may determine the results
of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. And additionally, as is also usual, BlackRock assumes no
duty and does not and will not undertake to update any such forward-looking statements.
So with that, let the call begin.

Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present our third quarter as adjusted results.
Our roadmap for shareholder value creation is predicated on three main drivers: generating consistent organic growth,
demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage and systematically returning excess cash flow to our
shareholders. We successfully navigated that roadmap again this quarter generating double digit earnings growth.
More importantly, however, and as you'll hear in much more detail from Larry in a moment. BlackRock has never been
better positioned to meet the needs of our clients. Our global reach, unique blend of active and index offerings, strong
overall investment performance, risk management and analytics capabilities and one BlackRock culture differentiate us
today in the asset management industry.
BlackRock delivered third quarter earnings per share of $5.21, up 34% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 15% to
$2.8 billion and operating income was $1.2 billion, 24% higher on a year-over-year basis. Non-operating results
reflected a $43 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, largely driven by mortgage, private
equity and credit related investments.
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.2%, reflecting discrete benefits primarily due to the resolution of certain
outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI. In connection with that transaction, BlackRock recorded a
$50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. Given the resolution of these matters, we recorded $50
million of G&A expense to reflect reduction of the indemnification asset and offsetting $50 million GAAP tax benefit.
Both the $50 million G&A expense and the $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from our as adjusted results.
Our 26.2% as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter also benefited from $34 million of discrete tax benefits. We
continue to estimate that 29% is a reasonable tax run rate for the fourth quarter and based on what we know today, 30%
is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015.
BlackRock's third quarter results were driven by $29 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized
organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across all client businesses and regions. And despite a more volatile
market environment, we continued to demonstrate stability of our highly diversified platform.
Over the last 12 months, BlackRock generated $134 billion of long-term net new business, representing 4% organic
asset growth, and an even faster rate of organic base fee growth, as we benefited from positive mix change associated
with our faster growing, higher fee retail and iShares businesses.
Third quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 15% or $377 million was driven by continued growth in base fees,
performance fees and revenue from BlockRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base fee growth
across all long dated asset classes.
Base fees increased $315 million or 15% from a year ago, as average AUM increased due to organic growth, market
appreciation and the acquisition of the MGPA real estate business. Base fees were up 1% compared to the second
quarter due to higher average AUM levels and the impact of one additional revenue day, partially offset by the seasonal
decline in securities lending activity we typically see in the third quarter.
However, we entered the fourth quarter with lower spot assets under management than our average AUM for the third
quarter, which will impact our fourth quarter entry rate base fee level. This decline was primarily driven by the
appreciation of the dollar against foreign currencies, which given the global nature of our business led to an $89 billion
decrease in total AUM during the quarter.
Performance fees for the third quarter increased $37 million or 39% from a year ago, driven by continued strong
performance across our broad suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings.
As a reminder, fourth quarter performance fees in 2012 and 2013 were elevated due to similarly sized one-time fees,
triggered by the wind down of opportunistic funds related to the financial crisis. We do not anticipate any such fees
during the fourth quarter of 2014.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $165 million was up 6% year-over-year and 13% sequentially due to increases in both
Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business, which represented 72% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the

quarter grew 6% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We continued to successfully execute on large global
implementations associated with record new business wins in 2013.
Our Financial Markets Advisory business had a very strong revenue quarter, driven by several large advisory
assignments associated with ECB AQR diagnostics. Notwithstanding a more institutionalized post financial crisis
advisory model, future FMA results may be difficult to predict as a function of the transaction-based fee structure
associated with this business.
Total expense for the third quarter rose $141 million year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue-related items,
including compensation and direct fund expense. Compensation and benefits increased $112 million from a year ago or
13%, reflecting higher head count and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income. While
compensation as a percentage of revenue declined year-over-year, partly as a function of the timing of certain accruals,
quarterly comparisons are less relevant as we manage compensation on a full year basis and our overall compensation
policies have not changed.
G&A expense decreased $8 billion year-over-year or 2%, driven primarily by beneficial and non-recurring items,
including the positive FX impact of re-measuring dollar balances held overseas to their respective functional
currencies. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $51 million reflecting the previously mentioned impact of positive
FX re-measurement and lower legal and regulatory expense in the current quarter.
Excluding the positive impact of these items and taking account of a planned seasonal uptick in year-end marketing and
promotional spend, we expect to see higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters of the
year.
Overall, total expense increased 9% from a year ago compared to a 15% increase in revenue over the same period,
resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 44.2%. The year-over-year margin improvement of 300 basis points was
positively impacted by the previously discussed lower level of G&A and compensation accruals in the quarter.
We remain committed to a consistent and systematic capital management policy. During the third quarter, we
repurchased an additional $250 million of stock and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year. As
you are all aware, we traditionally review our capital management strategy with our board each December for
implementation in January of the following year.
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client
relationships and commitment to alpha generation. Quarterly, net flows were positive in both our active and index
franchises, as well on each of our geographic regions with $11 billion from the Americas, $7 billion from EMEA and
$11 billion from APAC.
In Global Retail, we saw long-term net inflows of $5 billion during the third quarter bringing year-to-date inflows to
$32 billion or 9% annualized organic growth. Retail flows were positive in both the U.S. and internationally, but were
limited by macro headwinds during the quarter that impacted our high yield and European equities franchises.
BlackRock's diverse platform was well positioned to weather this market volatility as we nonetheless delivered overall
positive flows with strength in outcome oriented offerings including unconstrained fixed income, multi-asset and
alternatives products.
U.S. retail flows of $2.8 billion were driven by strength in our outcome oriented fixed income suite, including our
Strategic Income Opportunities fund or SIO, our Strategic Municipals Opportunities and Global Long/Short Credit
funds.
During the quarter, SIO raised $2.9 billion in net new flows from a combination of retail and institutional clients and
remains the number two best selling active mutual fund in 2014. Retail fixed income results were dampened by
outflows from our high yield franchise, which was impacted by investor rotation out of this sector in July. Though our
high yield bond fund has top docile performance, the fund experienced quarterly net outflows of $1.6 billion.

Our 40 Act alternatives funds raised nearly $600 million of net flows during the quarter and we continued to see
significant opportunity associated with delivering institutional quality alternative solutions to the retail marketplace.
We recently expanded our retail liquid alternatives suite with the launch of the Multi-Manager Alternative Strategies
Fund which allocates assets to a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated alternative investment managers and leverages the
success of our hedge fund solutions platform, BlackRock Alternative Advisors.
International retail net inflows of $2.1 billion were driven by our fixed income multi-asset and index capabilities, but
were impacted by deteriorating market sentiment in Europe contributing to the $3.8 billion in outflows from our
European equities franchise.
Within fixed income, we saw $1.2 billion of flows into our fixed income global opportunities fund which is the cross
border version of SIO and $680 million of flows into our BGF Euro Short Duration Bond Fund. International
multi-asset net inflows of $1.9 billion reflected demand for our BGF Global Allocation Fund, as well as growing
traction for the cross-border version of our flagship Multi-Asset Income Fund.
We also took advantage of strong three-year performance track records in Asian equities to capitalize on increasing
demand with our top quartile BGF Asian Dragon and BGF Asian-Pacific Equity Income Fund and our top decile BGF
China Fund generating more than $500 million in aggregate flows during the quarter.
Global iShares generated $18.2 billion of net new business in the quarter, representing annualized organic growth of
7%, driven by strong equity flows. Equity flows of $13.8 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series, as well as
demand from emerging markets and Asian equity exposures which offset outflows in European equities.
The buy-and-hold segment remains an important growth channel for iShares. During the quarter we generated $7.3
billion of flows into U.S. Core Series, representing annualized organic growth of 23% and gathered $2.5 billion of
flows into the recently launched European Core Series representing annualized organic growth of 26%.
We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market. iShares saw fixed income flows of $3.7
billion, paced by $1.3 billion of flows into our core bond product, AGG, as investors look for options to maintain
exposure to the broad fixed income market in the current environment. Year-to-date iShares ranks number one in
market share of fixed income net flows globally.
Our Institutional business generated $5.6 billion of long-term net inflows for the quarter primarily reflecting index net
inflows. We continued to see sizeable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of institutional index products as
barbelling continued to be a key theme among Institutional clients with cost effective beta exposure being paired with
alternative solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns.
Index fixed income inflows of $5.5 billion was driven by LDI activity, including extensions of hedging or liability
matching services. Institutional active net inflows included $5.2 billion of net inflows into multi-asset class products,
driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite and over $1 billion of flows into our dynamic diversified
growth strategy or DDG.
DDG is an unconstrained multi-asset strategy that feeds to generate positive consistent returns in a range of market
environments with significantly lower volatility than an equity portfolio. Multi-asset and scientific active equity
inflows were offset by outflows from active fixed income and fundamental equities.
Despite strong performance across our active fixed income platform, our Institutional net flows were impacted by
several client specific outflows driven by rebalancing and asset allocation decisions, partially offset by continued
strength in unconstrained fixed income strategies.
As you're going to hear from Larry shortly, our broad fixed income platform and performance track record continued to
position BlackRock extremely well to capture opportunities in the current environment.
In Institutional core alternatives, inflows and hedge fund solutions were offset by outflows from several single strategy
hedge funds and return of capital. However, we had another strong quarter of fund raising in the liquid alternatives with
nearly $1 billion in commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum in hedge fund and private equity solutions and

infrastructure.
As a result of strong fund raising in liquid alternatives over the last two years that has brought in over $9 billion, we
still have approximately $7 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital [indiscernible]
(15:48) flows immediately, committed capital only translates into flows and assets under management as those dollars
are invested.
In summary, in a quarter marked by increased volatility, our diversified business model delivered solid financial results
and we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous opportunities that lay ahead of us.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence D. Fink
Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. We've seen some meaningful shifts in
market dynamics since we spoke last quarter. Diverging monetary policy, changes in global economic growth
expectations and heightened geopolitical unrest all impacted the investment landscape and resulted in higher volatility
in both asset prices and currencies in the past few weeks. And that volatility is likely to continue, as conflicting Central
Bank policies and questions about the timing and magnitude of U.S. interest rate hikes led to an ongoing market
uncertainty.
Investors are also questioning whether the ECB's recent efforts will be enough to reinvigorate the economy and stave
off deflation. I believe it's going to take longer to stabilize Europe than many think and we are likely to see an
aggressive ECB behavior for a long time. It is in these times of volatility and uncertainty that clients turn to BlackRock
for answers. And we're having more conversations with our clients. They're deeper, more meaningful conversations
than ever before.
Clients are turning to BlackRock because of our platform that we've built over the past 26 years. As a result of a
comprehensive and deliberate process focused on culture, technology and talent. Our platform is built on the foundation
of our One BlackRock culture, a belief in putting our clients first in all that we do and managing risk better and more
thoroughly than any other asset manager in the world.
We built Aladdin with this in mind, to create a premier risk management and technology platform that allows everyone
at BlackRock to speak a common language. BlackRock doesn't eliminate risk, but it helps us to create an environment
where our team is constantly aware of the risks and we are connected across the firm worldwide to optimize these
results.
Increased connectivity through Aladdin and other sources leads to improved communication. And in the BlackRock
Investment Institute, we have a forum for investment teams to share knowledge, to share insights with the idea that this
will enhance alpha generation across the firm.
This team based approach is a critical differentiator for BlackRock. We do not and never had a centralized CIO. We
don't have a house view where any one person is setting a single investment strategy for our platform. Our process
enables our teams to make independent portfolio construction decisions to meet client objectives. That may result in
differing performance for our clients at times, but it means we don't have an overwhelming bias towards one strategy or
another and we minimize the risk that that entails.
We also believe that having a deliberate process to develop our people is critical for BlackRock's success and our
connectivity with our clients. At our most recent board meeting in September, we spent two days reviewing 320
individuals at BlackRock across the entire firm to identify BlackRock's best talent. This is an annual exercise and
includes a process to develop each of those individuals as global leaders, as global investors and as global citizens. This
might mean moving into a new region of the world or into a new business, and it helps to develop a team that will be
deeper with broader and global experience, which will enable us to have better investors and better leaders in the
future.

The leadership changes we announced in the second quarter, is an example of how we do this. The move involves new
roles for 10 senior leaders across the firm and those leaders are now in their new seats driving growth, enhancing our
value proposition for our clients.
Finally, BlackRock's global diversified platform is a critical component of our strategy. BlackRock is the only asset
manager to offer active and index capabilities globally across all asset classes on one platform, and we are constantly
looking to innovate to find new ways of meeting our clients' needs.
When we combine our people, our technology and risk management investment platform and wrap it all in the One
BlackRock culture, the totality of the firm comes together to serve our clients' needs. Nothing here is accidental.
BlackRock was built to highlight these strengths and to minimize the risk of getting it wrong. And while we will never
compromise on our philosophy of building our culture, sometimes we do get it wrong. And when we do, we will do
what's necessary to rebuild.
We rebuilt our scientific active equity platform which now has 96% of its assets above benchmark or peer mediums for
the last three years. And while flows have not improved as quickly as we might have expected, given the strength of the
performance, this quarter we saw inflows in scientific active equity for the first time since we did the merger with BGI.
We made changes in our Asian equity business several years ago and Andrew Swan, today, has a top quartile
three-year track record. And as you know, we're now in the process of rebuilding our U.S. fundamental equities. We
are excited about the progress and we're seeing from our new teams, and remain committed to that effort. Our
confidence in our ability to rebuild the U.S. equity platform stems in part from the success we've seen elsewhere,
highlighted by the rebuilding process we started over six years ago in our fixed income business. The investments we
made in that business are clearly paying off.
BlackRock saw $11.1 billion of net inflows in fixed income in the third quarter. And now, we have seen, in total, $48
billion year-to-date in fixed income across both active and index, reflecting the stability, the breadth and the strong
performance of our fixed income franchise.
We have a deep bench of talented senior fixed income investors, with more than 400 fixed income investment
professionals, including 150 sector specialists. They manage $1.3 trillion in AUM across a full range of high
performing active, index and iShares strategies.
With 87% of BlackRock's active taxable fixed income assets above the benchmark of peer mediums for the three-year
period, BlackRock's offerings are positioned to help clients achieve their desired investment outcomes, regardless of
their specific needs or macro expectations.
Our unconstrained fixed income strategies continue to be a core theme for clients, and we saw nearly $5 billion in
flows in the third quarter and nearly $20 billion in the last 12 months across our top quartile unconstrained bond
franchise, including SIO and Strategic Municipal Opportunities in the U.S., our Fixed Income Global Opportunities
product in Europe, as well as our flagship retail alternative fund, Global Long/Short Credit. We have seen continued
momentum early in the fourth quarter as well as heightened client interest and we expect unconstrained strategies to
remain a strong driver of growth for BlackRock going forward.
The breadth of BlackRock's Fixed Income franchise is further highlighted by our top decile Total Return and High
Yield Bond funds. In Total Return, we've seen a significant recent increase in flows and client interest, and see a
meaningful long-term growth opportunity. In High Yield, while we experienced some market headwinds in the quarter,
our performance continues to position us to win in this asset class.
As a result of BlackRock's strong active fixed-income performance track record, we're increasingly being rewarded by
Retail and Institutional gatekeepers, with improved positioning on platforms and buy lists. We see a sizable opportunity
in fixed income in the coming quarters. And we believe BlackRock is the best positioned firm in the industry to
capitalize on that opportunity, both in active and in index.
On the index side, more and more investors are recognizing iShares as an efficient tool for investors to manage market
exposure, to generate alpha through asset allocation. Investors are increasingly been turning to iShares as a core

component of their fixed income portfolios. In the first few weeks of October, we've seen more than $7 billion of net
new flows into fixed income iShares, including our Barclays Aggregate ETF, AGG. We've seen a substantial uptick in
secondary market trading volume as well exhibiting iShares' ability to provide liquidity for our clients.
BlackRock believes fixed income ETFs represent a substantial growth opportunity, given they only represent about
0.4% of the global fixed income markets. A fraction of the ETF penetration compared to the equity market where ETFs
represent about 3% of the global markets. We believe iShares can offer an attractive solution to the needs for fixed
income liquidity with nearly $200 billion of AUM across 189 fixed income ETFs. BlackRock's product breadth and
depth are key differentiators.
I need to reflect for a moment because when BlackRock acquired BGI five years ago. BlackRock's global iShares
assets under management were $385 billion. I'm proud to say that BlackRock's iShares closed the third quarter with
nearly $1 trillion of assets under management. We continue to drive global expansion and grow our iShares market
share by pursuing several areas of client ETF usage, including core investment, precision exposures and financial
instruments.
BlackRock's ability to combine active and index strategies and deliver the entire full firm to clients is critical as client
demand for investment outcomes and solutions increase. One of the most common outcome investors are targeting is to
sustain a certain level of income leading up to and through retirement. Just this month, we launched an income
campaign in Europe and the Middle East targeting advisors and consumers with the dual objective of raising brand
awareness for BlackRock as well as educating clients on the importance of income investments as part of their
portfolios.
Outcome oriented income focused products have been a significant driver of retail flows and products like SIO and
Multi-Asset Income or MAI were significant contributors to our results in the third quarter.
Our global basis or our multi-asset income franchise crossed over $10 billion in AUM, and has seen $4.5 billion of net
inflows so far in 2014. Blackrock's multi-asset franchise is a key differentiator. And our team based culture enables our
multi-asset managers to benefit from the best alpha engines and risk management capabilities BlackRock has to offer.
I'd like to turn to a business through which we serve as a trusted advisor to some of the most sophisticated financial
institutions in the world. This is our Financial Markets Advisory business or FMA business within BlackRock
Solutions.
Since BlackRock started FMA business in 2008, we have completed now more than 330 assignments for 185 clients in
30 countries generating more than $1 billion of revenues in BlackRock Solutions.
In the third quarter, we reached a significant milestone for the team and the firm. With the substantial completion of the
FMA's crisis era liquidation assignments. FMA's track record includes the risk control liquidations of long-term
wind-down vehicles, totaling more than $110 billion which resulted in strong performance for our clients. That track
record also includes supporting clients with execution advice and strategic transactions totaling more than $660 billion.
As a result of this track record of proven success and in a more stable environment marked by heightened financial
regulation, we are now helping clients position their balance sheets to maximize value and thoroughly managing risk,
including numerous assignments as part of the Dodd-Frank Stress Test in the United States, CCAR planning initiatives,
the ECB AQR and most recently in August, the FMA business of BlackRock was selected to provide consultancy
services to the European Central Bank on the design and the implementation of their ABS purchase program. This
marks a real transition for the FMA business from a crisis oriented work to differentiated advisory and consulting
services.
In all our businesses, BlackRock strives to be a trusted advisor to our clients, from institutions to end consumers. As a
trusted advisor to our clients, we also believe we have a responsibility to engage with regulators to promote a safe and
sound financial system. We know there is a growing concern for many around about liquidity and markets. We believe
our success at BlackRock depends on investors' continued confidence in the markets. And so we have a shared interest
in working with regulators on these issues.

In closing, I want to share with you the reaction to BlackRock I witnessed during the last four days, where I spent at the
IMF Annual Meetings in Washington, D.C. last week. During that time, I met with more than 30 clients, in total,
BlackRock met with 141 clients who are among the world's leading financial institutions. And I was struck by how
BlackRock's reputation and position in the financial marketplace came through in each and every meeting.
Investors are turning to BlackRock for advice and for investment solutions. And it was very gratifying time for us to be
as part of these exceptional discussions, and to see the actions clients are looking to give to BlackRock to be a thought
leader and to help them to provide them with better financial futures.
I believe BlackRock has never been better positioned to meet the needs of our clients around the world. We remain
focused on performance, we remain focused on strengthening our leadership team, we remain focused on developing
our talent, we remain focused on enhancing our differentiating platform to unlock value for our clients and of course to
our shareholders.
With that, I want to thank our leadership team and all of our employees for delivering a strong quarter, and continuing
to work towards building better financial futures for our clients.
Before we take up your questions, I wanted to mention that in addition to Gary, Matt, and myself here in New York, we
have Rob Kapito joining us on the line from Hong Kong, where he and the BlackRock team there are hosting
BlackRock's Second Annual Asia Wealth Symposium, bringing together our clients across the region.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll pause for just a moment to
compile the Q&A roster. And your first question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Robert.
<Q - Robert Andrew Lee>: Thanks. Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a question on the alternatives business. And I
think, Gary, you mentioned in your comments that obviously, you had some realizations and returns of some capital
and also had maybe some outflows from discrete hedge funds. But I mean if you look at that business, it's pretty
sizable, is it $100-odd-billion and that's one place that despite the success you've had across the firm where flows have
continued to be kind of breakeven-ish despite the size. Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on underneath
the business kind of maybe which strategies are having kind of the flow issues or some of the puts and takes, if you
will, that are going on behind it?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Robert, I'm going to open it up and then let Gary to really get into some of the details. We
are very excited about our flows and the situation we have in alternatives. We have returned some large pools of money
back to our investors. We had a huge amount of mortgage strategies that we liquidated in July that were quite
successful to our investors. And so that is a decline in our assets. But in [ph] our liquid (35:36) strategies, we do not put
those assets under AUM, until those monies are invested.
So we have a firm commitment for those monies. And that's now totaling $7 billion of flows over the last few years and
they continue to grow, and we put those monies in work over the course of the next several years. And so in reality, we
are recycling our alternative strategy quite successfully, and I believe the momentum is accelerating towards more
opportunities for BlackRock in the hedge fund arena. I'll let Gary go into some specifics, but the macro number masks
the successes we've been having.

<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, Rob. No one would like this to be a little cleaner and simpler to understand than I would
and we spent a lot of time on it. But we've got about $113 billion of total alts of which we classify $88 billion of those
effectively as core and we strip out currency and commodities from that when we think about the core business.
And I think, obviously as Larry mentioned, return on capital, it does complicate the matters a little bit. I mean,
obviously, this quarter alone we had return on capital of a little over $1 billion, which effectively matched about a little
less than $1 billion of new commitments that we raised in the current quarter.
Year-to-date that return of capital is about $2.8 billion and that was again versus last year where it was close to $3
billion. It's clear that over the last two years, I guess since the beginning of 2013, Larry mentioned, we've raised about
$9 billion in commitments.
And I think candidly we're looking for the right opportunities. In a perfect world, perhaps we would have invested
some of that money a little quicker to basically match the timing better. But obviously, we're not going to put client
interests behind what happens in our core flows in terms of return on capital versus putting the assets in the ground.
It also is impacted by a lots of ins and outs, which frankly, is the same phenomenon that impacts some of our
institutional index business. But we basically look excluding the return on capital and I know this is a little unfair, but if
we effectively exclude kind of one larger hedge fund that has frankly been a little more challenged in the last year or
so. And that the way we look at the core health of the business, that would have put up about $1.4 billion of core alts
flows in the quarter with Retail alts being about $400 million of that and Institutional being about $1 billion.
On the Retail side, that's really, again, being driven by, Larry has mentioned, our flagship Global Long/Short Credit,
but we're also now having good flows from Global Long/Short Equity. I mentioned we recently launched the new
Multi-Manager Fund, which basically pulled in about $100 million this quarter already, so that's off to a good start.
And on the Institutional side, again excluding return on capital and this one challenged hedge fund, we saw strong
flows into BAA of close to $350 million. Our fund to private equity business invested about close to $275 million in
the quarter. Real estate had about $200 million in the quarter, our Alternative Solutions, which is a key growth area,
was close to $150 million. So, there's actually very strong pockets of momentum around it. However, it takes a little bit
of commitment from you and us to make sure you can see all of that [ph] helping us (39:31).
<Q - Robert Andrew Lee>: Great. If I can maybe ask one follow up, which I'm sure is on a lot of people's minds, the
turmoil from one of your competitors and the assets that maybe kind of in play or in motion as a result of that? And I
guess, I'm particularly interested in your thoughts as it relates to the DC World where, certainly the Total Return Fund
have been pretty well entrenched and there's usually not a lot of fixed income options out there. But how do you feel
about – if you look at the opportunity set or do you feel like that's – how do you feel about your ability to kind of start
capturing some share there? And same time, are you starting to see more DC plans think about a broader range of
options within their fixed income selections?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: So, Rob, I think you identified a great growth opportunity for us. A) On the DC land,
managers are entrenched until they're not. We have had a historically very strong presence on the DC side in the index
equity and target-date products, as we have great relationships. Not because of our strong performance and breadth in
our fixed income, we have an incredible chance now to leverage those relationships and indeed we are – indeed
winning more wins on the DC side and we do believe this is going to be a great opportunity.
And in addition, as people think about fixed income, especially on the DC side, we are seeing evidence of people
moving out of a total return type of product into more unconstrained strategies too. So this is going to be an opportunity
for us in the coming years.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Hi, good morning. Okay, topic du jour, a lot of intermediate term investment dollars
in motion. So first, to what extent do certain categories of Institutional investors already have so much money managed
by BlackRock that it's hard for them to invest more with you. So like following up with Rob in DC, you're doing so
well on iShares in the DC channel, does that somehow constrain you on the fixed income side for example or are there
other categories of constraint?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Ken, we have not seen one example where our scale is and our presence with our clients are
being impacted. We actually won some business from one client already in the DC side, where when we did the BGI
merger, they were concerned about our large presence within their plans. Over the course of the year as they become
accustomed to our large presence, and they've indeed since then have awarded us more business, well we've been
awarded more business again from them. So we're not seeing any evidence of that at the moment.
I think importantly more and more clients are separating the amount of business we have in beta products versus alpha
products. So I think we're in a very good position now to take on a larger share of wallet with more clients.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Okay. Perfect. And then money in motion again, it seems to be going into cash,
short-term bond, intermediate term bond currently. What asset categories do you think are best positioned over the next
year? So for example, when capital had its issues, your money go out of equities, actually go into Pimco and into
fixed-income, so there was a big switch. Do you think there is – not to lead you, what categories do you think are best
positioned over the next year or plus?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Where are you identifying the flows, are you doing it in the mutual area. What people can't
see what's going on in the Institutional side. And let me just highlight the Institutional side first. On the Institutional
side, generally they have consultants. Generally consultants determine how given managers are perceived, and if there
is changes in perception, there is money in motion. Now, that's a slow process. In some cases, it's going to take
quarters, maybe even a year. But we have had more by recommendations added to BlackRock in the last few months
mainly because of our five-year success and performance.
And then – so much of it had to do with the timing of our success. I don't want to – there's not a single event that is
stimulating some of this. It is just because of the consistency of our positioning in fixed-income, and obviously because
the events that you're alluding to, there has been more change. Hence we are seeing more opportunities over the next
quarters and years of money in motion into various fixed-income strategies. But we're seeing more and more clients
looking at. They're looking for outcomes. They're looking for solutions. They're not moving money across asset
categories. So most of the money if it is being moved, it's being moved from one fixed-income to another fixed-income
player, and then you're seeing bias is moving.
The one area where we've just been awarded a big assignment. This is a big institution that would have been awarding
us something maybe in the total return side of fixed income and they determined to award us a large assignment in the
unconstrained fixed income.
So that's where we're seeing the bias has changed, but there is a lot of money in motion going from total return from
one shop to another shop. And I believe there is quite a bit of movement today in the Institutional side that should show
up worldwide in the next few quarters.

Your next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone. First just to hit on the margin. The adjusted result
of 44.2% looked very strong. I'm just wondering, if you could provide some color on the sustainability of this level, and
it also looks like G&A expenses were a little light driven by FX. And it's always the seasonal G&A trends in 4Q, which

tends to be higher. So maybe just provide us a little color there and maybe you can help us in terms of what kind of a
good go forward range is?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Thanks, Craig. No doubt a good question. So a couple of things on margins. Obviously, in the
context of year-over-year comparisons, you obviously have to look at the relevant quarters that you're comparing. And
so I think from Q3 to Q3, if you will, a couple of things went on, obviously we had strong beta from that Q3 to Q3
period, which obviously helps drive our revenue growth and you saw not only in addition to our organic growth, we
actually put up 15% year-over-year revenue growth, which is a pretty good number.
And on the expense side, really two things as you've mentioned, one is our G&A clearly was low in the quarter. I think
we highlighted sequentially that there was about a $51 million gap, which was primarily attributable to the FX
re-measurement and lower legal fees and expenses related to the last quarter, where we called them out as being
somewhat high.
So beta driving one direction, expense driving the other direction and then obviously, as we've mentioned, both this
quarter and last quarter, some changes in comp accruals that made quarter-over-quarter comparisons a little less
relevant. But mentioning that we really haven't changed comp philosophies and so as you look at full year accruals, I
think that's a better indicator.
Then of course, you take all of that and you go into the fourth quarter. And I think there's no question that beta
comparisons year-over-year will look much less muted. It was a strong fourth quarter in beta last year, it's not looking
like a very strong fourth quarter this year. So that will impact obviously year-over-year comparisons. We mentioned the
FX impact. So we're going in with lower spot AUM into the quarter than our average.
And as you correctly mentioned, in addition to the seasonal uptick in our M&P spend, which is actually also planned.
We've got some rougher comparisons on the performance fee because of the opportunistic fees we booked last year. So
I think if you take all of that into consideration, I would suggest that the 44.2% in the quarter is probably not something
we'd be looking to repeat in the fourth quarter. And I think as it relates to margin guidance, I think our margin guidance
hasn't changed as it relates to the overall business.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Great. Thanks, Gary. And just a follow-up on the management turnover at one of your
competitors, we've only had three business days in the third quarter results and we only have mutual fund data there,
but if you could size up the potential opportunity given your good performance, wide product menu across 401(k),
Retail and then Institutional, which one are you more excited about in terms of growth in your active bond business?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: It's still too early to determine how much is growing. It's fair to say there is a sizeable
opportunity. It's in the tens of billions of dollars. We've seen recent strong momentum, but it's going to play out over
quarters and maybe a year. And as I said, it's going to be in the core fixed income strategies, it's going to be in
unconstrained fixed income strategies. You may see people, I think there is evidence of that, you've seen some people
moving into ETFs and maybe there's a holding pattern. But I just want to underscore, we're seeing this type of flows
because of our five years of performance.
I just want to remind everybody, we had $48 billion of flows in the first nine months. And so we continue to think, it is
all about performance, it's all about positioning, it is also because of our strength in beta and alpha products and
fixed-income, so it is our platform that has also differentiated and a global positioning. So, but as I said, this is a sizable
opportunity and there is increased momentum.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good morning.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: So, yeah, kind of a big picture question here. You've got Institutional index strategies
contributing just 10% of your revenues. I think those AUM receive about a 40% weight in the conventional calculation
for organic growth. So if you exclude those assets, I think your organic growth on what we might call, revenue critical
AUM, has been ranging between 5% and 7% on a trailing year basis. I don't know many asset managers of any size,
they're flowing at that rate, perhaps I'm wrong. But it really doesn't seem like that's reflected in your multiple today. So
the question then is sort of in terms of messaging, what's it's going to take to change how investors view your organic
growth rate? And if you could maybe...
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Hopefully, you tell everybody, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Yeah. Well, a suggestion is that...
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: I mean look, it's a great point. That's one that we have been trying to tell a little bit differently
than the way you just satiated it, both at Investor Day and even today. We're trying to basically point to a concept of
organic-based fee growth being in access of organic asset growth, which is by virtue of stronger growth in our Retail
and our iShares business or obviously relative to the Institutional business and in particularly Institutional index
business.
I would say that, we do give you ways to get there in terms of the disclosure. There's ways to back that out. But I'm
mindful that it's always easier if we do that for you. And I think it's fair that we are thinking – we're always thinking
about ways to improve our disclosure and to help investors, and analysts better understand our business. And we're
actively considering whether or not we should make some changes going into next year.
I mean, we do break out on the AUM tables exactly that component of flows and obviously the beginning balance of
our Institutional index business. So you can actually go ahead and do that. And I don't want to suggest that the
Institutional index business is not a very important component of the firm. But you're right to suggest, it has lower
revenue characteristics than some of our other businesses and in that end markets such as this, the velocity of those
assets tends to be a little bit greater. So even though you're seeing $5 billion of net flows, there's basically significantly
more inflows and outflows that happen every quarter to get to that number. So we take your point. We appreciate it.
And we're going to give it a lot more thought as we go into the end of the year.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Yeah. I mean, I think the fee versus AUM basis for presenting organic growth is
interesting, but maybe it's just as simple as showing organic growth figure excluding Institutional index in your press
release that's what I might suggest? Thank you.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: And I think that's one way to do it. Though again that data is there for people who want to
figure it out.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: And I would just also say that – I don't want to dismiss the Institutional index business and
we love it, we think it's a growth area. We think it's a very important connector with our clients, as I discussed earlier,
especially even on the DC side, which is really an Institutional component. And it's a connector to so many of our other
businesses. That's the opportunity of it. So obviously Gary and team will look at it, how we better account, see how
better understanding of our growth rates and our revenues. But we don't want to dismiss a great component of our
business.

Your next question is from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey Marc.

with a forecast for 5% organic growth. And I just want to get a sense of two things, you've constructed that view that

you can get to that organic growth rate at some point in time and I think you've given us some of the building blocks.
Maybe you can just review that?
But also what kind of assumptions are embedded in a forecast like that in terms of manager replacement, obviously
there's a lot of money in motion, some of which you would have expected to be on the fixed-income side. But I'm
curious also manager replacement and volatility, how that sort of plays into that forecast, so what we should expect?
Thanks.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So Marc, again, great question. Look, 5% when we laid it out was viewed as a target. It's an
aspirational target. We're very serious about making sure we have strategies, business strategies and appropriate talent
and making sure that we provide resources to those businesses to get there. We very much still believe in the fact that
that is a number that we can achieve.
We are very much still focused on the three components of that growth with iShares being low double-digit growth,
Retail being high single-digit growth and our Institutional business being low single-digit growth obviously with faster
growing parts of that business offsetting some of the headwinds we face in DB. So we're continuing to prosecute the
strategy and we still feel incredibly comfortable about that.
I would say that it's not a quarter-to-quarter number for us. It's basically getting there on a more long term stable basis.
Obviously, I'll come back to the discussion that we just had with Luke, which is actually if you strip out some of the
more lower fee components which have been a little bit more volatile in recent quarters, one might suggest that we're
already there on a trailing 12 month basis for some of those businesses, but I'm mindful that's changing the goalpost a
little bit.
And I think in the context and Rob is on the phone, he may want to chime in. I mean, obviously there are significant
amounts of cash yet on the sidelines that when we think that gets deployed that will obviously have an important
element to our ability to attract some of those assets.
So I think we're still moving forward and we're holding people accountable to get there. And our sincere hope is that
we'll be able to – in the near term, be able to talk about getting there very consistently.

Your next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey Bill.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Just coming back to the
whole money in motion discussion, it certainly is very topical. Larry, you highlighted sort of five year track record as
being a key differentiating factor for you. How important – just coming at scale the other way, how important is scale
and capacity as well, as a consideration for the consultants, as I think about incremental opportunities maybe perhaps
from PIMCO?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I don't think it's -- well, as I said earlier, Bill, I don't think scale is a negative. I think
scale has proven to be a positive for us. And we have plenty of growth opportunities in our unconstraint area, that's
going to be the area where we'll ultimately have capacity issues. But we have measured that and we have a lot of
bandwidth to continue to grow in our unconstrained strategies. This is something we look at with our strategic product
management group. This is the group that is trying to design new products and try to eliminate the products that are
underwhelming. And I think that's another reason why we are winning so much business in so many different fixed
income strategies.
And I think the highlight is, it's not just the active fixed, we actually won an active fixed and an unconstrained fixed in
iShares fixed income, we're seeing inquiry in our model-based fixed. It is the scale and breadth of our fixed income
platform across the globe is the reason why we're having so much dialog with the consultants worldwide and it is
allowing us to be well positioned for that money that is moving. Operator?

Yes, sir. Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, guys. Larry, you guys put away paper out I think a few weeks back just on some
of the issues in the fixed income markets and some of the longer term solutions. Just given the recent volatility we've
seen, I don't know if you want to call it hiccups, but some new issues in terms of liquidity. Just wanted to get your
view, I think a lot of the things that you guys discussed in terms of the long term fixed just make a lot of sense. Some of
those things is a lot tougher to do in the near term when we may face increased volatility, given the amount of assets
that have gone into fixed income and the reduced inventory on broker/dealer balance sheets. Just want to get your
sense, what are you guys doing or what can you do to try to protect your investment returns in some of the lack of
liquidity in the markets, which is going to impact the returns for investors?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I would say overall the markets are performing quite well. There only have been a few
circumstances where you've seen really aberrant type of trading behaviors in the last few months. Any one single day
or single week you may have seen some spreads widening, but over a course of a two month to three month period of
time, they narrow back.
I think there's been some great consistency across the fixed-income market. With that said, we are worried about the
liquidity in the fixed income market especially in the corporate bond area, where there's just so many different CUSIPs
and so many different issuance and there's no consistency. And importantly this is the big role that the investment
bankers and Wall Street played in terms of providing balance sheet, and navigating your positioning within the
fixed-income universe and that balance sheet has been reduced significantly.
And so, it does at times present liquidity issues. This is why we have been so loud in stating that we need a more
expedient adoption of electronic protocols and markets. I do believe this is one of the areas where regulators need to
focus.
I spoke about this at an IMS session this past weekend, but I think it's imperative that we focus on this. As the
regulators have put more capital demands on banks, by definition the capital markets are playing a larger and larger
role in terms of financing corporations and financing different organizations.
With that in mind now, we need to be focusing on how to improve the capital markets and making sure they provide a
stable mechanism for buying and selling securities. And we're in this transition phase right now and the faster and
sooner we have this adaptation of electronic trading, the sooner we have standardization of some form of corporate
bond issuance.
And then importantly, we need behavioral changes across the board. This is going to take time and so the worry we
have is, do we have enough time before there is a true liquidity event that really destabilizes the market. And this is
why I said in my prepared statement, if we need to be working with regulators to make sure this – we have a more
stable trading environment.
We are the biggest beneficiaries in the world as the largest asset manager. We benefit when there is greater liquidity.
We need to make sure that our clients believe that investing is safe for them too, so this is key. Now, in saying that
though because we are a large client of all the different firms worldwide, if there is balance sheet that's offered just
because of our relationships, we have an advantage. But that's not a lasting type of thing and this is why we are so
much in front whether it's writing or working with regulators, working with the Street to build a more robust electronic
market.

And your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. Just a follow-up question, you mentioned a couple of things on
impacting on the Retail side, but last 12 months your organic growth rate was in the like 11%, this quarter it was 4%,
curious how much you think of that as more environmental versus maybe talk about some of successes you are pushing
through on your distribution strategies?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Sure. So as Gary suggested, we had outflows in high yield, that was environmental. We had
outflows in European equities, that was environmental. On the positive side we had inflows in other products. So I
don't – I think it speaks very loudly to our platform. I believe, obviously we want to be beneficiaries of all the areas
where there's going to be inflow, but there are going to be period of times that where our client interests are going to be
navigating out of those platforms.
We also saw even in iShares in the last few weeks of September. We saw large movement out of some European
iShares' products, European equity iShares product. So this is all environmental. We truly believe we're penetrating
more distribution channels, more RIA channels. A broader distribution channels in Europe than ever before. And so I
think we are in a very good position for whatever is money in motion in the Retail channels, we're going to continue to
see some elevated growth.
We are strengthening our positions across the world. As I talked about our strategic product group, we're evolving our
product set. So we are responding to the need of clients. And so I feel very good about how we are positioned in Retail
and iShares. And importantly, we are going to continue to build our brand and I think we have done a very good job of
building brand awareness and now we need to continue to do that and be successful in that. Gary, do you have anything
more to add.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Yeah. I mean, Glenn just – I mean, to put some numbers in perspective and then again in terms
of European equities, it happens again good – maintaining still good three-year, five-year performance there, that cost
us close to $4 billion in the quarter in Retail in outflows. And then high-yield again top decile performance and rotation
there cost us $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion for the quarter. So if you just think about the magnitude of those two products,
still with decent performance, and in fact some exceptional performance in some cases and that have the growth rate
just in the quarter alone in those two areas. So the good news is, as Larry said, we had continued strength in EMEA
Index. We had continued strength in fixed income, continued strength in multi-asset and alts that I think., without that,
obviously there would be a very different story and that's part of the diversification and stability story which I have felt.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence D. Fink
Yes. Operator. Thank you. So the last comments that Gary just said, I think is really key, as you think about
BlackRock. I think we have a unique business model, a unique culture that is differentiating us and once again allowing
us to deliver a strong third quarter. We have never been as well positioned to meet the needs of our clients worldwide.
And I think clients are turning to us more than ever before because of the consistency over 26 years of a comprehensive
and deliberate process of focusing on our culture, our team, our technology and our talent. And I think this is very
critical. And as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, when we combined our people, and our technology, and our risk
management on top of our investment platform and wrap it up with one common BlackRock culture, the totality of the
firm comes together and it serves our clients well.
And I can't say in the fourth quarter and going forward, we're going to just be as intently focused on achieving our
performance, on strengthening our leadership relationships with our clients, continuation of developing our talent. And

as Gary said, it really well, our highly diversified platform allows our investors to have a greater stability with more
consistent growth than any other asset manager.
