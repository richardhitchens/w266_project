Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will

Kenneth Gosnell
Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter earnings call for Campbell Soup's fiscal
2017. With me here in New Jersey are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; and Anthony DiSilvestro, CFO. As usual,
we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You will find the slides posted on our website this
morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. This call is open to the media who participate in a listen-only mode.
Today, we'll make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on
assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide 2 or our SEC filings
for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking
statements.
Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, which is included in our appendix. Lastly, please mark your calendars for our planned
fiscal 2018 earnings dates, we plan to release earnings on November 21, 2017; February 16, 2018; May 18, 2018; and

Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Today, I'll focus my remarks on the
marketplace, our performance, our plans and our outlook for fiscal 2018. As we've discussed previously, the operating
environment remains challenging across the food industry. While macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. continued to
improve in the quarter, the seismic shifts we've described in the past continued to alter the consumer, food and retail
landscapes. These disruptions include shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food with a focus on
fresh and health and well-being, and increased snacking behavior, a range of socioeconomic forces and technology
advancements that are reshaping the consumer shopping experience.
Additionally, there's no denying that the retailer landscape is changing dramatically with the emergence of new players,
new store formats and evolving business models. Several variables are at play, including value players expanding their
presence in the U.S., the growth of store brands and the explosion of e-commerce and meal delivery services disrupting
the market. We expect conditions to remain hyper-competitive for the foreseeable future.
In this environment what is Campbell doing to compete differently? First, we're prioritizing investments, aligning our
resources to future growth areas and creating opportunities from the disruptions in the market. Through our growth
agenda, we're focusing on four strategic imperatives to strengthen our core business and at the same time expand in the
faster growing spaces.
Second, we redesigned our retailers' selling and support capabilities in June of fiscal 2017. Our new integrated structure
aligns our sales and marketing resources to drive growth with existing customers and to pursue business in new
channels.
We're rethinking our approach to collaborating with key customers around platform merchandising such as health and
well-being and snacking. We're enhancing our data-driven shopper insights, and through our strategic foresights work,
we're better-positioned to drive innovation and customization across both the perimeter and in the center store. Most
customers have welcomed this new level of engagement and collaboration.
Third, we've established a distinct digital e-commerce business unit to address both pure play and omni-channel
opportunities. Finally, we believe that investing to differentiate our brands is the best way to appeal to consumers and
build loyalty in a crowded market.
Make no mistakes, these shifts are accelerating and converging, and they're having a dramatic impact on Campbell and
across the industry. In this environment, sales growth remains challenging. With this as backdrop, our performance in
the quarter was mixed. Organic sales declined 1%, while adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS both increased double digits.
Despite multiple headwinds, we finished fiscal 2017 within our guidance and delivered another year of growth in
adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.
For the fourth quarter, our Global Biscuits and Snacks performance was slightly below what I would've liked in terms
of the top line, but the team delivered a double-digit earnings increase versus the year-ago quarter. Americas Simple
Meals and Beverages continued to deliver against its portfolio role with sales performance in line with the categories in
which we compete and margin expansion.
I'm not happy with our performance in Campbell Fresh, but remain encouraged by the progress we've made this year to
address our key executional issues. C-Fresh delivered modest sales growth and we expect this business to return to
profitable growth in fiscal 2018.
Let me now offer my perspective on each division's performance and highlight our plans for fiscal 2018 starting with
Global Biscuits and Snacks. Overall, I'm satisfied with the performance of the division in the quarter. Organic sales
were comparable to a year ago, with expected gains in Pepperidge Farm, but below my expectations in Arnott's due to
our performance in Indonesia. Importantly, the business delivered a double-digit increase in operating earnings.
I'm particularly pleased with the performance of Pepperidge Farm snacks, especially the Goldfish brand, which once
again delivered strong sales results. In the quarter, growth was fueled by larger pack sizes. Over an extended period of

time, this team has delivered a steady cadence of innovation and effective marketing programs, while also expanding
the brand's health and well-being credentials with organic and whole grain offerings.
I'm also enthusiastic about the launch of our new Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse cookie line, a thin crispy cookie made
with simple ingredients. Farmhouse is on track to be the biggest Pepperidge Farm snack launch in more than a decade.
In Australia, the team delivered growth in biscuits behind the return to the original version of Arnott's Shapes crackers.
Additionally, our new Tim Tam gelato-inspired varieties performed well.
Segment operating earnings increased 35% as a result of our strong enabler program, a return to more normal
marketing levels and reduced administrative costs. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect to grow sales in Global
Biscuits and Snacks. In Pepperidge Farm, we intend to dial up our real food and health and well-being efforts by
emphasizing our goodness credentials. New snacking consumer insights will also shape how we connect with our
consumers, develop new packaging formats and adapt to new retail environments.
In particular, we have plans to extend Goldfish to older kids, a new demographic for the brand. We'll continue to
execute the successful marketing strategy that has led to both sales and share gains this year by investing behind our
proven Milano Moments campaign. We also plan to build on the successful launch of Farmhouse cookies and drive
increased trial of Tim Tam biscuits in the U.S. from both traditional retailers and e-commerce channels.
In Australia, we have plans to strengthen our core with new varieties of Shapes crackers, expand our health and
well-being offerings with new Arnott's Vita-Weat Cracker Chips and Cruskits products, drive on-the-go snacking with
a variety of new multi-pack single serve products. And we recently launched an integrated Arnott's master brand
advertising campaign to support the business.
Turning now to Campbell Fresh. I'm not satisfied with the performance this quarter, but I'm optimistic that our key
executional issues are now largely behind us. In the fourth quarter, Campbell Fresh returned to growth with a modest
1% increase in sales, driven by Garden Fresh Gourmet and our Farms business.
However, sales in the Beverage business declined slightly, as we continued to deal with capacity constraints largely due
to newly enhanced quality processes we've put in place both in our plant and with our new co-packer. As we previously
said, we began increasing promotional activity towards the end of the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect to ramp
up to normal promotional levels during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Let me be clear, I'm disappointed with the operating loss in Campbell Fresh this quarter, which reflects a number of
costs that are one-time in nature, including higher carrot costs, as well as increased expenses to further refine our new
quality protocols. We have plans underway to increase efficiencies as part of our overall effort to eliminate supply
constraints and improve margins, while delivering our new higher quality standards.
As I've said before, we've learned some tough lessons in C-Fresh. Despite the executional challenges, we remain
confident in the growth potential of the package fresh category, and believe our C-Fresh strategy is sound. Throughout
fiscal 2017, we took steps to build a stronger foundation for growth under our new C-Fresh leadership team.
Looking ahead, we plan for the business to grow profitably in fiscal 2018 as we return to more normal capacity and
commercial activity across the beverage portfolio. We also have a robust innovation pipeline to help fuel additional
growth, and we'll begin to introduce new beverage products to the market such as Plant Protein Milk. We also plan to
expand distribution of Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa and fresh soup.
Finally, our largest division, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, similar to other center store categories, sales
declined. Organic sales decreased 3% in the quarter, driven by soup and V8 beverages. Operating earnings increased
4%.
Let me start with our shelf-stable beverage business. Sales declined in the quarter. As we've discussed previously, the
entire shelf-stable beverage category has been hurt by ongoing consumer concerns about sugar and calories, and by
consumers shopping the store perimeter for fresh juices and other functional beverages. These trends continued to
negatively impact our V8 portfolio, in particular V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash.

However, V8 100% Vegetable Juice and V8 +Energy continue to meet the demands of consumers seeking beverages
that deliver health and well-being benefits. In the quarter, consumption of V8 Vegetable Juice increased behind our
ongoing media investment focused on our core baby boomer consumers, and we expanded distribution of V8 +Energy.
Looking ahead, as discussed at our Investor Day, we have a clear strategy to improve performance of the V8 brand with
continued focus on V8 Vegetable Juice, the revitalization of V8 Blends with new benefits-focused messaging on the
front of the label and steady growth of V8 +Energy. While our performance will improve, we do not expect this
business to return to growth in fiscal 2018.
Now, let's turn to soup. As you know, this is a relatively small quarter for U.S. Soup. While consumer takeaway was
consistent with a year ago, soup sales declined 4%, all of which was related to lower retailer inventory levels.
For the year, U.S. Soup sales declined 1%. While sales of condensed soup and broth declined, I'm pleased with the
growth of our ready-to-serve portfolio, including Chunky, Slow Kettle, and the meaningful contribution from the
successful midyear launch of our new Well Yes! line.
We've modified our outlook for 2018 in U.S. Soup since we spoke in July for sales, as we now expect additional
headwinds. Let me explain. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the retailer landscape is changing dramatically
amid intense competitive activity. Each year, we enter a set of complex negotiations with our key retail partners. Our
goal is to drive growth both for our customers and for Campbell. Unfortunately, this year, we've been unable to reach
an agreement with a large customer on a promotional program for soup.
We expect this will negatively impact our U.S. Soup sales with this customer, particularly in the first half. Accordingly,
we now expect our soup sales to decline in fiscal 2018. We are taking a number of steps to mitigate the profit risk, and,
of course, we're continuing discussions with this customer to create a win-win solution.
We believe our fiscal 2018 soup lineup and promotional programs are strong, and we're pleased that they've been
well-received in the balance of the marketplace. For the upcoming soup season, we'll build on the continued launch of
Well Yes! soup and introduce five new varieties. We have compelling brand partnerships with popular movie
franchises to drive our kids' soups.
We're rolling out innovation in Swanson Broth. We have robust holiday plans across the portfolio. We're launching the
new Chunky Maxx line with 40% more protein, and we have strong integrated marketing, including a new Chunky
campaign that fully leverages our NFL sponsorship. We'll continue to work closely with all of our customers to
maximize the sales opportunity during the upcoming soup season.
And now, a quick update on the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods. You may have seen recent media reports
regarding a lawsuit involving the estate of one of the co-founders and Pacific. Campbell is not named in the suit, and
we're not going to comment on the litigation. We remain enthusiastic about Pacific. It will add another purpose-driven
brand with a track record of growth to our portfolio. We're working to resolve outstanding issues so that we may
complete this transaction in the coming months.
A highlight for fiscal 2017 was our successful multi-year cost savings initiative. As announced this year, we increased
our target by $150 million and now expect to deliver $450 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2020.
We remain committed to managing costs aggressively and reinvesting a portion of the savings back into the business in
fiscal 2018 to position the company for long-term growth. As we outlined in July, we're focusing our investments on
our four strategic imperatives, as we believe these areas will be future growth drivers of our business. First, as I
mentioned earlier, we created a new e-commerce business unit to scale our capabilities across North America,
including content creation, data analytics and forging new partnerships.
Expanding our e-commerce organization is critical to capture more than our fair share of the rapidly growing market
for online grocery, which we expect to reach $66 billion annually by 2021. We're in a good position to do so with
experienced digital and e-commerce leadership in place and a solid strategy to develop new capabilities.

Second, we're targeting increased investment in snacking, as consumers continue to seek new and better-for-you
snacking options. The snacking market is worth approximately $125 billion in the U.S. alone and growing around 3%.
We plan to invest in people and resources to expand our business beyond cookies and baked snacks to other snacking
and mini-meal categories.
Third, we'll continue to invest in our real food credentials in our core business, including adding more vegetables and
whole grains, converting all our soups to chicken with no antibiotics while continuing to eliminate artificial colors and
flavors from our products and completing the removal of BPA from the lining of our cans in the U.S. and Canada.
Finally, in the health and well-being space, we plan to invest across the company, focusing on food with attributes such
as natural, organic, functional and fresh. Additionally, for the longer term, we'll continue to fund Habit, our
personalized nutrition startup. We're applying the learnings from our successful beta test in San Francisco as we expand
the service nationally. We continue to expect multiple business models to emerge that ultimately will create value.
These four strategic imperatives represent significant growth potential for Campbell, as we continue to differentiate our
company and our brands over time. The rapidly evolving marketplace requires new approaches and smart investment to
engage with new and existing customers to make our brands more relevant to new generations of consumers while
satisfying our loyal core consumers, and to explore new models of innovation. This longer-term view sometimes comes
at the expense of shorter-term performance.
We have our eye on the long-term targets as we continue to believe that they are attainable. However, to achieve them,
we must further invest to diversify our portfolio toward the faster growing consumer spaces of health and well-being
and snacking, while increasing our participation in the growing e-commerce space. And we must do this while raising
the bar on transparency and making our food more real and more sustainable.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect sales growth in both Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh.
However, we expect sales to decline in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. As I outlined earlier, U.S. Soup sales
will be negatively impacted by lower promotional support with a large customer. Additionally, we do not expect our
V8 beverage business to grow in fiscal 2018.
Given the difficult operating environment, the outlook for our Americas division and our plan to invest back in the
business for the long term, we expect net sales to change by minus 2% to 0%, adjusted EBIT to change by minus 1% to
plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by 0% to plus 2%. This guidance excludes the pending acquisition of Pacific
Foods. Anthony will walk you through additional details during his remarks.
In closing, across the industry, the pace of change and disruption continues to accelerate. We expect the operating
environment to remain challenging in fiscal 2018. Campbell is prepared to address the short-term challenges we're
facing and make the necessary investments to position the company for long-term growth. Our purpose, growth agenda,
and strategic imperatives provide the guide as we take the steps to be the leading health and well-being food company.
Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro.
Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Thanks, Denise, and good morning. Before reviewing our results, I wanted to give you my perspective on the quarter.
Importantly, as you saw in our press release this morning, we finished fiscal 2017 with performance consistent with our
most recent guidance.
I'm very pleased with the progress we've made against our $450 million cost-saving target by 2020. We ended 2017
with program to-date savings of $325 million. Cost savings, together with productivity gains, have contributed to
another year of gross margin expansion.
We are disappointed with the performance of the Campbell Fresh division. As we said, we believe that we have the
right strategy for this business, we are addressing the executional issues, and we look forward to returning this business
to top and bottom line growth in 2018.

We are providing guidance for 2018, which is below our long-term targets. As I'll discuss, we have not been able to
reach agreement on the promotional program with a key customer in our U.S. Soup business and anticipate this to have
a negative impact on sales.
In terms of EBIT performance, while we expect to generate incremental cost savings and drive gross margin expansion,
we are increasing our level of reinvestment in the business. I'll discuss the factors impacting the guidance in my
remarks.
Now, I'll review our results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, as reported net sales declined by 1% to $1.664
billion. Organic sales also declined by 1%, reflecting declines in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.
Adjusted EBIT increased 11% to $282 million, reflecting on an adjusted basis lower marketing and selling expenses
and a higher gross margin percentage, partly offset by the sales decline.
Adjusted EPS increased 13% or $0.06 to $0.52 per share. For the full year, both as reported and organic net sales
declined by 1% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT increased 2% compared to the prior year, driven by a higher
adjusted gross margin percentage and lower adjusted administrative expenses which benefited from lower incentive
compensation costs, partly offset by lower sales volume, and adjusted EPS benefiting from share repurchases increased
3% to $3.04.
Breaking down our sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales declined 1% driven by lower volume, primarily
in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, reflecting the impact of lower retailer inventory levels on soup sales and
declines in V8 beverages.
Overall, promotional spending rates were comparable to their prior year as increases in Americas Simple Meals and
Beverages were offset by lower rates in Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh. Within Americas Simple
Meals and Beverages, promotional spending rates were up in Canada to hold key promoted prices following our list
price increase and also in V8 beverages.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, promotional rate reductions were primarily driven by lower levels of spending in
Arnott's biscuits. And in C-Fresh, promotional activity remained lower as we managed through our beverage supply
constraints. And although it rounds to zero on the chart, we did have a slightly positive impact from currency
translation, principally the Australian dollar, bringing the change in our as-reported sales to minus 1%.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage increased 80 basis points in the quarter. First, cost inflation and other factors had
a negative impact of 110 basis points. On a rate basis, cost inflation was about 1.5%, and in Campbell Fresh, we
experienced higher carrot costs and costs related to beverage supply constraints and enhanced quality protocols. These
negative drivers were partly offset by benefits from our cost savings initiative and mark-to-market gains on open
commodity contracts. Promotional spending, mix and pricing had little to no impact on the quarter.
Lastly, our supply chain productivity program which is incremental to our cost savings program, contributed 180 basis
points of margin improvement. All in, our adjusted gross margin percentage expanded 80 basis points to 36.9%.
Adjusted marketing and selling expenses declined 12% in the quarter, primarily due to lower advertising and consumer
promotion expenses, as we lapped the prior year quarter in which marketing levels were significantly above historical
level. We are also benefiting from our cost savings initiatives.
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 5%, reflecting the benefit from our cost savings initiatives. For additional
perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance
and below-the-line items.
Adjusted EPS increased $0.06 from $0.46 in the prior-year quarter to $0.52 per share in the current quarter. On a
currency-neutral basis, the improvement in adjusted EBIT had a $0.06 impact on EPS. Share repurchases reduced our
share count adding $0.01 EPS benefit.

Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter increased by 80 basis points to 37.2%. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter reflects
an unfavorable timing impact, as well as the geographic mix of earnings. This was partly offset by lapping the negative
impact of a $13 million correction for deferred tax expense in the prior year.
The higher tax rate reduced adjusted EPS by $0.01. As expected, the adjusted tax rate for the full year was 32.4%. And
while adjusted interest expense was up $1 million, as higher rates were mostly offset by lower average debt, this had no
impact on EPS for the quarter. Currency translation also had no impact on EPS, completing the bridge to $0.52 per
share.
Now, turning to our segment results. In Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, organic sales declined 3% driven
primarily by declines in soup and V8 beverages. Sales of U.S. Soup in this non-seasonal quarter declined 4%, reflecting
declines in condensed, broth and ready-to-serve. The lower sales were driven by reductions in retailer inventory levels,
while consumer takeaway in measured channels was comparable to year ago.
For the full year, sales of U.S. Soup declined 1%, as declines in condensed and broth were partly offset by growth of
ready-to-serve soups. Operating earnings increased 4% in the quarter to $198 million. The increase was primarily
driven by lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses and lower administrative expenses, partly offset by
lower sales volume and a lower gross margin percentage.
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period
ending July 30, 2017, the category as a whole declined 40 basis points. Our sales performance was better than the
category, declining just 10 basis points. We had a 58.8% market share for the 52-week period and as we outperformed
the category, we gained 20 basis points of market share.
Our share gains in ready-to-serve reflected improved performance of Chunky and the launch of Well Yes! and were
mostly offset by lower share in broth, which was impacted by increased private label activity. Private label grew share
by 130 basis points, finishing at 14.1%. All other branded players collectively had a share of about 27%, declining 150
basis points.
In Global Biscuits and Snacks, organic sales were comparable to the prior year, as gains in Pepperidge Farm, reflecting
continued growth in Goldfish crackers, were offset by declines in our Arnott's business in Indonesia. Operating
earnings increased 35% to $109 million, reflecting a higher gross margin percentage, lower advertising and consumer
promotion expenses, and lower administrative expenses.
In the Campbell Fresh segment, organic sales increased 1%, driven primarily by higher sales of Garden Fresh Gourmet
and Bolthouse Farms carrots and carrot ingredients. Sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages declined slightly,
reflecting the impact of supply constraints. Looking ahead, with increasing internal capacity and additional co-packer
capacity now coming online, we expect to have sufficient capacity to support our growth plan in fiscal 2018.
Operating earnings decreased from $8 million to a loss of $8 million, reflecting higher administrative expenses, higher
carrot costs and the cost impact of further improvements in our quality processes and related beverage capacity
constraints. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter are below our year-to-date run rate, reflecting additional costs,
primarily related to one-time inventory and asset write-offs.
While not to the record level generated last year, we had another strong year in cash flow performance. Cash from
operations was $1.291 billion compared to $1.491 billion in 2016. The decline was due to lapping last year's working
capital reduction, lower cash earnings and lower receipt on hedging activities. Capital expenditures ended the year at
$338 million, about equal to last year.
We paid dividends totaling $420 million compared to $390 million in 2016. The increase reflects our 12% increase in
the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share earlier in the fiscal year. In aggregate, we repurchased $437 million of shares
in fiscal 2017, $400 million of which were under our strategic share repurchase program. The balance of the
repurchases were made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. Net debt of $3.2 billion was comparable to
last year, as cash from operations was offset by capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases.

Now, I'll review our 2018 outlook. We expect sales to change by minus 2% to 0%, adjusted EBIT to change by minus
1% to plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by 0% to plus 2%. This guidance assumes that the impact of currency
translation will be nominal. We are forecasting sales growth in both Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh.
However, we expect sales in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages to decline.
As Denise discussed, we expect U.S. Soup sales to be negatively impacted by lower promotional support with a key
customer. We currently estimate the impact to be about 1 percentage point on total company sales. And while we
expect to make progress in turning around our V8 beverage business, we do not expect growth in 2018.
While adjusted EBIT is benefiting from our cost savings program and productivity improvements, we are increasing
the level of reinvestment in the business to drive long-term growth. As we discussed at our Investor Day meeting, we
are investing in e-commerce, snacking, real food and our health and well-being initiatives. We are also forecasting an
increase in the rate of cost inflation and face an incentive compensation headwind representing 2 percentage points of
EBIT.
Adjusted EPS reflects the anticipated benefit from our strategic share repurchase program, partly offset by higher
interest expense. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, I will say that we expect significantly weaker
performance in the first half and relatively better performance in the second half of this fiscal year.
Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance. As I've mentioned before, we have seen an increase
in cost inflation. Looking ahead to 2018, we are forecasting cost inflation in the range of 2% to 3%, driven by
ingredients and packaging increases on dairy, wheat, steel cans, resins and corrugated. Cost inflation also includes
higher wages and medical benefit costs. As we've successfully delivered in the past, we expect ongoing supply chain
productivity gains, excluding the benefit of our cost savings program, of approximately 3% of cost of products sold.
Against our cost savings program, we expect to deliver an additional $60 million to $70 million of cost savings, most of
which will impact COPS. With productivity and cost savings ahead of inflation, we expect to deliver a modest
improvement in our gross margin percentage.
Below the line, our adjusted interest expense is expected to increase to approximate $120 million to $130 million,
reflecting the impact from our sale of intercompany notes to a third-party bank in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
We expect that effective tax rate to be approximately 32%, slightly below the 2017 rate of 32.4%. We expect to
continue buying back shares under our strategic share repurchase program. However, given the pending Pacific Foods
acquisition, we anticipate the level of repurchases will be below 2017 level.
Lastly, we are forecasting capital expenditures of approximately $400 million, which is an increase from 2017
spending, reflecting our recently announced initiative to build a forward deployed warehousing and distribution system
in the U.S.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn it back to Ken for the Q&A.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Hi. Denise, I have a question I guess on the fiscal 2018 outlook, more broadly that pertains to
Campbell, but obviously some other food names too that have sort of similar fiscal years and have recently provided
their own sort of 2018 guidance. I guess the pattern that has emerged is still some expectation of sales growth that will
be below what we all like to see given the tough environment that you've talked about, but still some earnings growth
given the flow-through of cost saves and such.
And I guess in Campbell's case, the company's made some very big bets around growth of your assets within C-Fresh
and snacking. And I guess I wonder if – you've talked about reinvestment this year, but I guess [ph] sort of as (39:41)
consideration to maybe spending even much more upfront to realize the promise of these growth areas. Even if it
means, let's say, lower EPS for a year or two in order to revive the top line maybe more sustainably, even though I
know that's not a super-pleasant thought process, I guess my question is really around the concept of reinvestment
versus a rebase from an EPS standpoint, just so we don't run the risk of maybe repeating as a group this sort of scenario
over time.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Andrew, you raise a very good point and it's always a very thoughtful process to balance
the performance in the short term with significant long-term investments. In this environment and for the last several
years, we have been acting very decisively and aggressively. When you think about it, we bought five companies in the
last five years if you include the pending acquisition of Pacific, we divested lower-performing businesses.
We have closed several manufacturing facilities and consolidated assets and invested to give us much more flexibility
and cost savings in our supply chain. We realized our cost savings program over-delivering the $300 million a year
early and setting a goal for another $150 million which we have a line of sight to, and we really amped up new models
of innovation going into places that we haven't gone before.
So we haven't been sitting still for a moment. And this continued stream of investment is on top of all of that activity.
And we believe that the investments that we're making really are in sufficient support in 2018 to get these ideas
jump-started and/or continue to invest where we have already been activating. And so I am comfortable with the fact
that it's the right level of investment, and we're still able to show some EPS and EBIT growth in the process.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Great. Thanks. Hi, Denise. Good morning. I know this is probably a difficult one to
elaborate on, but I wanted to come back to the negotiation issue that you highlighted in the soup category. Given the
importance of soup to your overall profitability and supply chain, I'm just curious if you can give us any more context
on why you felt it was necessary to exercise this level of discipline and really sort of stand on principle here. Is that a
function of that particular retailer making unrealistic demands? And how do you think about the risks of that translating
into other categories or potentially a loss of shelf space or display that's hard to rectify going forward?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. We don't necessarily comment on the specifics with a customer, but let me answer
the question more in aggregate. Our negotiations with customers for soup season involve joint business planning with
plans for spending and merchandising linked to a sales goal. And what we seek are win-win-win solutions, win for the
consumer, win for the customer and win for Campbell.
And so in this particular situation, we were not able to achieve that negotiation. And so what I can tell you though is
our programs are strong, our A&C investment is robust and our new products are really unique with the Well Yes! and
Chunky Maxx. And they've been really well received by customers in general in the marketplace. And we'll continue to
keep the dialogue open and strive for that win-win-win solution.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, understood. And I'm not sure if these factors are related, just quick follow-up. But
does the trade inventory reduction that occurred in Q4 have anything to do with the sort of the lead into the fall and
changes with that same customer, or is that something a bit broader across the retailer environment?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, I would say, they're unrelated, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Great. Thanks, both.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great. Thank you and good morning.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, David.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: I want to just go back a little bit. So the Analyst Day – I walked away from Analyst
Day really thinking that you were quite optimistic about the situation that it was changing, Denise, in a positive way.
So the negative 2% to 0% revenue guidance comping negative 1% from the year, it's pretty disappointing. But it doesn't
even seem like it's all related to this. Anthony, I think you said the impact from this soup issue is negative 1 percentage
point. But – so can you just comment on the fullness of this guidance? Is there something else here, because negative
2% to 0%, it just – it doesn't seem to [ph] flick (45:16 ) to some of the stuff that I thought you were saying at Analyst
Day about the turnaround in C-Fresh and these opportunities in biscuits? I just feel like we're getting a bit more
negative of a figure today, and maybe it's not only related to the soup issue, but would just love for you to elaborate if
you can.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah. So, if I think about it and its component, and as Denise said, we do expect to see
top line growth in Campbell Fresh in 2018 as we get the capacity for beverage back up to where we need to be, we turn
on the promotional program. That's kind of happening now as we speak, so we do expect growth there.
We do expect growth in Global Biscuits and Snacks. The Pepperidge Farm business driven by Goldfish had performed
well, so we expect that to continue. Fresh bakery is a little bit of a drag on that portfolio; frozen is a little bit of a drag
on that portfolio. Arnott's, we expect a little bit of growth and we expect to turn around or stabilize our business in
Indonesia. So I would say, in Global Biscuits and Snacks, a little bit of growth.
As you pointed out, on Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, two negative drivers, one is now the issue on U.S. Soup
and the other is the expected decline, although hopefully to a lesser degree on our V8 beverage businesses. So that gets
you into negative territory in aggregate. And I think the range reflects some expectation and some realization of the
environment in which we're operating, and that's how we came to a decision to go down to that minus 2% as to the
lower end of the range. So...
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: One follow-up on the specific issue, just to be clear, it's a promotion problem that
you're having for the soup season. It sounds then that – is this a true statement? You've not been delisted, you've not
lost shelf space. You're just not getting the promotions that you would've otherwise expected to get during the soup
season. Is that fair?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, that is fair. So it will show up on the financials. It will look like a reduction in
trade and a lower trade rate. That will flow through to lower volumes which we think will more than offset the trade
reductions, so therefore lower sales. It will have some negative impact on EBIT, and we're looking for ways to mitigate
the bottom line impact through incremental cost savings and a redeployment of some of that trade elsewhere.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thank you so much, I'll pass it along.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hi. Thanks so much.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Kenneth Gosnell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: If I can just ask a quick one on soup and then a more general follow-up on soup. Just on
the timing, thank you for the help in terms of – you mentioned the first half. I'm just curious, has it started to affect your
business, I'm just talking to the loss of the promotion in the first quarter, or is it more of a second quarter issue? Why
doesn't it affect the third quarter as much? I'm just trying to get a little bit of sense of timing as we sort of model this
out. I'll leave it there, and then I'll go to the follow-up if I can.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah. There is two things, one is the seasonality of soup. So it is going to impact both
the first quarter and then the second quarter. And the reason that you don't see it is less so in the back half is how the
in-season and out-of-season pricing works on soup. So the big delta that you'll see on shelf prices is really a first half
in-season issue and not so much when we get out-of-season in the back half.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. But that's exclusive of seasonality, we should start modeling this fairly
immediately in 1Q, is that the message we should take away or is it unclear exactly when this sort of...
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: No, I would agree with that.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Yeah. Okay. And then just my follow-up is, we've heard some of your peers talk about
the more challenging negotiating environment with customers in general. One individual said it's not like it was 20
years ago where you just send a fax out and announce a price increase, it's a lot harder than it used to be. I think that's
apparent. But I'm just questioning or curious, rather, for this particular issue with the lost promo, do you look at it as a
real one-off, I guess, challenge to you, or is this indicative of a more difficult environment out there, something that
you may have to deal with a little bit longer and more broadly in the future?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. Yeah, I think that the – again, as I said, I think the retailer environment right now is
hyper-competitive. I mean, you've got the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods, the expansion of Lidl and Aldi creating
some new retail formats and some escalated competition in the marketplace. However, I'm optimistic that retail
continues to morph. I mean, I remember, and I'm going way back, when club stores and supercenters were a new
format. And the retailer market and companies like ours adjust to that.
So we're really focused on making our brands accessible in multiple channels, and we believe that the new sales design
that we have will help us in that effort. So yes, I do think these are challenging times, and I do think that as the
consumer changes, retailers will change with the consumer, and we've got to do the same.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Thanks. Have a good holiday.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: You too.

<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hello, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just question on snack investments, I think you had mentioned that it was one of the themes
in the Investor Day in July, and you referenced it again today on the call. So, Denise, can you just sort of give us a little
bit more color in terms of the type of investments? Would it be reconsidering maybe more M&A in the snacking
world? Is it packaging formats, launching new products? Just trying to get a sense for I guess what we should look for
in terms of being able to identify where you've sort of expanded in snacking and what those types of investments would
be.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right. So in the snacking area, I'll take it in three parts. The first is our internal
innovation, and we have real insights about the frequency of consumer snacking and mini meal consumption now five
times a day as opposed to only about a third of the population eating three square meals. So we think that's a very rich
space for us to expand with our brands internally.
So we have a concerted effort across the enterprise to really look at a series of platforms that we've identified and bring
health and well-being more into the front and center on snacking, starting with mindful kids snacking, which we think
is a good base for us. So the investment is really in the people and resources to amp up that internal innovation.
The second part of it is partnerships, and we're continuing to look at partnerships like Chef'd, for example, where we
can actually incorporate our brands into new models and accessible channels. And then the third would be smart M&A.
And we continue to be very disciplined about the M&A that we do, and this will be no different. But this is an area
where we have an interest, particularly in the better-for-you snacking arena. So it's really a three-pronged approach, but
we do believe that's a very robust space for us as a company across the enterprise.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: If I remember correctly, you've set revenue targets over, I guess, maybe the medium term
for each segment to sort of gain incremental revenue from snacking. Do you expect that in this fiscal 2018 that there
will be some incremental revenue in 2018 from these initiatives?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. I think that's built into the growth expectations for the Global Biscuits and Snacks
division. And some of the innovation that we will be developing will also be hitting the marketplace in future years.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great, thanks. Have a great holiday weekend.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: You too, Bryan.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Good morning. Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. You had a little break there. So let
me get back to the – just one more follow-up, please, on the major customer soup decision here. Is this just a simple – I
mean, you said you didn't lose shelf space, is this just as simple as a competitive issue that maybe surprised you a little
bit where someone else is selling in promotional aggressively, and that's maybe a little surprising giving some of the
recent plant moves that have been made? I mean, is there any truth to that statement?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I'm comfortable that we've given you the information that we're willing to disclose. So
beyond that, I don't believe we should be talking about the details.
<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Okay. Let me take it this way then. For your other nine of your top 10 customers where this
didn't happen, what are the factors, when you think about this soup season, that – or like what data do you provide
them, what are the factors that you're very excited about that allow you to maybe keep the kind of promotions you've
had there? I mean, is it – what data do you share with them that make those negotiations go well?

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. We have a very disciplined robust process with our customers in joint business
planning, which starts with discovery of opportunities, development of ideas, decisions made, and then delivery and
execution. And so we have been working on these joint business plans for many years with many customers.
They really involve things like pricing, merchandising, shelf, performance, consumer activation, customization,
packaging, product assortment. They're very, very comprehensive strategic plans that we co-develop with our
customers. And we have very strong programs this year and very robust plans with customers. So I'm optimistic with
this other one situation that we will get to a win-win solution.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning, folks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Thank you for allowing me to ask a question. Hello, hello. Hope summer is treating you well.
I'm going to follow up on Feeney's question, because I feel the need. The issue with the soup promotion, maybe you're
willing to disclose whether or not it was a retailer choosing to opt into other categories, so no longer showing the [ph]
same real (57:17) support behind soup. Is that the issue here or is it – is it – kind of to Feeney's question, no, no, it's just
a different brand within soup that they're going to promote this year?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We're not experiencing this in other categories.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, I guess is – it's really hard for us to tell you what the retailer's promotional
program is going to be in the category. We know what it is vis-à-vis our product, but it's hard for us to sit here and say
we know what they're going to do with respect to the other brands within this category. I will add that this situation
with this retailer is unique to this soup category, and not to the other categories in which we participate even with this
retailer. So it is confined to soup, and again it's really hard for us to say what that retailer is going to do.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. So the jury's still out on whether or not they're just pulling back on the category in
aggregate. Wait and see there. Let me ask a different question, and kind of taking the other side of Andrew Lazar's
question on, do you need to spend more, and ask the question of, are you spending way too much on this portfolio.
You're talking about upping capital investment for services, but arguably there's ample third-party capacity out there,
but you'll burn a lot of cash to replicate that.
And you continue – I mean, you've pulled back a lot on A&P, but the spend level isn't necessarily anemic in context of
the industry. Denise, given the seismic shifts and the acceleration of these shifts, all the things that you're talking about,
why aren't you making more seismic shifts? Why aren't you [ph] pulling (58:53) back, shoring up more cash to really
accelerate this portfolio pivot in transformation outside of just sort of these smaller bolt-on incremental moves that
you've been pursuing for the last few years?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We believe that we have the right balance of strengthening our core business, and at the
same time expanding into faster growing spaces. So again, we believe that we are spending adequately and
aggressively in our Global Biscuits and Snacks and our Campbell Fresh business to build those very on-trend
categories.
Just a reminder though, the Soup business is still a very large and profitable business for us. And we have to keep our
brands differentiated and relevant. And so we've been really investing very specifically in the real food credentials of
our core business to better satisfy consumers and customers, and innovation to keep the center store robust, which is

definitely needed in today's environment.
That said, we have had really good margin expansion in the category, and we're operating as a company very
profitably. So I do think that if there are – there are M&A opportunities out there that we can bolt-on or supplement
what we're doing, we are open to that. But we're again very disciplined about our approach to that.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now
open.
<Q - David Palmer>: Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Good morning.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Good morning. Just a quick one on – you mentioned in the opening remarks retailer brands as
part of the description of the challenges facing food producers out there. In the past you talked about retailer brand push
in broth. Could you just talk about retailer brands and the threat or the market share shifts that are going on there
vis-à-vis broth and particularly as it relates to your fiscal 2018 outlook? Thanks
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah. Private label has definitely been around for a long time and has traditionally been
below average share in our categories and acknowledging the fact that we did feel the impact on Swanson Broth this
year. We believe in a world of private label that the best insulation is brand differentiation and that's where we're
focused. And so the other – the flip side of it is in the Fresh business we do participate with store brands in some of our
fresh categories. So it's not a one-size-fits-all on how to work in an environment with private label.
<Q - David Palmer>: So do you feel like you've – with broth, in particular, you've stabilized things versus private
label and you have the right programs to make sure that those shared trends are at least not going to get worse?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. We have specific plans to differentiate broth this year.
<Q - David Palmer>: Great. Great. Thank you.
