In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the
webcast will be available on our website later today.
Before we begin today's comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments
on this call will include forward-looking statements. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in
our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.
On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of
the Board; we also have Mark Johnson with us today; and also Rick Coleman who manages our expansion and
construction activities. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who
will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported third quarter 2011 net income attributable to common stock of $1.1 billion or $1.10 per share,
compared with $1.2 billion or $1.24 per share for the third quarter of 2010. Our third quarter results included additional
tax provision of approximately $50 million or $0.05 a share associated with Peru's new mining tax and royalty regime.
For the first nine months of 2011, we reported net income attributable to common stock of $3.9 billion or $4.10 per
share, compared with $2.7 billion or $2.94 per share for the comparable period of 2010.
Our third quarter 2011 consolidated copper sales of 947 million pounds were slightly higher than what we estimated in
July of 940 million pounds primarily because of the timing of shipments in North America. As anticipated, third quarter
2011 copper sales were lower than the prior year quarter sales primarily because of lower sales in Indonesia and South
America, partly offset by higher production and sales from North America.
Our third quarter 2011 consolidated gold sales of 409,000 ounces were slightly below our previous estimate of 415,000
ounces and lower than the third quarter 2010 sales of 497,000 ounces. That primarily reflected lower Grasberg
production.
Third quarter 2011 consolidated molybdenum sales of 19 million pounds were higher than our July estimate of 18
million pounds and also higher than last year's third-quarter sales of 17 million pounds.
During the third quarter of 2011, our production and sales of copper and gold were adversely affected by labor
disruptions at PT Freeport Indonesia. The estimated impact on our third quarter 2011 production including the eight
day strike in July 2011 and the ongoing strike that commenced on September 15, totaled approximately 70 million
pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold in the third quarter. Without these impacts, our third quarter 2011 sales
from Grasberg would have exceeded our forecasted production and sales because of access to higher grade ore
previously scheduled to be mined in future periods.
We've also developed revised operating plans to produce and ship concentrates at modified levels with a reduced
workforce and we sold concentrate from inventory during the third quarter, which partly mitigated the lower production
levels.
Our realized price for copper in the third quarter of 2011 averaged $3.60 per pound. That was $0.10 higher than our
realized price of $3.50 per pound in the third quarter of 2010. For gold, our recorded realization averaged
approximately $1,693 per ounce in the third quarter of 2011. That was higher than last year's realization of $1,266 per
ounce. Our third-quarter molybdenum price of $16.34 per pound was similar to the year ago period.
Our consolidated average unit net cash cost during the third-quarter averaged $0.80 per pound. That was lower than last
year's unit net cash cost of $0.82 per pound in last year's third quarter. Our higher site production and delivery costs
reflected lower copper sales volume in Indonesia and South America and increased mining and milling activities in
North America. We had higher molybdenum and gold and silver credits which more than offset these higher site
production and delivery costs.
Operating cash flows during the third quarter of 2011 totaled $1.8 billion. That was significantly above capital
expenditures, which totaled just over $700 million during the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2011, operating
cash flows totaled $5.9 billion and capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt
approximating $3.5 billion and our consolidated cash position was $5.1 billion. FCX has approximately 948 million

common shares outstanding.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slides and materials on our website.
Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning, everyone. Slide three has the details on the financial results that Kathleen talked
about and I want to just speak to a couple of things that she mentioned. In terms of assessing our production numbers
and our financial results for the third quarter, there are a couple of factors that I'd like to point out.
First, we – our long-term mine plan as our guidance in the second quarter reflected, provided that we would have been
in a lower grade material in the Grasberg mine than we were a year ago without the strike. So our guidance going into
the third quarter before the strike situation projected lower numbers and – because of this grade issue. Now as always,
our team on the ground works to find ways of getting access to higher grade materials and adjusting the mine plan to
optimize those plans. And that was the part of the process that is reflected in this – in the results that we achieved.
The strike had a significant impact on this. As Kathleen said, both the work stoppage in early July and then the ongoing
strike that started in mid September reduced our third quarter copper production by 70 million pounds from what it
otherwise would have been and 100,000 ounces. So that is an adverse impact to us. It results in lower taxes and
royalties to the government of Indonesia than there otherwise would have been because of that. And of course, the
workers who are on strike are not being paid. So all of us, all the stakeholders have a strong incentive to try to resolve
the strike and we're committed to trying to do that on a fair basis.
But we did revise our operating plans. We – our management team on the ground at PT-FI, our Indonesian national
staff people and contractors and some of the workers that revolt on the union allowed us to operate on a reduced basis.
Our mill has operated in recent days at 75% to 80% of capacity. We're operating in the mine at roughly two-thirds of
our normal rates. Our underground operations have ramped up and we've been able to ship concentrate inventory with
some disruptions, but shipping inventory to the port and loading cells. We'll continue to do that.
There is uncertainty about how this will proceed in the fourth quarter. Our hope is and what we're certainly working
towards is to get this strike resolved on a mutually satisfactory basis with all parties so that we can go back to totally
normal operations. Without that, we will continue to work to the extent we can with our reduced workforce. We've
been pretty effective with that, but it does create a degree of uncertainty about what will transpire prior here in the
fourth quarter. And as you look at the fourth quarter results, projections – you need to take that into account.
Our revised annual guidance is of 980 million pounds of copper is 50 million pounds lower than the previous estimate
in July and gold is consistent with our previous estimates, but it does reflect lower copper and gold volumes than we
otherwise would achieve if we hadn't had to deal with this reduced workforce because of the strike.
Turning to slide four, not only are we dealing with the strike, we're dealing with the macroeconomic uncertainties
around the world today that caused copper prices to drop dramatically during the third quarter in creating the current
situation involving the macroeconomic impact on the financial markets. We are financially strong. We demonstrated
during the 2008 crisis our ability to adjust to adverse conditions.
Of course, today's conditions are nowhere nearly as significant for us as they were then, but another factor to point out
is just how much stronger financially we were than at that time. We reduced our debt to a level that's below the amount
of cash that we already have and at today's copper price of $3.30 and our ability to produce copper this year at less than
$1 a pound indicates that we are – we're very profitable in generating – continuing to generate substantial cash in
excess of our capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements.
And so we're confident of our ability to operate in the current condition and we continue to be very optimistic about our
commodities for the future. We are not changing any of our operating plans or our capital spending plans because of
the current conditions. And as we work to resolve the strike issues we have in Indonesia, the labor issue we have in
Peru at Cerro Verde. And as we deal with the macroeconomic uncertainties around the world today, our management

team is focused on running our business in a safe and efficient way and focused on future growth because of our
optimism about the future for our commodities.
Slide five shows our cost situation. One thing that I'm very proud of all of our operations on is, even though commodity
prices have risen in recent years, we continue to have a real focus on constraining costs. And as a commodity producer,
that's always a key factor and our team has done a good job of mitigating some upward cost pressures that have to do
with input costs. And also just the competition for goods and services in our industry. And as you can see from the
numbers that we're reporting today, we've done a good job for it. Our unit cost before by-product credits is up slightly
from the second quarter, but by-product credits are higher because – principally because of the higher gold price and
we ended up with a net unit cost of $0.80 a pound for the third quarter.
I mentioned markets, and we've got the price movements of copper, gold and molybdenum on slide six. There is
currently a disconnect between the financial markets' view of copper and their view of producers' equities like ours and
the physical markets that we're seeing on the ground today. The physical markets remain relatively tight in the U.S.
where growth is slower than it was going into the year and Europe's growth is slower than it's going in the year,
continue to be tight in both marketplaces. China continues to consume copper, although there are concerns about its
credit tightening activities. But on a global basis, the physical markets are much stronger than you would see as
indicated by the financial markets' reactions. And that's driven by these macroeconomic factors that create a lot of
uncertainty of where the marketplace is going.
We don't know, and we don't run our business on our ability to project these factors. We're prepared to react to the
circumstances that come to us. We want to preserve our assets, preserves our opportunities for a bright future. And
that's driven by the fundamentals of demand, because of what we believe will be global growth in future years and the
continuing supply side constraints in our business of where it continues to be difficult to find and develop new copper
mines, where there are challenges in develop and continuing to operate aging mines because of falling grades, the need
to move underground, issues with governments, communities and workforces. Volatility is part of our situation because
of the financial markets, but we are highly positive because of these fundamentals of longer-term demand, supply
constraint, about the outlook for our business and that's driving our strategy.
Couple of comments on the labor situation in Indonesia. We have worked in good faith to reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement with the union. The strike really doesn't have basis under Indonesian law. We're working cooperatively with
the government, which has designated our operations in Papua as a "Vital National Object". So the government
recognizes the importance of our operations to the community, to Papua, to the government itself.
Our pay packages have been and continue to be at the top of workers – for workers in Indonesia. We are offering a
substantial increase to pay as we talk about the new two-year contract. We see our offer as being fair and generous. We
have worked in a government designated process of having discussions including participating with the union in a
mediation process. The mediator was designated by the office of Manpower. The government of Indonesia came up
with conclusions and we accepted those conclusions. The union did not, and as I said, we are committed to working
with the union. We value our workers, our workforce in Indonesia. They've been key to our success.
Our labor cost, total labor cost at PT-FI include not only the direct pay for the mine workers, but all the support costs
that go into it. We have over 22,000 person workforce. And when we look at our labor cost at PT-FI, it is consistent
with our work – our labor cost for our other operations in terms of the percentage of that cost to the price of copper.
The reason PT-FI operations are so profitable is because of the high grade mine there. And as I said, we're committed
to being fair and generous with our workforce and are hopeful that we can reach a resolution soon.
In Peru at Cerro Verde, we also are having a strike situation and we are actively negotiating with the union with the
assistance of the government and we're working in good faith to complete a new labor agreement there. Production has
not been materially affected at Cerro Verde because of our use of our existing management group and contractors that
work with us to continue operations there. We're hopeful for a near term solution there.
As we deal with this and as we deal with today's macroeconomic situation as I said, our management team continues to
be focused on creating value from our existing assets. And on slide nine, shows we have very large proved and

probable reserves of copper, 120 billion pounds using a $2 price. We have a very significant additional amount of
mineralized material, over 100 billion pounds that are associated with our existing mines. When you add all that
together and looking at the positive copper future that we see for the world, we are very committed to converting these
reserves and resources into cash flow producing assets and in creating value for our company shareholders that's not
reflected in today's copper price.
The new projects that we have can be divided basically into three types. One is advancing restarts of projects and
operations that were either curtailed or deferred in 2008 and 2009 and we've made great progress with that. At Morenci,
we've restarted the mine. We've increased the mine rate. We have started operations at Miami, near Phoenix, where we
have significant abandonment obligations. We're starting to – restarted the Chino mine in New Mexico where we had –
we shut that mine down in 2008. All of these projects are increasing. It's about 400 million pounds of copper a year and
progressing very well.
With our molybdenum business where we are the industry's largest and lowest cost producer, we are moving towards
starting up the Climax mine outside Leadville, Colorado in 2012 with a ramp-up that would ultimately lead to an
annual production rate of about 20 million pounds a year. This ramp-up that we will undertake is going to be dependent
on market conditions. Climax ultimately could produce 30 million pounds a year and is expandable beyond that. We
will operate Climax and our existing producing pure molybdenum mine in Henderson, Colorado in a manner that flexes
to meet market demands. We produce significant amounts of molybdenum as a by-product of copper. At Climax,
construction is now 80% complete. We are working on mine development. We should complete mechanical
construction by the end of this year and be prepared to ramp-up in 2012.
In South America at our mine in Chile, the El Abra mine, we've commenced production on our sulfide leach project
called Sulfolix, which is replacing the depleting or depleted oxide ore resource. This project extends the mine life by
10+ years to produce 300 million pounds of copper. We have a great partnership with Codelco on this operation and
this – we are completing this project – it's virtually completed now.
Since the Phelps Dodge acquisition in 2007, we've continued exploration there and significantly expanded the sulfide
resource that's available to us, and so we look – we're looking at studies for a potential major mill project that would be
incremental to the sulfide leach project. And we've had a really positive recent drilling results and are very excited
about our ability to have a major mill project at El Abra.
In Indonesia, the underground reserves there that are available to us represent what appears to be the most profitable
exciting copper mine development project in the world. The aggregate reserves are 37 billion pounds of copper and 33
million ounces of gold.
Grasberg is unique because of its high grades of copper and gold and the same ore material. We are operating in very
large Block Cave operation where we had begun operating Block Cave operations in the early 1980's. The DOZ mine
has a current capacity of 80,000 tons per day, very large mine. We've initiated mining at the Big Gossan, which is a
high grade mine. The Grasberg Block Cave, which contains the reserves that will allow us to develop after the pit is
depleted, which is expected currently to occur in mid-2016, has been developed, access has been developed. The initial
mine development has occurred and we expect that plus the Deep MLZ, which is an extension of the DOZ at depth and
laterally, will allow us to have underground production and at rates that's consistent with where we operate today in the
open pit of 240,000 tons per day.
This requires significant capital. We'll be expecting to spend our share of that capital at roughly $500 million a year
over the next five years. These underground reserves are in close proximity to our existing mill facilities. Because of
the way the deposit in the mill lays out, we're able to access the underground deposits vertically – horizontally as
opposed to lowering shafts and this allows for more efficient lower cost operations. And so we will continue to be at
Grasberg among the very lowest cost mines in the world because of the development opportunities we have and also
the combination of copper and gold rates of such significance.
Now beyond the near term project we're working on, slide 15 shows the major expansions that we're progressing
aggressively. This includes a tripling of the mill throughput at Cerro Verde, a new milling operation at Morenci and

also expanding the Tenke Fungurume mine in the next stage of its development. These three projects, which are not yet
in our numbers, either our future production volumes or our cost numbers, we expect them to be added shortly as we
complete our internal approval process, would add roughly $1 billion a year of incremental copper involved, a billion
pounds a year of incremental copper and $6 billion of capital investment, a very attractive rate of return projects in
today's world.
The Morenci mill is a very exciting operation for a 100+ year-old mine that not too long ago was considered to be on
its last legs. We're operating it very profitably today. We're expanding it. And this would be another major expansion of
increasing the mill capacity to mine sulfide ore that we're identifying the capacity up to 115,000 tons per day. It
involves increasing the mining rate, over $1 billion of capital with good rates of return and significant incremental
production. We are completing the feasibility study on that by early next year. And then we'll be moving into
permitting this year. And we expect to achieve full rates out of this project by 2014. And as we're doing this, we're
continuing to drill at depth, finding good results. And we believe this will lead to a further large scale expansion at
Morenci.
The Cerro Verde project is one where we – as I said, are looking to triple its mill throughput, significant increase in the
mining rate to take advantage of the resource that we have available to us. It does involve significant capital at $4
billion, but that's the world the industry lives in today. And this would be a very attractive project. We have the
opportunity to achieve power and water resources there, which is a challenge in Chile and Northern Chile and Peru, by
working in cooperation with the local community there to obtain our water from a wastewater treatment plant, which is
– and that has resulted in us having really strong support from the Arequipa community and the surrounding region. We
expect to commence construction in 2013 and to begin production in 2016.
Tenke Fungurume, a positive aspect about that operation is that our existing mill has operated beyond design capacity.
We've taken advantage of that to incrementally increase production. Our operations there are going well. Our delivery
system of product using a significant trucking operation is going well. And we are now looking at our first expansion
beyond the initial project. This would involve with a significant increase in our mining rate, additional tankhouse
capacity, capital cost of $850 million, to give us incremental production of 150 million pounds a year in an
approximately two year timeframe.
While we're doing this, we're continuing to do exploratory drilling and metallurgical work to see what the next stage
goes and also developing a long term strategy from taking advantage of this significant resource that we have over this
very large concession in Katanga.
The third set of projects, again, we have the resources that allow us to consider this. This is not something where we
have to find new resources to do it, but we're looking at, as I mentioned, a large scale further expansion at Morenci,
mill projects in Arizona, at Sierrita, Bagdad, Ajo, Twin Buttes, ultimate expansions in the Safford/ Lone Star area for
where – our mine there near Morenci. In South America I mentioned the El Abra major mill expansion and then at
Tenke Fungurume further – we have the opportunity to further expand our oxide operations there as well as dealing
with the very indicated large volumes of mixed ore and sulfide ore there.
So as we look forward with our company, we have these very near term projects, the major expansions and the longer
term expansions. In the meantime, we've upped significantly our exploration spending. We expect to spend $250
million a year, focused primarily, principally on the resources near our existing areas of operations. This allows us to
look at expansions, expand, get permits, progress in ways that are much less complicated than you would with
greenfield projects. It can be done at less cost and proceed with communities and with permitting agencies on a much
more straightforward basis.
I want to close by looking at our 2011 outlook. Again, I want to emphasize that this outlook has degrees of uncertainty
that are not typical for Freeport's operations, but based on our ability to continue to operate as we've been operating at
Grasberg, of course we hope to get back to normal operations with resolution of the strike, we are giving a sales
outlook of 3.8 billion pounds for the year, which is about 100 million pounds lower than our previous guidance. Gold at
1.6 million ounces is consistent with where we were. A million pounds higher molybdenum at 78 million pounds.

Our unit cash costs, because of higher gold prices principally, at $1,600 gold would be less than $1 a pound, and at
$3.25 copper, our operating cash flows would be $7 billion. And capital expenditures currently are at $2.6 billion for
2011, although we would expect that to be higher as we get some of these projects approved.
Our quarterly – our outlook beyond 2011 or 2012 and 2013 is presented on slide 22, you can see how that variation
goes and particularly how the gold sales at Grasberg vary depending on where we are in terms of access to the higher
grade materials at the lower part of the pit.
Quarterly outlook is updated for 2011 on slide 23 and our current outlook for annual unit production cost is on slide 24.
These costs are consistent with our prior guidance with somewhat higher by-product credits. And the current outlook is
for cost at 95% net – $0.95 net per unit. And we present the sales by region at the chart at the lower part of the slide.
I mentioned our cash flow outlook. Operating cash flow is at $3.50; copper is roughly $6 billion and with – that would
be EBITDA of over $8 billion. Capital expenditure – sensitivities are shown on slide 26 for your reference and capital
expenditures are on slide 27. We're looking at $2.6 billion this year. Next year we would expect to have roughly that
level plus $1 billion of projects. We expect to have approval to go forward in 2012, and that is projects at Cerro Verde,
Tenke Fungurume and Morenci.
From a financial policy standpoint, our board has been focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, strong liquidity,
as we continue to invest in our attractive growth projects. We have historically had a shareholder-friendly policy of
paying substantial dividends. We certainly should have opportunities to do that as we go forward and our board will be
reviewing our financial policy as always on an ongoing basis.
So we – with that we'd like to turn the – operator, we'd like to turn the call over for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question
comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Yes. Good morning, Richard and Jim Bob, Kathleen. I have a question on potential
for a share buyback. And given the balance sheet with the $5 billion in cash and you have net cash on the balance sheet
and given the growth prospects that you have certainly well-funded with the internal cash flows and your comment on
the value of the stock down here, and then I would agree with that, the stock is cheap down here, what's your view on
using some of that cash for share buyback?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We are – well, Mike, our focus is on investments, I mean we really want to look at
taking advantage as aggressively as we can on these opportunities to grow our business because of our positive view
about the future for the business. We do have an authorized share buyback program. As you know, better than anyone,
we have a long history of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and historically with share buybacks,
it's something that our Board considers on an ongoing basis and we understand your comment and it will be a matter
for the Board's consideration.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: And one other question, just about Grasberg, I think I heard you say that the mine is
currently operating at around two-thirds of its capacity, is that correct?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's right. In terms of the open-pit mine rate. The underground is really more like 80%
of its capacity. And that – when I talk about mine rates that includes the significant waste material that we move as well
as ore production. So we are dealing with both of those and adjusting our mine plans in relation to our current available
workforce.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And all that adds up to the fill which is where we produce the concentrate, and it's – like
at 75% to 80% of capacity.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. And what percent of the workforce are you doing that with right now?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, our workforce includes our management team, which is all there, our staff,
workers, our junior and senior [ph] nascent (39:11) staff and they've been extraordinary supportive of our operations.
So we have people doing jobs that they normally don't do, and we have had some union workers that have decided to
come to work, maybe in the range of 10% to 15%, it varies day-by-day. So when you add it all up, it's about 60% of our
regular workforce.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And the regular workforce includes not only the mine workers, but infrastructure. We
have fewer people up there. So there's a reduced infrastructure requirement for it. The union workers, I said 10% to
15%, it's more like 15% to 20%, Mark is telling me.

Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Yes. Good morning, Kathleen, Richard and Jim and congratulations I think on good results
in the face of adversity. My question is really about the fourth-quarter guidance which you put for copper at 915
million pounds. I'm just trying to understand how much of the strike impact is embedded in that assumption, if any. The
union has basically extended the strike through November 15 and you guys produce about 3 million pounds per day
there. So that would be 135 million pounds of lost production, but you're saying you're operating at about 75%, 80%
throughput. So I'm just trying to understand, are you baking through November 15 lost production because of the strike
at this point or how many pounds would you say have been shaved off that guidance number?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Well for the year including the third quarter impacts, we're estimating 100 million pounds
of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold. Most of the gold impact was actually in the third quarter. The copper impact in
the third quarter is 70 million pounds. That leaves about a 30 million pound impact for the fourth quarter. We were –
our fourth quarter was projected in any case to be our lowest grade quarter of the year. And actually with the strike
action in the third quarter, some of the higher grade material that we expected to mine in third quarter has been pushed
into the fourth quarter. But these assumptions assume that we're operating under strike conditions at this moderated rate
that Richard's been talking about. So we've baked that into the forecast.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: So, Jorge, it just assumes that we're doing what we're doing now and in recent days.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: It's through until November 15 or through the entirety of the fourth quarter?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, through – all the way through to the end of the year. So I mean, that's just an
assumption; it's a projection. Our hope is that we get the strike resolved and get everybody back to work, but in terms
of giving you and others in the investment community guidance, we thought the best way to do that now is just to say if
we continue to operate right now, as we are right now through the end of the quarter, to give you those results.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: So to paraphrase then, if you're talking about a 90 day quarter, to lose 30 million pounds of
production at Grasberg is like 0.3 million pounds a day. That's pretty good for an operation that does 3 million pounds a
day.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, and as I tried to emphasize at the start of my comments, there's a combination of
factors going on here. One is our revised mine plans on how to deal with this. And then taking into account the lost

capacity that we have because of the strike situation. So using overall averages doesn't take into account exactly how
we're responding to the situation and because this ore body is being of the quality it is, it gives us more flexibility than
you might have with other operations.
<A - Mark J. Johnson>: The other aspect of that, Richard, is – this is Mark Johnson – is that, in the higher grade areas
of the Grasberg, we're operating at 100% of pre-strike capacity. Where we're giving up some of the production due to
the strike impacts is in the lower grade areas and we're deferring some of the stripping. As Richard said, in the
underground, we're pretty much where we were prior to the strike. So the incremental tons that we're giving up right
now are not at an average grade. They're more on the lower grade side of things.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Right. That sounds very positive. And sorry, if I could just ask a second question. Richard,
you've been talking up this idea of these growth plans at Cerro and Morenci and Tenke for a while. Is there a firm date
by which you would expect the Board would approve these projects? Is there like an end December deadline or early
Q1, where we would know if these projects are authorized?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. We will have that presented. It's just a question of completing the necessary work
to get the data together. We've been keeping our Board informed. They've been very supportive of what we're doing. So
it's a natural process here and nothing that – the Board is very supportive of our overall strategy. So we anticipate
getting that done in due course.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And I just want to make a comment as I was listening to the questions of Jorge and so
forth. Our resource that we have available to us at Grasberg is going to be there. It's a question of when we're able to
mine it. And our first priority, as we operate day-to-day is to do what we can to protect the safety of our people, the
people in the local community and so forth. So this is going to be a dynamic situation and we'll – we're going to get
back to normal. We will do it and we'll keep you informed as we move along.

Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Good morning, Sal.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Good morning, Sal.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: I wanted to just understand the CapEx for Cerro Verde. You have increased that number from the
previous presentation about by 500 million. Is there something additional you're doing over there?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Sal, you're going to hear this over and over in this industry. I mean as companies
work on projects despite the fact we've got these economic uncertainties, the factors that go into spending money on
capital project in this industry continues to rise. And so some of that is escalation as we get ready to actually order
equipment and contract for services, costs are higher than they were estimated in our previous studies. There are other
factors that go in. We've changed the scope of this water project that we're doing, Arequipa that's going to be the source
of our water. We found that we're going to have to build some additional power line facilities and transmission
facilities that are different than we originally anticipated. But I will just make an observation because we are engaged in
so many of these projects and we watch what's going on with others in the industry is that capital cost escalation is a
significant factor. It's going to have an impact on supply, development and the timing of projects.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Understood, thank you. And also, you are forecasting, gold forecast, if I look at your total forecast
and subtract the first three quarter, it appears to be higher than what you mentioned later in the press release that you're
going to do 280,000 ounces in Grasberg, because it comes out about 355,000 ounces. I was wondering, that gap is –
that's significantly higher than what you do outside of Grasberg for gold.

it's not anything that...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: We've got some coming from South America.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We've got some coming from South America, but -
<Q - Sal Tharani>: But if I take your total gold forecast for the year, subtract the first three quarter, it comes to
355,000 ounce, while you say in the press release later on that at Grasberg you expect fourth quarter to be 280,000
ounces. I just was wondering how to reconcile that?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. We're expecting from Indonesia total for the year of – and you look on page 24 –
1.45 million ounces and roughly 100,000 ounces from South America, so I think the math works. We'll go offline with
you if you still have questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Good morning, everyone. Just getting back to Grasberg, the additional color on mining 100%
of the open pit, that was very helpful, but I just would like to understand what type of stockpile you're working with in
terms of – I don't know if you can disclose how many days? And what type of grades you have in the stockpile of this?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. This is not really stock, I mean we develop short-term stockpiles depending on our
mine plans and so forth, but we don't have significant stockpile situation there. We basically move material very
quickly from the mine crushing system through our ore – our ore drops into the mills. So stockpiles, there's not a
long-term stockpiles for us there in terms of our current operations.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: In terms of the – you indicated in your presentation that 2012 production for copper is also
lower than what you were anticipating. I mean the number is not that significantly lower, but is this all coming from
Grasberg and mining lower grade [ph] sands (50:12)?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No. This whole thing – about half of it is from Grasberg, but the total adjustments I don't
think – it's 2% or less and it's just normal mine planning adjustments. We're now going into developing our annual
plans, which we complete in the fourth quarter, but that's just normal adjustments for mine plans. Nothing significant.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Okay, great. No, that's very helpful. And then on – the next question is, over the last
couple weeks, Codelco has been able to obtain financing from one of the Japanese, large Japanese melting companies. I
guess when you talk about your project in El Abra and the sulfide, that looks to be something that is very attractive. In
your discussions with the company, is there any sense that that you can push this forward? Because I mean, you've
been referring to it for about a year now, but are we closer to seeing anything coming forward?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we're working actively on it and I mean and we're also working jointly with
Codelco, but this is a project in the pre-feasibility stage and so that's going to take a significant amount of time to
advance it. That's just a nature of these projects because it involves, being where it is located in northern Chile, there is
the challenging water issues and power issues. And we're working cooperatively with Codelco on those issues. And –
but just going back to my comments about why we're optimistic about the future of copper, one of the things is supply
constraints and as attractive as this project is and as aggressive as we are in wanting to pursue it, it's going to take

several years to do the pre-feasibility study and deal with the water and power issues, which we believe we can. It'll
cost money. But that's indicative of the constraints on supplies and why even though we can produce copper at such a
low unit cost, you can't just turn on projects and get production very quickly.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS Securities.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Good morning. I just want to go back one more time on the Grasberg situation. First of all,
we've talked a lot about production and we talk about sales going forward. Is there any inventory effect at the port? I
know you're running at 75% at site give or take, but do we borrow any inventory going forward or is that all smoothing
out over the next few quarters?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's – our inventory at port builds up and then drops as ships come in. And this is just a
normal situation. We did have some inventory that we drew down, but we try to ship it as quickly as we can and it's just
a question of shipping schedules and so forth. So at any point in time, the inventory is going to be driven by kind of the
steady production that comes out of the mill, gets down there, ships come in, it's loaded, inventory drops, but there's
nothing unusual about it now.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Other than the fact that we're operating at a reduced level.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: So we've probably got – you would have always had 100%, your production has come
down, you probably drew bit in this quarter, but going forward it'll just be flat going forward, there will be no mismatch
per se other than your normal ship loading.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, but as we always have, the amount of sales at the end of any quarter is based on
ship loading.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And, Brian, I know you recall in the past that sometimes it's a shallow sea and rough
weather can delay a ship. We record sales when it's loaded on the ship. So the timing, if you want to call it mismatch or
whatever, is strictly a function of getting the concentrate on the ships and getting it out of there and that's ship
schedules and loading conditions.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: And we're just forecasting normal inventory levels in our outlook.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Okay, great. That helps. And then just on that, because that was one of my questions, the
deferred profits in this quarter, I know it was something like $200 million something last quarter and $101 million at
the end of this quarter. Do you know what the deferred profit, was it – I don't know, I've lost track of how this works,
whether it was a gain or loss in the quarter? Then what it would be?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: It was income during the quarter, because inventories were lower. If you look in the foot
notes on the income statement, Brian, there is a summary of what the impact was. It was a positive impact of $84
million to net income, but as you know, that number moves depending on the changes in these inter-company inventory
levels.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Great, yeah, that's what I was looking for. I just missed that because I had the year end. And
the final question, I think someone mentioned, and I just want to be clear about this, as we work through the fourth
quarter, which makes sense, obviously, with all the uncertainty, we focus on where we make money. But was there a

comment made that we sort of slowed down our stripping a bit? I think someone said that to one of the answers to the
earlier question and therefore is that significant and is there is a catch up as we go into the future quarters?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's just a question of how we plan our mining activities given the reduced workforce.
And so obviously to the extent that we adjust stripping or over-mining in these conditions, it affects what we're doing
going forward. So, again, the mine plans – the mine plan, we're not doing anything that would be inconsistent with our
long-term mine plan in terms of protecting pit stability and in terms of maximizing the NPV out of the ore, so it's just a
question of how we do that with the reduced workforce that we have.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Right. Which makes sense. And then I guess, so then my final question just on this, because
I think I totally understand the maximization. You also had gold production down a little bit year-over-year versus your
previous guidance. Is that just more the normal reset that we all the time rounding error as opposed to anything to do
with the strike?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's correct. Beyond 2011.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Beyond 2011.
<Q - Brian MacArthur>: Okay, great. Thank you very much. That helps a lot.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Thanks, Brian.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me just make a comment. We have a very long list of questions. And so I'm going to

everybody a chance that wants to – have a question, a chance to ask it.

<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Good morning.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Just, okay, I guess I can ask only one. So what are your thoughts on your capital structure? Do
you – would you like to keep some debt or there's an optimum debt to capital ratio that you'd like to maintain or – just
wondering what are your thoughts on that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No we don't have any targeted capital structure. We look at the debt situation, over the
last four years our credit rating has improved significantly. And so this gives us time, opportunities to repay debt on an
opportunistic basis and reduce our interest cost. We point out that a good portion of our interest cost does not get the
benefit of tax deductibility and so we just approach everything on a cash flow basis of optimizing our cash flows as
opposed to targeting any level of debt. We would be more comfortable with a greater level of debt on our balance
sheet. And we certainly have the financial capability of doing that. And – but we just look at it in terms of maximizing
cash flows.

includes advancing the engineering and also potentially advancing our earthworks there. We've also got capital

comments that the operating planned modifications that you guys have been employing at Grasberg shouldn't affect the
life of the open pit?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, this question of the life of the open pit is a dynamic question in and of itself even
without the considerations of the strike. So at the present time we don't see any significant change as a result of recent

when you meet again with the union and the mediators and maybe just give us some perspective on how far apart the
two sides may be at this point?

<Q - Richard Garchitorena>: One question from me. Looks like the guidance for 2012 volumes came down by about
100 million pounds and 100,000 ounces. I just wanted to make sure that – that's largely related to the higher ore grade
that you're mining this quarter and then basically it's going to decline as you move into the fourth quarter and into next
year?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Richard, it's just more of the overall process of the continuing changes in mine
plans. And it's not all Grasberg. As I said, it's about half Grasberg. But it's nothing unusual, it's just ordinary business
course mine plan changes.

that just sort of causes you to say we're just going to wait on this one?

the people. So we're committed to – I mean we're very near completed. We've actually turned the power on to the mills;
the mechanical completion there is going to be finished by the end of this year roughly. We've started mining activities
this past summer. We're hiring the workforce. So in terms of completed project, we've crossed the Rubicon. Now, the

honored our contracts since early 1970s and we are confident that we will able to work together on a positive basis
going forward. So I would just – that's the only comment I would make about that. We don't anticipate there'll be any
change with our relationships with the government with the new cabinet situation.
<Q - Elliot Glazer>: The article goes on to say the local power to negotiate contracts has been handed over to a locally
elected governor and the local government now has more power in these negotiations. Any thoughts on that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Our contract is with the government of Indonesia. The contract has the status of law in
Indonesia. We work cooperatively with the provincial governor and his office with the regency and the community
where we work with, so all those things are things we work with. Our contract is with the central government.
<Q - Elliot Glazer>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Wayne Atwell with Rodman & Renshaw.
<Q - R. Wayne Atwell>: I have a quick question for you, it's sort of an overview question. You have done a great job
of managing your M&A program. You have a number of wonderful projects in your queue. But with a very strong
balance sheet and good cash flow and dynamic environment in the commodity sector, what thought are you giving to
diversifying, maybe going into met coal and iron ore? There are some other commodities that you're in, two or three of
the best, but have you given thought to being diversified and having a broader profile?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We always have our eyes open for opportunities that may come to us. Our board has not
made a decision to diversify just for the sake of diversification. We believe – we're confident in saying that success in
the mining business depends on the quality of the assets and not the mix of the assets. So given the quality of the assets
we have and the development opportunities that we have, it would take a significant opportunity to be attractive to us to
compete with our own development projects.
But I believe the story of 2008 was that the macroeconomic forces affect base metals and other commodities across the
board and diversification is not going to protect you from a macroeconomic event. So we have the opportunity through
our contacts with the industry and with the investment banks, opportunities are presented to us all the time. If we had
the opportunities for a high quality asset that we believe would be – add incremental value to our shareholders, we're
prepared to take it, but our strategy is focused on our internal investments and our internal growth prospects.
<Q - R. Wayne Atwell>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Isabel Darrigrandi with Celfin Capital.
<Q - Isabel Darrigrandi>: Yes, good morning. My question is regarding Cerro Verde. I would like to know if you are
at all concerned that the current labor conflict could escalate at Cerro Verde given the current socio and political
context in Peru and the sometimes violent and illegal disruptions that other mining operators have had to deal with in
recent years. And just if you could comment how you guys are handling the situation and if you believe you can resolve
it in the near-term. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thank you for your question. Yes, we do, Isabel, believe we can resolve it in the
near-term. And we've had a peaceful situation with this strike and with previous issues related to labor at Cerro Verde.
We have a very positive relationship with the community of Arequipa because of the efforts we've made to improve the
standards of living there. And so our situation there is different from some of the other mining projects in Peru. We
take it very seriously, we listen carefully to the union and to the work force and we're working to get a resolution and
we believe we're making current progress of getting it resolved. So we don't expect the kinds of violence that you
suggested and we're taking this very seriously and believe we can reach a mutually acceptable resolution in the near

Your next question comes from the line of Sanil Daptardar with Sentinel Investment.
<Q - Sanil V. Daptardar>: Yeah. Thanks. Just if the striking workers accept your offer, how much increase in cost –
operating cost do you see for 2012?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I think that's speculation about that and about where we are with the process. The cost
increase would – there would be a cost increase because we're offering a substantial increase to the workforce. Labor is
about 25% to 30% of our cost there and so you can get some sense about what would be a reasonable increase on that.
But as I said in response to an earlier question, I'm reluctant and I'm not going to get into too much detail here because
of the sensitivity of the negotiations and the fact that we've got this legal process going on, Sanil. So as things get
clarified, we'll give more detailed guidance.
<Q - Sanil V. Daptardar>: Okay. Thanks, Richard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: At the end of the day, Grasberg is going to continue to be a very low cost producer
because of the high grades of copper and gold, and the truth is, commodity price movements are going to be much
more important.

Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. I just wanted to get clarification on the news about the
Grasberg pipeline which was damaged over the weekend. Ultimately was that caused by a rockslide or was it actual
sabotage and has it been fully repaired?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes, it was sabotage. This happens from time to time. It's not necessarily related to the
strike. Rockslides really are an issue with our pipeline. There's just places as it goes from the middle down to the port
where it's above ground and there's access to it. And at times illegal miners have disrupted it. We – it's not a significant
issue to get it repaired and get it operating again.

<Q - Sal Tharani>: Hi, Richard. Can you give us an idea – your DOZ mine which is at 80,000 tons per day right now
of ore mining and you're planning to go to 240,000 tons per day once you seize the open pit and start doing the
underground. What is the timeframe you're looking at from going to 80,000 tons per day to 240,000 tons per day?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, that would be triggered when we stop mining the open pit and start mining
operations of the Grasberg Block Cave. So if you think about 80,000 tons per day from the DOZ complex, we would
look at ramping up to 160,000 tons per day in the direct Grasberg Block Cave. We've done access work for that. We've
begun initial mine development. But there would be a ramp up period from the time that we stop mining in the pit,
since these – this is Block Cave that's directly underneath the pit, same ore body. And we can't start the caving
operations so as long as we are mining in the pit. So there would be period of time for the ramp-up and we are looking
at steps as how to mitigate that. This is an issue that we've been – had in our 10-Ks and talked about for years in terms
of mitigating that ramp up period, but there will be a ramp up period from when the open pit stops and we start ramping
up the Grasberg Block Cave. It's the same ore body. We're just mining it with a different mining method. This is the
case where we will do stock – our stockpiles to help us do that. We are looking at ways of adjusting the operations in
the DOZ and then the MLZ to help mitigate this effect, but it is part of our future.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right. Thanks, Sal.
Richard C. Adkerson
All right, well, we appreciate everyone's participation and interest in our call and we look forward to giving you further
updates as the fourth quarter progresses. Thanks, everybody.
