MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now
my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael L. DeWalt
Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt,
Caterpillar's Corporate Controller. On the call today, I'm pleased to have with me our Chairman and CEO, Doug
Oberhelman; and Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without our
written consent is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor
Section of our caterpillar.com website, and that'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
Now this morning undoubtedly, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risk, uncertainties and
assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion
of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our
projection, that can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1A Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the
SEC in February of this year and also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. Now in addition, a
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release and again, that's been posted on our website
at, caterpillar.com.
Now before we start the Q&A today, I'm going to be covering three main topics. The first will be a summary of our
second quarter results and revised outlook, then I'm going to take a few minutes and talk a little bit about our business
segments, and then I'm going to finish up with cash flow and the stock repurchase that we talked about this morning.

So let's start with second quarter which I'm going to discuss in two ways. First, I'm going to cover at a high level our
second quarter results versus a second quarter of 2012. And then I'm going to discuss the specific headwinds, we faced
in the second quarter and how we're thinking about them going forward in our expectations for the second half of 2013.
First, compared to the second quarter of 2012, our results this morning were quite a bit lower. But to put the
year-over-year comparison in context, the second quarter a year ago was certainly a tough comparison. The headline
from last year's second quarter started with, Caterpillar Reports Best Quarter in History. Sales this quarter were – sales
and revenues were $14.6 billion and that's a 16% decline from the second quarter of 2012. And this morning, we
reported profit of $1.45 per share and that was down $1.09 from the second quarter of last year. Now the sales and
revenues decline versus last year in dollars was about $2.8 billion, and about half of that was the result of dealer
inventory changes and the other half from lower end-user demand.
Now in last year's second quarter, dealers bought more machines from Caterpillar than they delivered to customers and
their machine inventories rose again last year about $300 million. In the second quarter of this year 2013, it was the
reverse. Dealers bought less from us than they sold to their customers and their inventory of new machines, as a result,
declined about $1 billion. So, in combination, the impacts and the changes of dealer machine inventories was negative
by about $1.3 billion for the quarter-over-quarter.
The remaining sales decline was a result of lower end-user demand for machines and to a lesser extent, Power Systems.
The decline in profit was largely a result of that drop in sales and on page six of this morning's financial release, we
have a waterfall chart that would step you through the quarter-to-quarter changes in operating profit. It shows a decline
in total from last year to this year of about $1.059 billion and lower volume, which includes product mix, more than
accounted for the total decline in operating profit.
So the overwhelming story on the quarter-to-quarter profit decline was volume and I think the waterfall chart covers the
other pluses and minuses reasonably well, so I'm going to change gears a little here and talk about the headwinds in the
second quarter and how we're thinking about them relative to the second half of the year.
And we'll start off with dealer inventory. As I mentioned before, dealers took out about $1 billion of inventories in the
second quarter and that was a sales headwind for us, as our sales were about $1 billion below end-user demand. In
terms of what that means for the second half of the year, well we expect that to continue. We think dealers are going to
take inventory down another $1.5 billion to $2 billion or so between now and year-end. The continued dealer inventory
decline in fact is the main reason that we lowered our sales and profit outlook for 2013 this morning. We're expecting
sales and revenues in a range of $56 billion to $58 billion and profit of about $6.50 a share at the middle of that sales
and revenues range. That's a drop of about $2 billion on the top line and $0.50 a share at the bottom line. So dealer
inventory reductions were a headwind in the quarter and the main reason we lowered the outlook.
Now our inventory was also a headwind in the quarter. In addition to what the dealers took out, we cut inventory by
$1.2 billion in the quarter. That was negative to profit from a cost absorption standpoint. And just to help you get a
handle on the profit impact, we use a rule of thumb of 13% to 15% of the inventory change. The year-end expectation
for our inventory is that it'll end the year about where it ended the second quarter. That means we do not expect the
profit headwind that we had in the second quarter from inventory absorption to continue in the second half of the year.
In addition, we also had a substantial currency headwind in the second quarter and in this context, I'm not really talking
about year-over-year. I'm not talking – I'm not comparing the second quarter a year ago. I'm talking about actual
translation and hedging losses of about $134 million that happened in the quarter and were reported in the other income
and expense line of our P&L, which is a couple of lines below operating profit on the P&L.
Now as we put our outlook together, we don't forecast future currency movements. We do our outlook based on
exchange rates as they are. As a result, our outlook does not expect currency translation and hedging losses in the
second half of the year, like the $134 million in the second quarter.
Now the flip side of that is we did have a positive item in the quarter. We had $135 million gain on our settlement
related to the Siwei acquisition and that's also something that we don't expect to repeat. So as we're thinking about the
second half of the year, kind of relative to the second quarter, the average sales for each of the two quarters on a

quarterly basis in the second half is about the same as the second quarter. But we don't think we'll have a negative cost
absorption impact like the second quarter had. We don't think we'll have the $134 million, at least in our outlook of
currency losses and the current or the Siwei $134 million gain, we don't expect to continue.
The other difference that we're talking – that you need to take into consideration is that we're taking additional actions
to reduce cost in the second half of the year. Now we started taking action in the second quarter and began
implementing cost reduction measures and we're going to do more of that in the second half of the year.
Okay. That's enough for now on the quarter and the outlook. I'd like to change gears just a little bit and talk about
segments. Now I'm going to start by saying that our largest segment this year by sales has been Power Systems. Our
most profitable segment this year has been Power Systems. The highest margin rate of any segment this year has been
Power Systems. Now, I know that most of you on the phone here today already know that. But there are many casual
observers of Caterpillar that if you asked them that question, would have said mining which is in our Resource
Industries segment.
The point of this discussion is that we serve a number of different cyclical industries, but thankfully they don't all
follow the same path at the same time. The diversity within and, in fact, between our segments helps mitigate
year-to-year swings in sales both down and up for the company. The Power Systems segment, again our largest and
most profitable segment over the past five years, has also been, relatively speaking, the most stable of our three large
equipment segments. And that's because it spans a number of different industries itself, electric power, oil and gas, rail,
marine and industrial engines. And actually even within those industries, there's diversity. In oil and gas, for example,
our sales of engines for drilling and fracking are weaker, but gas compression continues to do pretty well.
Moving on, our Construction Industries segment sells an extensive range of construction equipment around the world
that support infrastructure development, commercial and residential construction. The worldwide construction industry
is showing signs of recent improvement, but remains relatively depressed from a historical standpoint. Construction in
the United States, while starting to turn up, is still far below the 2006, 2007 peak and the construction equipment
industry in Europe is, as you'd expect, well below the prior peak and construction equipment sales in China in 2013, we
expect to be about half what they were in 2011. The point is there's a lot of room to grow just to get back to where
we've been before. When economic and construction activities begin to improve in the world, particularly in the U.S.
and hopefully, eventually in Europe, it should be a positive for our business.
Our Financial Products segment is also important to our business and it's doing very well. It provides financing to end
users that purchase our equipment and it also provides financing for some Caterpillar dealers. Financial Products
revenues and profit have proven to be much more stable through the business cycle than our product-related businesses
and they're currently performing well. Revenues this quarter were up 5% from the second quarter a year ago and profit
was up.
Now the segment that's currently getting significant attention is Resource Industries, which is primarily mining and I'm
going to give you a rundown of what's happening in mining. But before I do that, I'd like to point you to today's
financial release. And on page 16 in particular, question number five in the Q&A in the back of the release, we've tried
to provide a pretty comprehensive discussion of the mining industry and how it impacts our sales. Now the high points
of that discussion start with the production of mined commodities and in the underlying health of the mining industry,
relies on commodity demand and production. And based on the data that we've seen, it looks like mining production in
2013 is going to be a little higher than it was in 2012.
And recently, a couple of the big public mining companies have reported they're producing at record levels. Now
commodity production underpins the need for mining CapEx and despite 2013 increases in commodity production, it's
clear that mining companies are currently cutting their CapEx after significant increases in 2011 and 2012. While we
don't specifically accumulate CapEx estimates ourselves for the industry, we do follow the market surveys. Based on
those surveys it appears total mining CapEx in 2013 is likely to be down 5% to 10% from 2012 and those some surveys
are also indicating further CapEx decline near 20% for 2014.

Now the mining industry CapEx includes spending on exploration and development, buildings and structures, things
like processing plants and equipment. At Caterpillar, we're most impacted by spending on equipment. While we don't
have a consistent CapEx deals at that level of detail, for the industry worldwide, we have reviewed data at that level of
detail from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. And it tells us that over the past few years, the largest and
fastest-growing category of CapEx in Australia was for buildings and structures. While this is the largest category, the
most significant declines in 2012 have been for exploration and development and equipment. And based on our own
experience with large capital projects, that make sense to us. It's difficult to stop construction on large-scale facilities
once they get substantially started. That means in the short-term, we believe that more of the decline in mining CapEx
is for equipment, things like Caterpillar machines.
And that leads us to end-user demand for our products. That's how much Cat dealers are actually delivering to end
users that are mining companies. Year-to-date, deliveries to end users and our expectations of what dealers will deliver
for the full year are declines of about 20%. While dealer inventories are down – while dealer deliveries – I'm sorry –
are down, for the type of equipment that we make, we believe we're doing a little better than the equipment industry
overall.
And that brings us to Resource Industries sales, so we started with CapEx, we've moved on to end-user demand from
our dealers and now to our sales. And to relate the decline in mining equipment demand placed on our dealers to our
sales, we need to consider several other factors besides mining CapEx. Our Resource Industries segment includes
things that are not directly related to mining CapEx, like aftermarket parts sales, as well as equipment sales to the
forestry, paving and quarry and aggregate industries. Although Resource Industries sales of aftermarket parts are down
a little in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the year ago, the decline is much less than the decline for
equipment and in the context of the total decline in sales for Resource Industries, it's just not a significant factor. And
the collective sales of equipment for forestry, paving and quarry and aggregates are also down, but again the vast
majority of the decline in Resource Industries sales for the quarter, the second quarter of 2013, is mining equipment.
Now in addition to those factors, to understand our sales you also need to consider dealer inventory changes. Dealer
inventory increased in the second quarter last year and it declined substantially in the second quarter of 2013. That
means that last year, we were selling more products to dealers than they were delivering to the end-user mining
companies. And in the second quarter of this year, we've sold far less equipment than dealers were selling to mining
customers. In fact, our sales of traditional cap mining equipment, such as mining trucks, large track-type tractors and
wheel loaders would have had to have been more than 50% higher in the second quarter to match what dealers were
delivering to end users. In the second half of 2013, we expect that dealers will continue to substantially reduce their
inventories and that means we expect to continue to undersell mining demand for the remainder of 2013.
Given the substantial decline in sales in 2013, the uncertainty around when cyclical recovery will resume, we've taken
substantial action to adjust our production levels and to reduce costs. We expect to take further action in the second half
of the year. Now our intention is to reduce cost and drive operational improvements and do it in a way that doesn't
significantly reduce our ability to ramp up when production improves.
I know many of you would like to get a better understanding of what we think will happen after 2013. Now we're going
to discuss that here for a couple of minutes, but we want to start by saying, we are not providing a sales outlook for
2014 either for Resource Industries or for Cat in total. It's certainly too early to do that and the activities over the past
five years in the mining equipment industry certainly reinforce that. It's experienced significant demand shifts, both up
and down. And the mining industry overall has had difficulty in forecasting those shifts in advance and frankly that's
impacted our forecast. We understand that. It's a part of being in this industry and this year is a good example, as
mining companies have been cautious and dealers reduce their inventories.
What we will discuss here this morning is what the industry surveys. Not our forecast, but what the industry surveys
about next year suggest and what that could mean as the impact of dealer inventory reductions wind down. Now earlier
I mentioned that we've seen surveys that suggest another 20% decline in mining CapEx in 2014 from 2013. Again,
that's not our estimate and we're not providing an outlook. But if you take that CapEx survey at face value, it suggests
another down year in 2014. To put mining CapEx in the context of our sales though, you have to consider the impact of

dealer inventories.
Even if dealer inventories of – or – I'm sorry – even if dealer deliveries of new mining equipment were to be down 20%
next year from 2013, if we see an end to the dealer inventory reductions over the next few quarters, we believe our
sales of new mining equipment to dealers would be positive. In other words, we believe the significance of the end of
dealer inventory reductions would have a more significant positive impact on year-over-year sales than a 20% decline
in end-user demand. Just to clarify this, we're not suggesting an increase in inventories next year. Just the absence of
the big declines in 2013 that pulled our sales well below what dealers are delivering to mining customers.
Now in addition to that, if the world economy continues to improve, we would expect commodity production to also
increase and that coupled with a relatively large number of new machines placed in service over the past several years
that should be a positive for mining aftermarket parts sales. Again, that's not – this is not a forecast for 2014 at this
time. Too early to do that. The purpose of this discussion was just to illustrate for you the significance that dealer
inventory changes are having on our mining business today and what the implications are for when the decline comes
to an end.
Now looking further ahead, our long-term view of mining remains positive. Commodity demand is driven by economic
growth, population increase and rising standards of living and we believe that will all continue to improve over the
long-term. In addition, declining ore grades imply that in the future more material will need to be moved per ton of
commodity output and that's another positive, at least from our perspective, for long-term equipment needs.
Finally, much has been written and said about the impact of China on commodity demand in the mining industry. Our
long-term view of China is also positive. We expect continued urbanization and improvement in the standard of living
for the people of China. We believe that means more electricity production will be generated and increased production
and consumption of goods in general. Now increasing electricity production in particular is a positive for coal. Coal
makes up a large portion of the electricity generated in China and they continue to add coal-fired capacity. Now that
said, we do not expect the significant economic growth rates that China experienced over the past 10 years will
continue indefinitely. But we do believe that China will continue to grow at a much faster pace than the rest of the
world. And it's also important to remember that over the past 10 years, the size of the Chinese economy is more than
doubled and that means that economic growth rates of 7% to 7.5% have a greater impact today than the 10% growth
rate would've had 10 years ago. It's a big economy that, relative to the world in total, is growing faster.
So in summary on mining, we don't expect much change in the environment in the short-term and the remainder of
2013 will be tough for our mining business. As dealer inventory reductions come to an end, our mining equipment sales
could rise from 2013 levels even if mining CapEx declines and our long-term of mining remains positive. The world
needs mined commodities. As the world grows, we believe commodity demand will continue to increase.
One last quick topic and then we'll go to the Q&A and that topic is cash flow and cash deployment. While it was
certainly a tough quarter for sales and profit, our Machinery and Power Systems operating cash flow was better than it's
been in a long time. We generated $3 billion worth of operating cash flow in the quarter and that's a substantial increase
from $1.3 billion in last year's second quarter and we've put that to work for stockholders. In the second quarter, we
repurchased $1 billion of cap stock and we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend. And in this morning's
financial release, we announced that with the strength of our cash flow, balance sheet and cash on hand, we expect to
repurchase an additional $1 billion of cap stock in the third quarter. Repurchasing stock in a downturn has been a key
part of our cash deployment strategy and we're executing on it.
So with that, we're ready to open up the floor for Q&A.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Please announce your
affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: It's Vertical Research Partners. Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Let's see. Let me just start with Power Systems, since you did highlight that division. I
mean you had one of the strongest margins you've ever had and wanted to just check in on whether you're seeing,
actually just whether that was a mix related? I know power gen, backup power gen has been off, whether structural
improvement in the margin or division. And then whether you're seeing any change in electric power at all?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. If you look actually, Rob, at the dealer statistics that we put out yesterday morning,
you can see that's a little bit better than it was a year ago. I think a lot of that has to do with, it was kind of even turned
down a year ago. So I think a little bit on power – electric power, in particular the comps will probably just continue to
get a little easier. I think for Power Systems overall, they had a pretty darn good quarter. Sales volume was down a
little bit, but some of the pieces were up. I think more of their profit improvement had to do with, they had a little price
realization and they've done a pretty good job on cutting costs. And as opposed to Power Systems – as opposed to
Construction and Resource Industries, they didn't have near the decline in inventory that those other two segments did.
So the absorption impact was relative to the company in total. A lot smaller for them.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: Could I ask you a different question? I'm not sure if this is one you're willing to or able to
answer, but is it impossible to look through the turmoil that's gone on in Resources over the past six months and think
about what's your margin would be in a more stable environment at these volume levels?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well you're right, I'm not going to throw out a number. But I think, in my opinion, we had
one positive item, the Siwei settlement that would be in their numbers that you'd have to take out. That would actually
make it a little bit lower. But they – we are in the middle of pretty heavy inventory decreases and that – in total, the
amount that they're really underselling real demand and the absorption impact probably more than offset that. And
since we are moving from, let's just say, higher volumes over the last year to lower volumes this year, cutting costs has
been a process and that's going to continue into the second quarter. So if, for example, volume – end-user demand kind
of hung in at this level, our sales would probably go up a little bit because we've stopped cutting inventory. We
wouldn't have the Siwei adjustment in there, but cost would likely be lower as we've – as we're part way through kind
of the cost-cutting activities that we've been doing. So I guess my thought is that we'd probably be a little higher than it
is now, but I don't know that I would want to throw out a number.
<Q - Rob C. Wertheimer>: I guess that was my two. Thank you, Mike.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Hi. Good morning. JPMorgan.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Good morning, Ann.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Morning. I'll start out with the decremental margin question, Doug, you've been pretty vocal
about driving for 25% pull through. Can you talk about the decrementals this quarter, whether they were disappointing
or not to you? And are we going to get back to 25% by year-end?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Hi, Ann. This is Brad Halverson, and it's a good question. If you look at the second
quarter, I think there's a couple of things. If you look to the right, you have to consider in terms of results. One is, close
to 70% of our drop in sales are mining which is negative from mix. But even putting that to a side, if you just look at
the pure cost absorbed kind of impact, you'll get to a decremental margin slightly under 30% and we've talked about

Page 7 of 13
25% to 30% kind of a detrimental margin in terms of our target. And so for the quarter, you would get slightly under
30%. If you look full year at our outlook, even with all the headwinds, you'll get to a decremental pull through of 24%
and this is something that we spend a lot of time on internally. We have targets that we've committed to and if you look
across our segments, Resource, Construction, Power, Financial Products, each of them, as we've talked about before,
have made a commitment as to what they'll make at certain volume levels which ties to our external commitment and
they're executing on that. So when we get through the end of the year, we'll be at $6.50, right around 24% which is,
with the mining headwind, I think a good number.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Fair point. Thanks for the clarification. It's normally in the press release, but that wasn't
conspicuously there today. My follow-up would be on pricing. You also mentioned in the press release some negative
pricing, I think it was in Resources in Australia. Can you talk about pricing overall? And where you are seeing the most
pressure? Obviously probably in mining, but why would we be giving up pricing at this point in the cycle?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, Ann. This is Mike. Just a couple of comments. I think, when we talk price
realization here, it's versus the second quarter a year ago. And again, I don't want to harp too much on this, but we had
an absolutely fabulous quarter a year ago. Price realization in the second quarter of last year, kind of everything came
up heads and we had just about $500 million reported for last year which was pretty close to a third as a whole year. So
I think to start the discussion off, it was, in total and in particular for price, a pretty tough comparison. We did have a
slightly negative price realization, well less than 1% for Resource Industries and for Construction Industries. For
Construction Industries, it was mostly in Latin America and we have a few big deals going on down there that have a
little tighter pricing.
And I think for mining in general, it's a tough market out there right now. I mean volume is down quite a bit and I think
by and large we're pretty close to holding our own again. It was a slight reduction in the quarter compared with a really
big quarter year ago. I don't think there's any big fundamental shifts. You didn't ask this question, but I'm going to
answer it anyway. As a part of this updated outlook, before we were kind of talking about 1% up this year, but we're
not far off that. I think we're looking at just a little under 1% for the full year for the total company this year. So it was
a little tighter I think in the second quarter, but pricing didn't overall go down. It was helped a little bit by better
numbers out of Power Systems.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Hi. Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, in talking about mining, there's an awful lot of focus
on dealer destocking in the business as the big source of pain, but this is a made-to-order business. So I mean isn't the
real fundamental issue that the miners are just cancelling orders and as long as that remains the case, you're not going
to see much of a pickup in production and margins unless – until you see a pickup in orders?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, Ross. That's actually a great point and one of the things I think that's been impacting
orders – remember we don't take orders directly from the mining companies, we take orders from the dealers. The
dealers take orders from mining companies. So if you look at the destock in inventory, I think that's certainly having
some impact on the dealer order rates to us. So we definitely would like to see order rates pick up, but I think certainly
until we get through the inventory reduction, that'll probably be a drag, at least on orders placed on us. But to your
point, I'll just kind of go back to it. I talked about the surveys that suggest mining CapEx down another 20%. For that to
be the case, I mean orders have to pick up. I mean if dealers don't order anything, or – I'm sorry – or customers don't
order from dealers and dealers from us don't order anything or don't order more than 20% is just not – I don't think it's

in the cards. That would look like an optimistic number. So I think for mining CapEx next year to be down 20%, they
have to order more, dealers would have to order more from us than they are today. I'm not trying to make that overly
complex, but to say that even a 20% decline in mining CapEx, considering that dealers ought to be out of inventory
here pretty soon, would have to mean more orders placed on us. Maybe that's a better way to say it.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then you mentioned in the discussion of Resources in the press
release that acquisitions and divestitures negatively impacted operating profit by $33 million in Resources and I believe
that's with the $135 million gain from Siwei in there. So is that $33 million a year-on-year swing in earnings? Or
should we assume that Bucy is loss making at this point...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: No. No. No. No. No.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: I think what you need to do is go back. In our second quarter release from a year ago,
one of our Q&A is in the back of that release had quite a bit of detail on Bucyrus and included in there, we had pre-tax
gains on the sale of Bucyrus Distribution. We had some big ones. So basically the gains from last year on the sale of
Bucyrus Distribution to some of the big dealers more than offset the $135 million this year.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: I got you. And just related to that though, have you had an impairment test for Bucyrus yet?
And if not, is there a next test coming up? Do you do that annually?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, we do that annually. I kind of, I want to be careful on how I answer this. If you
do an impairment test, it looks forward to what you think you're going to generate in that business over a longer period
of time and we certainly wouldn't be using a cyclical low straight line going forward. In our mining business, I think
there's reasonable headroom. I certainly don't want to predict what a test would be, but I think the chances of an
impairment there are probably not – it's certainly not likely.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ashish Gupta. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Ashish R. Gupta>: Hi. Good morning. It's CLSA. I believe, in the past, Doug mentioned that China's not
over-excavated and I'm wondering kind of what the pickup in sales we've seen recently – I'm wondering how to think
about the machine population over time? Now they're moving to more to maintenance from infrastructure? I'm just
wondering, how you guys view the long-term machine population in China relative to some of the more developed
economies?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. I mean this is a case where there's a short-term story, there's a long-term story. I
think clearly if you look at long-term, I mean I know the market doesn't like to look out this far, but if you looked out at
a point where China is developed say to the level of Japan or South Korea or Europe maybe. The excavator population,
the construction equipment population, in terms of equipment relative to the economy, currently is a lot lower than
those developed countries. As the standard of living rises there, as the level of development builds out over time, the
population of equipment in China will certainly need to grow. I guess the big question you have is, will that take 3
years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, and I think that depends a lot on the scale of China's growth.
From our perspective, I think it's going to grow. I mean our view is it's probably I guess the second biggest economy in
the world today and it's growing at a faster pace than the rest of the world and its importance is going to grow and its
level of development is going to grow. And I think as a result of that, the construction equipment industry there is
going to need to grow. But it is true and we see that in our part sales in China. As the population has increased and the
equipment gets used, it has driven part sales up in China over the past few years. And as that population continues to
develop, that's a trend that'll probably continue.

<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yeah. Doug Oberhelman here. I'll just comment a bit on China, as we see it, and
particularly as I see it. I am not one in the camp of a China implosion that China will implode and drag the world down
into a massive black hole. I think what we will see in China is very healthy, with a much slower rate of growth. And I
would call it 5% to 8%, they say 7% to 7.5%, so be it. But that means a maturing of that market for construction
equipment and all kinds of things. And as that economy has doubled in the last decade, we've seen our field population
of machines grow and grow and grow, allow parts and service opportunity for our dealers and our business model plays
well with that and that's exactly what we're trying to do.
We've also been working hard on market share in China and that is up and we're quite happy with that. And in fact,
year-over-year sales are up, that is for all of our business in China, fairly substantially. So we're going to see China go
in fits and starts. I absolutely, and I've said this before to many, that I hope we don't see another double-digit boom. The
after-effects of that and the residue is painful for everyone. A 5% to 7%, 8% growth rate is just fine. We sized our
business for that. We'll do very well with that, particularly trying to get to a leadership position in market share and
that's really the way we see China overall. Mining certainly is an opportunity there and we're working on that. Much of
that is underground, as you know. We now have an underground offering to work with. So long term, China in mining
are appealing to us. Short term, we go through cycles and we're certainly in that downturn at the moment.
<Q - Ashish R. Gupta>: Thanks for that Doug. Just one quick follow-up. When you guys look at your global fleet of
machines with GPS data, can you help provide us with some sort of indication of what you're seeing globally by
region?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Ashish, I'd like to give you the answer to that, but of all the myriad of data that I made sure
I was up to speed on before I came in here today, I didn't not look at that, so I don't know the answer.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: We can't do it regionally anyway. But overall, machine operation as a service leader
units on the field population that we have monitored today are relatively steady and have been, and I think that as we
look back a few months. So overall, that's a worldwide number, including the U.S., China and everywhere else in the
world, so it's hard to say that regionally.
<Q - Ashish R. Gupta>: Great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: It's Barclays. Good morning, guys.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Hey, Andy.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Hey. So as you look at your press release, one of the things that you said is, you believe
it's unlikely that dealers will continue to reduce machinery – machine inventory in 2014. So maybe, Mike, if you can
talk about your conviction level in that statement, this is the first down cycle you've had with your PDCs, with your
product distribution centers? So I guess what I'm wondering, is there any way to look at the overall inventory in the
channel between the PDCs and the dealers to get a read on whether you think inventory is low enough that you can sort
of make that statement because it's hard for us because the PDCs are a relatively new development?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. Yeah. That's actually a very good question, Andy. If you just look at dealer
inventories, they're really today really on the lower side of the historic range, actually really on the lower side. If you
include PDC inventories, right now the sum of the two is probably right kind of maybe more in the middle of a
reasonable range and we're looking for continued dealer inventory reduction through the rest of this year. I mean we're
looking at somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion coming up in the second half. So further from here, I mean
mining inventory probably would be at about half the level that it started the year and construction down some.

Now your question about conviction level, as in all things, it depends upon what the economy does, what our sales
forecast for next year ends up being and we don't have that. But if you look at just where months of supply are, the
severity of what's happening, kind of particularly in construction, the trajectory of the way the sales chart looks, I think
there's a pretty reasonable conviction that dealer inventory is certainly not going to have the kind of declines that it had
this year. And probably, I guess at this point, I think it would be – we would have a pretty reasonable conviction that's
not going to go down certainly at least much next year, but again I'm going to qualify that, because it depends a lot
upon what happens to sales, and to some degree, when it happens next year?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Now just a couple of other comments, dealers are using PDC quite a bit more this
year. The usage rate, the percent of dealer machine sales that are coming out of PDC is actually quite a bit higher in the
second quarter than it was last year. So it looks like dealers are using PDC inventory and that's a good thing. However,
delivery times for product to dealers compared with the year ago are much less and I don't think that's probably a
surprise. So that's happened. So I think there's a pretty reasonable conviction on dealer inventory and it is going to slow
or stop.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Mike, it's fair to say then that at the end of this year when a dealer inventory comes out
as you expect that the addition of PDC plus the dealer inventories would then be at the low end of your historical range
versus dealer inventories in the past?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Well that'll depend upon what our forecast for the first quarter sales is because when
we look at it months of supply is kind of related to the forward-looking sales estimate for the quarter. So since we don't
have that out there right now, it's a little bit tough for me to just say that. But I think our expectation it would certainly
be in the range, yes.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Okay. And then if I could ask a follow-up on Resource Industries margins, I mean I
know people are already hitting you on that. I guess the issue that we have is the decremental margin in that particular
business looks exceedingly low and you've talked about really accelerating cost takeout in 2Q. Is it possible to quantify
how much cost take-out you really started in 2Q in terms of expense, so maybe we can sort of parse through why the
decrementals were so low? I know you're going to tell me that mix is negative also.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well mix is certainly negative for the total company because more of the decline was
mining, but we introduced this concept of profit curves inside the company to manage the business and each of our
three segments have a profit curve. In other words, if sales goes up there is an expectation of a certain amount of profit.
When sales go down there is an expectation that only that much will come out. It's basically think of it as an
incremental and decremental margin rate for each segment. And the takeout rate for mining is a little higher than the
25% that we look at for the total company and that's probably not a surprise. So we're trying to take actions on cost that
will allow us to get as close as possible to that curve decremental margin rate.
So they've been – I'm not going to quantify it for you, but they've been doing rolling layoffs, rolling temporary layoffs
for salaried management employees. We've taken R&D down a little bit. And the things that we're going to do in the
second half of the year, we certainly haven't announced to our own employees yet and so the specifics on that are
probably going to start coming out I would guess over the course of the next month or so. So it's probably better to talk
about the specific items after that but definitely we're planning to take some more action here in the second half of the
year. Now one thing that and this is through the first half of the year and this will ease in the second half of the year. It's
particularly hurting decrementals. And that's this period cost absorption.
I mean we added a lot of inventory in the first half of last year and in the second half. I'm not talking dealer inventory.
I'm talking our inventory. And in this year's first half, we've taken inventory out. We took about $0.5 billion out in the
first quarter. We took $1.7 billion out this quarter. And that is primarily impacted Construction and Resource
Industries. And the more vertically integrated you are, the larger the impact is on your business and that's been a
particular negative for Resource Industries in terms of incrementals. It was a positive last year, and negative this year.
It's not really an operational item, when you think about it, it's not operating efficiency. So as the inventory declines
start to slow down, that should be a little better in the second half.

<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: And for that segment of decrementals to inventory reduction would actually be higher
than 13% to 15%, as you said? For the whole company?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. We've not given out a number overall, but if you think about it the absorption thing
is basically down to fixed costs that essentially get absorbed in and released from inventory, when you build and sell
inventory. If your entire business was just buying and selling material, you wouldn't have a lot of value added to
absorb. And then the business is where you're a lot more vertically integrated, you would have more. I think Resource
Industries is probably a little more vertically integrated than in Construction, for example.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jamie Cook. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. I guess just two quick follow-up questions. Under your new
forecast, I think your old forecast implied that mining OE would be taken down about $7 billion. What are your
assumptions under your new forecasts, because I'm just trying to back in to what mining OE will be as a percentage of
total sales as we exit 2013? Because I actually think that would be most helpful as we can all – we all have different
macro assumptions, or assumptions on mining, but if we can get a sense of what mining OE would be, I think would be
much easier for us. And as I calculate, it could be as low as 10% or as high as 15% and I'm just wondering how off I
am. Then I guess, my second question, Mike. Last quarter I think you said your core mining business would be down
[ph] 50 Bucy, 15 (51:05) and then after-market flat, just can you talk to what your new assumptions are? Thanks.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. Again, if you look at the last outlook and this outlook, the main driver of the decline
is dealer inventory. So that's the biggest driver. And that is machines. So it's a combination of Resource Industries and
Construction. What we're looking at in the back half of the year is probably more slanted to Resource Industries. So I
think proportionately of the decline the outlook more of it would have been at Resource Industries certainly than
Construction. And actually, Power Systems is sort of flat to slightly up in the outlook.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay. But you didn't answer the question on -
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: We don't disclose new equipment separately from after-market in our results. So I can't
really give you a mining equipment number separate in Resource Industries. We just don't disclose it that way. I'm not
trying to be cagey. What I am trying to tell you is that, whatever your current estimate is probably the majority of the
decline in the outlook, and when I say majority I mean more than half in this context, would be Resource Industries for
equipment. They have more of the decline in dealer inventory in the second half.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: And then any change in your assumption? So Bucy is trending what you thought after-market,
can you just talk to those relative to your last forecast?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. I think directionally both of those numbers are kind of the same. But remember
when we were talking about the 50%, that's not end-user demand, that's what we're selling to dealers.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Yes.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: That has been impacted, of course, by the dealer inventories. So that means that our sales
of the traditional product is down. The Bucyrus product is down a little bit, but I think that sort of proportion that you
used with Bucyrus sales holding up much better than the traditional Cat product is absolutely true. And a lot of that is
because the dealer inventory impact is much more pronounced for trucks and dozers and wheel loaders than it certainly
is for Bucyrus product.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: And then in the mining after-market?

<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. It's holding up. It's holding up pretty steady. We had a really strong first half last
year. Coal mining was still doing okay, and then it started to tail-off a little bit in the second half of last year. But our
expectations for after-market this year haven't really changed.
<Q - Jamie L. Cook>: Okay. Thanks I'll get back in queue.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: To any degree that you would be concerned about.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - David M. Raso>: ISI. I'm just trying to gain some comfort with the second-half implied margins. If you pull out
the settlement gain in 2Q, the margins for the year so far about 8% and 9%. The second half of the year is implying
more like 11.5% to 12% operating margins. So when I think about how to bridge that gap basically find about 300 bps
of margin improvement, you're looking for sales growth of about 7% sequentially first half to second half. And I can
get a decent amount of that margin improvement with a pretty healthy incremental margin on that sequential build
increase. But can you help us a bit with the mix to better understand the incremental margins, the overhead absorption
benefit? Where do you see the 7% sequential increase? Which businesses, maybe geographies, just help us a bit we're
trying to get a feel for how much could the incremental margins be, the overhead absorption benefit. What could it be
on that sequential improvement?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I think if you – if you're just – when you say incremental margins, you're talking about
kind of from the first half to the second half?
<Q - David M. Raso>: Yeah. I'm talking sequentially.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. I think there are three big things that are driving that. One is just the absence of
negative inventory absorption. And if you start with the premise that the second half of our year, if you look at the
implied guidance at the midpoint on sales and revenues, it has sales in the second half of the year averaging about what
they did in the second quarter, but up a bit from the first half average. So volume will be some help, and we would
certainly expect a reasonable incremental margins on the volume. I mean, I'm not talking massive, but our kind of
target range is around 25%. And so incremental margin on volume second half versus first half a little better. I think the
second thing is absorption. That was a pretty big deal in the first half, and in particular in the second quarter. We had
$1.2 billion inventory decline. So that had a pretty sizable effect.
And I think the third thing is to get to a point where inventory is not going to go down further, our production needs to
go up. And that's certainly the case, particularly for Construction. And so that ought to be positive for just efficiency in
general. And then we have cost reduction activity. What we've said we're going to do it but we haven't really
particularly because we haven't announced it internally any specifics, but we're going to take additional actions in the
second half of the year to lower costs. So volume, some efficiency as production goes up, absence of the large negative
cost absorption impacts and some additional cost reduction.
<Q - David M. Raso>: But where is it coming? You mentioned Construction, but if you had to handicap – the 7%
increase in revenue sequentially first half, second half. Is the increase mostly in Construction? Is it Power? Or even
suggesting Resource Industries sequentially better. I'm just trying to get a feel to better gauge those incremental
profitability.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah. I think you would normally if you think about fourth quarter our Power Systems
business usually has a stronger second half than they do first half. So I don't know anything this year that would cause
that to be different. And where we're ramping up production is mostly in construction.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. And lastly, not to even suggest you're going to tell me 2014 sales guidance, but just
going from what you've articulated in this press release, and this discussion. You feel inventory won't be lowered

further next year as a base case right? So that's $3.5 billion of Cat sales growth next year if retail is flat. I mean, that's a
caveat there. But when I think about your commentary and your thoughts around Construction and Power, can we walk
away from this call saying base case Cat is thinking revenue growth at a bare minimum is up next year?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: You know, I would love to answer that question directly but, and I said it about five times
in my script, we're not doing an outlook. I think the message that we're trying to get people to think about is just the
scale of the impact that dealer inventory reduction has had in this year. And the likelihood that – there's a lot of water to
go under the bridge and so I'm hesitating a little bit on making too much in the way of predictions about next year. But
I think given the scale of what's happened this year it's certainly not likely that, that's going to happen again in terms of
dealer inventory reduction.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: David, Doug here. I've kind of been waiting to make this point in this inventory
swing up and down has been painful on us and our dealers. That is the fundamental reason we established our
enterprise system structure organization and emphasis a few months ago. Working on lead times, lead manufacturing
and really getting after a condensed supply chain. And that's my number one initiative between now and the end of
2015, and I think I said in the last call, we expect to see some of that in 2015. There's a lot of mine – there's a lot fruit to
be picked on this one and if there's ever a reason or a good way to get after it, it's this inventory swing that we've seen
up and down. And I just want to make sure you all understand how important that is that we get that organized. We've
come a long way but we still have a ways to go with that, and we'll start to see that manifest itself out late next year and
certainly into 2015 a little bit.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Michael L. DeWalt
With that I'm afraid we're at the end of our hour here today. Thank you very much for joining in and we'll talk to you at
