I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Mel, thank you very much.
We are pleased to announce another very solid record quarter. We delivered our 9th consecutive quarter of record
revenue. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating income and record non-GAAP net income. Our solid results in
Q3 are the proof points of the effectiveness of our vision, strategy, differentiated value proposition and continued
execution even with a challenging global macro backdrop.
Specifically in the opening comments, I would like to focus on the following five key takeaways from Q3. First, we are
executing very well and continue to consistently deliver to hit or exceed expectations. In addition to driving both top
line and bottom line growth, gross margins continue to be stable and operating margins are strong. Bottom line, we
again did what we said we would do.
Second, we are well positioned in the major technology global growth markets in the industry. Our cloud data center
revenue growth was up 77%. Wireless was up 27% and SP [Service Provider] Wi-Fi up well over 100% and SP video
was up 30%. We're continuing to deliver game changing innovations like UCS, unified access, Videoscape Unity, the
Internet of Everything and self-optimizing networks to drive the technology transitions and transform markets.
Third, we saw continued improvements from a total geographic perspective with total product year-over-year order
growth of 4% following two quarters of flat growth. Also for the first time in six quarters, we delivered positive growth
across all four customer segments, those segments being Enterprise, Commercial, SP and Public Sector.
The most important takeaway, however, for me in the quarter was the performance in the U.S. and emerging countries.
In the U.S., our Commercial business was up 13%, U.S. Enterprise was up 10%, U.S. Service Provider was up 10% and
U.S. Public Sector up 5% in terms of orders. Emerging countries also saw strong double-digit growth of 13%
year-over-year, and remember in Q2, the last quarter we reported, the growth in emerging countries was just 6%. While
we like the trends, we are managing the business to account for a continued slow, steady recovery on a global basis.
Fourth, we generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow and returned to our shareholders $1.8 billion in share buyback
and dividends.
And fifth, we articulated our strategy and value proposition to deliver a new model for IT where customers are
embracing our unique ability to drive an open systems approach to greater networking automation, optimization and
programmability. With the role the network plays at the center of every transition, we believe we are uniquely
positioned to help our customers manage through and capitalize on the opportunities they had. And in so doing, meet
our goal of becoming the number one IT company.
In every quarter, there are always areas of our business that outperform and some that under perform. We continued to
demonstrate again in this quarter the consistent strength of our portfolio approach, our discipline, our innovation and
our execution.
To provide some additional details from the financial perspective, Frank, if you'll go next on this, I'll come back and
then talk about what we're seeing in more detail from a product perspective and geographic and some interesting treads.
You'll come back, Frank, if it's okay and do the guidance. I'll provide some summary comments and then we'll do what
we enjoy most, which is the Q&A.

So, Frank, over to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thank you, John.
So we had a solid quarter despite difficult macroeconomic environments. Our strategy is working, we're growing
profits faster than revenue and increasing shareholder value remains our top priority. We have stronger operational
discipline and a more focused portfolio.
Our total revenue growth was 5% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.51 per share. We grew profits faster than revenue six
straight quarters, as measured through earnings per share. In this quarter we completed the divestiture of Linksys;
continued our NDS integration; announced two more acquisitions in software and cloud; and closed two others in
network, software and security, all in line with delivering top line growth, profitability and balancing our portfolio.
In terms of our business momentum, we saw product revenue growth of 5% with total product book-to-bill of
approximately 1%. Our services revenue grew 7%, driven by our strategy of solutions-led selling.
There are a couple of reasons for the slow growth this quarter. First, Q3 FY 2012 was a very strong quarter for services
with 13% revenue growth, including revenue recognition of several large multi-year deals that were in Asia Pacific.
Second, our services revenue growth is lower, following slower product order growth over the last few quarters. As we
discussed at our Financial Analyst Conference, our model for services revenue growth is 9% to 11% CAGR over the
next three to five years.
As I mentioned, we announced two acquisitions during the quarter, including Ubiquisys, a leading provider of
intelligent 3G and LTE small cell technologies; and SolveDirect, which provides cloud delivered services, managed
integration software and services. Both of these acquisitions, as well as our divestiture, meet our business objective to
increase growth and innovation while positioning us to provide the optimum return for our shareholders.
We continue to make solid progress with our operational excellence initiatives on both growth and operating margins.
We saw very good leverage in our profitability model this quarter with strong non-GAAP operating margins of 28.2%,
which was at the high end of our long-term financial models. In Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.0%
compared to 62.3% last quarter and 63.1% a year ago. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 62.1% compared to
60.9% last quarter and 62% a year ago. We continue to see consistency and stability in our product gross margins.
We also saw good gross margin stability across our individual product areas. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was
66.5% compared to 67.6% last quarter and 61.1% in Q3 FY 2012.
We continue to manage our overall business as a portfolio both in terms of top line growth as well as profitability. So
an example was this quarter we concentrated our set-top box sales in the most profitable business opportunities and we
chose not to participate in non-strategic and non-profitable deals. We plan to continue this discipline as we move
forward.
We saw stability and consistency in total gross margins by geography with the Americas at 62.6%; EMEA at 65.3%;
and APJC at 61.1%, as well as from a product area perspective. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.3 billion
or 34.8% as a percentage of revenue, and that compares to 34.5% in Q3 of FY 2012.
Our head count investments of 675 were specifically related to our acquisitions, as well as investments in our
engineering, as well as our services business. We expect our strategic investments in these areas to drive profitable
growth over the long-term.
Our non-GAAP tax provision rate was 21%, which was consistent with our expectations. And our non-GAAP net
income was $2.7 billion, representing an increase of 5% year-on-year. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net
income was 22.3%. And as I mentioned earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.51,

and this is versus $0.48 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, which was a 6% increase.
Our GAAP net income was $2.5 billion representing an increase of 14% as compared to $2.2 billion in the third quarter
of fiscal year 2012. Our GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.46, versus $0.40 in the same quarter
of fiscal year 2012, which represents a 15% year-on-year increase.
We are committed to our capital allocation strategy as we demonstrated by the announcement this quarter of a $0.17
per share quarterly dividend and this was an increase of $0.03 per share or 21%. Our consistent execution and strong
financial position enabled us to provide a greater dividend yield – level to our shareholders.
During the quarter, we returned $1.8 billion to our shareholders, which included $860 million through our share
repurchase, as well as, $905 million through our quarterly dividends. Our total cash, cash equivalents and the
investments, were $47.4 billion. That's including $7.9 billion available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. And our
cash flow from operations, as John mentioned earlier, was $3.1 billion and this was up 4%.
In terms of our key balance sheet metrics, DSO or day sales outstanding was 37 days, reflecting a greater proportion of
shipments in April, than earlier in the quarter. And we continued strong and consistent collections throughout the
quarter. Our non-GAAP inventory turns were a very strong 11.9.
Overall, our long-term financial strategy is performing as expected. And we continue to deliver innovative solutions to
our customers. We have the right discipline, focus and rigor, and we are going to continue to make strategic
investments and emphasize our commitment to shareholder returns.
John, I'll turn it back over to you.
John T. Chambers
Thank you very much, Frank, and nice job. I will now provide some additional detail on the performance and trends we
are seeing in our business and in the market. I will first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year
revenue growth, followed by discussing geographic and customer segments in terms of orders.
First, in Networking, we continue to drive industry-leading innovations across our core Switching, Routing and
Wireless businesses. With continued challenges in Europe and global public sector, we did see Switching revenues
decrease 2% this quarter. But in the data center, we saw continued strength in our Nexus Switching product line with
double-digit growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. And in the campus we saw good customer adoption and
growth on our fully converged wired and wireless Catalyst 3850 platform. We see demand for faster speed ports
driving switching upgrades, cycles, and in Q3, shipped a record number of 10-gig ports, growing 35% year-over-year.
We do see budgets shifting from wireline to wireless, benefiting our wireless business, which delivered another strong
quarter of record revenue growth, up 27% year-over-year. While our competitors have stumbled in this market, we
experienced strong growth across the board. SP Wi-Fi growth continued to be extremely strong, with triple digit growth
and our recently refreshed wireless LAN portfolio grew at 17%. Our Meraki integration continues to go well and we
continue to take share in this market.
Our NGN routing strategy remains solid with our architectural approach and strength in mobility providing
differentiated long-term value. In this quarter, total revenue for NGN routing was flat year-over-year. Strong
momentum in our ASR 5000 family and SP mobility with record revenues up 60% at the edge. And at the edge from a
fixed perspective, our ASR 9000 revenues were up over 40%, and this was offset by declines in our core CRS platform.
We do see SP CapEx spending continuing to be challenged, but we believe we are gaining more than our fair share
with the alignment of our product portfolio, architectural approach and innovation capabilities with the priorities
matching our capabilities to the priorities of our customers.
During the quarter, we provided additional detail on our strategy to deliver a new model for IT. Helping our customers
move beyond the hype of software-defined networks or SDN to a much more complete solution for network's

programmability and orchestration. We now have over 50 customers in beta with our Cisco 1 APIs, agents and
controllers, and announced our leadership in the Open Daylight Project, a community-led, open, industry-supported
framework to create a transparent approach to SDN. Customers are telling us that they strongly prefer the breadth and
openness of Cisco's approach and ability to build upon existing network investments and run across hybrid
environments as only Cisco can deliver. We feel very confident in our leadership position in this market.
Moving on to Data Center and the cloud. Our Data Center traction is truly impressive, with growth of 77% and
continued market share gains. As we execute on our Unified Data Center strategy, we are seeing our UCS Plus Nexus
business now on a combined run rate of approximately $5.5 billion annually growing over 35% year-over-year.
Integrated solutions such as FlexPod with NetApps and Vblock through VCE are driving significant demand for UCS,
and UCS is becoming a preferred and strategic platform across all segments and geographies around the world. Our
leadership in the data center, wired and wireless networking, and our architectural approach is enabling us to be the
trusted partner for many customers as they optimize their business for a world of many clouds.
Moving on to Video. Total SP Video grew 30%, driven largely by NDS. The NDS integration continues to go well and
Videoscape Unity is seeing continued traction. This quarter, we announced two new European service providers for
Videoscape and received the Future of Video award for innovation.
Moving on to Collaboration. We continue to improve on our Collaboration execution. While revenue was down 1%
when we normalized for underlying server revenue, which is now recorded in the data center, making a more accurate
comparison to what we've seen in prior years, the business was up 2%. Rowan, we like what we're seeing there and
really are excited about our plans for the next one to two years here.
We saw continued strength in Conferencing, up 11% due to momentum in Enterprise, offset by softness in
TelePresence, which was down 6%. Collaboration unit announced and delivered tight integration across TelePresence
and WebEx further simplifying and aligning its focus of growing a larger mix of software, which is now approximately
half of the total business of our Collaboration Group.
Moving on to Security. We saw a decline of 4% with weakness in content security, balanced in part by relative stability
in network security. The continued shift of Security business to term-based software licensing does have a short-term
impact on year-over-year revenue growth. Order growth for enterprise licensing agreements, identity service engines
and cloud web security continued to outpace overall business.
Finally, our Services business continues to be a crucial component of our strategy to become the number one IT
company. Together with our partners, we are winning large multiyear service deals, as our customers ask us to partner
with them to meet their business goals. We see near-term opportunities that leverage our solid $180 billion customer
install base and longer-term opportunities around new consumption models and markets.
In summary, we continue to focus on market transitions and customer priorities to drive our innovation and focus. We
see new business and consumption models coming into the market with increased pace. And we are very focused on
how we remain cognizant of the risk, capitalize on the opportunities and adapt to change faster than our peers, to
support our customers as their business, opportunities and requirements also evolve at this pace.
I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and
customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders, unless specifically stated otherwise. In
Q3, Cisco's total product orders returned to growth, up 4% year-over-year. Looking at the numbers from a geographic
perspective, the Americas region grew 7%. As we said earlier, we saw very strong balance across enterprise,
commercial, service provider and even public sector. U.S. public sector grew 5% in the quarter, with state and local –
state, local and education growing 13% and U.S. Federal declining 3%. As we have said before, we believe this
balanced approach to growth is a positive signal for the U.S. economy going forward.
The Asia, Pacific, Japan and China region grew orders 1%. We have, over the last several years, seen tremendous
growth in Japan. And last year, fiscal year 2012, there was growth year-over-year of 30%. This has created some tough
comparisons. We also continue to see challenges in China, largely Cisco specific, relating the business environment.
We do believe we are making progress, although we expect these challenges in China to last for several more quarters.

Our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Russia region continues to show improvement, flat in Q3, following a decline of
6% in Q2. We still see pressure in the south, southern part of Europe, with declines in the mid-teens. But we did see
growth in three of the four other regions. So you're beginning to see Europe bottom out with the exception of the south,
a great job by Chris and team in Europe.
We were especially pleased with the progress we've made in Q3 in the emerging countries with growth of 13%. As a
reminder, emerging countries grew 6% in Q2. We are also pleased with the balance across emerging countries, with
India growing 29%, Russia growing 16%, Brazil up 14%, China up 8% and Mexico up 4%. The remaining emerging
markets around the world, which is approximately 50% of our total business from emerging countries, was also very
solid with growth of 13% as well.
Now moving on to the customer market view. Again from an orders perspective, we saw growth in every segment.
Enterprise grew 3%, commercial grew 3%, from an orders perspective, our service provider grew 8% and global public
sector grew 1%.
Frank, let me now turn it back over to you for guidance.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thanks, John. Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook or the guidance for the fourth quarter.
Let me remind you again, that our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC
filings that identify important risk factors and also understand that actual results could materially differ from those
contained in the forward-looking statements and that actual results could be above or below guidance.
The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with reconciliation to GAAP. For Q4, FY 2013, while we like
the trends, we are managing the business to account for a continued slow steady recovery. With that in mind, we expect
revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 7% on a year-over-year basis. This guidance factors in the divestiture of our
Linksys product line, which contributed approximately 1% of total revenue in Q4 FY 2012.
For the fourth quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately in the range of 61% to 62%. Our
non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax provision rate
is expected to be approximately 21% in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 FY 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected
to range from $0.50 to $0.52 per share and we anticipate that our GAAP earnings in Q4 will be $0.07 to $0.10 per share
lower than our non-GAAP EPS.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and our
non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax or
other events, which may or may not be significant.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit
public disclosure.
Thank you and, John, back to you.
John T. Chambers
Frank, thanks very much.
In summary, for nearly 30 years, we've focused on moving the world to IP, first in communications and now in IT. We
built a portfolio of assets that deliver value for customers and shareholders with the discipline and the financial strength
to make long-term bets on innovation. There is no doubt that the pace of change in our industry is only increasing. Let
me be very clear. Change has always been good for Cisco. We use these times of change to get closer to our customers,

transform our business and drive new opportunities, and at the same time, break away from our competition.
Many companies are articulating strategies to expand into networking and reshape this market. Over the last 20-plus
years at Cisco, I've seen these challenges every few years. For example, I remember back in the 1990s when we were a
router company. Some believed that the new switching start-ups would topple our business. However, after the hype
settled, it was clear that Cisco was the leader, and we did it by listening to our customers and delivering products that
helped them transform their businesses.
With this strategy, we established our leadership position and increased our relevance to these customers. And we have
used this playbook again and again and again throughout our history to become an almost $50 billion company. I am
extremely confident with the hand Cisco has to play, and yet we have never taken it for granted. We take competition
seriously and, make no mistake about it, we love to compete. It keeps us focused. History is littered with companies,
large and small, upstarts and established, that bet against Cisco and failed. I have no doubt we can see this again.
We have always believed that the Internet will revolutionize the way we work, live, learn and play. This has never been
truer than it is today. Think about it – with cloud, mobility all coming together to deliver the Internet of everything, and
unprecedented new waves of opportunities for many players in our industry, and our goal is to lead this transition.
While we have to earn our leadership position every day, I believe we have the right cards, the right people, and, if
played right, we can emerge as the number one IT company in the world.
Mel, let's now open it up for questions.
Melissa Selcher
Thank you, John. We will now open the floor to Q&A. I'm first going to clarify one number that was mentioned during
Frank's. Our Q3 FY 2012 non-GAAP service gross margin was 67.1%, not 61.1%. As a reminder, as we go into Q&A,
we still request that sell-side analysts please ask only one question.
Operator, please open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thank you and congratulations on the great numbers and very optimistic guidance. John, as we
went through the last three weeks and listened to every one of your competitors, things didn't seem as rosy as you see
them. Now, clearly you're taking business away and you're executing to a higher level than others, but what is it that
you're seeing on the enterprise side in the U.S? You've highlighted that vertical specifically in the past as very critical
for the continued recovery process. How are you seeing purchasing decisions being executed over there? Are you
seeing some delays? And also, if you can revisit your perspective on Fed. Is there a bottom for that pit?
<A - John T. Chambers>: So in sequence, first, thank you very much for the compliment on behalf of us – all of us
here at Cisco. In terms of what is changing the market, our architectural approach tying together our products to solve
our customers' top priorities quicker than anyone else is really gaining traction. That's especially true in enterprise,
where Brian's team focuses on selling to the business customer in conjunction with the CIO in meeting the CEO's top
priorities.
In terms of the momentum there, the pipeline looks good. Pipeline actually increased, Rob, again faster than actual
growth this quarter and is well over $2 billion for Brian's group alone. The number of large deals, Ittai, are actually
increasing. However, you are seeing a little bit slower rate in bringing the deals home, which is a nice way of saying
you've got to have more opportunities and it might come in pieces versus before.

In terms of commercial, where you really look at what Alison has done leading our group, that's 13% growth
year-over-year, and it's probably an even more accurate indicator of economic potential in the U.S. looking out a couple
quarters. And we've seen this trend, interestingly enough, improve steadily, in both enterprise and commercial for four
quarters in a row. Alison grew at 13%, but again she sells solutions, not routers or switches or data center or UCS type
solutions.
Service Provider was very strong. Michael's team did very well there, 8% core growth, 2% from that NDS making 10%
growth. You're seeing our relevance to the large players: AT&T, the Verizons, the Time Warners, the Comcast
continue to be very solid and really make a difference. So I like the trends in the U.S.
The state and local business, as you all know, almost two, two and a half years ago was the start of the decline that
unfortunately we experienced first and shared with the market. And fast forward two years later, you're starting to see it
lead the upturn. The Federal business will be a market share change. It's who is able to really make a difference in this
market. But if you look, we experienced our slowdown a couple quarters ago in Federal, and now you're at a minus 3%
but I think you will see some of the effects make this a difficult growth market. So we're focused on building
relationships and maintaining value.
So I guess the key take-away and Rob, we saw this last night at a dinner with one of the large boards of a global, big
global multi-national bank and the day before, with a global service provider, and they bring their whole boards to
Cisco now, as we focus on business transformation, our ability to bring innovation to them, our ability to take the
CEO's top five goals and make a difference in their ability to achieve all the top five goals in ways that others are not.
I think what you're beginning to see, Ittai, is a transition for us moving from a communication company, selling boxes 5
or 10 years ago, to being a solutions company selling IT to our customers. If I were to summarize, I think the U.S. was
the example of what we want to do in the future. And I think it is also a positive trend and probably what you're going
to see the second half of the year from economic growth.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Hi, John. How are you?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Good.
<Q - Mark Sue>: If I think about one of the reasons why the multiple in tech stocks and com-tech in particular, why
they have been compressing it's been the lack of pricing power and the decline in gross margins. There were deals in
the past such as Turner where you took a margin hit, that was strategic. Now you're saying, now you're doing the
opposite, which is walking away from set-top deals which are not. Are we now at a point of structural changes for the
industry, you're going from selling boxes to selling solutions, so that rational pricing can prevail? And are we now at a
point where these things give you confidence, that your new found gross margins can actually improve further from
here?
<A - John T. Chambers>: So in reverse sequence. The gross margins, we like the 61%, 62% range, and I'd encourage
people not to get above that. But we clearly have done, Gary, a huge amount of work across the whole company on
focus on gross margins and the direction. If you sell solutions and IT solutions to the CEO's top priorities, you are at a
major premium. If you are dealing with a standalone switch or a standalone server and competing purely on a reverse
auction, RFP type of response, the margins are very low.
But I think what it does speak, Mark, it's what you're alluding to, our ability to maintain and to add value to our
customers is on very strong ground, even in the data center, where most people thought we could, quote, "Not

compete," and could not get good margins or market share, and we were obviously successful in all three.
So I think it's a combination. I would not encourage you to move the models around in terms of your gross margins on
that. We're doing a better job of getting software in, a better job of getting value for our ASICs.
Frank, you wanted to add something else?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Yeah, Mark, as we've talked about, I mean the whole thing when we look at gross margin
or overall profitability is the portfolio play, not only for the current but also the long period of time. And we want to
make sure that we have the flexibility to make trade-offs. As we talked about today, set-top box is an area where we're
making some trade-offs, it's other parts of the portfolio we'll continue to make trade-offs. And the range of gross
margin, as I talked about back in December, looking at 61% to 62% over the long-term and it could be some things that
could factor it in on the positive side, as we continue to kind of look at investments in the software area and there's
things that could also kind of be more challenging on the lower side.
So there's always going to be that balance that we're going to work through in the portfolio and we want to stay
reasonable with that kind of range over that longer period of time. And the overall focus for us is bottom line
profitability.

Thank you, your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hello, Simona.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi, John. Thank you so much. I just wanted to ask you specifically on the Service
Provider vertical, which for you was quite strong, this was a quarter when we saw a lot of misses related to the service
provider vertical and also the carrier spending numbers came in a bit lower for the quarter in some of the largest most
North American carriers. And so just wanted to get your perspective there. How much of this is specific to Cisco's
execution and share gains or the fact that maybe the linearity in the quarter changed where it got stronger toward the
end? And just if you can paint that picture looking out through the rest of the year as well?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. The linearity during the quarter for our orders was pretty typical of what we see all
Q3s. Not even a variation of 1% in the first month versus the second month versus the third month of our typical
performance. I think it does speak to our value to our customers and service providers and I think it does speak to
service providers are beginning to bet they've got to have strategic partners long-term, something that others would not
say was going occur five years ago. So we're winning the share of wallet spend.
The North American spend, especially in the U.S., is probably strongly stronger than you saw in other parts of the
world. We saw Europe challenged in terms of service provider spend and we saw some great numbers from Asia
Pacific in prior years. NTT is an example out of Japan where we maintain our share of spend but just the spending is
tighter. It's a nice way of saying, Simona, I think the carrier spend is low double digits and there might be some relief in
the second half of the year but we're focused on value to the customers and share of wallet spend and I think that was
the primary reason that we were successful.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Simona. Next question, please.

Thank you, our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Jess Lubert>: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter in a tough environment. Question is on...
<A - John T. Chambers>: Usually when somebody says it that nice, we're about to get a tough question.
<Q - Jess Lubert>: So question is on the guidance because it seems like order trends are improving across the board
yet if I do my math correctly, it seems like you're guiding for just 1% sequential growth during the July quarter which
has historically been a seasonally strong quarter for the company. So I'd like to understand some of the key factors that
you're still most concerned about from a vertical or geographic basis and what's driving you to take what appears to be
a fairly conservative approach to your Q4 outlook?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Frank, I'll take part of it then you kind of backstop me. First, is the sequentials on revenue
are usually dramatically different than the sequentials on bookings. Bookings Q3 to Q4 is almost always in double
digits. The orders come in late in the quarter. This is the quarter we build backlog and we fully intend to build a very
solid backlog going into Q1 and Q2 of next year and that's how we've always run it and that's how the sales incentive
plans are positioned.
In terms of the order rate, if you think about it, we were projecting 4% to 6% just a quarter ago. You take Linksys out,
which would be down a point, and we now said 4% to 7%, that's the equivalent of 5% to 8% if Linksys were still in the
numbers. It's pretty aggressive numbers in terms of revenue. And it does speak to our ability to forecast, we appear to
be gaining share and feel good about the momentum. But the global economy, there's still challenges. We'd like to see
more out of Asia. We'd like to see a little bit more stability in Southern Europe. We think these are pretty aggressive
outline of our goals for this quarter.
So again, I would not assume that the sequential 1% in revenue is indicative of our growth and clearly when the order
growth returned to positive at 4% that was a good start. Frank?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Yeah, John. I think that kind of covers a good amount. We've been clearly if you look at
the orders for the last couple quarters it's been pretty flat, kind of showing some growth this past quarter so we have
been improving the momentum. We're seeing some momentum improve as we've captured into guidance for Q4. But
with the backdrop of the environment and a slow and steady recovery, we want to make sure that we continue to see
that play out.
Hopefully what we're counting on here is to be able, as you said, to build some backlog which is important especially at
the end of the fiscal year, kind of going into the beginning of next year. And so we factor all that in and we feel that this
is a balanced guidance both top line and bottom line. So as John said, if you look at the top line at 4% to 7%, without
Linksys it's pretty much 5% to 8%. And then if you look at the bottom line, we're also growing profits at a pretty
reasonable rate in the range of about from an EPS perspective, 6% to 10% on the low and the high. So I think that's a
fairly good set of guidance that we're providing for the quarter.

margins, every quarter you guide below and you beat the margin, the gross margin number. And the question is, when
you take a two-year view, the last two-year view, where margins kind of were under pressure, you're back now to
margins above what we saw two years ago or one year ago. So is this the new sustainable margin of 63%? What are the
puts and takes of, I know you just said 61% to 62%, but what are the puts and takes in the margins that drove it up to
63% in the quarter that your largest and most profitable business is down sequentially and year-over-year?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So we have, Tal, as we talked about even back in December, we have headwinds and
tailwinds that we look at against that 61% to 62% if I want to be balanced looking out over the long term. Clearly, this
past quarter, very pleased with the 63% margin. I think we had many things working in our favor from across the
portfolio. As I mentioned, I think this is one of those quarters where, and I've looked through a lot of the details, we had
great execution across the board. That doesn't necessarily happen every quarter, and so we've got to make sure. Things
come up from time to time, we have to factor it in.
Secondly, the other thing, from a headwind perspective that we continue to come through from quarter to quarter, if
you look back over the last several quarters or even the last two years from a quarterly standpoint, we've had some
where it's been higher, some where it's been lower, and the variation depends on the mix, mix from the standpoint of
UCS and how fast that's growing and then also from an SP Video perspective, are the two drivers.
So mix comes into play from time to time as well as various other things from an execution standpoint within the
portfolio. So looking at that and spending the time we have across the business and making sure that we balance that, I
feel very comfortable that 61% to 62% is a reasonable range with the ability to maybe go a little higher and a little
lower depending upon how those things balance out.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hi.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Hey, John. Thanks. Quick question on gross margins as well. And I guess maybe the margin
execution in the quarter was pretty phenomenal, but maintaining the 61% to 62% longer term, I guess that would
suggest that there may be some little bit of clouds on the horizon. I guess one of the things that we would be concerned
about is potentially Cisco's ability to capture any margin shifts that may emerge with the transition to SDN. And I
mean, clearly most software defined networking developments right now are in a proof of concept phase but over the
next couple years that'll start to reach volume production. And so love to hear about your ability to capture margin in
that kind of realm. Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: So I'll cover a little bit the margin piece. And Rob, I'm going to ask you to comment
specifically about SDN, especially in the data center where clearly we're doing extremely well on our numbers. The
margins, I don't think it's going be a software game. It's going to be an architectural game where software, silicon,
ASICs, hardware, a world of all clouds play architecturally together. And as we articulate that well to our customers,
our customers are getting it and we're starting to win our big, large deals because we have the best product architectures
with routing and switching. We have the best, and using the customers' words, SDN strategy and it leveraged their
existing install base.
And what you are seeing is many of our new investments that Frank is investing in very heavily for us, have very little
revenue effect for the first year. They're largely going to be expenses this next year and those are the recurring revenues

in software as well. But if we were facing abnormal pressure from a new competitor that has a dramatically different
business model that was being successful, you would have seen different numbers in the data center and you would
have seen different numbers in terms of our growth versus our peers.
This is what I said earlier. We have a number of challenges coming at us. In the end, it will, in our opinion, in
architectural play where software will play a key component, but it will be an architecture, where our plays will, I
think, win in the end and we've done this, I don't know, I've lost track now, Rob, how many times. In fact, we're already
onto our next challenge beyond SDN without taking it for granted.
Your thoughts, Rob, and a little bit about the data center?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: Yeah. John, I think you already pointed out that in the data center switching area, we actually
grew 12%, a very big portfolio, and we've got some market leadership there. It's important to note that we just
introduced the Nexus $6,000 (sic) [Nexus 6000] (44:27), which is based on Cisco's ASICs and silicon. And I think the
real answer to the question that was just asked is we continue to see absolute evidence in the marketplace that as
eventually controllers and agents and overlays evolve, it's great hardware, it's Cisco silicon and ASICs that are going to
drive the scale that underlies the promise of SDN and Cisco software with Cisco ASICs and silicon is really the
formula. So we see that alive and well right now which is why we're doing so well and I feel very comfortable about
the future that that formula will continue to scale.

Thank you, our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hey. Thanks a lot. John and Frank, how you doing? Wanted to ask about cash and on the night
before Good Friday you snuck in a 21% dividend increase on us. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little
more about your long-term plans for dividend growth and how you balance that with buy-backs. It looks like you have
still a lot of balance sheet optimization potentially ahead of you and you could get even more aggressive if you elected
to do so. So just how you are thinking about that after this performance and what you just delivered?
<A - John T. Chambers>: So I'll take the easy part of it and just thank you all for the feedback. We listened pretty
carefully to our large shareholders and the buy and sell [ph] style (45:54) analysts on what you wanted us to do both
with dividend and buy-back and this quarter it was well ahead of our 50% free cash flow that we committed to and
don't think we won't listen to you in the future. We absolutely will very much align with how we accomplish our goals
together.
That's the easy part of it, Frank. Let me give it to you and put the meat behind it.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So, Ben, nothing really changes with the capital allocation strategy that we laid out back in
the summer of last year. I think what we've able to do since then is really continue to execute against that and that is to
say that on an annual basis that we will return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow through the dividend and the
buy-back. Clearly what we've done in the last year, it clearly is emphasizing much more heavily toward the dividend
with the increase that you just referred to and I think that's an indication of where we're probably going to go.
I mean, we're going to continue to look at both as ways of contributing cash with, I think, listening to many of the
shareholders or more of the shareholders emphasizing the dividend and also conversations with our board. That's
clearly where we have put more of the focus and will probably in the future. But balancing that minimum of 50% on an
annual basis and we're actually, as you can also see, I think we're doing a fairly decent job of managing the U.S. cash
with that as a backdrop to give us that flexibility with the numbers right now close to $8 billion; this is the highest it's
been in a long time from a U.S. cash position. And that's primarily to be able to have that flexibility to be able to
continue down this path of this capital allocation strategy.

Thank you, our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brent.
<Q - Brent A. Bracelin>: Hey. How are you? Thank you for taking my questions here. Wanted to go back to the
concept of what's changed in the environment over the last three months? I clearly appreciate your focus on a solution,
sell, three consecutive quarters of 5% growth now but your book to bill that was below one the last two quarters is now
approximately one. You're clearly seeing a recovery in U.S. order trends across all major segments. So I guess my
question here is, how much of an improvement do you see across the overall industry versus how much of the
momentum that Cisco's generating here is driven by share gains and the hand that you have specifically?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I think our movement from being a communications company and networking company to
an IT company has a huge impact on this. The communications companies, candidly, have had a pretty tough run this
fiscal year. And if you watch what we've done and we aren't completely there and we probably never will be, but our
ability to be viewed as more as an IT partner to our customers, has changed dramatically. We've watched the numbers
in the U.S. enterprise and it's been a very remarkable balance from 15% all the way down to 0%, then 5%, then 9%,
then 10%. And Alison's numbers from 22% down to 4% or 5% base and then to 9% last quarter and up to 13% this
quarter. That is solution selling. And that is share gains in large part and moving more toward what we want to do and
combining services, Gary, into the overall approach.
The emerging markets, there's been a major push in the last four months about just understanding the key government
leaders' requirements there and how we meet their requirements and driving it through. And that is, I think, even better
execution, Rob, in terms what we've done in emerging markets. It will be bumpy and it always is in emerging markets
but I like what our play is doing there.
When you were asking about Europe, we're modeling Southern Europe to stay tough. Decreases probably in the
mid-teens on that but we like what we see in Central Europe. Kind of that corridor of Germany, Eastern Europe,
Russia, U.K. has leveled out. And that's a nice job there. But I would say in these kinds of situations there's probably a
partially, an economic slow recovery. And I think the right word is slow but steady, and partially our execution on the
model.
Gary would you add anything to that?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: No, I think the – our ability to execute the visibility we have into the business to make
adjustments. Even going back to the gross margin questions, the discipline that we have, continued value engineering,
some of the things we're doing there, but the visibility that Chuck and the sales team has into discounting and those
kinds of things, not only helps us win, and close deals more quickly, but it helps us with the margins.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And again, just to note, while I'm on this, I know there are a lot of Cisco people that listen
to this, you know what we're going to do right after the call, first congratulations, and then we're going to say you have
to move faster; we've got to execute better; we've got to get better coordination across our functional groups. And if
we're going to break away at the level we want, we've got to take it up to another level as we go into Q4 and Q1. So I
don't want anybody resting on their laurels and to you as the shareholders, we aren't going to rest.

<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Good morning or good afternoon, guys. Hey, John. Couple questions, real quick. Can you talk a
little bit about on the Switching side, what you're seeing in terms of pricing pressure in 10-gig ports? What you're
seeing from, in terms of the adoption of 40-gig? Are you seeing that transition more rapidly, perhaps than you maybe
earlier anticipated? And then maybe a little bit of color around the 3850, and if that's doing anything to help your trend
on the campus side, which has been somewhat anemic, at least on the order side perhaps?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah. Well, first of all, I want to congratulation Rob Soderbery and Rob Lloyd. You all
took the Switching market after last quarter, where candidly, we lost port share. And I think in less than three months
have got our port share gains back going again. Nice way of saying it, the total port level we're back gaining share.
In terms of the data center, I think the numbers speak for themselves on it. I think we need to do a little bit better in the
modular component part. There is a transition from 10-gig to 40-gig. I think it's more of a price performance issue. And
in many of our large accounts, government and federal as an example, head count's actually coming down. And so
there isn't the normal push out of these verticals that we normally see leading it. Right now, they're actually a negative
drain in terms of the large financial institutions in the U.S. and the large Federal government.
Rob would you add anything to that?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: 3850 is ramping very nicely, John, and we have a very unique position there, leveraging our
strength in wireless and obviously the footprint we have in the wiring closets and at the edge of the network. So we're
going to watch that very carefully. But we do see a very nice ramp and we expect that, that unique value we have,
again, based on Cisco ASICs and what we've done there, will be interesting. I'd also watch the ramp of the Nexus 6000
in the data center. And we do see the penetration rates of 10-gig driving a lot of growth, about 35% up in terms of
10-gig ports.

<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Good. How are you?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Actually, pretty good.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: I want to drill down a little more on your data center growth. It seemed pretty – really pretty
strong. You said that UCS and Nexus together, I think you talked about 77% growth. I want to compare that, if that's
comparable to the 65% growth number you gave us last quarter, and if it is, it means you're accelerating there. So from
that kind of a basis that you're really taking some serious share and doing really well in the data center, couple things I
just want to dig down into. Can you cut your customer base a little bit differently to give us some insight into these
massively scalable data center guys, the Web 2.0 guys?
And is a lot of this growth, is a lot of that growth into those MSDCs or is it into enterprises? And as those MSDCs
whether it's the AWSs of the world or the Microsoft du jours, as they get more clout and cloud guys in general, sort of
just to track a lot of data center, kind of mass, let's say; how do you see that changing the business, how you do
business and the competitive environment?
So I guess it's, what's happening now in terms of growing your strength, as well as, in the future, and parleying that into
your U.S. enterprise? If you look at your order growth for the last three quarters, it's accelerated. I think three quarters

ago it was 1% order growth, this is total U.S. enterprise, then 4%, then 9% and I think this quarter it was 10%. Do you
worry that we're on this pattern of four strong, four weak, four strong, four weak? I think I asked you about this a
couple of quarters ago. Just how do you look at next quarter given you've now had several straight positive trends?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Ehud, I think our position – going in reverse order of your questions, I'll try to remember
them all. The enterprise growth is on a very good trend. I don't see seasonality on that. And I think it's probably a very
good indicator of economic growth. It's nothing to write home about but it's very solid economic growth in terms of
slow but steady in terms of the U.S. is how we're modeling. And I think this is a solution that sells in a very tough
environment so I would be disappointed if we don't continue to maintain this type of momentum in the enterprise, give
or take a couple points on it.
In terms of what we're seeing, it's all geographies and all segments of the market. You all are aware of a lot of the
rumors in the market with some of the things we're doing with SME that is absolutely targeted to massively scalable
data centers and the combinations of software and hardware and ASICs and UCS combined. And stay tuned. We're
really excited on that and I think that will prove a lot of people perhaps scratching their heads in terms of the
architecture discussion we had before and just repeating the same theme. If you can't win in the data center with
software defined networks you sure as heck aren't going to win standalone across an architecture of $180 billion install
base with APIs at each component parts all the way through it.
In terms of our relevance as an IT player, it's increasing and when you get Board of Directors coming through, not the
CIO, but the Board of Directors and top management it really speaks Cisco's position in the industry is changing. I
know to some people they might describe this in some of the news media perhaps as a – something that is primarily a
router or a switch vendor type play and movement a little bit slow. But what you've seen, I view us more as somebody
that flies underneath the radar, pretty much a stealth-fighter and when we catch our competitors, we usually leave them
behind fairly quickly.
And sometimes Gary, we take a little bit long to get focused on something but we really close well. That's a nice way of
saying, I'm real comfortable across all key customer segments where we're going. I think we are dramatically better
positioned than the traditional data center players such as HP, Dell and IBM as this transition occurs.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Ehud. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi. Thank you. I had a clarification and then a question. On the clarification, John, I thought
last quarter you said USC plus Nexus was running at a $3.5 billion annualized run rate and I thought you said the
number today was 5.5. Just wanted to clarify that.
And then a question for Frank. I believe Gary said at a conference in February that you still had about $900 million that
you could extract in terms of supply chain efficiencies in our your COGS line. I just wanted to get a sense of where are
we with respect to that goal? Is that a goal for this year? And if you could give us any sense of just other efficiencies
and improvements you can make in the supply chain and your COGS line as we progress through the year.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. Gary, take the second one and I'll see if I can get the numbers together.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yeah, so specifically what I said and someone actually put it in a paper, I think it was Simona
in a Goldman paper. What I said in the conference was that in the first year of our transformation work that we pulled
about $800 million improvement to gross margin for the value engineering, value design and some of the other work
that we're doing around component negotiation, et cetera. What I said for this year, it would be that we had targeted
another $800 million, we had upped that to $900 million and I think Frank and I did a review on this probably 10 days
ago and we're actually moving ahead of that.

So it's going be in that range but I would just tell you that on specifically everyone here is still focused on driving value
and driving the operating leverage in our business. So we continue to see opportunities like that and we haven't dialed
back on it at all.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: And it's important. I mean that just shows, even you gave two years right and we had the
pressure – and so we have to continue to kind of stay – it goes back to the comments that John made before. As we
continue to look at next year going into FY14, those are the kind of goals that we set internally that we have to
constantly keep executing on. That's going to allow us to have that offset for what happens on the price side.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yeah, I mean, so John Kern and the entire team over there in supply chain, not just with those
types of work but the whole manufacturing cost process, they're driving very hard and then the other things that we can
do there. So that was the $900,000 comment that you referred to. So hopefully that answers that second part.
<A - John T. Chambers>: So to answer your question on clarification on the numbers. The UCS plus the Nexus 2000,
5000 and 7000 is the $5.5 billion run rate. The last quarter we referred to USC plus the Nexus 2000 through 5000,
which are the bundled architectures that we do in the data center was at a rate of $3.5 billion, and that was the
clarification.
Also, I don't want – I don't know if it was Ehud or Brent or Ben, but one of you all asked us, is the UCS accelerating? I
think the numbers already are spectacular, but they tend to go up and down a little bit. Bookings didn't grow quite as
fast as revenues this quarter, and so I wouldn't be modeling in the 70s for this, but we're obviously very pleased with
growth in 60%, which I think is more what we experience typically from the UCS side of the house.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian White with Topeka. Your line is open.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian. Hello, Brian?
<Q - Brian J. White>: Yeah, John.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Hi. Yeah, just on UCS, I'm wondering if you could break out UCS. I know in some quarters
you've broken it out. I think last quarter it was a $2 billion annual run rate. Maybe you could break that out. And I'm
also curious, is UCS being driven more a majority by the converged infrastructures or a majority just by standalone
sales to customers with Nexus?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Converged infrastructures much more. Cloud is a part of it. Nexus architecture is part of it.
We even get some bare metal sold through with the non-traditional blade piece. But it is largely an architectural sale
and tied to a converged architecture and cloud movement.
In terms of the business, it's over the $2 billion run rate at the current time, and I don't want to get too specific on it but
it's reasonably over – it isn't over by a magnitude of 20% or 30%, but comfortably over the $2 billion run rate.
And I think – no, that's our last question. I want to thank everyone for spending the time today. We've got the clear
message you want the script cut down to fewer pages. And some of you have implied that our PE ratio would go up in
direct proportion to how many pages we took off, and we intend to make it short and tight, we'll try to keep the
questions to the same-type timeframe. And Mel, maybe other than end-of-year we ought to shoot for an hour
conference call when we can. Please give us the feedback overall.
We know you've got to earn your – we've got to earn your trust and confidence every day. We're committed to that.
We're committed to becoming the number one IT player and we're committed to beating our competitors and still
maintaining very good margins in a tough market. So, Mel, your closing comments?
