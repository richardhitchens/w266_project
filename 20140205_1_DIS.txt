Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon. We had a very strong first quarter with earnings per share up 32% when adjusted
for comparability, and operating income up double-digits across all business segments. Our Parks and Resorts had a
great quarter, setting attendance records at Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Resort.
The popularity of Disney Infinity drove Interactive's profitability for the second consecutive quarter. The demand for
Frozen, Star Wars and Disney Junior merchandise added up to a great quarter for our Consumer Products division and
Media Networks delivered 20% growth in operating income, led in part by higher affiliate and advertising revenues at
ESPN.
While all our operating units delivered solid results this part quarter, we are particularly pleased with the performance
of our studio, driven by the enormous success of Disney Animation's Frozen, Marvel's Thor: The Dark World and Walt
Disney Studios' Saving Mr. Banks and that's what I want to focus on today.
As we've articulated in the past, our studio strategy is to essentially make three types of movies, big releases with broad
appeal and franchise potential under the Disney, Marvel and Lucasfilm brands. Animation, which is the heart and soul
of this company and a stronger than ever under the Pixar and Disney brands and lower budget original films that
entertain audiences and enhance the Disney brand through exceptional storytelling.
In today's global marketplace, big franchise films play extremely well particularly those with [ph] added (2:43) action
or family appeal. In fact, of the world's top 20 highest grossing movies of all time, 19 are franchise drivers and almost
half of those carried the Disney, Pixar, Marvel or Lucasfilm brand. With all of the creative brands that are now product
of our company, as well as the thousands of characters and phenomenal storytelling behind them, we believe we are
uniquely positioned to maximize the ever expanding global movie market.
Our success with Marvel is a great example. There is no question, with the phenomenal success of Avengers,
strengthened The Avengers franchise and is now driving subsequent Avengers-based character films to stronger box
office performance. Iron Man 3 topped $1.2 billion in global box office, far exceeding the $632 million for Iron Man 2.
Likewise, Thor: The Dark World has delivered more than $635 million global box office versus $450 million for the
first Thor movie.
We expect this trend to continue when Captain America: The Winter Soldier opens on April 4th, in the United States.
And having seen it a few times already, I can tell you this sequel takes the Captain America story to an incredible new
level. And I think audiences are going to be more invested in this character than ever before. Because all Marvel
content and characters exist in a connected universe, this movie also sets some critical events in motion that will lead
directly into Avengers: Age of Ultron and some facets of the story in Captain America: The Winter Soldier will also be
reflected in upcoming episodes of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC.
In August, we'll release Guardians of the Galaxy, introducing audiences to a new cast of great Marvel characters. And
as we announced last quarter, Star Wars: Episode VII premiers in December of 2015, and it looks to be one of the
biggest movies we've ever released. Nothing I say here today, could ever capture or convey the magnitude of global
anticipation for this movie. So I'm just going to say the excitement is fully justified and leave it to that.
We're also very pleased with the work being done at Walt Disney Studios, blending their own form of tempo films with
lower budget great original films like Saving Mr. Banks that do so much to enhance the Disney brand image. And we're
excited about our upcoming slate including Muppets Most Wanted, Angelina Jolie as Maleficent, Jon Hamm in Million
Dollar Arm, George Clooney in Tomorrowland, which is directed by Brad Bird, and Disney's first ever live action
Cinderella.
Lastly, animation is one of our biggest priorities because it's one of our most important creative businesses. With Pixar
and the creative resurgence of Disney Animation, we now have the two strongest animation brands, generating some of
the greatest creative work in the industry with Frozen being the most recent example.

Frozen has now surpassed The Lion King to become the most successful Disney Animation movie of all time. It's
exceeded $870 million in global box office before even being released in two of our most important markets. It just
opened in China in the last 24 hours, and it will open in Japan on March 15.
Frozen is not only a tremendous financial success, it's also an incredible creative triumph, earning the Golden Globe for
Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, as well as Oscar nominations for Best Animated Film and Best Song. It also
just picked up five Emmy Awards for outstanding achievement in animation.
Two months after opening, Frozen is still big in theaters. It was second in U.S. box office just this past weekend.
Additionally, the sound track is at the top of the charts, and high demand for Frozen merchandise continues to drive
strong retail sales.
And in the tradition of The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, Disney's Frozen will also be going to Broadway.
When we acquired Pixar in 2006, our goal was to not only support and benefit from the continued creative and
commercial success of Pixar, but to rejuvenate Disney Animation under their leadership. Accomplishing this was not
only a priority, but something that is and will continue to drive value across the company for years to come. We
congratulate all those involved with Frozen. Its success speaks volumes that the future of animation at our company.
We're obviously proud of our performance this quarter, and it's very satisfying to see long-term strategies come to
fruition, delivering results and driving greater value for our company and shareholders.
I'm going to turn the call over to Jay to talk about the details of our quarter performance and be back for questions later
on. Jay?
Jay Rasulo
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Segment operating income
was up 27% on revenue growth of 9%. The strong financial performance was broad-based as each segment posted
double-digit growth in operating income and margin expansion compared to prior year. I think once again this quarter
demonstrates that our investment strategy continues to create value.
Media Networks delivered another great quarter of financial performance, led by Cable Networks, which generated an
impressive 34% increase in operating income, driven by growth at ESPN and higher equity income. This more than
offset a decline in operating income at Broadcasting.
Growth in ESPN's operating income was due to higher affiliate and advertising revenue. ESPN also benefited in the
quarter from the absence of losses at our ESPN U.K. business, which was sold in the fourth quarter last year.
Programming costs at ESPN were comparable to prior year, as contractual increases for the NFL and college football
were offset by the absence of costs for U.K. sports rights.
During the first quarter, ESPN deferred $18 million less in affiliate revenue than last year. As we look to the second
quarter, we expect ESPN to defer approximately $75 million less in affiliate revenue than last year. Ad revenue at
ESPN was up 10% in the first quarter due to higher rates and an increase in units sold, partially offset by lower ratings.
So, far this quarter, ESPN ad sales are pacing up slightly, despite the impact of the winter Olympics.
Over the last couple of years, we have provided insight into our cable affiliate revenue growth on an aggregate basis.
Given some of the recent business model changes internationally and the impact of foreign exchange rates, we think it
might be more helpful to break out the domestic affiliate growth as it constitutes the majority of our affiliate revenue.
As such, our domestic cable affiliate revenue growth was up high single-digits in the quarter. Adjust for the timing of
deferred revenue at ESPN, growth in domestic cable affiliate revenue was still up high single-digits.
It's also important to note that the growth in Q1 reflected the last quarter in which year-over-year comparisons were
aided by the new affiliate deals that took effect in the second fiscal quarter of 2013.

Equity income was up in the quarter due to higher income from our investment in A&E Television Networks, as well
as the absence of equity losses from our investment in the ESPN STAR Sports joint venture, which we sold in the prior
year.
At Broadcasting; lower operating income was driven by higher programming expenses at the ABC Network, due to
program write-offs as well as the contractual rate increase from Modern Family. Program sales in the quarter were
down compared to last year when we sold Revenge and Army Wives. Ad revenue at the network was up low single
digits in the quarter as a result of higher rates and increased units sold, partially offset by lower ratings. Quarter-to-date,
scatter pricing at the ABC Network is running more than 10% above upfront levels.
At Parks and Resorts, growth in operating income was once again due to strength at our domestic operations and
investments at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort continue to pay off. Results at our international
operations were up modestly over the prior year, with growth in Hong Kong Disneyland partially offset by a decline at
Disneyland Paris. Total segment margins were up 170 basis points in the first quarter.
Growth in operating income at our domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending at Walt Disney World and
the Disneyland Resort, partially offset by higher costs primarily related to the continued rollout of MyMagic+. For the
quarter, per capita spending in the parks was up 8% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending.
Per room spending at our hotels was up 5%. Attendance at our domestic parks and occupancy at the hotels were
comparable to first quarter last year, in which we saw increased visitation due to the opening of Cars Land at Disney
California Adventure and with the grand opening of Fantasyland expansion at Walt Disney World, the last phase of
which we'll complete in a few months with the launch of Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.
So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 7% compared to prior-year levels while booked rates are
up 2%. As Bob said, Studio Entertainment had a great quarter, as a result of the global box office success of both
Frozen and Thor: The Dark World, compared to Wreck-It Ralph and no Marvel title in the first quarter last year. Studio
operating income was up 75%, driven by increases in our theatrical business and to a lesser extent, an increase in Home
Entertainment due to lower distribution and marketing costs, partially offset by lower unit sales.
At Consumer Products, operating income increased 24% and margins were higher by 400 basis points, reflecting
strength in our Merchandise Licensing business and continued improvement at retail. Growth in licensing was driven
by the inclusion of Lucasfilm's results, as well as higher revenue from Planes, Disney Junior properties and Monsters.
On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue for the first quarter was up 5% versus last year and that follows the
9% growth in earned revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to be pleased with the results of our retail business,
specifically in North America where comp store sales were up due to strong sales of Frozen and Disney Junior
merchandise, demonstrating the power of our franchises to drive our retail businesses as well as the Disney Store's
ability to support a company franchise.
The North American stores have now posted comp store sales growth for eight consecutive quarters. At Interactive, we
had another profitable quarter, driven primarily by significant improvement in core games, and to a lesser extent,
continued growth in our Japan mobile business.
Higher operating income in core games was due to strong sales of Disney Infinity compared to Epic Mickey 2 last year.
As we look at the second quarter, I want to point out that the Easter holiday will fall entirely in Q3 this year, whereas
one week of the two-week holiday period fell in Q2 last year. We estimate the impact of this one week shift on parks
results to be roughly $45 million in operating income, shifting out of Q2 into Q3.
At Interactive, we expect quarterly results to be somewhat lumpy throughout the year and they will largely follow the
timing of key game releases. While the segment posted an operating profit in Q1, we expect an operating loss in the
second quarter that's comparable to the loss in Q2 last year. We significantly increased our pace of share repurchase
during the first quarter by buying back 25.3 million shares for about $1.7 billion. Fiscal year to-date, we have
repurchased 33.7 million shares for $2.3 billion.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Frozen seems to have had a really incredible staying power at the box office,
still doing so well domestically, many weeks after its initial release. Can you help us frame, I guess both the benefit we
may see to the studio in the March quarter from these box office results but also home video release I believe in the
middle of March, and maybe the longer-term benefits both in film and maybe Consumer Products?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, we won't give you specific numbers Alexia, but obviously the film's success continues in
the quarter that we're currently in, although it was released as you know in November, Thanksgiving weekend. So the
box office is still growing both domestically and internationally. We're second this past weekend with our sing-along.
Internationally it continues to grow. We just opened in China within the last 24 hours and we opened in Japan on
March 15. We had a mammoth opening and a great success in South Korea. It's actually the biggest animated film ever
in South Korea box office, above $45 million. So, we think that bodes well for both the Asian markets that is just
opening or will open.
It's continuing to drive sales in our stores and across licensing, so it will have an affect there. Clearly, we're having
success on the music front, albeit small from a numbers perspective. And this has real franchise potential, so just
beyond the quarter that we're in, expect to see not just with new product that we create from Frozen, but expect to see
continued interest in this and continued impact on the bottom line for quite a while.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And just a related follow-up if I may. Just on the Consumer Products business. Can you
size just about how – I guess roughly how big the business is in China? And can that business in general or should that
business in general post the Shanghai opening really have a much bigger opportunity?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Consumer Products in China is still somewhat small for us. We don't have stores we've some
licensing. But by and large, the numbers are fairly modest, but they are growing. We do believe that Shanghai will have
an impact on the Disney brand in China, which should affect both Consumer Products, and well actually movies and
television post opening, but we have no idea what that will be. But clearly it is a growth market for us. It's become one
of the largest markets in the world from a movie perspective because of all the added screens that have gone into China.
The park will have obviously a big effect on the future of our business there. So, we continue to believe and are very
bullish in that market.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you very much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay. Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.

Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. One for Bob and one for Jay. Bob, I would think there's a natural limit to
the number of brands each business or one company could support. So, maybe it's an odd question, but I'm curious if
you see any challenges managing this many franchises. And any comment about the company's ability to build more
franchises at this point? And Jay, did affiliate revenue benefited in the quarter from a higher accrual rate for DISH even

though the DISH deal wasn't done and do you plan on ever signing a DISH deal? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I think, we do plan on signing a DISH deal. Look, I think the key brands of the company are
ESPN; Disney, obviously; Marvel, Pixar, Lucas, ABC. We're not really looking to build additional brands right now
either organically or through acquisition, but these brands all have a lot of growth potential, both by mining them better
across platforms and across the world, but also by creating new franchises within each brand. So, we've already
demonstrated, for instance, under Marvel, just how strong The Avengers franchise is, and as my remarks indicated,
what impact that has on the individual components, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, specifically. We're trying and
believe we have a real opportunity to create other franchises under Marvel. Guardians of the Galaxy is the next one up,
which is for next summer, or coming summer.
So, we think that the opportunity for franchise building, given all the characters and storytelling capabilities of these
businesses are great for the company. We don't really have a problem managing the array of brands that we have. We
actually think that we're in quite an enviable position. We met recently just to look at our movie slate going forward,
and everything seems to be fitting in nicely; meaning, we don't seem to be bumping up against sort of one another
within the company. And we think that, we really are well positioned to take advantage of the marketplace without
really creating traffic jams.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Okay. Great.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Relative to DISH, Doug, I'm not going to comment on the financial terms of that renewal, but as
Bob has said before, we continue to expand our agreement with them as we continue to have productive
forward-looking conversations that we believe will result in us moving forward with them for the long-term.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Yeah, Jay, specifically I was just wondering if the December quarter benefited from your
estimates as to what the new rate card would be. So another word, the benefit of a DISH renewal already begun or is it
delayed until a deal is actually signed?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: No, I understand your question but I'm not going to give any guidance on that.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Oh I see. All right. Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Yeah, thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Jay, one for Bob. Hi, Jay, thanks for giving the pace on the affiliate
revenue growth for domestic. That's one of my go-to questions. So, let me ask this question. There is no real lumpiness
in cable network expansion in the past couple of quarters, and if our math is right this quarter cost were flat for cable in
general. So, can you talk a bit about, expectations this fiscal year for cable expense growth and the phasing of that
growth over the next fiscal year?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Sure. So, cable programming expenses are expect – we expect them to grow in high single-digits
for the entirety of fiscal 2014, but and of course that's mostly driven by ESPN. That will be very backloaded this year,
Michael, and the reason for that is basically the kick-in of a series of new deals just to tick through the Major League
Baseball. Their contract will kick in, in Q3 and Q4. The NFL contractual increase in Q1 2014 and the new deal in Q4
2014; World Cup, which, you know when that is, in our third fiscal quarter; and college football Q1 2014 and Q4; and
the launch of the SEC Network which will begin in Q4 2014. So most of those increases will occur in Q3 and Q4.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Okay. And then for Bob, you guys had talked about the cost of MyMagic+ this quarter,
but can you give us some indications of how the rollouts going on revenue and customer behavior because [ph] per
capita is really good this quarter (23:53). So, what's going on with MyMagic+?

<A - Robert A. Iger>: I can't quantify it from a financial perspective yet. It's still early, and we're still rolling out facets
of it. What I can say is that what has been rolled out, has been a real success, both for the guest and for us. So, to give
you a for instance, our Parks people in Walt Disney World believe during the peak holiday season that we were able to
accommodate about 3,000 more additional guests in the Magic Kingdom per day, thanks to Magic+. One of the, I think
most attractive features and one that I think will have possibly the biggest benefit is the FastPass+, which is the ability
to reserve three times on three attractions per day, either before you visited the park if you are a resort guest or on the
day that you enter the park if you're a same day or a single day ticket holder. What we are seeing there is substantially
higher utilization of that product among our guests than we saw with the traditional FASTPASS, by the way, by a wide
margin.
And since the goal of this was to make the guest experience better, enable the guests to experience more, to do so more
efficiently and essentially to be able to customize, we think that these are very, very good signs for us, because clearly
guest satisfaction is very, very important to the value equation for us, both, how they spend their time when they are
with us and the determining factor in terms of whether they come back. So, this is all very good. So I'd say the biggest
impact is, one, being able to accommodate more people because it's just more efficient, and second, enabling guests to
have a substantially better experience than they've had before because they're doing more.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Hi, Michael, since you mentioned the higher spending. We reported out 170 basis points of margin
improvement this quarter, but actually on an underlying operating basis, the quarter is actually even stronger than that,
because everything that Bob just mentioned, we are in rollout, new initiatives are a drag on our margins almost to the
tune of 190 basis points. Now there is some pension benefit in there that we've talked about before that the Parks get,
but when you look at adding back 190 basis points to the 170 basis points we reported, it's a very strong operating
quarter for Parks and Resorts.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thanks, Jay. Thanks, Bob.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay. Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks. So I guess, at this point, follow-ups to some of the questions asked. But starting
just on the film strategy overall, you have such a unique strategy with these very definable brands, and each studio, I
guess doing one to two films per annum. So, I was just wondering what – is there a benefit in terms of marketing cost
because they are focused what you're getting with Marvel or Pixar? And what's the ripple effect to other Disney
businesses, are you seeing, I mean obviously there is a huge benefit in these franchises, from Home Entertainment and
Consumer Products. But is there some way like a tie ratio that's – it's like an improvement that you – there are relative
improvement that you know is coming because of these kinds of films?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Yeah. Well, there's definitely benefit on the marketing front. When you put the name Marvel on
a movie, we think that it gives us essentially a head start with the audience. Just by the way the anticipation of these
films suggest that, before we even go into the marketplace with a significant marketing spend, awareness among the
potential audience is very, very high. Now that's the – probably the most obvious when it comes to Star Wars, but I've
really been impressed with the early buzz that we're seeing for the Marvel films. Captain America is just huge now.
We're already in the marketplace with some marketing, but it's been relatively limited. We had a pre-game for instance
in the Super Bowl, and yet the din, so to speak and the interest in, The Captain America film, which comes out here in
the States April 4th, seems much louder that it would be for – what I'll call a non-branded film.
And I believe that Marvel, Pixar, Disney, certainly Lucas Star Wars all basically fall into similar categories. The ripple
effect across all of our business from these films is already not only clear, but pretty significant for us, and we believe it
will only grow in significance. Frozen probably is a great example. Now you've seen countless times over the past
where a big franchise animated film has really the ability to lift the number of our businesses. We've gotten that over

the last 10 years mostly from our Pixar films, the fact that we're starting to generate that from the Disney films,
Tangled, a great example of that.
This is a huge example suggest that we're creating some momentum there, and of course Consumer Products, obvious,
what we're doing in the bottom-line in terms of music, the impact of course on home video, all big. But for instance one
of the characters in Frozen was the host of a Christmas show, the World of Color or The Holiday World of Color
version at California Adventure, before the movie even opened. And there were huge crowds just to see the character,
and the movie wasn't in the marketplace. And it ended up obviously helping us when the movie came out. But I think
there is a – I hate to use the word synergy, maybe the better word is our ability to leverage the success of these
characters and franchises, not just across the company, but across the world is I think really significant and will only
grow in significance.
Also, just a few other things, we announced, an Iron Man attraction for Hong Kong. We've talked about developing
more Star Wars presence at the Park. We don't have specifics there. But I can tell you, there is a lot of active
development there, not just for domestic parks, but for some of our international locations. You will see Frozen in more
places than you've certainly seen today. There is much more potential from Marvel in certain parks too. What we're
doing on the Interactive front, I think is also key. The fact that – the Infinity game did so well, is great in 1.0, but can
you imagine what will happen when we fuel future iterations of that game with an even broader set of our stores, our
intellectual property, and our brands. There is just a lot. I know that I sound like a huge cheerleader for the Disney
brands, but I obviously, I'm feeling rather enthusiastic today because of these earnings, but continue to feel very
optimistic about the potential.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: No, it's obvious you have a very, very unique strategy and the film, across all your
business, but started by film. And then just my second question on MyMagic+, I know you said the benefit of guest
satisfaction, but there must be some benefit to revenue to be able to spike what the price was and get out of one of the
stores quickly, is it showing up in the per cap revenues? On the cost side, how much more is there to go? How much
more is there to go on those?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, look, what we spend and then how we account for it, I don't really want to get into that.
There's some impact on the bottom line, but this is still a very new product, so we're not even close to being able to
quantify it in a public sense. In fact, we're actually just learning more about how it's working and what impact it's
having on our business today. I think you may be jumping to conclusions that the per cap spending was the direct result
of MyMagic+. At this point, it's still a little bit early. It's possible that it had some impact, but I can't say today that we
know for sure that it did. We do know, as I said, talking to George Kalogridis who runs Walt Disney World, which I
did this morning, that he really believes that we are – he was able to accommodate 3,000 more people a day in the
busiest period of the year in the Magic Kingdom, which is our number one park. That obviously has bottom-line value,
but we can't tell you what that is.

Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi. Thank you. A quick one for Jay and then one for Bob. Jay, just with on A&E Television, last
quarter, I think we saw some surprising softness there; this quarter looks to come through particularly strong. Can you
just comment like, is either quarter more emblematic of how that business is performing, or is the right answer
somewhere in between? Thanks. And then Bob, I just want to ask you what do you think about like what comes next at
Interactive. You started talking about it a few minutes ago in your euphoric listing of all the great brand string at
Disney, but you've been marching with a goal of profitability there for a long time, and so you've gotten there. So what
now? How big can that be? Are there more big product launches like Infinity to come or do you just keep adding that

for a while. What is your – where do you want to take that business over the next X number of years? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Thanks, Todd. Starting with AETN, I would look at last quarter more of an outlier than I would this
quarter. They basically have – saw higher advertising revenue driven by shows that you can probably tick off as easily
as I can. Duck Dynasty, Pawn Stars, Ax Men, Dance Moms and on Lifetime they've got some new scripted shows, so,
that's basically what is driving their success. They had some lower program new marketing cost this quarter, but in
general, we're incredibly happy with our investment in A&E and I think that you can continue to look for good things
there.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the Interactive front Todd, there will be new iterations of Infinity, what that game proved to
us is the strength of that platform of basically the gameplay itself, which was great and the fact that Disney characters,
Disney intellectual property, could work on that platform. So, that's a big deal. So, what's next of course is new
iterations of that, a 2.0, a 3.0 and mining a broader set of our more popular characters. What we're doing the rest of
Interactive, you'll see more licensing rather than publishing on the console side, except for Infinity.
We're also basically tracking what we're seeing in the industry, doing a fair amount of work at creating efficiencies and
moving off of some of the more traditional platforms into the mobile space, mostly for social games and for other
casual games. That's a big move for us and some of the announcements that were made this week are indicative of a
shift in strategy there, to both reduce our spending in that space and to basically seek to grow the business where the
customers or the users are, which is more on the mobile front. I think those are the two, Infinity and then a move to
mobile, basically for all our games, the two big trends you'll see, again, all with an eye toward not just being profitable,
but improving profitability and no guidance there in terms of how profitable this could become.

Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Jay, I want to come back to the ESPN comments you made, first on the
expense side, I think you said high single-digit programming costs for the year for the cable segment, so overall
mid-singles and you include SG&A and I don't know if you're willing to quantify the U.K. impact on the revenue and
OI line in the quarter, but just trying to get a better sense to serve the organic trends in the ESPN business.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Thanks, Ben. Coming back to the U.K. question, so you know that this was an unprofitable business
for ESPN, in round numbers, the impact is about $20 million of benefit to the quarter. And they had round number $65
million of affiliate revenue that flowed to that company and obviously the expenses were higher.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. And you had made a comment in your prepared remarks, that you were reminding
us this is the last quarter of benefiting for some renewals, are you suggesting there should be a bit of a slowdown in the
March quarter on domestic affiliate? I just want to ask you a follow-up on that point?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: I'm not going to give you a prediction on what those numbers will look like. I'm just saying that we
as of next quarter we'll be lapping those, I think it was five affiliate deals that were renewed on prior year.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Got it. And then just lastly, Bob on the film business one of the things that's been a
headwind in the industry has been home video, and I'm wondering if you're feeling a little better about the outlook
there, given some of the successes on digital and EST, is it sort of too early to get excited or do you feel like maybe that
business, that part of the film business starts to grow from here.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: At least as we see, if you look back on 2013 across the industry. You saw low double-digit
declines and I think the number I heard was 13% on the physical sales side. And an increase of about 50% on the
digital side, obviously on a much smaller base. The result of both was that home video was relatively flat, not flat for

the year. I guess that is a good sign because the continued deterioration of the physical goods sized at least is being
mitigated somewhat by digital. We have been bullish about digital, particularly our prospects in digital because we
think we got brand advantage there by creating destinations on digital platforms for our brands. I think Marvel, Disney,
Pixar, Lucas as for instance. We think there will be opportunities either through digital emporiums, Emporia or
directly. But I don't, I think it's still early in terms of just how significant that all could be. I think the bottom line is that
we are making movies that we believe stand a better chance of doing well in the secondary markets than called
non-branded, non-franchise movies, particularly movies that are directed at families.

Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks very much. Couple on ESPN. The 10% ad sales growth in the quarter, just
wondering Jay, maybe if you could talk about the drivers of that, you were able to grow ad sales through some of the
rating softness and just want to hear about how – the drivers there and then looking to the next quarter, if we were to
kind of exclude the impact from the Olympics that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what would be recurring
ad sales growth of ESPN look like? Thanks, and I have a follow-up.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Okay. Well, I hate to be tautological, but what was really the ad revenue growth are the rates that
ESPN received for the ad it sold in its programing, and I think I also mentioned, but if I didn't, I'll tell you that the units
were also up for the quarter. And that was somewhat offset by the lower ratings that you mentioned. So, that was really
the driver there. Relative to the Olympics, you know we don't expect there to be a significant impact on our networks
from the Olympic period coming forward nothing, I would say de minimis, if I were to describe it.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Just a quick follow-up about the launch of the SEC Network. Would love to hear a little
bit more, about if you could just remind us about the opportunity there in terms of ad sales growth, affiliate fee growth
and will there be any launch costs associated? I know you mentioned about the right fees hitting but, are there any other
launch cost that we should be mindful of as it pertains to the SEC Network? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: So, obviously Anthony, there will be production costs associated with the SEC Network in addition
to the rights cost from the conference. But I don't want to – I don't like to predict out of the future in terms of what the
rates of subscribers will look like as we ramp that up. Suffice to say, we are extremely excited about this opportunity.
Anyone who is – at all interested in college football, he is well aware of the impact of the SEC, not only in the States
that encompass the schools, but more broadly because of their powerhouse nature in college football, and we feel great
about the opportunity to sign a long-term deal with them.

Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Thanks very much. This question is I guess for Bob, Bob as improved VOD technology is being
deployed and consumer behavior suggests it's poised to supplant DVR usage as the preferred method of time shifted
viewing. I guess Disney and the rest of the existing TV ecosystem have opportunity to sort of out-Netflix Netflix, and
the S5 guys by, you can enable viewers to sort of binge on stacked episodes or the best shows on television, and need
digital SVOD services. But the issue with the opportunity seems to be that some of the contracts that you all signed
with these digital guys limits the amounts of episodes you can stack on VOD. So, I guess my question is in the long

run, do you think that structure needs to change? Would you like to see full season stacking on VOD, what is stopping
that, how do you see it evolving?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: That's a very good question. Our feeling on this, first of all, that product is differentiated from
Netflix, and that Netflix, at least their off network deals offering prior seasoned shows, first of all, for a subscription.
The VOD largely has look back of five episodes. The demand for essentially a full season, which is think is growing, is
out there. But I think that's an opportunity in terms of monetization for us, either directly from the consumer or by the
distributor or from the distributor I should say. And so, if distributors are going to be given the ability to offer their
customers essentially same season, full season stacking, then there's a cost associated with this, and we expect to get
paid for it. And again, an interesting opportunity for us.
The other opportunity, of course, is a world where consumers do not have the burden of having to set their DVRs for
shows, and in effect have access to many more shows without having to essentially do something premeditated or
before-a-show-airs perspective. That will increase, in my opinion, the non-live viewing of programming, and then the
question is, what is our monetization capabilities there? Right now, there is some disablement of the commercial
skipping in the C3 window, and so we're actually getting ratings for and thus getting paid by advertisers in that
window.
If consumption increases there, and I believe it will because of the availability or the ease of use in that window, then I
think that monetization can increase as well. And that's why I think it's very, very important for us in that window to
protect the value of the commercial. Eventually, there will be dynamic ad insertion, and that will, I think, result in even
more opportunities for IP owners or networks to monetize, but that's just starting.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: David, thank you. Operator, next question, please.

Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks so much. This is second quarter in a row, I guess, where I've been surprised at
the strength in your Consumer Products division. And I was just wondering if you might – you may not have this, but is
there any rule of thumb you could share with us in terms of the linkage between box office gross and Consumer
Products sales? In other words, if the movie sort of naturally fits toward selling Consumer Products and you do $10 at
box office, you will do X dollars in Consumer Products. And the reason I ask is my sense is this could be very big as
we glide towards Star Wars VII? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Jason, there is no rule of thumb because it's not really about box office, although box office has
an impact; it's about whether the storytelling and the characters are easily leveraged or adapted to various forms of
Consumer Products, whether it's toys or books or whatever – or clothing, you name it. So, it's more about that. If you
have both, which Frozen is a good case in point, you also have play patterns, for instance, Princess. You've got great
characters, you've got great music; and you have huge box office, that's as good as it gets.
And the Marvel movies tend to fit into that category, as we know, not all at an equal level, but certainly, they have that
opportunity, and you mentioned Star Wars, of course, that's probably at the top of the heap. Cars was another great
example of that. But it's not – obviously, box office has an impact because it suggests popularity of characters and
stories, but you still have to have the right characters and stories to ultimately monetize on the Consumer Products side.
Also, it's not just about movies; it's also about television. So, if you look at Disney Consumer Products today and you
look at the last couple of quarters, one of the reasons why you continue to see growth is the success of programs on
Disney Junior, which is a platform that we only launched within the last year and has suddenly hit big in terms of
interest with young kids two to five, where actually it's done well in ratings even kids older than five, with a number of
shows, Doc McStuffins and Sofia the First. Two obvious examples that are very monetizable on the Consumer

Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. I have two quick questions. First, it sounds like there was a benefit from the
absence of ESPN STAR Sports, so how much of a drag was this last year in the comparable quarter? And then
secondly, Jay, you mentioned fiscal Q2, there'll be a loss in Interactive, and can you just talk about what that's from?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Starting with your second question, our results at Interactive are very tied to game releases, and in
Q2, we don't have – we're not releasing any big games. Obviously, you know the division continues in terms of its
production capabilities and distribution capabilities. So, without the release of a title of significant revenue, we're going
to have some downdraft in those quarters. Your first question, relative to ESS, STAR Sports, look round numbers, it's
about $20 million of drag that we got the release from this quarter.

Our next question comes from David Miller from Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Miller>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the stellar results. Bob, I'm just curious if you guys are in
negotiations with the domestic theater circuit here, so far on Star Wars. Are you in discussions with these guys about
maybe taking advantage of just pent up demand here? A massive amount of pent-up demand and maybe gunning for
more than 52% on theatrical splits or are you just not there yet, it's just too early? Anything you're willing to tell us
would be great. Thanks very much.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We did some new deals with the domestic distributors within the last year. I'm not aware that
we're in negotiations now, but we did some deals in the last year and those deals reflected the strength of our studio
slate in the year and years to come. So that would obviously include Star Wars. And there are potentially additional
opportunities worldwide, but I can't really comment further on the state of any negotiation or whether there is any
negotiation going on.

And then separately for Jay, retail business, I believe in North America clearly I think seems to be outperforming the
overall industry for the holiday season, I know a lot of retailers had actually reported lackluster results and you guys
have put together some really consecutive streak there. So, I'm just wondering if, what you see as the main driver of
that. Are there any trends that you're seeing in terms of any particular items or SKUs that are driving the momentum?
Any kind of color for the future would also be helpful. Thank you. Hello?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: To get them to carry the WATCH app and to enable us to monetize them, that's the component
of the negotiations that are underway right now. So growth and adoption will come in part from not just consumer
demand but new deals that we've cut. We're also seeing some modest advertising growth. We believe that will increase
obviously with greater adoption, but also when we start getting more meaningful data from Nielsen on consumption on
mobile platforms. So, all very positive as we're concerned and clearly the quality of the devices is improving as well
both from a speed perspective, the quality of screens and that's a good sign too.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: On your question on North American stores, Tuna, obviously we are very-very happy with the
development of our North American retail business. I think I mentioned this two year in a row every quarter. We've
seen ups and there are couple of pieces to that. First of all, you'll recall that we have reoriented our stores in our best
locations towards a more franchise focus from what they were before, which for lack of a better term, I'll call them
more emporium focus. And, highlighting franchise as they are hot and popular, that's had a definite impact on the
results of the Disney Store, and it has resulted not only in quarter-to-quarter higher comp sales but also higher gross
margins across as we get to really front items that have better margins and those items end up getting purchased in part
because of how they are merchandised. But you can't forget the power of the franchises that backs those
And over the most recent quarter, obviously, if I had to pick out a single item, I would say Frozen items were the
single-most demanded items at Disney Store, but quickly followed by the power of the Disney Junior properties that
have come on amazingly strong. So, the combination of powerful franchisees as Bob mentioned 10 or 15 minutes ago
in terms of the quality that drives Consumer Products in addition to just better merchandising as a result in much better
results over the last couple of years.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay, that's very helpful. Did the new concept have anything to do with that at all? I know you
were starting to roll that out a couple of years ago, where do you stand with that now?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yeah, that was the first thing I said as we renovated a lot of, we're up to almost a 100 stores now
worldwide, renovated into IP, so what we call Imagination Park stores. That really reoriented the way we merchandise
to highlight franchises of the company, rather than being emporium style where you might go to find anything Disney.

<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Tuna. Operator, we have time for one more question.

Okay. Our last question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions. One is just back on the strength in
advertising in the ESPN in the quarter. Can you talk a bit – most of us believe that advertising on – related to sports is
more valuable due to the DVR resistance to the content. Can you talk about the relationship in pricing between sports
inventory in general and entertainment inventory? Is it much higher on sports inventory and are you seeing the value
increase at a faster pace there? And then secondly, talking about the films in China, you did the partnership, the
production partnership on Iron Man 3. Can you talk about whether or not you think that was a strong, a big contributor
to the strength that that film had in China compared to the second film in the series and whether you plan to do more
partnerships like that in the future? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Thanks, Michael. On your question on advertising. Look, I'm not a 100% sure how to answer that
because obviously there is a wide variety of programming across the ESPN network. Some that demand very high rates

and some that go on a lesser rates. So, I don't know how to compare that head-to-head to the kind of advertising on
entertainment product. There is also the notion of the multiplatform capabilities of ESPN, that, of course, they have
sold, we have talked about to you folks a very aggressively in that being number one in all but magazine publishing in
terms of platforms really gives ESPN incredible leverage; and advertisers, lots of opportunities to take their products
broadly to consumers where those consumers live today.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the China question, the success of Iron Man 3, I think it was mostly due to the film itself,
and the continued interest in and knowledge of Marvel, and Iron Man, in that particular case. And we think that the
Marvel brand as it grows in China bodes well for future films, starting with our next one. I don't think it's a function of
necessarily of partnerships.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Maybe if I could, just on the first question, I'll ask it different way. For the same-size
audience, is it more expensive to buy, let's say, a produced sporting event than it is a scripted original program that's
also, what, a high quality program, and if so, are you seeing – or are you seeing a differential in, let's say, those two
types of programs expanding as time progresses?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Not sure there's easy answer to that. You're selling basically the same-size audience or a
specific size-audience within a demographic; whether that's delivered in live or whether it's delivered in the C3
window. Now, obviously, C3 is not a selling demographic or a selling point in sports because it is live. But you're
basically selling eyeballs, whether they're delivered right away or within three days, I don't think you see a
diminishment in quality if you deliver the eyeballs live versus if you deliver them within that window. There are plenty
of entertainment programs that are sold on a C3 basis and with comparable ratings do just as well as sporting events
and with comparable ratings, again, I'm talking delivery of demographics.
So, I don't think the advantage of course of live is that it doesn't fall out of the C3 window or the non-monetizable
window, so one of the reasons why we're all are interested in monetizing consumption beyond just three days. I was
looking by the way at numbers for our primetime schedule and I was pretty impressed with the LIVE+7 ratings, we've
got shows that jump over 50% in 18 to 49 delivery in the L+7 rating category and yet we're only monetizing C3. So
that just speaks to more of an opportunity there. But I don't think you're seeing much of a differential in terms of
absolute rates again for comparable audience delivery sports live versus another program that is not live.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Yeah. Thanks, Mike.
