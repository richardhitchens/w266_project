MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Medtronic fourth quarter earnings conference
call. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014, which ended April 25, 2014.
After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
our revenue by business summary.
You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements
and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional
information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the
SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our
website at medtronic.com.

And finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in
comparison to the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal year 2013 respectively, and all year-over-year revenue growth
rates are given on a constant currency basis.
With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth
quarter revenue of $4.6 billion, which represents growth of 3.3%, and Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of
$1.12.
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap fiscal 2014. We grew our FY 2014 revenue
4%, which was in line with our revenue outlook for the year and just within our mid-single-digit baseline goal. It
represented another year of delivering consistent results. We made solid process in a number of areas over the past
year, including quantifying, communicating, and executing on each of our independent growth factors.
Our first growth factor, new therapies, contributed 180 basis points of growth in FY 2014, as we launched several
significant new products that provide tremendous patient benefit and will serve as important future growth platforms.
In our emerging markets, we sustained double-digit growth, which contributed nearly 150 basis points to our overall
revenue growth and represented 12% of our global business in FY 2014.
Finally, on our third growth factor, services and solutions, we sharpened our focus on economic value, translating our
efforts into new value-based business models, including our cath lab managed services and Cardiocom offerings, which
combined contributed 30 basis points of growth and $51 million of incremental revenue.
Healthcare payments and delivery systems are changing and evolving around the world. Through these efforts, we feel
we are well positioned not only to respond to these system changes, but to demonstrate the role medical technology and
related services can play in making these healthcare transformations successful.
Looking at the P&L, while we delivered a modest amount of SG&A leverage on an operational basis, we failed to meet
our SG&A leverage goal for the year due to our Q4 spending, which I will address in a minute. However, on an
operational basis we did deliver 50 basis points of operating leverage in FY 2014. And looking at our FY 2014 EPS, we
were in the middle of our guidance range for the year, covering for the incremental pressure from the medical device
tax.
Looking at free cash flow, we had a very strong year in FY 2014, generating $4.6 billion as we continued to deliver on
our working capital improvement program. This transfigured into strong shareholder returns, as we met our goal of
returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
Achieving these financial metrics ultimately reflect the dedication and passion of over 49,000 employees living our
mission every day, collaborating with our partners in healthcare to deliver therapies and services to millions of patients
around the globe, alleviating pain and restoring health and extending life.
Looking at our Q4 performance, while our 3% revenue growth was in line with our full-year revenue outlook, it fell
just short of our mid-single-digit growth baseline goal. However, it is worth noting that this performance was against a
difficult comparison of 5% growth last year. Strong performances from some of our key high growth businesses,
including the AF Solutions business in CRDM, the DBS business in neuromodulation, surgical technologies, and
diabetes helped to offset challenges in other areas. In core spine, the business showed stability again in Q4, consistent
with our results all year. We also saw solid growth in our new services and solutions businesses, Cardiocom and cath
lab managed services.
At the same time, our recently introduced new products continued to drive growth. The MiniMed 530G system with the
Enlight sensor is taking meaningful share, resulting in strong U.S. diabetes growth.

In CRDM, we had a very successful global launch of Reveal LINQ, a differentiated miniaturized cardiac diagnostic
monitor. This technology has been extremely well received by both patients and physicians and promises to be an
important new tool in cardiac and stroke diagnostics.
In Structural Heart, our U.S. launch of CoreValve is off to a good start, as we treat patients with extreme risk of surgery
with this unique technology. We're excited about the momentum we've seen in all of these areas and the future growth
that they represent.
We also faced some challenges in Q4. The U.S. pacemaker and ICD markets were both a little slower than we were
expecting. In addition, share gains in the U.S. pacing systems were offset by share pressure in U.S. defibs.
In Spine, while our core business excluding BKP posted modest growth, BMP and BKP declined, though both
continued to show sequential stability. We're continuing to implement our plan to broaden our BKP product line,
including adding new products in interventional spine. Chris O'Connell will share details of this with you at our
upcoming analyst meeting.
In BMP, we pointed out in our last earnings call that we faced a difficult year-over-year comparison following the
resolution of the supply disruption last year. In neuromodulation, our gastro-uro business saw weaker than expected
new patient demand in early calendar 2014, which we believe was due in part to insurance changes for elective
procedures in the U.S. We also continued to face some challenges from non-device alternatives. We've seen some
recent improvement in new patient trends and remain confident in our ability to demonstrate the unique value of
InterStim therapy as the basis for attractive growth in this business.
We had four major U.S. clinical data presentations in Q4: CRYSTAL AF, CoreValve for High Risk, SYMPLICITY
HTN-3, and IN.PACT Admiral DCB. CRYSTAL AF was presented at the American Stroke Association's International
Stroke Conference in February, where its compelling data demonstrated that our Reveal Cardiac Diagnostic Monitor
detected AF better in patients with recent cryptogenic strokes than standard care.
At ACC [American College of Cardiology] in late March, impressive results from our CoreValve High Risk U.S.
pivotal trial were presented, showing superiority over surgical valve replacement at one year. In addition, the low
mortality rates of our differentiated CoreValve system in patients considered high risk for surgery exceeded
expectations. I was at ACC, and many physicians shared with me their personal excitement regarding these
ground-breaking results.
Also at ACC, we shared our analysis of the HTN-3 data for treatment-resistant hypertension. While HTN-3 met its
primary safety endpoint, it was disappointing that it did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint. We convened an
independent panel of expert physicians and researchers to advise us on next steps to our Ardian program. Based on
their input, we decided to continue to provide access to SYMPLICITY in countries where it is approved and continue
to involve patients in the global SYMPLICITY registry. We are not abandoning renal denervation opportunities. We
will continue to bring insight from the HTN-3 trial and map a clinical and commercial path forward in collaboration
with the FDA.
One week after the ACC, the extremely positive results of our IN.PACT Admiral drug-eluting balloon U.S. pivotal
study represented at the Charing Cross symposium in London. This study showed patients with peripheral artery
disease in the upper leg experienced significantly better outcomes at 12 months when treated with IN.PACT Admiral
than those treated with standard balloon angioplasty. We are currently expecting FDA approval of the IN.PACT
Admiral about this time next year and believe the global markets for DCBs could be $1 billion by 2020, a driver of
growth not only for our endovascular business but for overall Medtronic.
In Q4, our international business grew 5% and accounted for 47% of our total revenue. Emerging markets delivered
improved overall performance, growing 14%. Our Middle East and Africa region in particular had a very strong finish
to the year, growing 29%. This was driven by strong execution of several tenders in a number of countries across all
three business groups.

Our channel optimization strategy also added to the performance in the region, as we recently became majority owners
in a new collaboration with our largest distributor in Turkey. This transaction not only allows us to work more closely
with providers in this important market, but also unlocks incremental margin. We intend to continue to identify and
pursue similar channel opportunities to optimize our performance in emerging markets.
Also, our results in Greater China were significant, where we experienced a modest improvement in underlying market
dynamics and grew 15%. On the other hand, growth remained slow in our Central and Eastern Europe region, driven
primarily by challenges in Russia. Healthcare spending has tapered in Russia and did not improve as we expected due
to the unforeseen geopolitical events. India also remained under severe pressure, declining 14%, as we continued to
face challenges from the previously discussed termination of one of our largest coronary distributors. Going forward,
we're focused on developing unique commercial and market development partnerships with different providers in order
to drive rapid improvements in therapy access and improve our performance in India. Despite the challenges in Russia
and India, we are encouraged by improved growth in emerging markets and remain confident in our long-term outlook.
Turning to the P&L, our SG&A expenses were higher than expected in Q4. Some of the additional spending was due to
the accelerated field investments that we decided to make given the strong new clinical data that was presented during
the quarter. However, there was also a component that was unexpected and frankly a surprise. This is clearly an
execution issue and something that should be controllable. I take execution misses of this nature very seriously. I'm
disappointed with these results and am taking immediate action with my management team to tighten up our spending
control processes.
Also in Q4, as in previous quarters, we had elevated levels of spending within cost of goods sold to address quality
system improvements in our neuromodulation and diabetes business. While we expect these costs to taper over time,
we do expect them to continue in FY 2015. These efforts are costly but they're non-negotiable and are critical to
ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance. We will not curtail or minimize these needed
investments to ensure our products meet their quality and performance obligations.
Finally, on a positive note, I'm pleased with the way our global team executed on our working capital improvement
programs, driving strong quarterly free cash flow of $1.2 billion.
As we look ahead to FY 2015, we remain focused on striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. To
achieve these goals, we need to continue the momentum we built in FY 2014 on our three primary strategies: therapy
innovation, globalization, and economic value. We are confident that these strategies will further strengthen, diversify,
and expand our market-leading competitive position. As I mentioned earlier, we're actively translating these conceptual
strategies into three distinct growth vectors: developing new therapies, penetrating emerging markets with existing
therapies, and building new independent services and solutions.
Starting with new therapies, we are poised to deliver a number of innovative products to the market and expect them to
generate 150 to 350 basis points of growth. In Structural Heart, the ongoing U.S. launch of CoreValve and the
European launch of Evolut R will be significant contributors. We're pleased to announce today the global patent
settlement with Edwards. This comprehensive agreement removes uncertainty for the next eight years, allowing us to
completely focus on providing access of our important CoreValve technology to patients.
We expect additional growth in our cardiac and vascular group to come from Reveal LINQ, TYRX, and AF Solutions,
as well as continued growth in endovascular from our aortic business and drug-coated balloons. In Spine, we're
expecting a number of new cervical and interbody product launches, the ongoing adoption of Surgical Synergy, as well
as continued stability in BMP and improvement in BKP. The RestoreSensor, SureScan MRI in neuromodulation, and
new capital products in Surgical Technologies should also deliver growth, good performances in FY 2015.
In diabetes, the continued rollout of the MiniMed 530G system in the U.S. and expected launch of the MiniMed 640G
in Europe should result in another year of strong growth. It is worth noting that we're working collaboratively with the
FDA to accelerate the U.S. timeline of our next-generation insulin pump system, and we're optimistic that we can bring
this new technology to the market sooner than previously anticipated. We are mutually committed to advancing access
to this important technology with all of the requisite patient safety requirements being met and we truly appreciate the

agency's focus in this area.
Finally, last week I appointed Hooman Hakami to lead our Diabetes group. Hooman is an outstanding leader, has a
track record of driving growth, and I'm confident that he will work to strengthen our core insulin pump and CGM
franchises as well as realize the tremendous growth opportunities in the Type 2 market and in overall international
expansion.
In our second growth vector, which is increasing the penetration of our existing therapies in emerging markets, we
should see momentum continue through not only our traditional market development activities but also new business
model innovation in the areas of channel optimization and broader partnerships with governments and private
providers. We expect our emerging market growth to accelerate in FY 2015 and contribute 150 to 200 basis points to
our overall growth.
Our third growth vector, which is creating value-based services and solutions, is also expected to deliver incremental
growth in the coming year, with a contribution in the range of 40 to 60 basis points. We're expecting Cardiocom and
cath lab management services, which are reported in our CRDM results, to more than double in size in FY 2015.
Looking at our growth vectors, it is not unreasonable to expect a revenue growth acceleration of 50 to 150 basis points
over what we delivered in FY 2014. However, given the dynamic nature of our marketplace, we feel that our revenue
outlook of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic. Ultimately, our goal is to build a business that is diverse and robust
enough to absorb challenges while still delivering on our baseline expectations, something that we feel we're beginning
to do.
At our analyst meeting in a couple of weeks, we will share in detail with you how we intend to deliver on our baseline
goals. We will lay out for you our full pipeline of innovative therapies across all of our businesses, discuss the efforts
we are making to develop and grow in emerging markets, and explain our innovative new business models and
partnerships that we believe will help shape the future healthcare landscape. In addition, we will present a detailed look
at our financials and update you on the progress we are making on our important product cost reduction and working
capital initiatives.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our quarterly results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.566 billion increased 2.4% as reported or 3.3% on a constant currency
basis after adjusting for a $39 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q4 revenue results by region were as
follows. Growth in the Middle East and Africa was 29%. Greater China grew 15%. Growth in Latin America was 13%.
Other Asia-Pacific grew 5%. Growth in Japan was 4%. Central and Eastern Europe grew 3%, and the growth in the
U.S. was 2%. The Western Europe and Canada region grew 1%, and South Asia declined 14%. Emerging markets grew
a combined 14% in Q4 and represented 13% of our total sales mix.
Q4 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.12, an increase of 2%. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.44, a decrease of 54%. This quarter's GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments included: an $85 million pre-tax
net restructuring charge primarily related to our renal denervation business, back office support functions in Europe,
and global manufacturing consolidation; a $746 million pre-tax certain litigation charge primarily related to our global
patent settlement with Edwards and our INFUSE product liability settlement; a 13% pre-tax charge related to
acquisition related items; and a $63 million benefit related to certain tax adjustments from the IRS resolution on certain
items related to the FY 2009 through FY 2011 audit.
Regarding the Edwards litigation settlement, we recognized a $589 million non-cash pre-tax charge, which is net of the
amount previously accrued. This payment will be made using OUS cash. Our ongoing royalty rate will vary between
geographies and periods of time depending on the applicable patents, with higher royalty rates in earlier years declining
over time, and the minimum annual royalty payment is $40 million.

In our Cardiac and Vascular group, revenue of $2.369 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in Structural
Heart, endovascular, and AF and other, which included growth from Hospital Solutions and Cardiocom, partially offset
by declines in coronary and defibrillation systems. CRDM revenue of $1.346 billion grew 2%, and included $18
million of combined revenue from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom and Q3 acquisition of TYRX.
Worldwide High Power revenue of $734 million declined 2%. As we noted last quarter, we believe a better way to
view the ICD and pacing markets is on a rolling two-quarter basis given the variability in quarter-to-quarter dynamics.
We estimate the global ICD market as flat to slightly down, a slight slowing from last quarter, with low single-digit
declines in the U.S. offsetting low single-digit growth in international markets. We estimate we gained about a point of
share internationally, offset by almost two points of U.S. share loss.
In Europe and Japan, we continued to see strong adoption of our Viva XT CRT-D with its AdaptivCRT algorithm and
Attain Performa quadripolar lead. In fact, in the two quarters since launching Attain Performa in Japan, we have gained
12 points of CRT-D market share. Attain Performa improves on a competitor's first-generation quadripolar technology,
and we expect to launch this product in the United States in FY 2015.
Late in Q4, we received CE Mark for our Evera MRI SureScan ICD, the first and only ICD system approved for
full-body MRI scans, and also began enrollment in the U.S. pivotal trial for this meaningful new technology.
Low Power revenue of $503 million was flat. On a rolling two quarter basis, we estimate the global market is flat, a
slight improvement from last quarter, with the U.S. market declining in the low single digits, while the international
market grew in the low single digits. In Japan, Advisa MRI continues to perform well despite new competitive MRI
product launches, as our share remains 500 basis points above our pre-launch level. Another positive driver of results
this quarter was the strong global launch of Reveal LINQ, which nearly doubled our diagnostics revenue.
In Q4, we continued enrolling patients in our global clinical trial for Micra, including enrolling the first patients in the
U.S. and Japan. Data from this trial is expected to lead to CE Mark by the end of FY 2015 and will also be submitted
for FDA approval. Micra, the world's smallest leadless pacemaker, is a true innovation in pacing and features a novel
delivery and fixation mechanism specifically designed for this new approach to prevent perforation and dislodgement
while still permitting repositioning and capsule retrieval.
AF Solutions grew over 20% as we continued to gain share in the AF market. Results were driven by robust global
growth of our Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation system, which grew over 30%. Our phased RF product line also
returned to double-digit growth with the Q4 launch of PVAC Gold in international markets, and we are enrolling our
U.S. pivotal study.
Coronary revenue of $446 million declined 2%, driven by growth in DES, offset by declines in bare-metal stents and
renal denervation. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $288 million, including $99 million in the U.S. and $33
million in Japan. Our DES business grew 2%, outperforming the market as the Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent
continues to gain broad market acceptance. In the U.S., our DES share improved sequentially despite a competitor's
ongoing product launch. We also saw strong DES growth in Japan as our long-length stents drove share gains.
In Structural Heart, revenue of $337 million increased 9%, driven by growth from our CoreValve launch in the United
States and continued growth of our transcatheter valve franchise in international markets. We estimate that the global
TAVR market is growing in the high teens. In the U.S., we have had a strong initial launch with center activations
tracking to our forecast. Now with the Edwards legal matters behind us, we expect revenue to continue to ramp as we
are able to open new centers and train new physicians.
High Risk data from our CoreValve U.S. pivotal trial were presented at ACC and simultaneously published in the New
England Journal in March, showing CoreValve as the first and only TAVR system superior to open-heart surgery at
one year. The FDA waived the need for a panel review, and we now expect U.S. approval for high-risk patients this
summer.
In international markets, we are targeting the launch of the 26-millimeter and 29-millimeter versions of Evolut R, our
next-generation recapturable TAVI system, with a 14-French equivalent delivery system next spring. We also just

received IDE approval for our Evolut R U.S. pivotal study, which we expect to start enrolling this summer.
In endovascular, revenue of $240 million grew 3%. Our aortic business had mid-single-digit global growth, with solid
procedure growth within AAA and thoracic. We also had sequential global share gains in both AAA and thoracic,
driven by the continued adoption of our market-leading Endurant II and Valiant Captivia stent grafts.
Our Peripheral business declined in the low single digits as a result of the below-the-knee DCB voluntary product recall
in Q3. After adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus reentry catheter product line as well as the impact from
removing our below-the-knee DCB product from the market, our Peripheral business grew in the mid teens.
At Charing Cross, positive results from our IN.PACT Admiral SFA drug-coated balloon U.S. pivotal study showed a
clinically driven TLR rate of 2.4% at 12 months, and 360-day primary patency of 89.8% for the treatment arm.
IN.PACT DCBs for the SFA had strong double-digit international growth in Q4, and we continue to target U.S.
approval in Q1 FY 2016.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenues of $1.737 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth
in surgical technologies and neuromodulation, offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $786 million declined 2%.
Core spine revenue of $662 million was flat. Excluding BKP, our core spine business grew 1%. Both the global and
U.S. core spine markets appear relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, a slight deceleration from the growth the
markets saw last quarter. This was principally driven by the U.S., where we believe some elective surgeries were pulled
forward ahead of the changes from the Affordable Care Act at the beginning of the calendar year.
Our spine business continues to differentiate itself from the competition through our leading technology and procedural
innovation, enhanced by our Surgical Synergy program, which integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal
implants, and our expertise. Hospitals are leveraging Surgical Synergy by adopting flexible integrated procedural
solutions for spine surgery. They seek clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. This
is resulting in solid growth of capital equipment sales in our Surgical Technologies business as well as increased spinal
implant growth. In fact, in accounts that have adopted our Surgical Synergy program, core spine revenue growth is
meaningfully higher. Outside of the United States, our Kanghui acquisition continues to deliver solid revenue growth in
the value segment of orthopedics, both in China and in other emerging markets.
Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $438 million grew 9%, with strong growth balanced across all three
businesses. This was a solid performance off a very tough prior-year comparison. ENT grew in the high single digits,
driven by upgrades of NIM ENT nerve monitoring and strength in the core ENT power systems.
In neurosurgery, upper single-digit growth was driven by robust navigation sales of StealthStation S7, Midas Rex
power equipment, and Strata Valves. In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue
sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast, and CRDM replacement markets drove
solid double-digit growth.
In neuromodulation, revenue of $513 million increased 4%, driven by solid growth in DBS and pain stim. In DBS, our
referral development program in the United States and the strength of the early stim data in international markets,
which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's disease,
continues to drive strong new implant growth. In pain stim, the ongoing launch of our SureScan MRI spinal cord
stimulation system continues to garner positive feedback and drive sequential share gain.
Our gastro-uro business declined in the low single digits in Q4. As Omar mentioned earlier, we believe a number of the
procedures were delayed due to changes in patients' healthcare plans, but test and implant trends improved as we
moved through the quarter.
In our diabetes group, revenue of $460 million grew 13%, driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G
system, which includes the Enlite CGM sensor, a smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate sensor. This is the first
and only system on the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined
threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple
peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value our threshold suspend feature, including publications in the New

England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Since launching the MiniMed 530G system, we estimate we have gained over
500 basis points of U.S. pump share and over 600 basis points of U.S. CGM share. It is worth noting that we
recognized in Q4 the final $4 million of deferred revenue from our Technology Guarantee program.
Turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q4 gross margin was 74.4%. After adjusting for the $10 million
non-GAAP adjustment from the restructuring charge as well as a 20 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange,
the Q4 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational basis was 74.8%. Q4 was the first quarter to reflect the impact of the
biennial R-zone pricing adjustments in Japan, which as expected negatively affected our gross margin. The gross
margin also continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in
neuromodulation and diabetes, which negatively affected the gross margin by 20 to 30 basis points all year. Looking
ahead, we would expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of 74.5% to 75% on an operational
basis due to the ongoing quality spend.
Fourth quarter R&D spending of $385 million was 8.4% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies and
evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in FY 2015 to be around 8.5%, as we
continue to see the impact from shifting R&D resources to resolve certain quality issues, which get recognized in the
cost of goods sold.
Fourth quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.539 billion represented 33.7% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis point
negative impact from foreign exchange, Q4 SG&A was 33.6%. As Omar mentioned, this was higher than expected due
to several one-time items, including the higher levels of legal spending in structural heart and spine, higher than
expected incentive payments due to certain new product launches, and accelerated investments we made in the quarter
to support future sales efforts of CoreValve, Reveal LINQ, and drug-coated balloons in the U.S. Due to the one-time
nature of this incremental spending in Q4 and FY 2015, we are planning to deliver not only the 30 to 50 basis points of
normal expected leverage, but also the 20 basis points of missing leverage from FY 2014. Taken together, this would
result in FY 2015 SG&A in the range of 33.7% to 33.9% and operating leverage of 50 to 70 basis points, both on an
operational basis.
Amortization expense for the quarter was $87 million. In FY 2015, we expect amortization expense to remain in the
range of $85 million to $90 million per quarter.
Net other expense for the quarter was $59 million, including net gains from our hedging programs of $6 million. We
hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from
foreign exchange. However, it is worth noting that there is a growing portion of our profits that is unhedged, especially
emerging market currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Based on current exchange rates,
we expect FY 2015 net other expense to be in the range of $390 million to $430 million, which includes an expected
$125 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax, an incremental $13 million over FY 2014, as well as increased
royalty expense of $40 million to $50 million from the Edwards agreement. For Q1 FY 2015, we expect net other
expense to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million based on current exchange rates.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $10 million. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $14.2 billion in cash and
investments and $11.9 billion in debt after issuing $2 billion of senior notes in February. Based on current rates, we
would expect FY 2015 net interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q4 was 14.3%, translating into a full-year non-GAAP nominal tax rate of 18%.
This was lower than the 19% to 20% we expected, due primarily to a favorable profit mix by jurisdiction, the impact of
actual foreign exchange rate fluctuations compared to forecast, and lower than projected effective tax rates of foreign
subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. For FY 2015, we expect our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate to be back in the
range of 18% to 20%, and we expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax
credit is reinstated.
In Q4, we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow,
excluding the one-time items, to shareholders. In Q4 we paid $276 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million
for our common stock. As of the end of Q4, we have remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 59 million

shares. Fourth quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.012 billion shares. It is important to note
that cash we received from stock option redemptions, which was $251 million in Q4, will also continue to be used to
repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to
our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY 2015, we would expect diluted weighted
average shares outstanding to be approximately 995 million shares, including approximately 1.003 billion shares in Q1.
Let me conclude by commenting on our initial fiscal year 2015 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. As
Omar mentioned, we believe that constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic
for fiscal year 2015. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact
if the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY 2015 revenue
would be positively affected by approximately $50 million to $90 million, including a positive $20 million to $40
million impact in Q1.
Turning to the guidance on the bottom line, we believe it is reasonable to model earnings per share in the range of
$4.00 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates, this implies earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to 9% on a
constant currency basis after taking into account the currently expected $0.05 to $0.07 negative foreign currency impact
to earnings. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur
during the fiscal year.
I will now turn it back over to Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that we continue to strive to
reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth,
consistent EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue on our operational basis, and returning 50% of our
free cash flow to shareholders. We believe that our three growth vectors, new therapies, emerging markets, and our new
independent services and solutions, will provide the fuel for mid-single-digit revenue growth. We expect our continued
effort to deliver consistent and reliable performance combined with disciplined capital allocation will enable us to
create long-term dependable value in healthcare.
Medtronic is uniquely positioned to lead the shift to value-based healthcare, directing our products and solutions to help
providers, payers, and governments achieve their goals in driving more value into healthcare systems around the world.
I'm pleased with the early work we have done to establish our leadership position, and I look forward to sharing with
you at our analyst meeting the opportunities we have ahead as we transform Medtronic from being primarily a device
provider today into the premier global medical technologies solutions partner of tomorrow.
With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our
Cardiac and Vascular Group and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us again. We
are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If

<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Good morning. Omar and Gary, just first for you, on the SG&A, if you look at the reasons
why it was higher, legal spending, that's hard to control. But incentive payments, accelerated investments, that does
seem to be stuff you can control. Can you tell us what happened and how do you fix that in fiscal 2015 to get the
leverage you've been talking about?

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think, Matt, let me take that first and then maybe Gary can add on. Look, we've got a
company, first I view that, like you point out, is controllable and something that shouldn't happen, that kind of miss
from the expected number and something that can be modeled. But we've got a company with several layers of
management. And although the targets are clear, there was a breakdown in our forecasting process and therefore our
control process. We're acting swiftly to plug that hole and we'll do everything we can to avoid this in the future. But it
really is a mismatch between our forecasting process and what we actually got. There was a breakdown there. That's all
I can say.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Matt, this is Gary. To add to what Omar said, you're absolutely right. It is controllable. We've
looked back to make sure that – first of all, we want to look back to try to understand what did happen and what caused
it, and it's unfortunately small amounts but all over the company that created some of it. Obviously, legal is a little bit
more isolated, but we just had a breakdown in basically forecasting and accruing on the incentives as we went through
the year, and that caught us by surprise at the end of the quarter. That is controllable. It's something that we should be
managing on a much tighter basis. We've communicated that clearly and effectively to the rest of the organization. And
that's why we're confident going forward it is one time that we'll get that leverage back, but we clearly lost it here in Q4
that we had not counted on, and that's unfortunate. That's something we need to manage better, and we put the steps in
place to make sure that happens as we go forward.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Okay, and then just a quick one for Chris O'Connell if possible. On OUS spine, I'm not sure
if you said that the market U.S. and OUS was flat. I was wondering. Is the OUS market in spine flat, Chris, or is it still
growing? And then what's the ASP rate in the U.S.? Is it stable or down low single digits?
<A - Christopher J. O'Connell>: Sure. The international markets are growing a little bit faster. Overall worldwide,
the market was flattish in the quarter. And you may recall in Q4 of last calendar year, the market seemed to accelerate a
bit. I think we look across the last few quarters and see an overall spine market that's up in the 1% to 2% range in that
period of time, with the U.S. being flattish and international being up in the low to mid-single digits. And certainly that
represents somewhat of an improvement pattern over the last four to six quarters. We're seeing market conditions very
stable with some gradual improvement, principally coming out of the United States.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: And the U.S. pricing range?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: U.S. pricing has been pretty stable down in the low to mid-single digits, which has been offset
by mix. We continue to see favorable mix increase in spine, and so relatively flat procedures and price and mix
offsetting each other.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Thanks, Chris. Thanks, Omar, and thanks, Gary.

Your next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matt J. McDonough>: Good morning. This is Matt McDonough in for David. Thanks for taking the question.
My first question is on emerging markets. I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for fiscal year
2015. Given the improvement in the fourth quarter despite those headwinds in Russia and Eastern Europe, I'm
wondering if you see growth getting back to the high teens, 20% level in 2015 if some of those headwinds normalize?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: If the headwinds normalize, sure, that's certainly possible. We're trying to baseline this around
the mid-teens, so around 15% or so. And if those headwinds normalize like you say, it will go up from there. And in
addition, we're putting together some of these initiatives which we haven't fully baked into our projection, especially in
terms of channel optimization where there's margin as well as revenue potential and some major provider partnerships
that we're also working on in certain markets around the world. So we're doing everything we can to drive something
above 15%. But given our history and given what we're learning, I think it's prudent to expect something in the

mid-teens.
<Q - Matt J. McDonough>: Got it, thank you. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, I noticed that free cash flow
growth seemed to outpace EPS growth pretty noticeably in the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about some
of those dynamics causing the delta in the growth rates. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Gary, do you want to take that?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: This is Gary Ellis. Just quickly, what historically you see is our fourth quarter, the free cash
flow is much stronger than the earnings growth and vice-versa, our Q1 tends to be the other way around. Q1 tends be to
a little bit lower because that's when the incentive plan payments and a lot of the commissions and stuff like that are
being paid out. Those accumulate as we go through the year. So by the time you get to the fourth quarter, we tend to
see an improvement on receivables. We tend to see improvements on inventory levels as people are focused on that, not
that they're not focused during the year, but there's major efforts across the organization, and you're starting to see all
that benefit come forward into the fourth quarter. So it's not unusual for our fourth quarter free cash flow to be higher
as the company wraps up the fiscal year, and then Q1 tends to be the softer of all the quarters. So that's historically the
way we see it.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I will add, though, that I think our free cash flow performance for the year was good. I think
we've had certain initiatives we've put in place, like I've mentioned over the past several years that working capital is a
big initiative for the company. And I do think, as I mentioned in the commentary, that the teams are beginning to
execute along those lines.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thanks for taking the questions. The first one is just I wanted to understand the puts and
takes of the U.S. CRDM business this quarter. It certainly looks like the pacemaker business was strong. Maybe it
benefited from some restocking, whereas the U.S. ICD business looks to be the reverse. Can you just comment a bit
more on that?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll let Mike Coyle comment on it. Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure, Mike. There wasn't much change in terms of the relative contribution of bulking versus
run rate. In fact, there really wasn't any difference between those at all to speak of. What it comes down to is the
product flow that we're seeing. So on the low power side, we're in a very virtuous product cycle right now with the
full-scan MRI labeling approval that we've received that's unique in the marketplace, as well as the fact that we've
shown some very interesting data around the use of Reactive ATP to treat atrial fibrillation with our Advisa MRI
product line showing meaningful reductions in progression to permanent AF as well as reductions in heart failure
hospitalization, which is catching the attention of physicians.
But probably most importantly was the release of the Reveal LINQ. That product has really taken off quite nicely. It
offers not only the benefits relative to the old Reveal of being a much smaller device that could be put in essentially
subcutaneously very easily, but it also allows the device to communicate to a bedside monitor on a 24-hour basis
without the patient having to interact with the device at all. And as a result, that coupled with data from the CRYSTAL
AF study on cryptogenic stroke has really provided a very nice catalyst, and we account for those product revenues in

the low power product segment.
On the high power side, obviously, we have a different story in terms of the product cycle. We have obviously some
pressure resulting from the presence of the quadripolar lead, and now have two competitors talking about quadripolar
leads, whereas we're really trying to position against that with the AdaptivCRT algorithm that's unique to our device
that basically allows an elimination of forced RV in patients with intact AV conduction, which showed a meaningful
reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure and progression in AF, which is something that we're just beginning to get
the message to at the HRS [Heart Rhythm Society] meeting.
But we'll also obviously be supplementing our overall product offering with the TYRX approval that we have received
as well as we have submitted our own quadripolar lead last month to FDA. The data looks excellent and we would
expect by the end of our fiscal year, here in the second half of fiscal year, to have that approved in the U.S. And
obviously, when you look outside of the U.S., in places like Japan and Europe, we're actually getting very nice share
traction in the high power segment where we have all of these products available to us. And really the U.S. is the only
place left where we don't have quadripolar lead. That's pretty much the status of our implantables business.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay, and then just two quick follow-ups. Gary, can you please talk a little bit about the
driver of the tax rate moving down as much as it is, not only in the quarter, but obviously on an all-in basis. And then
second, how does the settlement with Edwards impact your investment in the transcatheter valve space? It basically
these sounds like you have minimum payments of $40 million to $60 million a year going forward, so you've got to
cover those payments, and you might as well go ahead and invest in the business and try and maximize your share as
much as possible. Am I missing anything? I just wanted to see how you're thinking about that business for you now that
you have this settlement in place. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Gary.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: With respect to the settlement with Edwards, you're correct. The good news about settling this
long-going patent litigation between ourselves and Edwards is now both of us can focus on growing the market and
investing in growing the market versus investing in fighting each other. And so yes, there is a royalty stream that we've
agreed to. There's an upfront payment we've agreed to. But this basically now sets the table. We know what the costs
are related to that, and we can now continue to invest in driving the market going forward, which will benefit not only
both of us, but benefit obviously the patients and the customers. So we actually do think this is a positive for us. The
royalty rates that we've agreed to we feel are very good that we can work within that as far as from an investment
perspective going forward and continue to invest in the technology overall. And the first question, I forgot again, was
on what?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: The tax.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: The tax, excuse me. On the tax decline, what we were expecting, actually back in Q3 we
actually had to increase the tax rate because we had some expectation that there was growing pressure on the tax rate
based on what we were seeing in some of the U.S. versus OUS split really in our profit picture. The reality is we looked
at that at the end of the year. The split where it was occurring was in Japan, the U.S., and some of the other OUS
markets. It ended up being that the actual tax rate itself was lower. And a lot of it gets back to – I won't get into all of
the details, but it gets back to, for example, FX, especially in Japan. Even though Japan has been doing very well on a
constant currency basis, Japan, which is a high tax jurisdiction, as you know, obviously on an as-reported basis, with
the currency being hit obviously has much lower overall as-reported taxed profits. And as a result of that, there is a
benefit in the tax line. That's just one example.
So we were pleasantly surprised by that. We were not expecting that we would see much of a tax benefit. And in fact,
in Q3 we thought there was some pressure, but there ended up actually being a decline. So 18% for the full year is
consistent with what we saw last year for the full year also. As we go forward, we widen the range as a result of that.
It's clearer to 18% to 20% as we go forward because obviously the R&D tax credit has not renewed yet. But if that gets
renewed, again, we're seeing that maybe we are experiencing a little bit lower tax rate at this point in time.

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Maybe Mike – I thought maybe Mike Coyle, who is in charge of investments for the
transcatheter valve, just had few words about our focus and what's interesting on that technology.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure, a couple of comments. First, we've been spending substantially on litigation expenses
which will now go away, which represents a good portion of what those minimum royalties are going to be. Secondly,
if you think about just the blended rates, and you'll run the numbers yourself, it certainly is a royalty that is consistent
with and probably in the end, less than what we pay on Resolute Integrity, for example, going forward. So we have
substantial capacity in a market that was $1.1 billion in our last fiscal year, growing at 20%-plus, to be able to handle
the royalty component here. But we are aggressively investing in the pipeline.
Obviously, we were very pleased with the data coming out of the High Risk cohort. We have the Evolut R product line
that is in clinical studies for CE Mark right now. We've received conditional approval to begin here in the summer the
U.S. clinical trial on Evolut R with its improvements to design and capture ability. And we believe that those product
lines are going to give us an opportunity to continue to drive share. And obviously, we have a very active program in
the Micra space that we continue to focus on in addition to just continued improvements in the delivery systems
associated with our core product line. So we view this as one of the most attractive markets in the cardiovascular space
going forward and we intend to drive leadership, and this settlement will only put us in a position to do that more
effectively.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could maybe just provide
any additional details. Mike, I know you were talking about the patent settlement. But are there any, I guess, conditions
in terms of the number of centers that you can expand upon, or do you really now have freedom to operate as you
would like, I guess? Obviously, the conditions of the CMS are very different. But in terms of the number of centers, is
there anything with the patent settlement that limits that?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Nothing in the agreement would limit us from being able to expand centers, expand training,
so this is a freedom to operate agreement. And obviously we're paying a lot for that, but we're also getting complete
freedom to drive adoption of the CoreValve technology in the U.S. and globally.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, and then just regarding the drug-coated balloon panel, Bard is going to have theirs
on June 12. Any updates on timing of when you guys would expect that panel, or if you have submitted all the final
modules with the PMA?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Where we sit on that drug-coated balloon is the fourth and final module, which is the clinical
model we expect to submit to the FDA in the first half of June. We take the addition of Bard's drug-coated balloon
product to the panel here on June 12 or June 10 or whatever it is to be a positive for us from the standpoint that there
has not been a panel review on drug-coated balloon technology, and so having that take place sooner rather than later is
a good thing. We have in the past been able to, when we have strong data, use the fact that those data conform to the
questions raised during the panel to avoid panels going forward. That of course will be up to the FDA, but we think
having a panel for drug-coated balloon technology for SFA sooner rather than later is a good thing for the timing of our
release in the U.S.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, and then just a big picture question for Omar. How are you thinking just about
M&A these days? We've certainly been seeing a little bit more increased activity across the space. Do you feel like you
have the right products and exposure to different end markets to really truly get to that mid-single-digit constant
currency growth rate you strive for over the longer term, or should we expect to see a little bit more increase in M&A
activity? Thanks.

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think, Kristen, the philosophy around that has not changed. We've got certain big core market
segments in cardiovascular and restorative therapies, which include neuromusculoskeletal. That's the way we refer to it
in Surgical Technologies as well as diabetes and a broader look at diabetes. Those are the three core areas. We intend to
fill those areas out opportunistically over time, either organically or inorganically. And at the same time, we intend to
invest in building out our Services and Solutions area as well as value products in emerging markets. So those are the
areas of priorities for M&A. We'll do M&A transactions. I think our overall goal, there are always certain exceptions
under certain circumstances, but our overall goal of trying to provide a non-dilutive impact of the inorganic growth is
still there. And we hold ourselves accountable to execute and deliver on what we said, both on EPS and the top line,
and we will do M&A accordingly.

Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Gary, could we come back to margins just for a quick second here? And just if
you think about the last two years, I think we're seeing a consistent trend where GMs are slightly declining but R&D is
also coming down as you reprioritize. And I wonder, if we think about 2015, maybe talk about that trend, but also the
quality issues you talked about several quarters now on GM, we thought those issues were beginning to alleviate here
heading into 2015. So can you quantify what those issues were, the magnitude in 2014? What magnitude drifts into
2015? And as you think about that 8.5% R&D you're saying for 2015, is that the new normal for Medtronic, or can that
number still come down as you reprioritize?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: As we've indicated in the commentary and as you said, David, obviously especially this last
year, one of the things we've indicated is that there's 20 to 30 basis points of hit that we've taken on the OPC line or
what we call other product cost line in the cost of sales that relates to basically quality measures that were taken into
place, especially in neuro and diabetes here in the organization. That is required actually that those costs actually are
engineers, et cetera, who typically are doing R&D types of projects who had to be retasked to basically address past
quality documentation types of issues or remediation in our product portfolio, whether in neuro and diabetes. Since
they're not doing R&D work and they're focusing on quality, it gets reclassed out of R&D up into OPC. And so that's
why 8.5% or 8.4% to 8.5% for the year has been a little bit lower and we're forecasting that that will continue, as Omar
said in his comments, right now based on what we know.
We had hoped that the neuro and diabetes quality issues would be behind us. I think diabetes is getting close, but neuro
we're assuming that basically these ongoing expenses probably continue at least through FY 2015. Towards the end of
FY 2015 they maybe start to taper off, but we'll have those for another full year as we go through that Warning Letter,
addressing the issues in the Warning Letter for neuro.
So in our guidance of 74.5% to 75% going forward, we're basically saying we're not going to see that gross margin
jump back up yet here in FY 2015 because we're still expecting the quality cost to be included in OPC, and we are still
expecting our R&D to be down at that 8.5% level as we alter that. Once we get through FY 2015 and get these Warning
Letters addressed and the quality matters all documented and completely addressed, then we would expect to go back
to a little bit more normal rates. But it's just taking us a little bit longer, especially on the neuro Warning Letter than
what we had originally expected to get those costs back in line.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I also want to make a comment on R&D. Look, at the end of the day, we're responsible for a
certain operating leverage overall, which depends on how much revenue we generate, and we hold ourselves
accountable for that. At the same time, we also hold ourselves accountable to sell our pipeline of technologies
organically as well as inorganically but fund it so that we can be assured that we can continue to be market leaders in
the long term. And so we keep all of these things in mind as we make tradeoffs. And I think you would agree that over
the past four years, past couple of years, yes, R&D spending has been down but our productivity in terms of the growth
that you've seen has certainly been there compared to where it was before. So R&D, we don't just look at a number and

say that's what we'll do. We look at quality of the programs we want to invest in, the return rates, our short and
long-term pipeline. And based on that, we make intelligent decisions.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, very helpful; and then, Mike, just a quick follow up on your commentary on the U.S.
defib market. I thought I heard you mention that it's really all about product cadence for both your pacer business,
obviously, and for defib, and that makes sense to us. You also mentioned that there are two players in the U.S. now
with quad access in CRTD. I think I heard you correctly. Does that imply that you do believe that second entrant into
the market for CRTD in U.S. who only has a can, are you expecting that to be a significant impact on the business here
in the U.S. over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: My point was you just have two different companies now talking about quadripolar
technology as being something that they should be interested in using with their patients. And obviously, we are
positioning our AdaptivCRT and its proven benefits in terms of heart failure, hospitalization reduction, and progression
to AF reduction as proven alternatives to that. Right now, unfortunately, physicians have to choose between those two
things. But as soon as we get our approval in the U.S. for the quadripolar lead, then we will have both of those things
and nobody else will, so that was my only point.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure, yes we can.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Great. So just to follow up on that for my first question, Mike or Omar, I would love you to
comment on what you're seeing in terms of U.S. ICD market trends. Obviously, things have looked a little bit weaker
here than we would have thought. Is that a pricing issue? Is that a units issue? If it's units, what do you think is going on
there? Just a comment on the U.S. ICD market would be great.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So basically since the first of the calendar year, we did see some slowing in terms of overall
procedure volumes. And that applies to both pacing and ICDs, but it's modest in terms of the slowing. In ICDs, it is
mostly replacement cycle, while here in pacing it looks more like initials. But those have dropped a point or two in
terms of overall growth. Pricing is pretty stable in low single-digit declines for both. And of course on the pacing side –
or the low power side, we now have the addition of the new growth vector in predictive diagnostics, which would be a
way to offset that. So that pretty much is the dynamic that we're seeing.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on the comments on M&A. Omar, this is a question for
you. I just wanted a comment on your confidence in Medtronic's M&A process. In light of what's going on with Ardian
and how CoreValve, given the prices you paid and now this settlement, it makes the initial price paid almost twice what
you originally thought. I'm just curious, does that impact your willingness to pursue technology and growth
acquisitions? Are you confident in Medtronic's process? And again, how does that impact the way you think about
potential deal activity in 2015 and beyond?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, I'm very confident in Medtronic's process. And over the past three years, the
acquisitions that we've done have delivered and we've executed on them. In terms of both Ardian and CoreValve, first
of all Ardian, like I said at the ACC, look, this comes with the territory. You do clinical trials for a reason. Every so
often you're going to get negative results, and we don't give up on strategic opportunities based on that. We continue to
strive on them because we believe in the long-term need for that kind therapy. We would have done that acquisition

over again based on the data that we had at that time, and I think our team is highly qualified for that. And I actually
compliment our team, our Ardian team, for executing through the clinical trial probably better than anyone else. So I've
got complete confidence in our ability to follow up on what we say we would do. We've just got to accept in our
modeling that some of these acquisitions may not turn out the way we wanted to because of the inherent risk involved,
and if you can, model that in our overall mapping of opportunities.
In terms of CoreValve, yes, sure, it was a surprise, but I think actually the overall rate of return even including the
payments that we have to make is still in the double digits, in the teens actually. So I think CoreValve overall again, I
would do over and over again. We are extremely excited about truly groundbreaking clinical results that we're getting
with this and in terms of our mission, what it does to extend life of people, what it means to us, I think that's one that
we would do over again and we'll find a way to fund.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Actually, I wanted to start with Mike on
Reveal LINQ, and then I had one follow up on tax. Mike, how big can Reveal LINQ be? How quickly do you think it'll
ramp? Are there any reimbursement issues we should be aware of? It seems based on the feedback at HRS it was one of
the products that physicians were most excited about, and it seems to be an important growth driver for you guys in
fiscal 2015.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Larry, we're going to spend some time on this topic at the analyst meeting because it is
something that we haven't really focused a lot on in commentary. I would just say there are multiple applications for
these kinds of implantable loop recorders not only in syncope, which has been the traditional market here, but we've
also talked about cryptogenic stroke and [indiscernible] (1:08:35) AF management. And the fact that we've now moved
to a technology that is so much more attractive to patients as well as to physicians in terms of its size, its ease of
implant, and its ability to without patient interaction provide a very strong diagnostic analysis is really creating a new
opportunity within this segment. We've always had the Reveal product, but it was more of a pacemaker size implant
and procedure. Now we have something that we think is just much more attractive to patients and physicians for use in
their diagnosis in the areas that I talked about. We very much consider this a growth driver on scale with our AF
investments in terms of its potential for return, and we'll talk a little more about that at the analyst meeting in a couple
weeks.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: All right, and I just wanted to ask one on the tax rate. Gary, can you talk about what
your guidance assumes for the R&D tax credit in calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015? I'm asking because if the
R&D tax credit is reenacted for calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015, if they reenact it for two years, is it
possible that your fiscal 2015 guidance would benefit from two years of the R&D tax credit or roughly $0.08 versus I
think zero in fiscal 2014? So if you could just clarify what your guidance assumes and what the benefit could be, that
would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: The R&D tax credit expired as of December 2013, so we did have eight months of benefit of the
R&D tax credit in FY 2014 and so it's not zero in FY 2014. Going forward, it's hard to say what the government will do
on this. Typically, when they do extend it, they extend it for a year or two, and so you do have a catch-up when that
occurs. Our assumption right now, and that's why we have a little bit of a broader range obviously on the 18% to 20%.
If the R&D credit is not renewed, you would probably be obviously towards the higher end of that range. If it gets
renewed, back to your point, with some in effect catch-up from the prior years, that's when the lower end of the range
would obviously come into effect. And so the range we've given in effect tries to bracket around where do we think the
R&D tax credit will end up being, but it's not quite as extensive as you indicated because there was eight months of
benefit in our FY 2014. But we could end up, back to your point, assuming it's renewed for all that, you could end up
with 16 months of benefit in FY 2015 assuming it's renewed.

<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Larry. We've gone past the top of the hour. We've got time for – we'll just squeeze in two
last questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line Raj Denhoy of Jefferies.
<Q - Rajbir S. Denhoy>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi.
<Q - Rajbir S. Denhoy>: I wonder if I could just spend a minute on the spine business. It still remains a bit of a
headwind in a sense or an anchor on you getting back to that mid-single-digit revenue growth target. When do you
imagine you might be able to see some better performance out of this, when INFUSE could stabilize or some of the
new products might start to contribute? Just some view on the outlook would be helpful.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Chris, you go ahead. Look, INFUSE stabilization is obviously a big driver, so that's one piece,
but sure.
<A - Christopher J. O'Connell>: Thanks for the question. We've obviously been suffering through some declines in
INFUSE and BKP over the past couple years. And let me just quickly address those because we've been working very
hard to try to stabilize and actually as we look forward, we think there's a very nice story developing. Obviously, after
the Yale publication on INFUSE last summer, we saw some softening on INFUSE following that. But now that the
market has digested that information, we've actually seen three quarters in a row of sequential stability, which we
believe points to a pattern of stability heading into next fiscal year, and so it's our goal to see the overall INFUSE
program be somewhat flattish over the next year.
We are also seeing some nice encouraging trends in BKP, principally in the U.S., as we've continued to diversify our
product line and as we look to build a bigger platform of interventional spine off of our core Kyphon business. And
again, our business has been relatively stable now sequentially for three or four quarters in a row, and we expect that to
be somewhat flattish as we head into next year as well. So if we get BMP and BKP to be flat, then you're going to see
the overall spine franchise lift, as our core spine business has actually been reasonably stable over the past four or five
quarters with some modest growth in that business. And as I pointed out earlier, the markets are stable and we believe
gradually improving in core spine. And so our expectation is that the overall spine franchise continues its transition to
positive growth for the overall business.
<Q - Rajbir S. Denhoy>: Just to follow up on that, would it be unwise to think about spine in aggregate being positive
in terms of growth for 2015, or is that a bit premature?
<A - Christopher J. O'Connell>: It's certainly my expectation to see modest positive contribution from spine next
year.
<Q - Rajbir S. Denhoy>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Jeff Warren>: One last question.

Your final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.

<Q - Joanne K. Wuensch>: Thank you so much, two strategic questions, please. One is we're hearing or seeing
actually more companies repatriate OUS cash to reuse it in a better way, although I do applaud you paying for the
Edwards litigation out of OUS cash. Can you give me a view on how you're thinking about that?
And then my second question is we've had a couple of questions on this call about M&A, but we're also continuing to
see companies split, spin out different divisions. Omar, now that you've been there for three years, what is your current
thinking on that? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure, thanks. Let me take the second one first. Like I said before, we are focused around three
strategic clinical areas, cardiovascular, restorative therapies, and diabetes. And in each of those areas, we need to fill
out. To the degree that things don't fit in those core areas or don't have any technology linkages with them and we don't
think we can win in those markets, there are opportunities for spinouts. And although we haven't done any recently, I
can assure you that we constantly look at that. And those will happen over time, but they will fit into our strategic
framework.
So that's the way we look at that and the strategic markets that they're going after as well as the globalization of those
markets and addressing those markets across the continuum of care is the way we look at this. So from an M&A
perspective, I would expect us to add more to that rather than get rid of. But to the degree that things don't fit, sure,
we'll take those actions and we do look at that regularly.
From an overseas cash perspective, I'll let Gary talk about it. We're certainly constrained to a degree there. But, Gary,
do you want to...
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Again, obviously as you indicated, Joanne, all U.S. headquartered multinational companies run
into the situation that we accumulate cash outside of the United States and it's very expensive to bring it back into the
U.S. And so we are all constantly trying to figure out ways to effectively utilize that cash as we go forward, and so
that's always a challenge for a company like Medtronic. As you indicated, the settlement with Edwards is such that we
will be using OUS cash to pay for that. As you recall, we actually used OUS cash to buy CoreValve originally. So it is
viewed as OUS, and we will use OUS cash to pay for the settlement.
The idea of actually just bringing back cash and paying the penalty right now, we are not looking at doing that, and I
think most companies who have done that have done that for basically they needed to for various reasons. Unless you
need to, if you can continue to borrow and have effective use of that, it just financially does not pay. So there's no
incentive at all for us right now to bring back that cash and pay the type of penalty we'd have to pay in additional taxes.
So we have enough flexibility with our cash generation and our debt that we continue to do our capital allocation as
we've discussed up to this point and time. So we have no expectation to make any change to that.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Joanne.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, everyone, for your questions. Before concluding, I'd like to remind you that we will host our investor
conference in two weeks, on June 5 in New York. We look forward to discussing in more detail the progress that we're
making at Medtronic. And I would also note that we anticipate holding our Q1 earnings call on August 19. And with
that and on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in
Medtronic. Thank you.
