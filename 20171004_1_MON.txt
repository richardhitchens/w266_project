Greetings, and welcome to the Monsanto Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Ms.
Meyer, you may begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. I am joined today by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett
Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the
IR team is Ben Kampelman.
During our fourth quarter call today, we'll share how we closed out fiscal year 2017 and will provide an early look into
how we're thinking about 2018. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and replay
at monsanto.com.
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both the GAAP and the ongoing business basis. Where
we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press
release, both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ

Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our year-end results as shown on slide 5. We
delivered strong growth with as reported earnings per share of $5.09 and ongoing earnings per share of $5.50, as
compared to last year's as-reported full year earnings per share of $2.99 and ongoing earnings per share of $4.48. Our
free cash flow for the fiscal year was $2 billion as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year.
Hugh, I'll turn it over to you.
Hugh M. Grant
Thanks very much, Laura. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. At the outset of this fiscal year,
we outlined two clear priorities upon which we judge success at year's end. The first was delivering on our operational
plan and key business milestones, and the second was to continue executing the necessary steps to close the deal with
Bayer. With focus and discipline, our team did both and I am extremely proud of what we delivered.
In what may be our final full year conference call as Monsanto, I couldn't be more pleased with the results. We
delivered record sales and gross profit in our Seeds and Genomonics segment in fiscal year 2017, fueled by the
outstanding penetration of our latest soybean and cotton technologies, and continued adoption of our newest corn
hybrids around the globe, reflecting the need for new solutions in what continues to be a challenging ag economy.
Clearly, our proven ability to innovate as well as our unique platform advantages position us well to meet the
production challenges of today as well as the demands of tomorrow, as shown on slide 6. New products and services
will remain crucial to meeting that demand. And leading the way is our strong foundation of seed, trait, digital ag, and
chemistry solutions like the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System, Climate FieldView offerings and NemaStrike
Technology, all outlined on slide 7.
The outlook for these new offerings is bright. In fiscal year 2018, Climate FieldView platform is expected to reach 50
million paid acres globally. Our blockbuster NemaStrike Technology is launching across 6 million to 8 million acres in
the U.S. and we, along with our partners, expect to have supply to double the penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend
soybeans. Momentum builds with continued INTACTA penetration in South America and growers continue to demand
our newest corn hybrids, particularly our Disease Shield hybrids which were sold out in fiscal year 2017.
Given these strong drivers, we remain confident in the outlook for the business. Looking specifically at the first quarter,
we anticipate our earnings per share to be stronger than last year, with growth expected to come primarily from
soybean technologies and better pricing in Ag Productivity.
Looking beyond Q1, we will refrain from specifics as we anticipate closing on the merger with Bayer at the beginning
of the new year.
With that, let's turn our focus towards the status of the pending combination with Bayer on slide 8. Bayer continues to
lead the regulatory filing process and progress is moving along as expected around the world. All the key filings have
been made and more than one-third of the approvals have been received from the authorities with whom we filed. We
continue to cooperate with regulators as they work through the reviews and we look forward to positive outcomes.
Beyond our work with regulators, we're also continuing outreach with stakeholders to convey the innovation
opportunity that this deal can have on the future of agriculture. While some divestitures will occur in limited areas of
overlap with Bayer, we believe in the potential to further evolve our leadership role in agriculture through this deal. We
expect to meet this challenge by delivering even greater benefits to our customers, as outlined in slide 9. In fact, that
commitment is exemplified by our significant R&D expansion in St. Louis that has just recently came online.

In the interim, we remain focused on delivering our new technologies and we look forward to the possibilities that our
combined pipelines and world-class teams can create for growers in the future.
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update.
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. With record-setting sales and gross profit in Seeds and
Genomics, 2017 was certainly a banner year for us. Our teams delivered strongly on our key business imperatives and
their unrelenting focus sets us up well for this year. We expect continued momentum for our new products and my
confidence has been reinforced by recent interactions with growers around the globe. Despite low commodity prices,
the demand for new tools only grows.
Let's start first with corn where our gross profit grew by 15%. This was driven primarily by better pricing, mostly in
South America on a growing acreage base, and a better than anticipated benefit from a strategic licensing deal in corn
in the fourth quarter. Globally, we also delivered the improvement in cost of goods we were expecting, with U.S.
production volumes increasing. As harvest progresses in the Northern Hemisphere, we look forward to sharing our
yield performance numbers in the months ahead.
Taking a longer view on slide 10, we expect that launching new hybrids globally will continue to create price mix lift
and genetic share gains. For the first quarter specifically, we expect corn acres to decline in the first season in Brazil
and do not expect to repeat the price gains of last year given the decline in the commodity prices there.
Moving to soybeans on slide 11, we delivered an impressive 35% growth in our gross profit, coupled with nice margin
improvement year-over-year. Our ramp year in Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans saw our final U.S. acre count at
greater than 20 million, as shown on slide 12, which showcased the demand for better weed control.
As outlined on slide 13, the vast majority of growers had a positive experience with the system, and we are hearing
from many who have a desire to significantly increase their on-farm use in the coming year. For those who did not, we
remain dedicated to improving their experience with the system, and we are actively developing plans to reinforce and
expand our training and grower education efforts across the country. We'll take full advantage of the months ahead to
broaden and deepen the understanding of the technology's application requirements so that more farmers can
experience the benefits that this system can offer.
For 2018, this will set the stage in a year where we, along with our licensee partners, expect to have supply available to
double penetration to more than 40 million acres and to offer the trait in more than 300 varieties in our brands alone.
Moving to South America on slide 14, INTACTA Roundup Ready 2 PRO soybeans continued to provide great value
through better insect control and yields, and the trait reached more than 50 million acres this year. This lays solid
footing for 2018 as we now expect more than 60 million acres throughout South America, coupled with anticipated
price improvement in Brazil.
In our cotton business shown on slide 15, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton reached more than 6 million acres, and our
branded and licensed cotton genetics here in the U.S. grew by nearly 13 points on a growing acreage base, which is the
second year of that level of exceptional share growth. Next year, given the strong demand for our cotton technologies,
we expect continued brand share gains and similar Bollgard II XtendFlex trait intensity even with planted acres likely
to decline.
Shifting to NemaStrike Technology on slide 16, our teams are excited about launching this novel nematicide on an
expected 6 million to 8 million acres of corn, soybeans and cotton in the U.S. It's been priced at a premium that reflects
its consistent yield protection, and we planted more than 400 groundbreaker trials this summer to allow growers to see
it firsthand.
Moving to the Climate FieldView platform on slide 17, the strategic differentiators for climate, the strength of the
platform adoption and the collaborations and partnerships both saw meaningful advancements this year.

One significant development was the recent signing of a new connectivity agreement with AGCO, as well as the sale of
the Precision Planting business to them, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. This sale
allows us to focus more exclusively on the Climate FieldView platform which continues to make great strides.
We landed on more than 35 million paid acres in fiscal year 2017, with a line of sight to reach 50 million paid acres
globally next year driven by seven advancements and enhancements to the platform.
Beyond the U.S., as shown on slide 18, we continued global expansion with a commercial launch in Brazil and Europe,
and we look forward to launching in Western Canada this fiscal year.
Moving to Ag Productivity, we remain optimistic about the anticipated results of the re-registration of glyphosate in
Europe, which we expect sometime before mid-December. We're encouraged that the EU risk assessment process has
reaffirmed the science supporting the safety and efficacy of glyphosate and by the dialogue we're hearing from farmers
across Europe who continue to reiterate that it is an indispensable tool.
Within the Ag Productivity businesses, we saw the glyphosate price improvements over the prior year in the second
half as we had anticipated, and our gross profit of $892 million for the full year was well within the range we outlined
at the outset of the year. This improved glyphosate pricing trend is continuing with recent increases in our U.S. branded
prices, in-line with our strategy to maintain a premium over generics. And we expect it to lead to better gross profit in
the segment for the first quarter.
In addition, we expect that volumes sold of XtendiMax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology will continue to grow
with the expansion of the system.
All-in-all, I'm pleased to see the record penetration levels of our newest traits and record results our teams delivered in
Seeds and Genomics. As we move through harvest and begin fiscal year 2018, I look forward to continued momentum
and adoption of the new solutions we're bringing to our customers.
With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review.
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thank you, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Financial discipline and exceptional strategic risk and portfolio
management contributed to the strong growth in both our earnings and free cash flow this year.
I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fourth quarter earnings per share which came in better than the prior year and
our expectations at $0.05 per share on an as-reported basis, and $0.20 per share on an ongoing basis. These results
came in stronger than we had anticipated due to additional tax benefits and better-than-expected corn gross profit from
the strategic license that Brett mentioned earlier.
With the continuing consolidation in the industry, we had the opportunity to grant the right to some key corn licenses in
Brazil, resulting in a benefit of more than $200 million in Q4. We expect to continue to receive ongoing royalties from
those licenses.
Beyond these factors, the results were in line with our expectations. The U.S. Seed business closed out much as we
anticipated. Our productivity and gross profit declined modestly, primarily from the absence of the Latitude fungicide
business. And SG&A and R&D spend was higher, primarily due to higher incentive expense and commissions
stemming from the strong growth in the business.
In addition, we had gains from non-core asset sales of about $70 million in other income and expense, roughly split
between the segments as we had guided. This compares to $157 million in gains from sorghum asset sales in Q4 of
fiscal year 2016.
The fourth quarter was simply the capstone for how the entire year came together. We grew gross profit by an
impressive 16% in Seeds and Genomics, posted a record high for both sales and gross profit in the segment while

improving margins with new technology penetration. We remain true to our brand premium strategy in Ag Productivity
and delivered gross profit in the range we expected.
And finally, our SG&A and R&D spend, while growing with the business, remained relatively consistent as a percent
of sales for the full year as we continued to execute on our cost savings and restructuring initiatives.
In terms of free cash flow, we delivered $2 billion for the year, which was above the high end of our guidance range of
$1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. This improvement from the prior year was driven by the excellent growth in the business
and strong collections resulting from our prudent management of risk in a difficult ag environment.
For fiscal year 2018, as shown on slide 19, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of the fiscal year to
improve, with growth primarily coming from stronger INTACTA pricing and penetration in South America, higher Ag
Productivity gross profit from improved glyphosate pricing, and a gain on the sale of the Precision Planting business to
AGCO.
Looking now at the full year, let me share some guideposts to help shape your thinking. Hugh and Brett shared our
outlook for penetration of many of our new technologies, which will greatly influence the results. Specifically, we
expect the penetration of pricing of INTACTA, additional acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend, price and share gains from
the introduction of new corn hybrids, and price premiums from the NemaStrike Technology to be growth contributors.
Pricing for glyphosate is expected to be better, at least for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and volumes of XtendiMax
Herbicide with VaporGrip Technology are expected to expand. You have to balance those factors against the expected
decline in corn acres in Brazil and against the fact that commodity pricing for corn remains challenging around the
globe.
We expect that our tax rate will normalize and that the contributions from strategic portfolio management will likely
fall below the roughly $350 million pre-tax average annual contribution we've seen for the last three years. We remain
committed to completing the restructuring and cost savings initiatives we began in fiscal year 2015, as shown on slide
20, and expect our SG&A and R&D spend to be relatively flat year-over-year.
In closing, our teams have done an exceptional job in delivering on our two imperatives for the year. And we look
forward to continuing with that focus and discipline as we move through our first fiscal quarter and our anticipated
closing with Bayer in early 2018. Thank you for your time today.
And with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions.
Laura J. Meyer
Thanks, Pierre. With that, we'll now open the call for 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you
please hold your questions to one person – one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as
possible.
Michelle, we're ready to take questions from the line.

<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Could you just give us your view on – I know in INTACTA this year, the original
discount that was provided as part of the Roundup 1 agreement goes away. Could you just give us your sort of what
you're seeing already in your level of conviction that you're going to be able to hold what should be a higher price point
year-over-year?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Vincent, thanks for your question. Maybe, Brett, you can say a few words to Vincent's
point on the change this year.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. Good morning, Vincent, and you noted one of the key factors in that. I think it's
important to start that INTACTA has continued to deliver incredible insect control as well as yield gains for growers
and we reached 50 million acres this year and expect to be close to 60 million acres next year.
One of the key things for pricing is through the transition from Roundup Ready 1 to INTACTA, there were some
covenants with the growers in making that transition and those have now expired. So as we look at the value that the
product is delivering in the marketplace and priced into the marketplace this year, we would anticipate somewhere in
the range of double-digit price improvement on INTACTA for next year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Donald David Carson>: Yes. I had a question on Xtend. Obviously, a lot of stories and issues around off-target
damage. I'm just wondering, what impact do you think this has on the growth of the trait? And as you review what
happened this year, how much of the grower experience was due to grower related issues such as spray drift, et cetera,
versus is there a fundamental problem with the new formulations of dicamba themselves such as volatilization?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Don, thanks for your question. Before I pass it to Brett, just a couple of observations. Between
beans and cotton, we will be on 26-ish million acres this year. So in what essentially was our first commercial year of
rollout, there's been extraordinary penetration.
So, to answer your question right up front, we're delighted with the product. We're delighted with the penetration. And I
think that's got a little bit lost in some of the noise that we've got a lot of very happy customers. It's true we have some
that have experienced leaf cupping but the vast majority have had excellent results and as combines have begun to run
through those fields, the feedback has been quite exceptional.
But, Brett, maybe a few words to Don's question on spray application and just the hygiene of the product.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Don. As Hugh mentioned, just a tremendous launch of the product,
and I think it speaks volumes to the challenges that farmers have in controlling weeds in the market. I think the key that
I look at is the vast majority of farmers had a really good experience, as Hugh noted. But there are exceptions to that
and we are following up each and every one of those particular claims to ensure we have a full understanding of how
the product performed in the marketplace.
I'd also note that just last weekend, I participated in the academics summit that we had and it was an exceptional
meeting and surpassed our expectations and shared a lot of information with the academics and vice versa, them
sharing with us. So we're in the process of looking through all of that data to draw our conclusions on the outcomes this
year, as well as working with the EPA in a collaborative way to make sure that we have a plan in place where all
farmers have a great experience next year.
I mean, as you look at some of the things to your specific point in the marketplace that we observed this year, there are
some cases where buffers maybe could've been followed a little better than they were, there's cases where tank
clean-out maybe wasn't done quite as well as it should be, and farmers have been using products that are a little more
forgiving than the dicamba technology, so we've got to work on that.

In some cases, we found nozzles that probably weren't the appropriate nozzle to be using for the application. So there's
a number of things, Don, that we'll double down on the training and working with our academic colleagues to make
sure that we have farmers fully aware and experienced next year going into the season. But I think it's notable to also
note that, as Hugh said, the yields are coming in strong, and we feel really good about our prospects for next year, and
that's why we're, along with our licensees, prepared to double the penetration next year.
<Q - Donald David Carson>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: Yes. I think your Acceleron Seed Treatment now includes the NemaStrike in it and maybe a Bayer
insecticide in it, but wanted to know what your thoughts were longer term about the potential to load in more Bayer
chemistry into those seed treatments and leverage the Montesano seed platform over into crop chemistry.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes. I think there's a real – thanks for your question, Steve. I think there's a real opportunity
there. We said – we got the approval in NemaStrike late in the year. We kind of got it to the fields just in the nick of
time. We will see how yields pan out, but a lot of the early root digs are looking very encouraging, so 6 million to 8
million acres next year I think is definitely doable and I think you're right, the combination with Bayer chemistry, I
think brings another great opportunity.
The way we've always looked at this is we look for the best possible chemistry that's out there and you're optimizing
yield, and when you put up brand-new hybrids every year, our general philosophy has been you put the very best
technology you can on that and remain agnostic to the source. But I think there's real opportunities for some of the
Bayer stuff as well as others from other stables as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning. I have a few questions about INTACTA. How did you fare in
Argentina this year? That is, how many acres did INTACTA go on, and where do the patent issues in Argentina stand
and how will that affect you in 2018? Your projection is for 60 million acres of INTACTA in 2018, but is for 75
million acres in 2019, so you have a 25% rate of growth in 2019, 20% in 2018. Why does the growth rate accelerate in
2019, I guess? So those are my INTACTA questions?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. This is Brett. Thanks for the question. So INTACTA was a
great success in South America again this year and we have been talking about it as South America for a couple of
years now rather than trying to differentiate between the various countries because you also have Paraguay and
Uruguay stuck in the middle there between Argentina and Brazil. And the markets are a bit different in Argentina,
particularly the north looks a lot like Brazil and the middle and southern looks a lot less insect pressure.
So, specific to your question in Argentina, we feel really good about our patent protection in Argentina. We have good
patent coverage of multiple patents in Argentina. We feel really good about the progress that we've made in working
with the coalition in the marketplace, working both with farmers and farmer unions as well as the government on POD
system in Argentina. It worked this year and it's set up to work even better going into next year. So there's always the
challenges with that in the early years, no different than the experience in Brazil, but we feel good about our position.
As we look at the penetration, we see substantial penetration in Brazil. We expect that to continue next year as well as
in the following year and we would anticipate that we will see an acceleration in Argentina as the POD system becomes

more sophisticated and spread out across the country, more varieties available with INTACTA, et cetera.
So when you look at year-over-year from 2018 to 2019, that's the anticipation of more activity in – or in, excuse me, in
Argentina coming online as more varieties are available. And as you know, we slowed down our efforts in Argentina
when we had the early challenges with POD, and because of that slowdown, other seed companies and us were slower
to bring varieties and market fit. So we're starting to accelerate that now as the POD is in a better position, so I feel
good about that 75 million number in 2019.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. Thank you so much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: No, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Hi. Thank you. There is some news hitting the wire today that the Brazilian regulator might be
concerned on INTACTA as part of the Bayer-Mon tie-up. Can you talk about that, and if there's any risk there? Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Joel. Thanks. It's Hugh here. I would – you're right, it just crossed the wire this morning,
but we would characterize this coming from Cade, the regulatory authorities in Brazil, as just a normal step within the
review process. So Bayer continues to lead that process. We're supporting them around the world. And if you look at
Brazil, you look at the rest of the world; we continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making overall. So I
don't think any new news out of the Brazilian [ph] staff (30:14) this morning.

run as a public firm. I wish you all the success at Bayer.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: That's very kind of you, John. Thank you very much.
<Q - John Roberts>: Back on the dicamba drift issue, I remember when insect tolerance was introduced, farmers had
trouble initially dealing with the refuge acreage kind of issue. Is it fair to think about this as kind of a learning curve,
kind of new technology issue like we had back with that? Or do you think it's actually going to be a little bit more
challenging to find a solution for them?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: No, I think it's quite analogous, John, and it kind of goes to your earlier comment. We've been
at this for nearly 20 years, and if you look back at experience with Roundup Ready 2s, for SmartStax, with some of the
early refuge issues with insect-protected crops, I think some of this is the same.
Brett talked about being focused on buffer strips, being focused on clean-out, being focused on good nozzle selection,
and I'm confident with the feedback that we're hearing from growers, the vast majority of whom had good results, this
is solvable with a bit more education and a bit more focus. So I think it's a fair comparison.
<Q - John Roberts>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Jones with Redburn Partners. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Tony Jones>: Oh, thanks very much for taking my call. It was just a quick comment – quick question on corn and
the price cuts. So I think, Brett, this is probably a question for you, actually, but you acknowledge that commodity price
is a little bit low on corn. How responsive have been farmers, growers, distributors to price cuts so far?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. Good morning, Tony – or good afternoon to you. It's early in the season, so that's the
caveat that I would put against this. But the early responses has been, I would put it in the category of as expected.
As I noted and you confirmed, the commodity price situation is challenging around the world. As we've moved into
South America, which is our early market, we're performing as expected down there. I'd say our orders feel reasonable.
The market is going to be a lot smaller. That's clear. Third parties saying that acres are going to be down 20% to 30%,
but we're doing fine in that market.
In North America, harvest is coming in, products are performing, and as we see every year, regardless of the challenge
in the marketplace, farmers are really in tune with the newest hybrids, the best products. For example, we sold out our
Disease Shield products this year. Those were our latest release and our best products. We believe that we'll see that
same kind of demand for our new releases and new hybrids this year, and we'll have to see how the market plays out.
But right now, most of our new releases are up in price, as you would expect. And with the products that are a bit older
in the marketplace, they're flattish. I see the competitive market being reasonable at this point in time, but we'll just
have to keep following it through the next month or two to see how that plays out.
<Q - Tony Jones>: Great. I appreciate the detail. Maybe just one small follow up there. Do you think then that the sort
of the trading down that we'd saw – that we'd seen in the past few years that's finished pretty much?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. I think in the early days – and I always referred to it as the farmers on the fringe that
were on the edge of did they really have rootworm or were they just using SmartStax as kind of protection for the what
if. That's all occurred. And if you look at it this year, there was very little of that even this year in 2017.
So I think we're out of that. I think it's pretty much farmers know what they have in their fields and what they need and
I think that – I see the market being more normalized next year as we go into that.
<Q - Tony Jones>: Perfect. Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah. Thanks for your question.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Arun Viswanathan>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on soy as well. You talked about
lower corn planted acres in Brazil. Do you have any view on soy down there as well as in North America? Thanks.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. I think at this point in time, it's a guessing game on acres. And I would put it in the
category of we're pretty confident corn acres are going to be down in the first season in Brazil and third parties are
confirming that. Don't see the same kind of reduction in Argentina. I would anticipate that those acres are replaced with
soybeans, but they have options in Brazil to other crops as well, and we'll just have to wait and see how it plays out.
I remind you then Brazil they get two cracks at corn, so they have the summer season that they're going into and then
they have the winter safrinha season, so they are less sensitive to a singular planting. They can make up for corn in
safrinha if they need to. And we don't anticipate the same kind of decline in safrinha that we are seeing in the summer
season. So I would anticipate at this point that in most cases beans replaced the corn acres that are down down there.

In North America, I'd say it's way too early. Farmers aren't going to make those calls. They are worried about
harvesting right now and getting the crop out of the field. Then they'll start thinking about next year.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Arun, the only thing I'd remind you of that Brett touched on is the Brazilian corn markets, the
domestic market, so the productions usually – largely kept within the country. Beans are globally traded, so beans will
probably follow much more closely what happens in the U.S.
<Q - Arun Viswanathan>: Thanks.
<A - Laura J. Meyer>: And, Michelle, this will need to be our last question.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Good morning. It's Dan Rizzo on. How are you doing?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Does Bayer have a nematicide product that competes with NemaStrike? Is there overlap there at
all?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I don't know. I don't think so. I'm looking around the table. We don't think that they have a
nematicide. The extraordinary thing about NemaStrike is its brand-new chemistry that was built on the back bone of the
genomics of the nematode, so we reverse engineered from biology and it really puts it in a very unique class of its own.
So I'm not aware of what Bayer has in that space, but I think the performance of NemaStrike that we have seen in our
own small trials and the feedback we are getting, it's – I think it's going to carve out a completely unique niche in
nematode control.
And the other fascinating thing about it is nematodes as a problem are extraordinarily widespread but growers have not
really had a tool to control them until now. So it really reminds me in a lot of ways of the early days with corn
rootworm where the actual market and the actual products that were there were dwarfed by the introduction of proper
control. I think we'll probably see the same thing happen with NemaStrike in the future.
<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: No, thank you. Thanks for your question.
Hugh M. Grant
I'll bring this session to a close and thank you for your attention and your support. I guess I would close to the way that
I started, I think my team has done an outstanding job of delivering on our operational plan and our deal milestones for
the year, while we continued to serve and support our customers,. And that's quite remarkable given the risk of
distraction, so I'm very proud of what we've done.
Given that, we plan to continue to execute on exactly the same deliverables as we move through the first quarter of
fiscal year 2018 and we are really looking forward to the benefits that we envision that the pending combination with
Bayer will bring to our grower customers around the world.
So with that, thanks very much for joining us on the call this morning.
