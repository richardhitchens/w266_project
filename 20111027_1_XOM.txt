MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is
being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor
Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's third quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon
Mobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2011. I will refer to the slides that are available through
the investor section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our customary
cautionary statement shown on slide 2.
Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. The global economy
and energy markets continue to face a challenging macroeconomic environment. Global economic growth was mixed
in the third quarter. The United States GDP in the third quarter is expected to show some modest improvement from the
second quarter while economic growth in the European Union continued to slow amid persistent sovereign debt
concerns.
In general, non-OECD growth remains robust even with some signs of demand softening in China. Energy markets
overall continued to weaken in the third quarter versus the second quarter, with both crude oil and natural gas prices
declining. Commodity chemical margins also weakened across the quarter.
Turning now to the third quarter financial results as shown on slide 4. Exxon Mobil's third quarter 2011 earnings,
excluding special items, were $10.3 billion, an increase of $3 billion from the third quarter of 2010. Our effective tax
rate for the quarter was 47%. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding special items, were $2.13, up $0.69 from a
year ago.

The corporation distributed more than $7 billion to shareholders in the third quarter, through dividends and share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $5 billion was distributed to purchase shares. Share purchases to
reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011.
CapEx in the third quarter was $8.6 billion, consistent with the third quarter of 2010. Across our diverse portfolio, we
continued to invest in robust projects through the business cycle to help meet global demand for crude oil, natural gas
and finished products while supporting economic growth including job creation.
Our cash generation remains strong, with $16.3 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. At the end of the
third quarter 2011, cash and marketable securities totaled $11.3 billion and debt was $16.8 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash and
marketable securities increased from $10.3 billion to $11.3 billion. The combined impact of strong earnings,
depreciation expense, lower working capital, and the benefit of our ongoing asset management program yielded $16.3
billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to plant, property and equipment or PP&E
of $7.5 billion and shareholder distributions of $7.3 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased our
cash and marketable securities by $0.5 billion dollars.
Moving on to slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's third quarter 2011 earnings of $10.3 billion
increased almost $3 billion or 41% from the third quarter of 2010. Upstream earnings increased $2.9 billion, while
Downstream earnings improved $419 million. Chemical earnings were down $226 million. Higher corporate and
financing expenses decreased earnings $140 million versus the third quarter of 2010, mainly due to tax items.
Corporate and financing expenses remain within our continued guidance of $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
As shown on slide 7, Exxon Mobil's third quarter 2011 earnings of $10.3 billion declined by $350 million compared
with the second quarter of 2011, mainly due to weaker crude oil realizations and Chemical margins, partially offset by
higher Downstream margins.
Moving next to third quarter business highlights and beginning on slide 8. During the quarter, we continued to make
good progress at Kearl, with construction now 75% complete. The Kearl initial phase development is progressing as
planned towards a late 2012 start-up. The PNG/LNG project is also progressing as planned towards a 2014 start-up.
Recent milestones include the first weld on the 430 mile gas pipeline, mobilization of the first drilling rig and
construction of the LNG plant pipe racks, storage tanks, foundations and jetty.
We continue to wrap up activity in Iraq, with six drill rigs operating. Current gross production is approximately
370,000 barrels per day. We're also working with the Ministry of Oil, the South Oil Company and other integrated oil
companies involved in the development of the southern Iraq oil fields to advance the commercial and technical basis
for the common sea water supply project.
At Banyu Urip in Indonesia, key contracts were awarded including the central processing facility EPC contract and the
drilling rig contract. Additionally the early production system continues to deliver approximately 20,000 barrels per
day of crude oil production.
Exxon Mobil also signed a principles of agreement with the government of Indonesia on key terms and conditions for a
new production sharing contract for the development of the Natuna gas resource. The completion of the POA is a key
milestone towards the development of Natuna.
Turning now to slide 9, Rosneft and Exxon Mobil signed a strategic cooperation agreement on August 30 to jointly
participate in exploration and development activities in Russia, the United States and other parts of the world. This
includes 30 million acres in the Kara Sea, which is one of the world's most prospective hydrocarbon provinces with
high potential for liquids. As you can see from the map, the 30 million acres in the Kara Sea is a very large area and is
similar in size to the entire central Gulf of Mexico. Seismic surveys are planned in the Kara Sea in 2012.
In the 2.8 million-acre Black Sea block, seismic surveys have begun with the potential for exploration drilling to follow
in 2014. We are working closely with Rosneft to finalize the definitive agreements.

Turning now to an update on our unconventional activities on slide 10. Exxon Mobil's global portfolio of
unconventional assets contains a growing number of highly prospective liquids-rich plays. We have approximately
410,000 net acres of leasehold and seven operated rigs in the tight oil reservoirs of the Bakken shale. In the Permian,
where we hold approximately 800,000 net acres of leaseholds, we are also evaluating unconventional potential that
occurs across roughly half of this acreage. In the Bakken, liquids production in the third quarter rebounded strongly
from the severe weather impacting operations in the first half of 2011, increasing by 19% from the second quarter and
25% year-over-year.
We are also involved in multiple emerging liquids-rich shale plays, the most active of which is the Woodford shale in
the southern Oklahoma Ardmore basin area. To date we have amassed more than 150,000 net acres in this play through
an aggressive leasing and acquisitions program. This leadership position has been built at an attractive cost, as we
acquired resources for approximately $0.30 per 1,000 cubic feet equivalent and added the leasehold for under $600 per
acre. Our activity in the Woodford Ardmore play has ramped up significantly in 2011, with our operated rig count
increasing from 3 to 7 rigs and gross operated production more than tripling since year end 2010.
In our core development area, peak 7-day gross production rates have averaged 325 barrels per day of crude oil and 3.7
million cubic feet per day of natural gas. With the rich 1,275 BTU gas also yielding significant natural gas liquids,
providing an average liquids rate per well of over 750 barrels per day and 2.9 million cubic feet per day of sales gas.
We are continuing to ramp up drilling activity and are progressing both marketing and infrastructure plans for the play.
Exxon Mobil is also actively exploring several other early stage liquids-rich plays in the United States, including the
Utica shale play in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Our position in the Utica stems from our recently
completed acquisition of the Phillips companies and represents incremental upside to the Phillips acquisition which was
focused on the Marcellus. The Phillips acquisition included 45,000 net acres prospective for the Utica in Ohio and we
have increased our position now to over 75,000 net acres. We anticipate drilling our first Utica wells in early 2012.
Additionally, Exxon Mobil has a diverse portfolio of emerging unconventional resource opportunities outside of the
US, including several new plays with liquids potential. For example, in Germany and Argentina we are in the early
stages of evaluating several new tight oil opportunities. These opportunities represent a large and growing global
portfolio of unconventional assets with the potential for significant value creation, through the application of Exxon
Mobil's advanced technologies, supplemented with strong operational and technical expertise from XTO.
Turning now to slide 11 with an update on our new synthetic lubricant basestocks project. During the quarter,
ExxonMobil Chemical announced plans to build a world scale facility to manufacture metallocene polyalphaolefin or
MPAO, a synthetic lubricant basestock at our integrated refining and chemical complex in Baytown, Texas. This new
facility will have the capacity to produce 50,000 tons per year of MPAO. This new high viscosity MPAO
manufacturing capacity demonstrates Exxon Mobil's technology leadership and our commitment to providing
customers with a reliable supply of synthetic basestocks.
ExxonMobil Chemical is the world's largest PAO producer and offers the broadest range of advanced synthetic
basestock fluids. MPAO is primarily used in high performance synthetic lubricants and offers enhanced characteristics
versus conventional PAO such as improved sheer and low-temperature properties. Demand for high performance
lubricants is increasing due to the greater emphasis placed on energy efficiency, improved equipment reliability and
extended drain intervals. This investment leverages Exxon Mobil's proprietary metallocene catalyst process and enables
development of innovative synthetic lubricants that can help address lubrication challenges across a wide range of
market sectors.
This new plant at the Baytown complex will be an important addition to our synthetic basestock manufacturing
portfolio, which includes production facilities in Texas, New Jersey and France, as well as various custom
manufacturing arrangements around the world. Engineering, procurement and construction activities have begun and
completion is expected in 2013.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 12. Upstream earnings in the third
quarter were $8.4 billion, up $2.9 billion from the third quarter of 2010. Stronger crude oil and natural gas realizations

increased earnings by $3 billion, as crude oil realizations increased $32 per barrel and gas realizations increased $1.34
per Kcf.
Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $660 million due mainly to the impact of lower entitlement
volumes in West Africa and base decline partly offset by the ramp up of Qatar, Sakhalin and Iraq projects. Earnings
were also positively impacted by the timing of liftings. All other items, primarily gains from asset divestments, partly
offset by higher exploration and operating expenses, increased earnings by approximately $600 million. Upstream
after-tax earnings per barrel for the third quarter of 2011 were $21.31.
Moving now to slide 13. Oil equivalent volumes decreased 4% from the third quarter of last year, mainly due to the
impact of lower entitlement volumes in West Africa, decline and divestments.
Volumes were positively impacted by the ramp up of projects in Qatar, Sakhalin and Iraq and continued strong
performance in our US unconventional resources business.
Turning now to sequential comparison, starting on slide 14. Versus the second quarter of 2011, Upstream earnings
decreased by $147 million. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $450 million, as crude oil realizations declined by
over $5 per barrel. Production mix and volume effects decreased earnings by $90 million, due mainly to lower
entitlement volumes in West Africa and Iraq, lower seasonal demand in Europe and decline.
Earnings were positively impacted however by fewer maintenance activities and the timing of liftings. Other items,
primarily gains from asset divestments and favorable foreign exchange impacts, partly offset by higher exploration and
operating expenses, increased earnings by $390 million.
Moving to slide 15. Oil equivalent volumes decreased 3% from the second quarter of 2011 due mainly to lower
entitlement volumes in West Africa and Iraq, lower seasonal demand in Europe and decline partly offset by fewer
maintenance activities. Lastly, I'll note that year-to-date oil equivalent volumes increased 5% or 226,000 oil equivalent
barrels per day compared to the first 9 months of 2010.
Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, quotas and divestments, production was up over 8% and remains
consistent with the 2011 volume guidance we communicated at the March Analyst Meeting of 3% to 4% growth versus
2010. For further data on regional volumes, please refer to the press release and the IR supplement.
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 16. Downstream earnings in the
third quarter were $1.6 billion, up $419 million from the third quarter of 2010. Improved refining margins increased
earnings by over $1 billion. Continued benefits from our refining optimization activities contributed $110 million in
volume and mix effects. Other factors including unfavorable foreign exchange effects and lower gains on asset sales
decreased earnings by $710 million.
Moving to slide 17. Sequentially, third quarter Downstream earnings increased $223 million. Positive margin effects
increased earnings by $360 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $270 million driven by
refining optimization and lower maintenance activity. Other factors decreased earnings by $410 million, largely due to
unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Turning now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 18. Third quarter Chemical earnings were
$1 billion, a decrease of $226 million versus the third quarter of 2010. Margins improved earnings by $50 million,
while higher planned maintenance contributed to a negative $110 million volume and mix effect. Other factors
decreased earnings by $170 million primarily due to unfavorable tax effects and higher planned maintenance costs.
Moving now to slide 19. Sequentially, third quarter Chemical earnings decreased by $318 million. Lower commodity
chemical margins decreased earnings by $130 million, reflecting lower global demand consistent with the softening
global economy. Volume mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million. Other effects decreased earnings by $140
million primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects, and higher planned maintenance costs.
While the Chemical business is cyclical in nature, we continue to leverage feed advantage, integration and premium
product offerings to outperform throughout the cycle and maintain a positive long term outlook on the business.

Moving to slide 20. While we manage our Downstream and Chemical businesses separately, we continue to capture
benefits from the unique integration and optimization of these businesses. Third quarter earnings were $2.6 billion for
our combined Downstream and Chemical businesses.
Moving to slide 21. Exxon Mobil's third quarter financial and operating performance was strong, and reflects the ability
of our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong results. As we continue to focus on operational
excellence, deploy high impact technologies and leverage our unparalleled global integration, Exxon Mobil remains
well positioned to maximize long term shareholder value.
That concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with ISI.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Hi, David. How are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. I'm fine. How are you this morning?
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good. Global E&P profitability seems to be rising especially overseas which appears to be
offsetting some of the weakness in the US and so my question is whether you could provide a little bit more insight into
these Upstream profitability trends and that is in relation to the level of realizations or margins, as they may be called.
Meaning are there other international mix effects besides the ramp ups in the three countries you mentioned? And in
the States, are the trends as simple as lower oil but higher gas production related or are there other factors at work?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me actually answer those questions in reverse order.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: The impact you do see in the US is a mix effect with some lower liquids production being
offset on a volume basis by higher gas production overall as we trended in the last year or so and you've seen that
impact on our volume mix effects. Overseas, I would say most of the changes that you see there is really the benefit
we're seeing in the project ramp ups. In particular, the Qatar trains. And you see that both in our non-US profitability as
well as the strength of our non-US gas realizations. So those would be the primary factors.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay, good. And then also you mentioned that Natuna was progressing slowly but surely
and on Natuna I wanted to see if we could get a little bit more of a status update on that project and specifically whether
you guys feel the partnership structure is settled and also whether you believe current technology is present to
effectively develop that project. Just a little bit of an update on that one.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Even though this project has been around a while and we've been looking at it and
working on it, we're still in early days in terms of the definition of the project, the partnership, et cetera. I was pleased
to report this morning that Exxon Mobil, Pertamina, Total and PETRONAS have signed this principles of agreement
which will relate to the plan for exploration and development of the area. So while the POA is a good first step, I have
to say we're still kind of in the early day of bringing that project along. And those negotiations for the final PSC are
ongoing.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. I understand. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Iain S. Reid>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Iain.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: I wonder if you can give us an update on the Rosneft deal, in particular, where are you on
negotiating the tax terms? Is there any kind of special tax breaks that you're looking for in order to make this project
work? And also I think you are going to swap some assets with Rosneft in the US. Is there any kind of decisions being
made on in which particular assets you're going to do that deal on? And I've got a question on Chemicals after that if I
can.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. Let me hit both of those questions on that strategic cooperation agreement. In terms
of tax terms and other issues around the definitive agreements, I can tell you work on those agreements is progressing
on schedule. We're working very closely with Rosneft on that deal and that's progressing.
I can say in terms of in particular on fiscal terms, the Russian government does recognize the need for fiscal
improvements in the offshore. And we are working with them to define how that might end up at the end of the day.
But I can't give a specific timeframe for the finalization of those agreements other than to say work is progressing.
In terms of the second question, I wouldn't refer to it as asset swaps necessarily. I think a better way to portray is
Rosneft will be given the opportunity to participate in various properties in the US, for example, in the Gulf of Mexico
in the deepwater. They'll have an opportunity to farm in to some of our 100% owned blocks and they are evaluating
those opportunities to make a decision. They may also take an interest in some of our unconventional resources in the
US. And they're looking at that as well and what those opportunities might be. There is also potential for cooperation
and joint partnership in other pieces of the business overseas but again, those have yet to be finalized.
I will say that we're looking forward to the multiple joint ventures and personnel exchanges that we're going to see in
this agreement. And I think this will help strengthen the relationship between the two companies as well as provide
valuable development opportunities for our staff. So it's kind of as the title suggested, it is a strategic cooperation
agreement. And that includes technology development that we've also talked about including the Arctic Research
Center, so a number of things going on. And I would say again, early days but things are progressing on schedule.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. Thanks. And my Chemicals question was, you talked about margin weakness in the second
and third quarter. Is this a kind of a global GDP slowdown thing you're seeing in Asia or the OECD? Or where is that
kind of bit of weakness coming from do you think and do you think this is something which will extend into the fourth
quarter and into next year now?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Let me hit the first part of that. As we've looked at margin trends sequentially across the
last couple of quarters, we are seeing demand weakness overall. And that has backed up into some downward pressure
on margins. Asia is probably at bottom of cycle if you kind of look at historic trends. But we've also seen some
weakening demand and margin pressure in Europe as well. Back again on the Asia side, there's a little bit of oversupply
across some of the commodity products and that's pressuring margins.
So once again we're reminded that this is a cyclical business and the profits that we're earning now are certainly very
strong given where we are in an otherwise pretty weakened economic environment and in particular, our commodities
although I will say on the specialty side of the business, that business is holding up pretty well both from a volume and
a margin standpoint. And we look at earnings decline across the last few quarters, most of that has been the commodity
section as the specialties business has held up well. So as we look forward in the fourth quarter and next year, it's hard
really to judge what's going to happen. Although I will say as you would expect, there'll be a close tie between
economic activity levels and certainly the profitability of the commodity side of the business.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. Thanks. Well, maybe we've had a bit of good news out of Europe for a change today.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Maybe.

And we'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good morning, David. How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Yes, first question on the US unconventional portfolio. I know last call you mentioned you're
running 65 to 70 rigs. Can you update us on the rig count this quarter? And secondly, as the commodity strip has come
down very different than oil on the natural gas side, how do you consider any activity response to the environment? Or
can you quantify – I know you highlighted Woodford Ardmore and Utica. I mean, can you quantify shift within that
portfolio towards liquids? And I have a follow-up on the Black Sea.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. As you mentioned the environment has weakened a little bit on gas prices here in the
US. I can tell you across the quarter, we're averaging right around 64, 65 rigs in the unconventional space, about what
we've been doing over the last year or so. I don't have a quantification of actual rig movement but I can tell you as you
would expect, we have optimized that rig count towards the liquids-rich plays and ramped up there, and certainly in
terms of keeping the overall total flat, backed off on some of the dry gas areas. So in particular, as I mentioned some of
these new plays that we're in, we're anxious to ramp up drilling activity there and are doing so. So yes I think just as
you would have expected, we are certainly optimizing that rig count towards the liquids-rich plays and in particular,
some of the newer things that we're working on.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. That makes a lot of sense. On the, just a follow-up on the Black Sea questions. In terms of
the onshore or offshore assets that Rosneft will have the option to farm into, is this primarily an acreage opportunity or
is there an associated production potential as well? And you didn't mention any time on Kara, you mentioned seismic
this year. Is that also a 2014 timetable with the Black Sea?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, let me just kind of clarify. In the Black Sea we've got seismic underway now and we
look to potentially at a well in 2014. When you go up to the Kara Sea, we would expect to begin the seismic operations
next year and then potentially if things work out, drill a well in the 2015 timeframe.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Got it. Any update on the Kastamonu well. I believe that – is that still drilling in the Turkish Black
Sea?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: When you look at – the Kastamonu well was our first well. We have finished drilling that
well. I can tell you that we did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. We plugged and abandoned that
well and we did take that dry hole expense in our earnings this quarter. I can also tell you we continue to evaluate the
results of that well and the well we drilled last year as we look at kind of the overall play there.
I think as you look out across the next several months, our plans in the Black Sea are to, once TPAO is finished, they've
got the rig now drilling one of their blocks, we'll then take the rig up to Romania and drill our first well. Whether we'll
get that spudded at the end of the year or it rolls into the first of the year, we'll see. It depends on timing of the return of
the rig. But that will be the order. We'll drill Romania next and then we'll evaluate based on the results and what we're
seeing from our evaluation of the earlier wells what the go-forward plan is there.
<Q - Evan Calio>: If I could just slip in just one other. I know on the Hadrian discovery, a large discovery. I know you
were testing a deeper objective. Any update there?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm glad you asked that because I do have an update on that for everyone this morning. We
have finished the well. We drilled to TD. And I can update for you now the pay that we have logged is now 1,000 feet.
So I think if you look at kind of how we've gone, we initially talked about 500 feet. Then we updated it last quarter to
750 feet. And I can now confirm that the well has encountered more than 1,000 feet of net oil and gas pay and we are
progressing plans for additional drilling as we continue to evaluate what has turned out to be a very high quality
prospective block.

<Q - Evan Calio>: Wow. That's great news. The development plans, will we hear those soon?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We're working on it. And as soon as those things are better progressed, we'll talk about
those. But at least for now the news is good and again, we are very pleased with the quality of this discovery in the Gulf

And we'll take our next question from Jason Gammel with Macquarie.
<Q - John C. Nelson>: Thanks. Good morning this is John Nelson for Jason Gammel.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: John, how are you doing?
<Q - John C. Nelson>: How's it going?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Very good, thank you.
<Q - John C. Nelson>: Congrats on the quarter. Just was wondering if I could get any color on the 76,000 barrels per
day of entitlement volumes that you lost in the quarter. Just curious if there was any particular region that stood out or
if you could try and maybe quantify that?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Oh, sure. The primary area there is West Africa as it was frankly when you look quarter on
quarter. But if you're looking specifically sequentially, you have the bulk of that is in West Africa.
<Q - John C. Nelson>: Okay. And then just wondering real quickly, could you quantify the, any out of period tax
charge taken in 3Q for the change in the UK tax law?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I can give you an update on that. That number was less than $100 million impact on
our earnings this quarter.
<Q - John C. Nelson>: Less than $100 million including 3Q or specifically for out of?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No. That would be the 3Q impact on earnings. Just under $100 million.

We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Good. Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones if I may. I guess going back to an earlier question
on the strength of the international realizations, it's kind of my favorite topic right now. But can you just talk about the
impact of Qatar this quarter? It looked like international gas realizations were flat despite a lower Brent price and I'm
wondering if that was some kind of movement in the direction of the sales volumes after the downtime in Q2. And I've
got a quick follow-up, please.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: You hit it spot on, Doug. That is exactly what we saw. The impact of the higher volumes
into the LNG market and in the impact on our overall realization that we saw internationally. So you got that right.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Do you think it's fair to describe that as a big factor in what's improving in your international
realizations?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I would say that was the primary factor.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, great. The follow up I have is really, I don't know if you're going to be able to answer this
one, but I know you and I have had discussions about Kearl in the past and given that we're getting pretty close I guess
to seeing a start-up next year, albeit at the end of the year, the economics have really come under a bit of scrutiny. And
I wonder if you could just clear things up in terms of how Exxon sees the economics of Kearl and how it stacks up
relative to some of your other projects. And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, no Doug, that is a good question and it stems from the discussion we initiated at the
Analyst Meeting in March. I can tell you that as we've looked at this that the Kearl returns are within the range of all
the projects that Exxon Mobil participates in the deepwater of Gulf of Mexico. So when we look at the projects that
we're involved in and those economics and compare those to Kearl, I can confirm that the returns are going be
consistent within that portfolio.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Any perhaps update on the timing of the future expansions beyond Phase I?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, I can't give you the timing on the future expansion. As soon as we've got that thing
locked down, we'll let you know. But we haven't made the final determination on that just yet.

We'll take our next question from Mark Gilman with The Benchmark Company.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: David, good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Can I stick with the Kearl project for just a sec. I wonder if you could, given that you're 75%
complete, give us an update on what the Phase I development costs looks like, whether it's still along the lines of about
100,000 of daily flowing barrel?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, if you look at as I mentioned that we are 75% complete and that's going along very
well. In terms of the cost, they've not changed from what we told you in March at the Analysts Meeting on the chart we
showed. Those things are still the same as we mentioned at the time.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Okay. If I could follow up with just some PSC related stuff. Looks to me as if there was a
tranche effect encountered in West Africa. Is that accurate? Was it Nigeria or Angola? Also you mentioned a lower
entitlement in Iraq which strikes me given the spending profile there to be just a bit curious. Hopefully you could flesh
that out for me.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. We did have a tranche change in Nigeria and that did impact part of those volumes.
And then I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?
<Q - Mark Gilman>: You had indicated lower entitlements in Iraq which struck me strange in light of the spending
profile going forward as well as the price environment. Can you clarify what was going on there? Maybe even provide
an entitlement production number for Iraq in the period?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, sure. Basically the situation in Iraq is quite simple. We became cost current last
quarter and so during the second quarter we were catching up and the production barrels that we had reflected that. And
this quarter, those volumes have come down because we are cost current.

We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, couple questions. First in the, can you tell us what is the asset sales gain, the actual
amount in the third quarter and the second quarter of this year and whether that they are primarily in the E&P segment?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Are you talking about the divestment gains?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Yes.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you look at our divestments, most of the gains that we've seen in the second quarter, or
in the third quarter rather, were in the Upstream. And also as you look at the second quarter overall, we did have a
series of divestments in the Upstream and also some in the Downstream. I think the place you really see the impact of
the divestments this quarter without giving a specific number, but it's the biggest driver in the, if you look
quarter-over-quarter, and then even sequentially, in the other factor on our earnings waterfall chart there. The primary
driver of those positive results are the divestments that we had over the quarter.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So yes, roughly about $400 million sequentially higher asset sales gain?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No. That's the total in there. There were some asset sales gains in there. But there were a
number of other factors. We had some favorable ForEx and then we also had the increase in exploration expense. So
again, without quoting a specific number on the asset divestments, I can tell you when you look at both of those
waterfall charts, that is the primary driver of the positive impact.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Because the second quarter does have a reasonable sizable asset sales gain also, right?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, we did have some asset gains in the second quarter as well.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And when you're talking about the foreign exchange on the favorable impact, are those
related to the translation of the balance sheet or is it actually on the cash earnings due to the impact on your [ph] costs
(41:56) as well as that the translation back to the US dollar when you are in the revenue side?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, the primary impact that you see in the Downstream on the unfavorable ForEx I
mentioned is really the impact on the US dollar crude payables that we have in the Downstream.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay, so, just on the balance sheet item.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Can I sneak in maybe just one final one?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: You're talking about the production and dropping into the shale oil. Is there any number that
you can share what is your current well cost that you guys running in Bakken? What's for the Permian Basin and what

is the EUR you are expecting and also the 30 day IP on those?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, I really don't have any additional details to share this morning other than the ones I
mentioned in my prepared remarks. As you look at some of those plays, obviously with the early wells that we're
drilling and some of the optimizations that we're doing, it really wouldn't be representative to start talking about, I don't
think, well costs and that sort of thing. Because our expectation is as time goes on, those costs are going to go way
down. I think what's encouraging though is the significant addition we're making to our overall unconventional
portfolio with the bulk of that here as I mentioned this morning giving you an update on how we're doing on the
liquids-rich plays you might recall.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: What is your total production in the third quarter for the shale oil?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I don't have a specific breakout number for that in the quarter. I can tell you it's certainly
going up. I mentioned a couple of examples. So while it's a little premature to start talking about absolute volumes, I
think the important thing for everyone to know is the activity is ramping up, the rigs are ramping up, the drill wells are
ramping up and we're progressing. I will give you a couple of examples. Just for example, we've added 38 wells
year-to-date in the Bakken, with 18 of those in the third quarter. So I think that gives you a good feel of kind of how the
activity is going. And once we get a little farther down the curve, we'll talk more about specific volumes.

We'll take our next question from Allen Good with Morningstar.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Allen.
<Q - Allen Good>: I just had a quick question on LNG and Golden Pass. Looked like this week there was movement
as far as the viability of exports from the US. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on how Exxon views essentially
LNG as the US and uses at Golden Pass and whether you're actually importing any LNG into the US currently?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, if you step back and look at the viability first of all of just LNG exports out of the US,
that is a topical discussion today and a lot of folks are looking at it and talking about it. I don't think it would come to
any surprise to you know that any marketing opportunity or development opportunity out there, is certainly one that
we're looking at across the board whether it's in the US or Canada. I can tell you though that Golden Pass is an LNG
receiving terminal and there are no current plans to change that either into any form of an export terminal. So that's
kind of the status there. We've not brought any cargos in recently that I'm aware of into the terminal. But it does remain
obviously a very valuable asset for us. Other than that, I don't really have any other comments to make. It will be
interesting to see, as time goes on, if the viability of LNG exports materializes, but that's just one of a number of
options that are out there.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, thanks for that. And then just a question, I think last quarter you mentioned that drilling in
Argentina would start in Q4. I was just wondering if that's still on track and if there is any sort of changes as far as
outlook there given some of the recent tax announcements and changes with the government in Argentina.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'll kind of start at the end and back up. We don't have any changes contemplated in our
plans at this point. We do have two wells that we're working on here in the fourth quarter, consistent with what I
mentioned last quarter and those wells are progressing. I don't have any results for you on that yet, but we are working
on those. The one thing I think that I alluded to in my prepared remarks and I've talked about the Neuquen Basin before
and our large acreage position there, we are looking at the potential there for not only shale gas but also tight oil and
shale oil. And so that's encouraging and we'll be progressing that. As I mentioned several other tight oil plays that are
emerging that we are actively working on. So, but back to your basic question, no change in our plans in Argentina and
the two wells are progressing.

<Q - Allen Good>: All right. I appreciate that. And I'd like to just get one more quick one. It looks like you added one
rig from last quarter in Iraq. Do you have a goal as far as an exit rate on rigs there for the end of the year or sort of an
eventual plateau rate on rigs going into next year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, I don't have anything specific on either of those. There are a lot of factors that will
drive that. I think the real important milestone that we've reached is we've gotten up to 370,000 barrels a day. The six
rigs are running, a lot of workover activity. And again, that progress is going very well. But I wouldn't want to
speculate on what something might look like down the road either next quarter or after that.

We'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Thanks for taking my question. Dave, if I may, one on Downstream first. I believe Exxon is
the only company in your peer group that has not been actively looking to sell refining assets in the past let's say one to
two years. I'm just curious what you see in the refining market that seems to be different from what many of your peers
are perceiving?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's a good question. Let me clarify that because in fact we have had some recent
announcements about asset divestitures which include refining assets. You might recall over the course of the last
several months we've announced divestitures in Argentina, various areas in Central America and then most recently the
Malaysia downstream asset sale. So we have had quite a number of asset sales over the last year or so. And again they
do include some refining assets.
Now if you look at refining in general across the board, as we've talked about on many occasions, one of the
tremendous competitive advantages we have in our refining circuit versus others is the full integration with most of our
refineries with the chemicals and the lubes business. So as we continue to optimize those facilities and get the kind of
profitability and returns on those that we're generating, I wouldn't expect us to see a lot of change.
So we're comfortable what we're doing. We don't proactively tout major divestment objectives or programs. But as you
look back across the years, we have been very active and have divested a number of assets as those assets turned out be
worth more to others than they were to us. And we'll see what happens going forward. But right now I think we're in
pretty good shape.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: Okay. I appreciate that. And just to be clear I was mainly thinking North America and
Europe.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: But your color on that is definitely useful. And then secondly just on Poland. Some press
articles in the past week mentioning about your first frac job in the Polish shale acreage, just an update on that would
be great.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, we are. We've got a couple of wells there that we're in the process of fracing and
flowing and cleaning up those wells. So it would really be a little early for me to give you any initial results because
we're just now literally as we sit here working on those and flowing them and testing them and seeing what we got. So
as we get through the evaluation stage and clean those wells up and see how they perform, we'll be in a better position
to perhaps give some color on that. But today, it's just working on the operations.
<Q - Pavel Molchanov>: We'll wait until the Q4 call. Thanks Dave.

We'll take our next question from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Hey, David. A lot of questions already answered. But can I just come back to the entitlement
issue? So basically Q3 should – I mean obviously it doesn't affect cash flow, but Q3 should be a sort of a better base if
we're trying to get the volumes right going forward if say you kept the oil prices flat?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, there are a number of things that affect the entitlement volumes. One of course and
not only the price but the spend as well. In fact, when you look sequentially at that impact that we had, the 76K BD, a
fair amount of that was actually due to spending being down and thus the recoupment volumes going down as well as
the tranche change that I mentioned. So in a constant price environment, you wouldn't see as big of an effect obviously.
You'd be more down to spending rates and of course tranche changes. But we did see some pretty big movement,
particularly quarter on quarter with that $30 increase in oil prices. And then again sequentially more spend driven rate
of spend driven as well as Iraq being cost current.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Okay and then thanks for that. Two small questions, but just the asset gains, you actually have
a number for the asset gain in E&P in the quarter? I mean you mentioned $600 million but a combination of a couple of
things in there.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I tell you Ed, I don't have a specific number associated just with the asset divestments
to talk about this morning. Again, I'll confirm though when you look at both the quarter-over-quarter as well as the
sequential primary factor again driving those, that other earnings impact are the impacts of the divestments.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yes, and then in -
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: And then there were a number of other things up and down.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right. And then in R&M, the actual FX impact?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, the actual impact in the Downstream if you're looking third quarter '11 versus third
quarter '10 was right at $300 million negative.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: And then if you're looking – in fact I'll just tell you, if you're looking sequentially, it was
also close to $300 million negative. So fairly sizable ForEx effects in the Downstream this quarter.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Great. And then obviously there was a mix effect in terms of volumes with the liquids change.
The flagged $170 millions of extra tax in Chemicals but the 47% rate was still a little high. Is anything else changing
apart from the UK?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: There are a couple of other factors I'd mention. One of course is the mix of profitability in
terms of Upstream/Downstream and US/non-US And then you have the kind of that effect where we had the absence
that I mentioned of a few tax effects in Chemicals and in Corp and Fin from last year and then a few negative impacts
this year. And the difference between those two also contributes to that 2 percentage point increase.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right. Okay. Thanks very much, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Okay.

looks like for you in terms of both Qatargas and RasGas both in the third quarter and for the balance of the year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you look at the downtime that we've seen in the Qatar trains particularly over the last
couple of quarters, I'll tell you that the work is done and those trains are up. And we actually saw as we came from the
second quarter into the third quarter, we actually had less maintenance and some improved volume performance out of
that in the third quarter. And so now it's just kind of normal operations but we did see improvement from the second
quarter into the third quarter.
<Q - Mark Gilman>: Is there anything remaining that needs to be taken down for maintenance purposes in the fourth
quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm not aware of anything major in the fourth quarter. So I would expect you could see
basically normal operations.

And our final question today comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Dave, just two quick ones. You talk about the over lift in the third quarter. Can you give us a
number that how much is over lift? Also at the end of the September from an inventory standpoint are you still over lift,
under lift or neutral. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's a good follow up from the last quarter where I'd mentioned how under lifted we
were. If we look sequentially which is probably the best way to look at our net over lift position, we were slightly over
lifted this quarter and under lifted last quarter. And that gave a net over lift for of about 80,000 barrels a day quarter to
quarter on a net basis.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. So 80,000 barrels per day net over lift.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, on the delta.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Is that at the end of September or that is sequentially?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, that's sequentially. So if you look, we were under lifted, I think I mentioned in the
second quarter about 69,000 barrels a day. We were over lifted in the third quarter by about 14,000 barrels a day and so
the delta between those two is about 83,000 barrels.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And at the end of September are you, from a inventory standpoint, are you now pretty much
balanced?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, I think where we are year to date, we're probably pretty close. It may be a little
under/over either way, but I think we're pretty close on a year to date basis.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Great. And Dave, would you be able to share with us that what, how much is the production
you actually booked in from Iraq in the third quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No. As we typically do, I don't typically give a country specific number. But I can tell you
as I mentioned earlier in the call, some of that change we saw in the net interest, or rather in the entitlements column
was Iraq getting cost current. But the most important thing in Iraq is that gross number which we have now gotten up to
370,000 barrels a day and that's a real milestone for us.
