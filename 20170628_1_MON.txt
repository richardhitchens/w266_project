MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to Monsanto Company's third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Laura Meyer, Monsanto Investor Relations Lead. Thank you. Please go
ahead.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Brenda, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO;
Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. Also joining me from the IR team is Ben Kampelman.
Our third quarter call marks the passage of a significant portion of the Northern Hemisphere ag season, and today we'll
provide a summary of our third quarter results as well as the outlook for the balance of this year. This call is being
webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides, and the replay at monsanto.com.
We have provided you today with EPS and other measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we
refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release,
both of which are on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ

are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any obligation to update them or the factors that
may affect actual results.
Before handing it over to Hugh to share our strategic outlook, let me share our third quarter results, as shown on slide
four. As outlined in our reconciliations and in line with our expectations, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of
$1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93 as compared to last year's as-reported earnings per share of $1.63 and
ongoing earnings per share of $2.17. From a free cash flow perspective, we had a use of cash of $158 million for the
first three quarters as compared to a use of cash of $251 million in the prior year.
Hugh?
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Laura, and good morning to those of you on the phone. Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm pleased
to share that we've returned another solid quarter for fiscal year 2017, and in doing so, have an even clearer line of sight
on our two priorities for the year, namely delivering on our operational plan and key business milestones, and moving
to closure on the Bayer merger agreement.
So let's begin with the Bayer path to completion on slide 6. Bayer continues to lead the filing process with support from
Monsanto and continues to target closing by the end of the year. The filing in the European union is expected to be
submitted in the next few days and the response to the second request issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was
recently completed. Once the E.U. filing is in, all key initial submissions will have been made.
In addition, we've already received clearance from several regulators, including South Africa, for which Bayer agreed
to provide remedies. The clearance progress has been steady and consistent, and we remain encouraged by the
advancement of other proposed combinations as our industry undergoes a healthy transformation to better serve the
world's farmers.
And while other deals have their merits, we believe this merger is uniquely beneficial, as shown in slide 7. It has the
capacity to benefit growers by accelerating innovation, by delivering integrated solution tools, and by expanding
offerings to new crops and geographies at a time when they're most needed.
One other benefit it delivers is complementary R&D expertise to enhance discovery efforts, leading to increasing
meaningful benefits for growers around the world. And global agriculture needs to get there to solve the conundrum of
growing more with less inputs. We know that there are ways to grow food better, smarter, and more efficiently.
Collectively, we've created and delivered many of the building blocks necessary to meet future needs, but there's still
much more to do. Despite near-term supply, the demand for corn and soybeans continues to grow, as shown on slide 8.
The rigors of climate change and competition for resources will only serve to intensify this need.
We're well positioned to develop this next generation of solutions as shown on slide 9 with the broadly licensed
Climate FieldView platform and our strong foundation of seed, trait, and chemistry solutions. The combination with
Bayer should only serve to accelerate our ability to bring those to the growers who need them most. And our open
platform continues to expand and evolve.
I'm encouraged by the positive farmer experiences that we've been hearing and seeing for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend
soybeans, Bollgard II XtendFlex cotton, and Climate FieldView, as they reach record levels of penetration. In fact,
combined, these new technologies are on more than 125 million acres in the U.S. in just two to three short years.
In addition, we recently received several regulatory approvals for our products. In April, we received the EPA approval
of NemaStrike Technology, keeping this blockbuster product on track for commercial launch in fiscal year 2018. We
also recently obtained the EPA approval for SmartStax PRO, our next generation of corn rootworm control technology,
which we expect to launch around the turn of the decade pending receipt of certain import approvals. And finally,
Vistive Gold soybeans just received import approval from China, clearing its final regulatory hurdle for full

commercialization in 2018.
These factors also play into the high-quality performance that our business is delivering, with gross profit up more than
12% through the first three quarters. Our innovation leadership is driving our growth, and the completion of our third
quarter bolsters our confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year.
To that end, our guidance range for fiscal year 2017 is expected to be at the high end of the range for as reported and is
confirmed at the high end of the range for ongoing earnings per share despite the continued tough ag market.
I am very pleased with what our team has accomplished, maintaining its focus while balancing our two imperatives.
The business remains on its growth trajectory and the progress on the combination continues at a steady clip.
So with that, I'll pass it to Brett to provide the operational update. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line.
Our focus on delivering the key business imperatives has powered us through the third quarter, and achieving our 2017
key milestones will place our company on a path to deliver on our strong growth through the turn of the decade.
Specifically, the ramp of our latest technologies has been record-breaking with Roundup Ready Xtend, Intacta, and
Climate FieldView. Our costs have been coming down in both U.S. corn and soybeans, and our pipeline continues to
advance.
As we delve into the specifics, let's start with corn, as shown on slide 10. This quarter is all about the Northern
Hemisphere. Let's begin with the U.S., where we're sold out of our DEKALB Disease Shield hybrids in their first year
of introduction, and we remain on track for genetic share gains. This was offset by lower than anticipated planted acres
and a modest decline in our germplasm price mix.
A key inclusion on those Disease Shield hybrids was our Acceleron B-300 SAT microbial product, which was the first
launch from the BioAg joint venture with Novozymes. Early season reaction has been positive, and we look forward to
seeing how the rest of the season plays out.
In Europe, acres planted to corn year over year ended up relatively flat, and our team delivered modest germplasm
price mix lift in local currency along with anticipated genetic share gains. Overall, we're still expecting our full-year
global corn germplasm price mix lift to be flat to up low single digits as a percent in local currency, primarily driven by
the strong double-digit growth in the first half in Brazil and Argentina.
For soybeans, the momentum continues to be tremendous in our latest technologies, as shown on slide 11. With 50%
growth in gross profit in Q3 alone, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% growth in our soybean gross profit as
well as strong margin improvement for the full year.
Let's start with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans in the U.S., as shown on slide 12, where our ramp year for the trait
has been outstanding. There are about 20 million acres planted across the country and we're hearing great feedback on
the performance of the varieties and on the efficacy of the trait and herbicide system in managing tough to control
weeds. Based on information we have to date, the overwhelming majority of our customers are experiencing success
with on target application of XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology and are following the label and good stewardship
practices. So I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season unfolds.
In South America, the strong performance of Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology once again underpins the
record penetration we are delivering. For a fourth consecutive year, Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO is delivering greater
than four bushel per acre yield advantage based on 2017 field trials.
With this continued strong performance, growers have added another 15 million acres this year, increasing penetration
to more than 50 million planted acres across South America as shown on slide 13. Our focus is now shifting to next

season where we have established the price in Brazil commensurate with the performance and reflecting an increase on
local currency which included the removal of the transition rebate that expired in fiscal year 2017 as expected.
In cotton, on slide 14, the growing experience with Bollgard II XtendFlex varieties and the ability to use dicamba
herbicides in season has now driven our trait penetration to more than 5 million acres in the U.S. This is well over our
anticipated penetration of more than 4 million acres and is nice to see given the substantial growth in cotton acres this
year. In addition, we're increasingly confident in our delivery of the third straight year of genetic share gains in cotton
and look to build upon this in the years ahead with Bollgard 3 XtendFlex cotton.
Moving our other crops, we still expect modest but steady growth in vegetables for the full year. We also continue to
strategically manage our product portfolio as planned with two additional deals struck recently, one in Ag Productivity
and one in Seeds and Genomics, and we expect to receive the benefit in our fourth quarter results.
Shifting to digital tools, our Climate FieldView platform continues to see major advancements in its strategic
differentiators in this space with our partnerships, collaborations and strong adoption as shown on slide 15. In terms of
partnerships, we have signed up three new platform partners, Ceres Imaging, TerrAvion, and Agribotix that will deliver
valuable high-resolution imagery to farmers.
In addition, in May, Climate acquired HydroBio, an agricultural software company with unique irrigation focused data
and analytics capabilities. This not only reinforces our partner of choice reputation in this space but also expands the
suite of products we expect to be able to offer farmers in the years ahead. And we'd expect even more announcements
here before end of the fiscal year as we continue to evaluate more than 25 potential technology partners.
In terms of adoption, we are ahead of where we expected to be for paid acres, registering more than 35 million, well
above the original target of 25 million acres. We also just recently announced our official commercial launch in Brazil
after completing trials on nearly 1 million acres as shown on slide 16. With continued significant progress on adoption
and partnerships, and increasing interest in licensing opportunities, Climate FieldView remains a very promising area
on the horizon for us.
As our Ag Productivity segment, we are now seeing the anticipated glyphosate-based herbicide price improvement
translating to the retail market. This has resulted in year over year improvement in gross profit for the segment for the
third quarter, and we expect this improvement in pricing will extend into the fourth quarter, despite year over year
headwinds we saw in the first half.
We're also increasingly confident in glyphosate's re-registration in Europe, as discussions have been progressing
positively. In addition, XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology continues to contribute to the bottom line, as trade
penetration for the Roundup Ready Xtend crop system drives demand for low volatility dicamba formulations.
Moving to pipeline products, as Hugh mentioned, we recently received the highly anticipated news from the U.S. EPA
that NemaStrike Technology has been approved. This puts us on track for commercialization in 2018 and allowed us to
place hundreds of Ground Breaker trials across the U.S. this year, as shown on slide 17. As we've done with numerous
new technologies in the past, these trials will give growers firsthand experience with NemaStrike Technology and will
inform our launch for 2018. With blockbuster value and strong interest from licensors and growers, we're excited to
move the technology into their hands.
All in all, this was a solid quarter, in line with our expectations. And as we look confidently to close out 2017, we've
shifted our focus to growers' infield experience with our latest technologies, managing returns in the Northern
Hemisphere, and to the selling season in South America.
With that, I'll hand it over to Pierre for his financial review.
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone.

In the third quarter, we delivered as-reported earnings per share of $1.90 and ongoing earnings per share of $1.93, in
line with our expectations. Let's look at the specifics. Our soybeans gross profit grew by 50%, driven primarily by three
factors in the U.S.: the reduced cost of goods for Roundup Ready Xtend, the increased acres planted to soybeans and
the benefit from the sale of those traded varieties. Similarly, cotton gross profit improved by 31%, thanks to the
increase in U.S. planted acres, greater Bollgard II XtendFlex acreage, and genetic share gains.
Corn gross profit was down slightly, in line with expectation, and mostly due to lower planted acres in the United
States, coupled with the previously mentioned grower demand-driven timing shift into Q2. This was partially offset by
lower cost of goods in the U.S. due to improved production volumes. Global corn price was essentially flat in a market
where commodity prices continue to be challenging.
Finally, other crops, seeds and trait gross profit declined due to the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in the
prior year. Ag Productivity gross profit increased about 12%, given the improvement in both pricing and volume for
glyphosate-based herbicides, and the continuation of XtendiMax dicamba-based herbicide sales coming through in the
results.
Our SG&A and R&D expense increased about 8%, primarily resulting from increasing incentive expenses, driven by
the growth in the business and from the increased investment in climate. However, we remain on track with our target
of $500 million in savings by the end of the fiscal year 2018, as shown on slide 18, across cost of goods and operating
expenses as compared to our fiscal year 2015 base. These savings are helping to offset inflationary increases globally.
Lastly, free cash flow fiscal year to date is a use of cash of $158 million versus the prior-year use of cash of $251
million. This improvement reflects the increasing operating cash flows from the first three quarters as compared to the
prior year. The increasing capital expenditure relates to the construction of the dicamba manufacturing facility in
Luling, Louisiana.
Looking out through the end of the fiscal year as shown on slide 19, we confidently expect our as-reported earnings per
share to be at the high end of the range of $4.09 to $4.55, and again confirm our ongoing earnings per share at the high
end of the range of $4.50 to $4.90. For free cash flow, we also still expect to be at the high end of the range of $1.2
billion to $1.6 billion.
As we look at the specific components of guidance, let's start with Seeds and Genomics gross profit, which is now
expected to be up high single digit as a percentage for the year. This reflects outstanding growth in both soybeans and
cotton as well as modest growth in corn, partially offset by the absence of the benefit from the alfalfa license in Q3 of
fiscal year 2016.
In our other segment, Ag Productivity, gross profit is still expected to be in the range of $850 million to $950 million,
as both glyphosate and dicamba deliver anticipated results.
As part of our continued portfolio optimization efforts, I am pleased with the recent deals we've signed, and we expect
to receive the benefit of roughly $70 million in non-core asset sales gains in the fourth quarter. About half of these
gains will benefit the Ag Productivity segment, and half will benefit Seeds and Genomics. Both are expected to be
recorded in other income and are considered in our guidance.
Despite the recent weakening of the Brazilian real, we still anticipate the change in currency rates year over year to be
relatively neutral to earnings. And finally, we still expect our SG&A and R&D expense to be up mid-single digits as a
percent due to increased commissions in South America, incentive increases, and greater spend at Climate, consistent
with the drivers in the year-to-date results.
In closing, we are delivering solid returns on innovation and doing so with financial discipline as we return our
business to growth this fiscal year. We have confidence that the outlook for the balance of the year is on sure footing,
and we look forward to updating you at the fourth quarter.
Thank you for your time today. And with that, I will pass it to Laura for the questions.

Thanks, Pierre.
With that, we'd now like to open the call for 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I'll ask that you please hold
your questions to one per person, so that we can take questions from as many people as possible. Brenda, we're ready to
take questions from the line.
Q&A
Operator
Okay, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, Vincent.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Just wondering, this year, Brazil in particular had a big fly up in planted acreage,
similar in Argentina, but we've seen the local corn price in Brazil retreat a fair amount. So I'm just wondering, as you
think into the fourth quarter and I guess a little bit into fiscal 2018, how are you thinking about where the acreage and
your volume performance is going to be? And you also had very strong price gains on seeds, so do you think you can
sustain those if we go into lower acreage and poorer corn economic environment down there?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes, that's good. I think we're taking a conservative outlook, but, Brett, maybe just a little bit
of color?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, good morning, Vincent. So it was just exactly as you described. As we look at Brazil,
the local price for corn is depressed compared to last year. So we obviously are taking that into consideration as we
look at pricing. Our genetics, though, we don't anticipate the same kind of improvement that we saw last year from a
pricing standpoint, and it will, as we expect, cut the acreage back a bit. So we're planning for somewhat of a reduction
in acres. It's still too early to call from how we see it and with the acres will actually come back, but we do anticipate
they'll be down some.
It's a bit stronger in Argentina as we look at the Argentina market with the demand for corn there, both domestically
and from an export standpoint, but we don't see the same kind of pricing opportunity that we saw last year. But we still
feel really positive about the performance of our portfolio, the performance of our genetics and traits, and our pricing
will be fine going into next year, and we still see growth occurring in that part of the world.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: And it's probably fair to say, Brett, that we took – we were careful in how we managed our
inventory this year as well, how we sold out.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, we're in a great position in Brazil and Argentina. Last year, as you mentioned,
Vincent, the acres were up significantly, and it's always a really good day when you find yourself with significant price
increases in a sold-out position.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: And that's where we found ourselves in Brazil this year.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Thank you. Just a derivative of that first question, can you just talk a little more
about the Intacta ramp as we stand today, including anything left to do in terms of old or new varieties within your
portfolio, the ramps in Latin America South, progress and timing of Intacta 2, et cetera? Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes, so good position on the varieties. In fact, in many ways, we're seeing it play out with
Xtend now as well. Because of the lead delays, we get a chance to color in the chess boards. But Brett, the final steps,
and then the migration to Intacta 2?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes. So as noted in our call today, soybeans has had a phenomenal year both in North
America with Xtend and as well as Intacta to your question, Chris, in South America. Intacta continues to do extremely
well. The big, big driver on Intacta has been and continues to be another year of delivering four-bushel yield increase,
and that's where the real value is. And so we're excited about hitting 50 million acres this year. We continue to look to
grow that into the total opportunity down there. We still expect somewhere around 75 million acres by 2019 on about
100 million-acre opportunity. And we do continue to look at Argentina and building it out there.
But again, I remind you that in Argentina, insect pressure isn't as severe as it is in Brazil. So Argentina has never been
as big an opportunity as Brazil has been. But we do continue to build it out for Northern Argentina and work with the
government on the system. And what really gets me excited about Intacta in South America is the work our R&D team
has done to bring us the next generation of Intacta 2.
And we're already starting to build the plans to make the big transition from Intacta 1 to Intacta 2, and as I've said for a
couple years, I don't think we'll ever fully penetrate with Intacta 1. We'll be making the transition to Intacta 2 bringing
in the new technology with new and better insect control into the marketplace. But we feel reasonably good about
where we sit right now in South America with soybean.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We're chasing 75 million acres by 2019. Thank you.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Don Carson>: Yes. Thank you. A question on just guidance. You've indicated that you're now looking for higher
gross profit in both Seeds and Genomics and Ag Productivity versus your previous thinking, yet you haven't changed
your overall guidance range. And just in terms of the impact of Xtend, we're seeing a lot of dicamba drama and some
concerns over off-target issues, and I know there's been some removal of in-crop use in Arkansas. So what overall
impact, if any, do you see that having on the Xtend rollout?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So, Don, thanks for the two questions. So Pierre, maybe a little bit on guidance and our stance
on guidance this year?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: Yes. So, Don, so as you know, historically, Q4 has always been a smaller quarter and
typically resulted in a loss. And last year was somewhat unusual with the favorable impact of the sorghum JV deal that
we had and better-than-anticipated final volumes in both corn and soybeans.
So this year, we are looking at a way more normalized volumes. And the key thing there is we are also expecting half
the amounts of deals that we had last year. And this is one of the reasons at this point in time since we've calibrated the
benefits from the deal around $70 million, this is why despite the increase you see in our guidance on GP in both high
productivity and season genomics. I mean, modest increases there, you see the total EPS not changing dramatically
because we have scaled down some of our assumptions as well on the deals. So all-in-all, I mean, pointing to the

high-end of our guidance, you're looking at a year where we're looking at double-digit growth for the full fiscal year in
terms of EPS in a really challenging environment. So that's the way we're thinking about it now.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks, Pierre. And then your question on Xtend, Don, we've talked for years about the
decade of the bean, and this is clearly the year of the bean. So we are delighted with the rollout of Xtend. It took a long
time to get here.
But if you look at beans and cotton, just to put some context in this, we've won 25 million acres this year from a
standing start. So our biggest launch and at time when growers are really looking for help for these resistant weeds,
Brett, against the backdrop of 25, how are you looking at it?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes. So, Don, you think about – as you pointed out, 25 million acres of combined corn
(sic) [cotton] and soybeans in the marketplace, that's a multiple fold, larger launch than we've ever experienced with
any technology, and I think it speaks volumes to the farmers' need for additional tools and technology in the
marketplace to control weeds.
What we've seen so far, Don, is the vast majority of farmers and applicators using our products are seeing great results,
both from a weed control and efficacy standpoint, as well as the application itself and the products staying put. So we
feel really good about what we're seeing.
I remind you to your point of the 33 out of 34 states have approved our XtendiMax with VaporGrip technology, but
Arkansas, as you noted, was one of them that never approved that product. It was the only one that never approved that
product. As it stands today, as we look at inquiries across the entire country, in the 34 states where we're approved, it
appears that the plant board in Arkansas is getting a lot more inquiries than we're getting across the combined rest of
the states that have approved XtendiMax with VaporGrip.
So the key here is that it's the largest launch ever. The number of inquiries we're experiencing would be normal for any
product. Even products that have been established in the marketplace would experience a number of inquiries every
year, so we feel really good about where we're at, and we'll continue to work with every farmer that's purchased our
technology and work with them to have a positive experience, but I couldn't be more excited about the performance
we're seeing across all the states.

Our next questions come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Good morning. Hugh and Brett, how do you look at market share playing out this year in the
U.S. in both corn and soybeans?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I guess, we'd say early days, but we're feeling good in both crops. There's possibility of a little
bump.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes. I'm always cautious to get ahead of ourselves because returns and everything is not
completed yet. But I do feel good today telling you that the indicators would tell us we expect genetic share gain in the
U.S. in our corn business and soybean business as well. And the one I'm more confident in is cotton because it's so
strong, and we've seen it for three years in a row. So I would tell you that it's kind of the triple crown on share growth
across the three different crops this year in the U.S.

Our next questions come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: Hi. You mentioned earlier about the potential pricing action you could take in Intacta. If I
understand correctly, you've been constrained on being able to push price for Intacta the last three years, limited by just
the rate of inflation down there, but the real has devalued by 50% in those three years. So given what you described as
the yield benefit and certainly cutting back on a number of applications has got to be a meaningful value proposition to
the grower. What kind of a price increase could we expect this fall on Intacta down in Brazil?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes. Thanks, Steve, and good morning. So a couple things to keep in context, and it's all
consistent with the points you made in your question. Yes, we've been somewhat limited based on inflation in Brazil.
It's not very often when you're talking about inflation being your friend, but inflation has been our friend when it comes
to pricing of Intacta, so we haven't been holding our price flat in Brazil. We've actually been moving it up with inflation
the past number of years, so we have improved our position.
As noted, there was a transition payment that was occurring from the old Roundup Ready formulation trait to the new
Roundup Ready 2 and Intacta, and that expires. And with that expiration, it feels a bit like a price increase to the farmer
and a benefit to us because it just goes away, so it just extinguishes itself. So we'll feel the benefit of that. So we would
expect going into this year that we'll see somewhere in the range of double digit, but it still has to play out as we look at
that transition payment expiring and the price move that we took, which was a positive uptick this year, again, on top of
the previous years.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes.

Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning. Corn re-plant acres have been relatively high this year. Can you talk
about the magnitude of the re-plants and whether that tightens up corn feed inventories at all industry-wide?
And secondly, it looks like your operating expenses in Ag Productivity were really much, much higher year over year.
Maybe they were $89 million or $90 million higher over a base of $127 million. What happened to operating expenses
in Ag Productivity?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the two questions, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Sure.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We'll maybe take the second one on Ag Productivity.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yes, so looking at the re-plants, it was – Mother Nature was not kind to the farmers. They
started planting early with great conditions, and then there's pockets where it just became really tough. And to your

point, there were farmers re-planting for the second and third time, unfortunately, this year. Here's the context and a
reminder. Every year, there are re-plants. And if you're one of the farmers that's affected in that area, it can be
devastating and it's incredibly frustrating. But when you look at it across the entire marketplace, it's always a relatively
small percentage in total. We accrue for that to occur in the marketplace.
Jeff, I would guess there's probably a slight chance it's going to – or more than a slight chance that it's going to be more
than average, but it isn't going be all that high. So to your point of, will it change our position with inventories, et
cetera, no, we're well prepared for that. The change in corn planted acres from last year to this year was more
significant than the impact of re-plant. So we're well balanced going into next year.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes, and that would be the same across the industry. That's the second real piece. Pierre,
expenses on Ag Productivity?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, Jeff, I don't have the detail in front of me. But as our total spend, our total spend is
increasing with the health of our business and we are seeing growth on both segments. And some of that translates into
commission in South America. Some of that translates into higher incentives. So specifically regarding Ag
Productivity, I don't have, as I mentioned, the details in front of me, but these are the key drivers at the company level,
which definitely play a lot in Ag Productivity since the base is lower. And there's also the launch of the dicamba
formulations in the market that may also have impacted that. So overall, this is together with the trends of our spending
in the company, which is really associated with the growth of the business.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: When you look at the year and our forecast on what we expected, we're tracking within
expectations.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: We're tracking within expectations, yes.

Our next questions come from the line of John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John Roberts>: Thank you. Is there any update you could give us on where you are in the divestment, you or
Bayer, in the divestment process to satisfy anticipated antitrust issues?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Not at this time, John. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're making steady
progress and the next piece of visibility will be the submission to the European Union, which we're working towards by
the end of this month. Given that, then the – if that occurs in that timeframe, then we anticipate that we would still be
working towards closure by the end of this year. Beyond that, we have no updates at this time.
<Q - John Roberts>: And is there anything to learn from the canceled precision planting deal that you had with
Deere? Anything to learn about antitrust issues or anything you can help us with there to understand why that didn't
happen?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: No, it's completely – it comes as the second part of your question, but it's completely separate
from our deal with Bayer, and we continue to look at that process. We're pursuing alternative purchasers at the
moment. So no, there's absolutely no linkage with the transaction.
<Q - John Roberts>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for your questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: I wanted to follow up on John's question in a little different fashion. You mentioned that you
received the South African approval for the transaction subject to a remedy, I guess, on the herbicide and seed side.
Was that in line with what your expectations were in terms of what would be necessary, or is that higher or lower? Can
you give us an order of magnitude of what the sales of that remedy was roughly? And I guess, do you think that that's
something that might carry through for other jurisdictions as well?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yes. Thanks for your question, Frank. And I really can't comment on that. I've learned over the
years, and you've been on many of these calls over the years, that speculating on regulatory processes is never a good
idea. So I think the next major one, as I said, is Europe in the coming days. I think our progress has been steady and
sure, but I think commenting on individual jurisdictions is – I don't think that's something that we should be doing at
this stage.
Laura J. Meyer
And, Brenda, I think we're coming to the close on questions now, as we indicated at the start. So we'll pass it over to
Hugh to make some closing remarks.
Hugh M. Grant
Thanks very much, Laura. Let me just begin by thanking you for your support and patience on the line today. We've
felt through this year that it's been important to continue to update our owners and investors, so we thank you for your
support.
I wanted to thank my team as well who have done an outstanding job on delivering on our operational plan and our deal
milestones where we continue to serve and support our customers, the growers around the world. And as we look at the
work through the summer, that's going remain our priority as we close out this fiscal year. So thanks, and
congratulations on a strong performance to my team.
And with that, we look forward to joining with you and talking to you again in October as we close out this year. Thank
you very much.
