Now, I will turn the call over to Mary Barra.
Mary T. Barra
Thank you, Randy. And thanks to everyone for joining the call today.
Through a lot of hard work, the GM team has made the business stronger than it was just one short year ago. You've all
read the headlines, so I don't need to repeat them here, but suffice it to say, during the last 12 months, we received a
flurry of great news from Moody, J.D. Power, Consumer Reports, the Automotive Leasing Guide, the media and more.
All of this momentum helped pave the way for GM to rejoin the S&P 500, achieve an investment grade rating, declare
a common stock dividend and report record earnings in North America. These are all important milestones; but they are
just that: milestones.
We have more work to do and our sense of urgency will not let up one bit. Our plan remains the same. We need to
operate profitably everywhere we compete, deliver compelling designs, excellent quality and a great ownership
experience, strengthen and grow our brand, further strengthen our fortress balance sheet and generate the kinds of
financial returns that earn the confidence of our long-term investors.
All right, let's turn to slide two and take a closer look at our 2013 financial results. To start, we delivered a record 9.7
million vehicles, which is up 4.5% from 2012. Deliveries in the United States and China combined increased by more
than 0.5 million units, although this was partially offset by declines in other markets, including Europe, parts of South
America and in our consolidated international operations.
Our global market share will be even with 2012 and net revenue increased by more than $3 billion to just over $155
billion. Net income to common stockholders was $3.8 billion. That's down from 2012 largely due to incremental tax
expense and special items. Our automotive business meanwhile generated $11 billion in net cash from operating
activity. That's a 14% increase from 2012.
Turning to EBIT adjusted, we earned $8.6 billion, which is a $700 million increase. We now have delivered EBIT
adjusted totaling almost $32 billion over 16 consecutive profitable quarters. As I indicated before, we are not where we
want to be in terms of profitability, but our solid and consistent profitability, combined with our fortress balance sheet,
has allowed us to level set our capital budget at roughly $8 billion annually.
It's been a long time since our product and plant teams have been able to work in such a stable funding environment
and believe me, it's a very welcome change. Ending churn in and of itself has made us more efficient, and it has helped
us deliver more award winning products with higher quality.
Digging into our EBIT adjusted results, you can see on the slide that we were up in North America, Europe reduced its
losses and our international operations in South America were both down. North America in particular is riding the
wave of new products with our Cadillac and truck launches helping to drive higher earnings.
The transition to our all new light duty pickups was well executed, especially the very orderly and profitable sell down
of the old models. And the CTS from Cadillac was the smoothest launch in my GM career. Rounding things out, GM
Financial increased its earnings before tax in addition to helping us sell more cars and trucks. Finally, our adjusted
automotive free cash flow was $3.7 billion, which means we ended the year with just over $38 billion of liquidity.
If you turn to the next slide, I'll review some additional highlights to provide more context. Let's start with Cadillac. We
have a long journey ahead of us with Cadillac to increase favorable opinion and purchase consideration. But the early
results of our global growth strategy are encouraging. Last year Cadillac leveraged the all new XTS and the ATS which
was the 2013 North America Car of the Year, has become the fastest growing full line luxury brand.
Now we are launching the CTS, the ELR, the ATS Coupe and the Escalade. And these vehicles represent some of the
finest designing and engineering work that General Motors has done. At Buick, our dealers in China and North
America delivered more than 1 million cars and crossovers, for the best year in the brand's 110-year history.

Chevrolet delivered nearly 5 million vehicles, which was enough for the brand's third consecutive year of record sales.
Market share was up in Brazil and Mexico and the retail market share was up in the United States. Some of the key
drivers in the United States were the Impala, which was named Consumer Reports best sedan, the Corvette Stingray
which was the 2014 North American Car of the Year, and the Silverado, which was the 2014 North American Truck of
the Year.
This year, GM is launching 15 new products in the United States and four of them are high volume Chevrolet Trucks
and SUVs. In China, we have announced plans for four new or redesigned Chevrolets in 2014, including a new
compact SUV for that fast growing segment. Finally, Opel/Vauxhall delivered more than 1 million vehicles and ended
2013 with its first European market share increase in 14 years, thanks to the Mokka and the ADAM.
I'll share just a few more highlights so you can see how these milestones really drove our business results last year. To
start, Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC all increased their retail market share in the United States, where we earned
record transaction prices. That drove an EBIT adjusted margin in North America of 7.8%. That's up from 7.2% in 2012,
so we made good progress on profitability, especially in the second half of the year as we expected.
In the third and fourth quarter, our margin was8.4%, which is up a bit more than two full percentage points from the
same period a year ago. And in South America, we had another profitable year. We're getting traction on both the cost
and the revenue sides of the equation in South America. For example, we ended the year with higher market share in
Brazil and we were able to reduce our material and logistics cost through localization. We also reduced our capacity in
high cost parts of the country and launched new products with higher margins. Heading into 2014, about 75% of our
sales in Brazil will be for new or redesigned products such as Chevrolet Onix and Prisma, up from about 25% in 2011.
Sales in China set a new record with more 3 million deliveries. That's up 11.4% from a year ago. One of the highlights
was the Chevrolet Malibu, whose sales nearly doubled. In Europe, we also recorded a year-over-year revenue increase
in the second half, and this shows that Karl-Thomas Neumann and his team are making tremendous progress.
And as I mentioned earlier, we achieved an investment grade rating from Moody's rating agency.
That's a lot of momentum, which we will build on in a number of ways this year. In North America for example, our
entire pickup and full-sized SUV lineup will be all new designs. Our 2015 model year Chevrolet and GMC full size
SUVs are on their ways to dealers. And our 2015 heavy duty pickups launched this quarter. And finally, our new
mid-size pickups launch in the fall. Later today, we'll unveil the new Chevrolet City Express small cargo van at the
Chicago Auto Show; it will also be on sale this fall.
Across Europe and South America meanwhile, GM Financial will start to contribute to growth as it consolidates the
consumer lending business we brought from Ally. And in China, we are expecting higher sales in 2014 and a richer mix
over time, growing in part from Cadillac's growth.
All right, let's move to the next part of the call. Chuck, I'd like to turn the floor over to you for a detailed walk through
the year and the quarter. I'll return at the end for some closing comments.
Charles K. Stevens
Thanks, Mary. On slide four we provide a summary of our 2013 calendar year GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net
revenue for the year was $155 billion, up 2.1% from the prior year, excluding the impact of FX translation, revenue
was up 3.6% for the year. Our GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up from a large loss in the prior period due
entirely to special items.
Net income to common stockholders was $3.8 billion and diluted earnings per share came in at $2.38. As Mary
indicated, the decline from the prior year was largely due to increased tax expense and unfavorable special items. Our
automotive net cash from operating activities was $11 billion, a $1.4 billion increase from 2012.
For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $8.6 billion in 2013 and the EBIT adjusted margin was 5.5% as
improved core operating performance across most of the business was partially offset by challenging environment in

consolidated international operations. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.7 billion for the year, a
$600 million decrease from 2012, largely due to the timing of sales allowances.
On slide five, we provide the EBIT adjusted by region for 2012 and 2013. GMNA's EBIT adjusted improved
significantly to $7.5 billion, driven by new products. GME had an EBIT adjusted loss of $800 million, an improvement
of more than $1 billion from 2012 driven by lower depreciation and amortization and material and logistic savings.
GMIO had EBIT adjusted of $1.2 billion, down significantly from the prior year, as the challenging environment and
consolidated operations more than offset improved performance in China. GMSA's EBIT adjusted was down slightly to
$300 million for 2013 due to FX headwinds.
GM Financial had record earnings before taxes of $900 million and corporate and eliminations was a $500 million
expense. This totals to an EBIT adjusted of $8.6 billion, an increases of $700 million from 2012.
On slide six, we provide an explanation of the $700 million increase in year-over-year EBIT adjusted. Our EBIT
adjusted was $7.9 billion for 2012. Volume was a $100 million increase, as the impact of increased wholesale volumes
in GM North America were partially offset by declines in GMIO and GM Europe.
Mix was unfavorable $400 million, primarily due to unfavorable country mix in GMIO and unfavorable vehicle mix in
GME, partially offset by favorable vehicle mix in GMSA. Price was $2.4 billion favorable for the year due to the
strength of our new vehicle introductions in GM North America and price actions to offset FX impacts in GM South
America.
Total costs were flat as lower fixed costs in Europe were offset with higher material costs in North America associated
with recently launched products. Other was $1.4 billion unfavorable, primarily due to FX challenges in South America
associated with the Venezuelan bolivar, Argentinian peso, and Brazilian real.
Slide seven identifies special items for the fourth quarter and calendar year that had an impact on our earnings per
share. I'm not going to go through the entire list, but the items in 2013 primarily relate to strategic actions we
announced in GMIO, the wage litigation in Korea, as well as the sale of certain non-core assets. At the top of the slide,
our net income to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $900 million and our fully diluted earnings
per share was $0.57. The special items listed had a net $200 million unfavorable impact to net income to common
stockholders and a $0.10 unfavorable impact on earnings per share. For the 2013 calendar year, our net income to
common stockholders was $3.8 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share was $2.38. Special items had an
unfavorable impact on net income to common stockholders of $1.3 billion and an $0.80 unfavorable impact on earnings
per share.
Moving on to the results for the fourth quarter on slide eight, our net revenue was $40.5 billion, a $1.2 billion or 3%
increase from the prior year. Excluding the effect of FX translation, fourth quarter revenues increased approximately
4.8%. Our Q4 2013 GAAP operating income included $1.4 billion of unfavorable special items as detailed on chart
seven. The prior year GAAP operating income performance also included significant unfavorable special items in the
quarter. Net income to common stockholders was $900 million, flat compared to the prior-year period.
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57 on a diluted basis compared to $0.54 for the same period in the prior year.
And our automotive net cash from operating activities improved significantly to $2.8 billion primarily due to the
absence of the pension settlement contribution made in the prior year. Our EBIT adjusted was $1.9 billion for the
fourth quarter including $200 million in restructuring costs, overall a $700 million improvement from the prior year.
The EBIT adjusted margin was 4.7%, up 1.5 percentage points from Q4 2012. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow
was $1.1 billion, flat compared with the prior-year period.
On slide nine we provide the EBIT adjusted by region for the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2013. GMNA's EBIT
adjusted was $1.9 billion. GME had an EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million. GMIO had EBIT adjusted of $200 million
and GMSA's EBIT adjusted was at break-even for the quarter. GM Financial earnings before taxes was $200 million,
double the prior-year period. Corporate and eliminations was a $100 million expense. This totals to an EBIT adjusted
of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, up $700 million from the same period in 2012.

Slide 10 shows our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we again show the
revenue and margins for the quarter. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were $1.7 million vehicles in the fourth
quarter, essentially flat compared to the prior year, and our global market share decreased two tenths of a percentage
point to 11.4%.
On slide 11, we provide an explanation of the $700 million increase in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted for
the fourth quarter. In Q4 2012, our EBIT adjusted was $1.2 billion. Volume was flat as wholesale volume increases in
GM North America were offset by decreases in GMIO and GM South America.
Mix was $300 million unfavorable, primarily due to country mix and increased wholesale of passenger cars in GM
North America and unfavorable country mix in GMIO, partially offset by favorable mix in GM South America. Price
was $1.4 billion favorable for the quarter, due to the strength of our recently launched cars and trucks in GM North
America and actions we've taken to offset FX in GM South America.
Total costs were flat as lower fixed costs in Europe were offset by higher material costs in North America associated
with our recently introduce cars and trucks. Other was $500 million unfavorable, primarily due to FX challenges in GM
South America associated with the Venezuelan bolivar, Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real. This totals $1.9 billion
for the fourth quarter.
We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 12. For
the fourth quarter of 2013, our total U.S. market share was 17.2% and our retail share was 15.9%. Retail share
increased 0.02 of a percentage point from the prior year as our fleet market share decreased due to the repositioning of
the Chevrolet Impala and generally lower fleet sales. Our incentives for the quarter were 10.6% of average transaction
price which put us at 107% of the industry average.
On slide 13 we show GMNA's EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $25.1
billion in the fourth quarter, up $2.3 billion from the same quarter in 2012. GMNA's EBIT adjusted margin was 7.5%
for the fourth quarter and 8.4% for the second half of 2013, an improvement of over 200 basis points compared to the
second half of 2012.
This is a clear inflection point and it demonstrates strong progress toward our mid decade goal of 10% margins. Our
U.S. dealer inventory was 748,000 units at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase from the prior year was due to
industry growth and the continued launch of our all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. We're closely watching
U.S. industry and our own inventory levels and we will maintain our disciplined approach to balancing supply and
demand. GMNA wholesale vehicle sales were 863,000 units for the quarter, a 37,000-vehicle increase from the prior
period.
Turning to slide 14, we provide the explanation of the increase in GMNA's EBIT adjusted, which rounds to 700 and
[audio gap] (20:09) North America's EBIT adjusted was $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012. Volume was $300
million favorable associated with the 37,000 unit vehicle increase in wholesales.
Mix was $300 million unfavorable, primarily due to country mix and increased wholesales of passenger cars. Price was
$1.2 billion favorable driven by our recently launched vehicles. Costs were $500 million unfavorable, which can be
more than explained by increased material costs associated with recently launched vehicles. Other was $100 million
favorable due to FX. This nets to an EBIT adjusted of $1.9 billion.
On slide 15, GM Europe reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for the fourth quarter, a $400 million
improvement from the prior year. Revenue was $5.3 billion for the quarter, up $100 million from the prior year and the
second consecutive quarter of year-over-year quarterly revenue growth. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was a
negative 6.5%. Europe's wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter stayed constant at 269,000 units. And market share in
the fourth quarter was 7.9%, a 0.4 percentage point decline from 2012 driven by lower sales of Chevrolets.
On slide 16 we provide the major components of Europe's $400 million year-over-year increase in EBIT adjusted on a
rounded basis.

Buying was flat with the prior year. Mix was $100 million favorable driven by increased sales of the Mokka and
Insignia. This is an encouraging sign as this is the first favorable European mix in several quarters. Price was $100
million unfavorable due to competitive pressure in the region. Cost was $500 million favorable primarily due to $200
million in lower depreciation and amortization, $100 million in favorable material performance and $100 million in
savings and fixed costs.
Other was $100 million unfavorable primarily due to FX. This totals to GMEs EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for
the fourth quarter of 2013. On slide 17, we show GMIO's EBIT adjusted for the most recent periods. In the fourth
quarter, EBIT adjusted was $200 million including equity income from our joint ventures of $400 million, partially
offset by a loss of $200 million in consolidated international operations.
At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from our consolidated operations was $4.9 billion, down $1.4 billion from
the prior year. GMIO's EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 2.2%, a significant decline
from the prior year as we continue to encounter challenging dynamics across consolidated international operations.
On average, net income margin for our China joint ventures was 7.6%, a 1.5 percentage point decrease from the prior
year, primarily driven by higher competitive pricing pressures and increased manufacturing costs associated with two
new plants coming on line in the near future.
GMIO had wholesale vehicle sales of 259,000 for its consolidated operations and 865,000 for the China JVs. GM
market share in the Asia-Pacific region remained constant compared to the prior year due to the continued growth of
China market offset with declines in the balance of the region.
Turning to slide 18, we provide the major components of GMIO's $500 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. The impact
of volume was $200 million unfavorable, primarily due to decreased wholesale units in the Middle East and ASEAN
countries. Mix was $200 million unfavorable due to country mix and price was $100 million unfavorable due to pricing
pressure in the Middle East. Cost was $100 million favorable because of material and logistic savings. Other was $100
million unfavorable due to foreign exchange and a slight decline in equity income from our China JVs. This totals the
GMIO's fourth quarter 2013 EBIT adjusted of $200 million.
On slide 19, we move on to GM SA region and look at EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the
slide, revenue was $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, a $300 million decrease in 2012. The EBIT adjusted margin in the
region was 0.7%, a significant decrease from the prior year period. South America's wholesale vehicles sales were
260,000 units, down 20,000 units compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, although our market share in the quarter rose
to 17.8% on the strength of our sales in Brazil and Argentina.
On slide 20, we look at the components of the $100 million year-over-year decrease in South American operations.
Volume was $100 million unfavorable due to the decline in wholesales. Mix was $100 million favorable primarily due
to increased sales of our successful new products in Brazil such as the Onix, Prisma and S10. Price was $300 million
favorable due to actions we have taken to offset unfavorable foreign exchange and the sustained strength of pricing on
our new products launched in Brazil.
Cost was $100 million unfavorable, due to charges related to the decision to terminate production, of a legacy product.
Other was $300 million unfavorable due to the Venezuelan bolivar, Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real currencies.
Slide 21, provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the fourth quarter. From our net income to
common stockholders of $900 million, we add back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the
undistributed earnings allocated to Series B and then deduct GM Financial earnings, to arrive at an automotive income
of $900 million for the fourth quarter of 2013. We had $200 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and
amortization was a $1.5 billion expense.
Working capital was a $200 million source of cash. The $1.3 billion decline in the prior year was due to a decline in
payables, as we experienced more payment cycles in the fourth quarter of 2013. U.S. pension and OPEB cash payments
exceeded expenses by $300 million in the quarter. The prior year period included the $2.3 billion contribution to settle
and annuitize our salary pension plan.

Other was a $200 million source of cash, a $700 million improvement from the prior year, largely due to an increase in
deferred taxes and an increase in dividends from our China joint ventures. This total has gone to automotive net cash
provided by operating activities of $2.8 billion. We have $1.8 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter. In addition
we exclude the interest associated with the prepayment of the Canadian Health Care Trust debt. This totals to our
adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, flat compared to the prior year.
The positive cash flow helped improve our liquidity position on slide 22 to $38.3 billion, including $27.9 billion in
cash and marketable securities. Debt increased to $7.1 billion compared to the prior year end due to our recent $4.5
billion refinancing transactions. $3.2 billion of the proceeds from the new debt was used to redeem Series A preferred
shares that had a book value of $2.4 billion. The remaining $1.2 billion was used in the fourth quarter to retire the
Canadian Health Care Trust notes. Series A preferred stock is $3.1 billion after the most recent redemption.
Our total U.S. qualified and nonqualified pension plans are underfunded by $7.3 billion, a significant improvement
versus a year ago, which we will further discuss in a moment. Our non-U.S. pensions are underfunded by $12.4 billion
at the end of the fourth quarter and our global unfunded OPEB liability is $6.3 billion.
On slide 23, we take a look at the funded status of our global and U.S. pension plans for the past four years. At the end
of 2013, we had a global pension benefit obligation of $99 billion, the first time our global PBO was under $100 billion
since 2002. Our global pension underfunded position improved $7.9 billion to $19.9 billion from 2012 to 2013, the first
time our global underfunded position has been under $20 billion since 2007. As it relates to our U.S. pension plans, our
underfunded status at the end of 2013 improved to $7.3 billion, nearly half the underfunded amount in 2012. The
combined effects of rising discount rates, asset returns and other items, partially offset by interest and service cost,
resulted in a $6.7 billion improvement to the funded status in our U.S. plans.
Slide 24 provides a summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial reported their results this morning and will
be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the fourth quarter remained constant
with the prior year at 7.2%.Our U.S. lease penetration is 20.8% in Q4, up 6.1 percentage points from the prior year as
we continue to approach the industry average. Lease penetration in Canada is at 20.4%, an increase of 14.3 percentage
points.
GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations grew significantly as our financing subsidiary continues
to grow its leasing and subprime footprint. GM Financial's percentage of GM's U.S. consumer subprime financing and
leasing remained fairly constant at 19% in the quarter. GM Financial's annualized net credit losses improved to 2.1%
and their earnings adjusted before tax were $225 million for the fourth quarter.
I will now highlight a few items of note for Q1 2014 on slide 25. Back in January in Detroit we indicated that we do not
expect our quarterly earnings cadence to follow typical seasonal trends in 2014. We expect Q1 earnings to be
approximately 10% to 15% of total 2014 calendar year earnings. Restructuring charges included in Q1 EBIT adjusted
are expected to be approximately $300 million, primarily related to the Bochum plant closing in Germany and the
strategic actions we've announced in GMIO.
We expect a weaker GM South America Q1 result, given the extremely volatile conditions in Venezuela, reducing
production in the quarter. Additionally, given the governmental policy actions and currency fluctuations within the
region over the past few weeks, the risk profile has increased. We will also have increased marketing costs associated
with supporting our vehicle launches. Additionally, we'll have volume and mix headwinds in GMIO, as we change over
to the launch of the full-size truck and full-size SUVs in the Middle East.
On slide 26, we again remind you of the slide we shared at the conference in January. Q1, as we just discussed, will be
significantly weaker than seasonal trends. Q2 and Q3, we expect to be similar to trend. However, Q4 will be stronger as
restructuring costs are frontloaded in the year and China will be benefiting from their new vehicle launches.
Finally, on slide 27 we remind you of our 2014 calendar year outlook. We plan to take advantage of the strength in
North America and China to fund our restructuring efforts around the globe. We expect EBIT adjusted for 2014 to be
modestly improved over 2013, while EBIT adjusted margins are expected to be similar to last year on a consolidated
level. Restructuring charges for the calendar year will be significantly higher than recent historical trends. We expect to

incur over $1 billion in restructuring expense and cash payments in 2014, primarily related to the Bochum plant closure
in Germany, and the strategic actions we announced in GMIO.
Now here's Mary for her closing remarks.
Mary T. Barra
Thanks, Chuck. In summary, we expect a year of modest growth in global industry volumes and solid GM results.
More importantly, we are working to accelerate the work underway to improve results on our way to becoming
profitable everywhere we do business. As you know, our medium term objectives include earning 10% EBIT adjusted
margins in North America, achieving breakeven results in Europe by mid-decade, delivering mid single digit EBIT
adjusted margins in South America, posting higher earnings in China, and turning in improved results in our
consolidated international operations.
We clearly have a lot of work ahead to make all of our regions solidly and consistently profitable. It's going to be a
multiyear journey that will include brand building, significant reductions in material and logistics costs and overall
lower fixed costs. We are working on all of these things simultaneously in a very coordinated and fully aligned way.
For example, about 70% of our Chevrolet volume in the United States will be delivered through renovated dealerships
by year's end, up from about 50% today. The global business services team is beginning to implement strategies that
are designed to significantly reduce our administrative costs. And we expect that the scale we achieve through our
global product development, purchasing and brand strategy will improve every year.
Rest assured we are confident that we have the team, the products and the plans in place to get it done. I know we
covered a lot of ground today and I'm eager to hear what's on your mind. So let's go now to the Q&A portion of our
call. Randy?
Randy C. Arickx
Okay, operator. We're ready for questions please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now proceed with the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
The first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Hey. A couple things, first, just focusing on North America, in Detroit, I think you suggested
that the earnings improvement from 2013 to 2014 would be similar to what we saw from 2012 to 2013. It's around $1
billion. It looks like you get a couple percent volume growth, maybe 3% volume growth, that could be $800 million.
You just did $1.2 billion of positive price in the quarter. So I was hoping you could just give us a little bit more color.
Are you essentially saying that maybe because market share isn't where you'd like it to be, pricing will come down or
are you a little bit more cautious on volume or mix?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, Rod, we haven't really changed our outlook from what we shared back in January at
the Deutsche Bank conference. And when you look at the key drivers year-over-year from a North American
perspective, industry we still expect to be in the range of $16 million to $16.5 million notwithstanding some of the
challenges we've had in January associated with weather. We expect mix to be a tailwind year-over-year really driven

by new vehicle launches. Pricing on new product will be up year-over-year with pricing on carryover being down as we
continue to see competitive actions that specifically impact carryover product. And we expect cost to be up
year-over-year. Engineering DNA will be up, advertising will be up to support brand building and launch, and then the
material content on new products. You kind of, as I indicated back in January, directionally we would expect another
step function improvement year-over-year, really being driven by the improved industry, and our new product
launches, and some pretty favorable pricing on new products.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the first quarter in North America? Obviously you've got
these two big launches. How significant a headwind is that? And maybe just thinking longer-term into 2015 or beyond,
you're talking about getting to 10% margins by mid decade. Is it reasonable to assume that you see that kind of
progressing positively from 2014 to 2015 and then beyond? And what are some of the things that we should be thinking
about as elements of improvement as we look out to next year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Okay. Yeah. First to the first quarter results or expectations for North America. Clearly,
when you shut down full size SUV and go through a launch along with heavy-duty pickups, that has an impact on
overall volumes and mix.
On the other side, we're filling out our pipeline with the new CTS and continue to get good traction on trucks. I would
say that the big kind of headwinds in North America really related to the launch cadence associated with full sized
utilities and heavy-duty trucks as well as some incremental marketing expense related to the Super Bowl and the
Olympics along with launches.
Relative to our journey to 10% EBIT margins, nothing has changed versus the discussions we've had in the past along
with that. It is a three tranche to four tranche phased-in journey. The first in 2013 was really driven by new products
and improved margins associated with that and improved retail share we got. In 2014, we expect another step really
driven primarily by product with some cost efficiencies on manufacturing and SG&A starting to filter in through the
latter part of the year. Going into 2015, we really start to expect to get some traction on costs and material, logistics as
we start to launch new products.
And then, the last piece is really business model leverage and that's really all about driving improved retail share and
improved loyalty, taking full advantage of global connected customer and that's going to be the last piece of this as we
move through the cycle. So, nothing's really changed from what we've discussed in the past.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: So, just to clarify, you would think that 2015 would be better than 2014, even though when you
look at new products are probably going to be a record as a percent of the overall portfolio in 2014.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Our expectations are that we are on our continuing upward trend in margins from 2013
through mid-decade. Nothing's changed versus that.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Good morning.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Hi, John.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just a first question on slide 26. Chuck, you alluded to in the first quarter there being $300
million of restructuring charges. But given the cadence that you're showing there, it would have appeared that that
actually was much higher in the first quarter. Can you just give us sort of the cadence of the restructuring charges
through the course of the year?

Page 10 of 18
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: In general terms, we talked about $1.1 billion. In Q1, and we're looking at this on a
year-over-year basis. In Q1, I would expect that 30% to 35% of those restructuring charges would hit and then kind of
work its way down on the trend line through the rest of the year. The big restructuring items in Q1, number one, there's
going to be a fairly significant charge associated with the Bochum closure. We've got ongoing activities there hitting
restructuring in GMIO, primarily related to severance payments as we start to work to Holden employees. And then,
the impact of the San Jose closure in Brazil and the severance and employee related costs associated with that. So those
are the three big items along with Chevrolet Europe in Q1. And again, as I think about the year, I would say that more
front – of the $1.1 billion, more frontend loaded in the first quarter and then mitigating going through Q2 to Q4,
coming down from that.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. That's very helpful. Then a second question on slide 17, you had alluded to, when you
were talking about IO, that there was a lot of competitive pressures on pricing. Are you seeing the Japanese taking
advantage of the weaker yen outside of North America in other markets? Is that kind of what you're getting a there?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, and we've seen that trend all year starting back in the first quarter of 2013, and it
really is market specific. So we've really seen a lot of price pressure in Australia for instance. Japanese pretty strong
there, and they primarily import from Japan. We've seen price competitiveness in Southeast Asia, again another area
where the Japanese dominate and we've seen price pressure there. So it appears to me that they're more overt about
taking advantage of the weaker yen in those markets than they have been here in North America or the U.S.
specifically.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then just lastly, Mary, obviously product is a key focus of yours and the
companies now. And it sounds like you're making bigger and bigger investments and the product cadence is good here
in the short term and this is – really seems to be the sweet spot in your product cycle. But as we look out into 2015,
2016 and 2017, once we get through the pickup trucks and the SUVs and the small and mid CUVs that'll launch in the
next couple of years, do you think you'll be able to keep this very significant product cadence going forward or are we
going to see a lull after we get through the surge? Can you guys commit to replacing 15% to 20% to 25% of your
product portfolio, and I'm talking about the U.S., on a consistent basis? Is that something you think you have the
product engine to do now?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Absolutely. I think if we look at our product cadence, it's really well thought out through the
next four years or five years in addition to strong products and looking at what are the opportunities to make significant
changes, whether it's a powertrain, whether its electrification as we look at the marketplace and what really the
customer is looking for in the vehicle. So I feel very confident that we've got a good product cadence as we go out
through the next several years and specifically with a focus not only on the vehicles but on powertrain.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Any color in China? The margin was down rather
significantly. Do you feel confident you could get back – those margins back to where they were? Because you
indicated it was a combination of both pricing which sounds like something that might be lingering for a while, and
also [indiscernible] (44:22) the new plants or anything else?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. For the fourth quarter specifically, the biggest driver of that was the incremental cost
associated with bringing two plants on. We've talked about the pricing dynamic in China all year and that is a pretty
competitive market. Looking forward, we expect to see continued margins in China in the 9% range and the continuing
price competitiveness, but our mix is going to improve substantially as we launch a number of SUVs in that market. So,
and Cadillac; we're going to triple the sales of Cadillacs in China between 2013 and 2015. So we would expect to
continue to see price headwinds, but we're going to offset that with much improved mix and our expectation is we'd

hold margin somewhere in the 9% range.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And then thinking in GMIO outside of China, it did look like, the GMIO consolidated got
slightly worse from Q3. I thought Q3 had some higher warranty costs that were a headwind. Why the sequential
weakness in the region?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: One, there was restructuring charges in GMIO in the fourth quarter of roughly $70 million;
two, as we start to prepare for the launch of the full-size SUVs and the trucks in the Middle East, there was a volume
downtake there, because they're selling down the GMT900 inventory that they have. So that was the headwind to a
large extent in mix and price from that standpoint. So, those were the two big drivers quarter-to-quarter. But I got to say
this, the region outside of China, very, very tough dynamic there. We made a couple of very big – took very decisive
actions with the Chevrolet Europe decision that we made and the Australia decision. And the whole purpose of that was
to improve the foundation for growth going forward. And there's more work to do in a number of other countries.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And in GM South America, what was the size of the product termination impact? And any more
specifics on exactly what product and will that affect your volume in the region going forward?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would like to avoid giving the specific product, because we still sell them. So, it
was in the ballpark of $60 million to $70 million in Q4 on that product termination. Fundamentally, it's writing off the
tooling. This is normal, that's why it's not restructuring and why it's not special. When we end production, normal
production of a vehicle, if there's any unamortized tooling, we write it off. So, that was the impact there.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And why the decision to terminate the product all of a sudden?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: As we look at our – again, the2012 plan that we started to execute four legs to that,
rationalize the portfolio and sell new products where we make more money than the products that we're placing. This is
just part of the rationalization of reducing our reliance or eliminating legacy products. We don't make very much
money on those.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. Just one last question. The $600 million GM Korea wage litigation, was that accrued?
And how much of that will be cash, and is there any implications from that from your cost structure? Because
obviously that's the settlement that I think the wages there are now kind of changing going forward?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. We accrued a similar liability in 2012 when we got an unfavorable ruling on this
specific litigation. We reversed it fundamentally, because a very related case had a favorable ruling and internal and
external council deemed the probability of exposure there to be low. So, we reversed that. One part of the ruling that
we're still working through is the go-forward provision. So, this was the retroactive piece as the ruling came down in
the Kabul case. The impact on go-forward wages, you would include bonuses, et cetera, in the calculation of ordinary
wage. So that could have a headwind on a go-forward basis from a wage perspective. But we're still working through
the details on that.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And from the cash perspective, there is no cash outflow from the settlement?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Not specific to the special item at all. No, there was a total non-cash transaction both sides.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Yes. Good morning. I want to ask a question really kind of targeted to Mary. Using the
pickup truck market share as kind of a microcosm of how you might be thinking about pricing and promotion and how
that might differ from prior management teams. So if you look at it, your trailing three-month large pickup truck share
was around 34%, 35%, that's like 300 basis points below the 2012 headline. I certainly remember in the mid-2000s, it

would probably be time for employee pricing for everyone. So want to understand, it is actually 33.9%. How you're
thinking about that share; is that your target given the new trucks, at least in the half-ton segment of the market? And
what needs to change vis-à-vis product and/or your pricing and/or competitor actions to reboot that? Or is the share fine
where it is?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, a couple points. First, the truck has gotten great reviews from a multitude of sources
externally. It won North American Truck of the Year, so we're very confident in the product. We are still getting all the
plants online that build that vehicle. I think if you look at it, there's been, our new product we were very effective in
selling out the old product. And so there's still 13 to 14 out in the marketplace. So, I think, we still have room get going.
We will maintain our pricing discipline, but we will also look and react to the market to make sure we're competitive
within the market. But I'm very confident that we have a solid full sized truck. Also as you look at – as I mentioned
before, we have the heavy-duty trucks coming out in the first quarter, we've got the SUVs. And then the third part of
our strategy is the mid size truck that will be coming out in the fall. So I think there's still a lot going forward and I
have a lot of confidence in these products and we'll still maintain our pricing discipline.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: And on the CUV side, I asked this question a few quarters ago, but maybe you have a
different perspective. Seems like we're seeing kind of a global CUV boom. You're talking about some product actions
that kind of put you in that. But I guess the question is, why do they seem somewhat late to some of these regions? And
is there a lesson learned there either around cycle time or getting the right balance between global platforms and local
market demand that you're going to kind of make different – try to do differently going forward?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I think we'd had success with the Chevy Trax and the Buick Encore and the Opel Mokka and I
think that's a very good success story. We have an SUV coming in China. I think this is a segment of the market that
continues to grow and we're going to get in and seize that. And in some cases, do I wish we were a little faster in
getting the product in the marketplace? Sure, but we have a complete cadence that we're working through. And we
have, I think, very good products that we've announced that are out in the market and what we have coming. Again, it's
a significant part of the market and I think we've got the right product cadence as we go forward.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks, everybody. I got a couple of questions, four questions for Chuck and then one for Mary.
Chuck, any guidance on the pension expense year-on-year given how you finished up?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: We're looking at overall relatively flat year-over-year. This year, we kind of looked at,
well, for 2013 a headwind, but as I look into 2014 relatively flat; nothing material one way or the other.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Great. Chuck, what's the Chinese JV dividend now, meaning on a trailing 12 months, how much
cash do you pull out of that business? It used to be around $1 billion; just curious how much higher or similar it is.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Fundamentally, we end up getting dividends relatively equal to the equity income over
time.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Over time, but any delay? Because I know it's based on the prior year and there's certain payout.
I'm just curious, can you quantify how much came out last year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I'll have to get back with you on that, Adam. I think it was slightly below the equity income
in 2013 which we expect to catch up this year.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Great.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: $1.7 billion. $1.7 billion was the number in 2013.

<Q - Adam Jonas>: So, slightly below that.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: No. That was the number that we got, which was slightly below the equity income.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, Chuck, GM Financial, you guys are guiding for stable profit
this year, but I'm curious why when we're getting all these new consolidated operations coming in. Any kind of
one-offs that don't repeat or is it new headwinds that you're allowing for?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I think there's incremental costs in building out the platform to help grow in the U.S.
to take that business to 20% across all of the different aspects of the business, lease financing. And also some
integration in systems costs in the international business. There's a lot of work to do over there from a systems
perspective. So, I would call it a non-recurring kind of one-time investment in the business.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Great. And Mary, just lastly, if you were to isolate the single biggest challenge or threat facing the
company, both in your domestic market and then separately in your international markets, love to hear your thoughts,
and if you were to highlight the biggest threats for us.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, I guess I will...
<Q - Adam Jonas>: I'm a glass half-empty kind of guy, so sorry.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Okay. And I'm a glass half-full kind of person. So, I would kind of characterize it as
opportunities. I mean, clearly, I think we've got a strong product cadence. I think we're getting the recognition in the
product cadence, but we need to continue to build our brands. I think we all know that that's a multi-year activity. You
don't recover in one year or two from a historical perspective when we look within the car part. That's a huge
opportunity.
So you know the product – winning products and my goal is every segment we choose to compete in around the world
we're going to win in those products. As we continue to do that, we've got to work on the other three Ps as it relates to
making sure we go to the market strongly and continue to build the brands. I still think there's tremendous opportunity
in China. We have the three brands there, Buick being very strong; Cadillac is a huge opportunity and there's still a lot
of room for Chevrolet in China, so I see those as great opportunities.
And then, third we've got to really focus on maintaining our cost structure. And I think we've got a lot of good activity
going on in a very coordinated way to make sure we're not just, I'll say looking at cost here or cost there, but
systematically looking at our overall cost structure, whether it's in the fixed cost of the business or, I'll say the material
cost of the logistics. I think that's another huge opportunity and we'll keep our focus on each of those.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thank you very much indeed.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yeah. Thank you for squeezing me in. Couple questions just on the outlook. I know
that Detroit Auto Show wasn't a long ways away, but since then you've had a bit of a currency crisis, which has clearly
impacted fourth quarter results likely to be a big impact, to your point, in first.
Europe, especially considering you had a, I think was it $100 million of restructuring? in the numbers seems to have
come in pretty well. Even though the outlook hasn't changed, would you consider the – upside downside regionally to
have shifted a little bit? In particular, the question would be for Latin America and Europe.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I think that's a reasonably fair characterization. As I indicated in the comments earlier, the
risk profile in South America, over the past several weeks has increased significantly. We still see real no line of sight
on a resolution to the business operations in Venezuela. And at the same time, Argentina seems to be a bit more, or
significantly more fragile. So, I would say the risk profile has increased in South America, I would say emerging

a price and a cost perspective to address that. So I would say, more downside risk now than we had a month or so ago
in South America. And I would say on the basis of how we finished and some of the momentum that feels like we're
starting to get in Europe, if I was more bullish on outlook versus three or four weeks ago, I would say, Europe feels like
there could be some upside there.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: And thank you. And particularly on the pricing piece of Europe, I think if, I don't
have the page in front of me, but it was sort of maybe a slight negative, but how would you characterize the pricing
environment, I mean with volume starting to pick up there? Is that something that you anticipate is getting better?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: No. And let me go back and make sure that we understand the reference to the upside in
Europe. Let's start with the foundation for 2014 because we need to be clear on that. When we talked about 2014 versus
2013, we said that was going to be a transition year in Europe.
Number one, our new key launches in the most critical segments, the B and the C segment, don't happen until the latter
part of 2014 and 2015. So we think that that's going to be a dynamic that we're going to have to manage through. We
also said that we expected continued price headwinds in the market. And I think in our case, exacerbated by the age of
the portfolio in the B and the C segment.
We've got significant year-over-year restructuring charges as a headwind in Europe as well and Russia. Russia is
consolidated and part of European operations now and with the weakness in the ruble, that's created, as I talked about
back in January, another year-over-year headwind. So in the context of, hey, you add that all up and European results
are, as I indicated before, are going to be down year-over-year and margins are going to be down year-over-year,
primarily driven by restructuring charges in Russia. I think that, my sense is, from that foundation, there's probably
some upside, but it's still going to be down year-over-year because of restructuring, primarily.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. That's very helpful to frame it. And last question from me is just on the North
America walk. I guess one thing, that I didn't sort of expect was the negative impact of mix. I mean obviously it was
offset by tremendous pricing. But, can you just explain that a little bit? You said country mix, which I suppose would
be Canada and Mexico. But I was sort of surprised, just given the truck production that that would have been negative.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. And I would say this, the mix results in the fourth quarter, a bit of anomaly. We had
indicated for the year that we were going to be flat to slightly positive on mix in North America; we ended up flat. We
indicated for 2014 that mix was going to be a tailwind and we continue to see that. In the fourth quarter, one, we had
compared to year-over-year, a higher proportion of production allocated to Canada and Mexico, so that had a
headwind.
Number two, in general, passenger cars versus trucks as a percentage of total sales or total production were up
year-over-year. And then the last thing, which really was a significant impact, there was a number of full-size pickups
in route from Mexico to the United States that didn't get pass the pay point or recognition point before the end of the
year. And that created another anomaly in mix. So I would view this as more of an anomaly than a trend.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. So those trucks will get recognized in the first quarter then?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yep.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yep.

<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Hi. Good morning, and congratulations to you both on the increased responsibilities.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Thank you.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thank you.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Another question regarding the North American walk, so what it means for the 2014
outlook. Your cost headwind on year-over-year basis worsened a little bit versus the run rate that we had seen in the
past couple of quarters at about $500 million or so. And you were pointing specifically to it being the materials
included in the new products that you've been launching. So, how should we think about that on the go-forward basis?
Is that the sort of run rate you think about the cost increases or was that a little bit more because of the launches?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well, I think it's time to launches, and when you recognize the price. So talking specifically
about Q4, pricing on new products, primarily the new trucks, but as well, Impala, the Corvette, CTS was favorable,
over $1 billion in pricing on new products. The material cost that goes along with that, so there's new content, right,
features on the vehicles were $600 million to $700 million. So that's a big portion of the cost headwind in Q4. But
net-net, it was accretive to earnings at $300 million to $400 million or 30% to 40% variable margins. And that's the
kind of dynamic you typically have when you launch a new product. So, as I talked about 2014 before similar to 2013,
price was going to be up primarily on new and major, material cost will be up on newly launched products; the net of
those two is positive to EBIT and that trend will continue.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Understood. That's very helpful. And then more strategically maybe for Mary, as you sort
of settling into your role, what are your strong near-term priorities? And specifically if you can highlight, if there is any
sort of directional changes that you would like to implement from the previous management?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Sure. Well, there's no right or left turn. I think our real opportunity is to accelerate. From a
focus perspective, it's keeping a strong customer focus. We got to continue to make sure we've got the right vehicles as
there, with the right quality. We have work to do, but we're on it on building strong brands. We need to continue to
maintain our fortress balance sheet and again, one of our key areas of focus is to operate profitably everywhere we
operate. And we know we have work to do in that. So, we're focused on that. I think one of the opportunities of creating
the President position, and I was very involved in putting that role together. I think there are opportunities across our
regions that we can see more quickly to have I'll say, stronger go-to-market strategies, also to make sure that we're
seizing the opportunities in the product portfolio more quickly and really managing it on a global basis. So, again, it's
really to move forward with the plan, and I think we've got a strong foundation, but we really need to now take
advantage of it.
<Q - Emmanuel Rosner>: Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know you don't host monthly sales
calls in the U.S. any longer, so I thought to ask in this forum, whether you have any comments on the slower SAAR
and softer GM sales in January. Are you able to quantify the impact of weather on your sales and shares? I think some
of the regions in the U.S. where your share is a bit lower like California were maybe less impacted by the winter
storms. It looks like you're maintaining your full-year SAAR outlook. So just maybe comment on how much of January
slowdown industry wide and for GM is related to potential one-off factors?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would say the impact for us in December and January and it looks like, at least if
you're sitting here, so far in February, was really primarily weather related. The SAAR in the month of January ran at
15.1 million units. It was actually down year-over-year.
And we over indexed to the Northeast, North Central Midwest and that's where the bad weather was and I would say by
and large, that had the impact not only in our sales, but also on the SAAR. The good thing is January is the lowest

month of sales from an industry perspective. So you can have a 15 million or 15.1 million SAAR for the month of
January and quickly recover. And we would expect to recover most of the sales that we lost in January, as we go
through the rest of the first quarter, assuming the weather behaves and into this spring selling season. And we're still
holding on our prior view of U.S. industry 16 million to 16.5 million light. So we're going to – obviously, we're going
to continue to monitor our industry and our own inventory levels and make sure that the industry does recover, and if
not, as Mary said earlier, we're going to continue to apply our disciplined approach to managing supply and demand.
But right now, nothing's really changed based on January results.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Now, obviously you're returning a lot of capital to
shareholders with your new dividend. But I'm curious what your thoughts are relative to repurchases. And if you were
to implement the repurchase plan at some point, whether it might make sense to do it sooner rather than later given a
pullback in your shares and your characterization of 2014 as a transition year with much better results to come
suggesting that you may not get another chance to buy your shares so cheaply in the future.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I think back in January, we laid out a pretty clear plan relative to capital allocation
for 2014. One, we're going to continue to support the capital spend that we need to maintain that product pipeline and
continue to enhance that going forward. We got the $1 billion plus of restructuring that we're going to have to fund in
2014. We've got the rest of the Ally International acquisition to fund for $700 million, of the China piece of that
business. We've got this rest of the Series A redemption, which will be a call of $3.9 billion of capital and $2.2 billion
of dividends, $1.8 common and $400 million on Series A. So that's $16 billion of capital allocation. And we think that's
a pretty good plan, and the dividend really made a strong statement around how we plan to return capital to
shareholders. With that said, I think we've proven to be opportunistic in the past if situations arise and we'll monitor
that as we go through the year. But that's fundamentally the plan that we've laid out and that we're executing to this
year.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Great. Thanks. Then just last question, if you could elaborate on the lower costs in Europe.
It looks like overall cost there helped EBIT by $500 million. And I think restructuring was a drag year-over-year. Can
you just remind us of that, so maybe underlying costs improved even more, and just sort of bucket it. Where did that
come from, your distribution venture with PSA, salary, personnel reductions, commodities et cetera? Just trying to –
anything that can help us gauge the sustainability of cost improvement in Europe, particularly as – can you maintain
that as volume returns? Thanks.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Looking specifically at Europe from a cost perspective, overall in the quarter, $0.5
billion purchasing. So, material performance in some of this would be associated with the Gefco Logistics alliance that
we have, or partnership. It was about $100 million in savings. Engineering was $100 million in savings. Other fixed
$100 million and D&A $200 million savings, partially offset by the restructuring. This is not like extrapolate on a run
rate basis going forward. When you look at year-over-year results, obviously a lot of the actions that we've taken over
the past couple of years reduced our overall fixed cost base.
The next big step, once we get past 2014, will be the ongoing savings associated with the closure of Bochum. Call that
$200 million to $250 million a year in savings. But I think another thing that may be underappreciated in some of the
views on Europe. We had that significant impairment that we took in 2012 that fundamentally wrote down most of the
assets and significant savings in D&A. We're investing €4 billion or $5 billion, much of that going into tooling. And
that depreciable base is going to start to increase. And when you think over the next three years or four years,
year-over-year we're going to have increased D&A versus where we were in 2013, as we launch new products.
So, not all of these are run rate savings. I think we've fundamentally driven the business, at least on a fixed cost
perspective, to the right level. We'll continue to look to streamline that, but not material changes, until we get past the
Bochum closure. And then beyond that, as we've indicated from the PSA alliance, a lot of the material savings will
eventuate when we work on the joint programs going forward, which are later over the next two years or three years.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. The last question for today comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Chuck, question on the North America margin path to 10%. I
think when you outlined it initially, it was the path from 7% to 10% was a third product, and then two-thirds cost
savings fixed and material logistics. Just wondering how far along are you now on the fixed cost and logistics? And
perhaps how far along will you be prospectively when we close out 2014?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Think about this in kind of three big tranches, I would suppose. Roughly 100 basis
points of product related, 100 basis points of material and logistics. And 100 basis points of a business model leverage
over time. I think the way, as we refine this from 2011, 2012 to now, the fixed cost efficiencies that we're going to
drive in administration, SG&A and manufacturing fundamentally will offset incremental D&A and incremental
marketing costs. So the way I think about it, a good outcome for us would be flat fixed costs as we continue to grow the
business. So I'd say, as we get through 2014, the first tranche of, or product related margin expansion will have
fundamentally played out. And then, the material and logistics piece will start to kick in with the next generation
programs because that's where you really get an opportunity to drive scale and leverage that scale with global
architectures; and business model leverage as I talked about earlier would be the latter piece in the 2015 and 2016
timeframe.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: That's helpful. And then a question on the 2015 outlook at GMIO consolidated. And I think in
Detroit you specifically refer to improvements driven by product launches and restructuring benefits. Hoping you could
perhaps quantify the restructuring benefits we should expect there in 2015 as well as perhaps what kind of product
refresh rate might you have next year versus this year there.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would just say eliminating the Chev – we don't talk about specific operations
within our regional results but we lose money on Chevrolet Europe, so that will be one of those benefits once we get
past that transition. We're looking to significantly improve our profitability or reduce our losses in Australia. So those
are the two benefits of the actions that we've taken that should help improve. When you think about product launch
cadence, just think about the Middle East. Full size SUVs, full size pickups, full launch of those products in the Middle
East. We have significant work to do in the other markets as well from a launch cadence perspective. We've talked
about the B SUV with Trax, Encore and Mokka. There's more of those coming down the pipeline. And fundamentally
in emerging market, B, C type vehicle, that's going to be very, very important for those markets looking forward. So I
think we talked about 2015 being improved from 2014. We didn't quantify it.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. And just quickly lastly, any updated thoughts on the tax rate for 2014?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: From a book tax perspective it's going to be in the low 30% range. We made a change in
including equity income in the denominator to be similar with Ford and industry practice which should take that to
30%, 31%, 32%, from where we were in 2013.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Perfect. Thanks so much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yep.
