Lowell Singer
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Walt Disney Company's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Our press release was

Good afternoon. I'm very pleased to announce The Walt Disney Company had another incredibly strong quarter with
diluted earnings per share of 23% to $1.27. These results were driven by solid performance across all of our businesses,

and once again demonstrate the strength of our brands and content, and a proven franchise strategy that will drive
long-term value.
And Frozen is a great example of this strategy. On March 13, along with Cinderella, we're premiering a new 7-minute
short, Frozen Fever, bringing back all the beloved characters and voices and introducing a great new song. This time
last year, we were excited about the box office success of Frozen, which went on to win the Oscar and become the
highest-grossing animated feature of all time. Now, a full year after its release, we're seeing the true impact of Frozen
across our entire company.
Overall, retail toy sales in North America were up 4% in 2014, and according to a leading market research firm, much
of the credit for that growth belongs to Frozen, which was both the biggest and fastest-growing toy property of the year.
It's also enormously popular in our Parks and Resorts. It's showcased in the successful mobile game and it gave a
significant boost to our Home Entertainment business for the quarter, along with Maleficent and Marvel's Guardians of
the Galaxy. And Frozen is just one of the 11 franchises at Disney currently driving more than a $1 billion each in
annual retail sales. The strong holiday demand for Frozen as well as Mickey and Minnie, Spiderman, and Avengers led
to the most successful quarter ever for Disney consumer products.
Among media companies, Disney stands out. No one else comes close to our unparalleled collection of strong brands or
our pipeline of great content. And our unprecedented ability to leverage creative success and create value across the
entire company allows us to adapt to emerging challenges, take advantage of new opportunities and, most importantly,
innovate for the future. For example, who else but ESPN could launch the first ever College Football Playoff with such
enormous and immediate success? The two semifinals and the national championship broke previous records to
become the three most watched telecasts in the history of cable television, an achievement that speaks to the
tremendous potential of this annual event and further strengthens ESPN's undisputed position as the number one sports
brand.
Our studio is obviously a key franchise driver and we have a strong slate of upcoming movies. We started the fiscal
year with Disney Animation's Big Hero 6, which has already generated just under $500 million in global box office. It's
also been number one in Japan for five weeks, and is yet to open in some key markets. And Into the Woods has been
both acclaimed by critics and embraced by audiences.
As I said, next month, one of our most beloved and iconic characters comes to life in Disney's first-ever live-action
Cinderella. It's a fresh look at this classic story and it's also a stunningly beautiful film. Later in the spring, we're
looking forward to an original Disney adventure called Tomorrowland starring George Clooney and directed by Brad
Bird. As every Marvel fan knows, the highly anticipated Avengers sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, opens in May. But
when the first trailer was released in November, fans viewed it more than 34 million times in just 24 hours. The speed
and magnitude of that reaction certainly speaks to the incredible excitement around Avengers. Ant-Man debuts in July,
bringing another great character to the screen with Marvel's trademark blend of action, humor and heart.
We're also thrilled to have two original Pixar movies on the way this year. In June, Inside Out will give audiences an
all-access pass into the mind of an 11-year-old girl. And in Thanksgiving, The Good Dinosaur takes a humorous look at
what the world would be like if the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs had actually missed.
Of course, for millions of Star Wars fans, the first 11 months of this year will be an exciting countdown to the
December 18 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. There's a strong emotional connection to this franchise that
transcends geography and generations. And the brief teaser trailer released last November has been viewed more than
123 million times. Having been on the set and seen most of the footage, I can definitely say their excitement is justified.
It marks the beginning of a new era of exceptional Star Wars storytelling as well as an opportunity for continued
growth across all of our businesses.
As a truly global company, we've talked a lot about the importance of developing local content. And the success of the
film PK in India is a perfect example. It's now India's highest-grossing movie of all time with almost $107 million in
global box office. It's also Bollywood's most successful movie ever. Co-produced and released by our Indian
subsidiary, UTV, PK will soon be on 3,500 screens across China.

This is also a dynamic and exciting time for our Parks and Resorts, with another very strong performance in Q1 and
plenty to look forward to, including the spectacular Shanghai Disney Resort. I was in China the week before last and
saw amazing progress. We've just topped off our signature Shanghai Disneyland Hotel and we're nearing completion on
iconic features throughout the park, including the largest castle we've ever built. And we're getting ready to start casting
the hundreds of performers we'll need to entertain our guests. It's thrilling to see Shanghai Disney Resort rapidly
coming to life. The artistry, complexity, the magnitude and the detail, it's all quite astonishing.
As you recall, after we broke ground on this incredible resort, we announced an $800 million expansion, significantly
increasing both the size of the park and the number of attractions available to our guests on opening day. Even with that
expansion, we will complete major construction by the end of this calendar year. And we're planning a spectacular
grand opening in the spring of 2016, which we believe is the optimal time to showcase the full grandeur of this
world-class destination.
Obviously, we're proud of our performance and our record of creating significant value for our company and our
shareholders and we're very optimistic about our future.
And now, I'm going to turn the call over to Jay to take you through the details of our Q1 performance, and then we'll
take questions. Jay?
Jay Rasulo
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2015 is off to a great start as we delivered another strong quarter of
financial results. Earnings per share were up 23%, driven by record revenue, up 9% over last year and 17% growth in
the segment operating income. The results this quarter, which I'll go over in more detail in a moment, are further
evidence that our strategy of investing in high-quality content drives significant long-term value across our businesses.
At Consumer Products, our broad content portfolio fueled incredibly strong financial results. Segment operating
income was up 46% on revenue growth of 22%. Margins expanded by 720 basis points, reflecting strength in both our
Merchandise Licensing and Retail businesses. Growth in Licensing was driven by Frozen and, to a lesser extent,
Disney Channel properties Mickey and Minnie, Spiderman and Avengers, partially offset by higher revenue share with
the studio. On a comparable basis, earned Licensing revenue in the first quarter was up an impressive 23% over last
year, which is particularly notable given the size of our Licensing business. Higher results in our Retail business were
primarily due to the continued demand for Frozen merchandise, which drove double-digit growth in same store sales in
North America, Europe and Japan as well as higher online sales in those regions.
At the studio, the success of our fiscal 2014 theatrical slate continued to drive financial benefits in the first quarter.
Operating income was up 33% over last year due to increases in home entertainment, higher revenue share of consumer
products, and an increase in television distribution. While we were very pleased with the worldwide box office
performance of Big Hero 6, theatrical results were lower in the first quarter, reflecting the record-breaking performance
of Frozen last year.
The increase in home entertainment was primarily driven by higher unit sales of Guardians of the Galaxy, Frozen and
Maleficent compared to Monsters University and The Lone Ranger in Q1 last year. The increase in television
distribution in the first quarter was due to better performance of Q1 titles, including The Avengers, Captain America 2,
and Frozen compared to last year's titles. The studio recognized a higher revenue share in consumer products in the first
quarter due to strong sales of Frozen merchandise.
The Parks and Resorts segment had another great quarter. Operating income was up 20% on revenue growth of 9% due
to continued strength at our domestic operations. Despite lower results at our international operations, total segment
margins were up 190 basis points, with major new initiatives accounting for 80 basis points of the year-over-year
increase. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our recent major investments, that they have contributed
nicely to the robust growth of the domestic-based business. In the first quarter, growth in operating income at our
domestic operations was driven by higher guest spending and attendance at our domestic parks and higher passenger

cruise days at the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by higher costs.
For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks was up 7%, with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort each
setting an all-time attendance record for any quarter. Per capita spending in our domestic parks was up 4% on higher
ticket prices, merchandise, and food and beverage spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was up 8 percentage
points to 89% and per-room spending was up 4%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 3%
compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are up 4%.
Turning to Media Networks, segment revenue was up 11% and operating income was up 3% as higher results at
Broadcasting were partially offset by lower results at Cable, due primarily to higher programming and production costs
at ESPN. Broadcasting operating income increased 35%, driven by higher affiliate revenue and higher program sales,
partially offset by lower ad revenue. The growth in affiliate revenue was due to contractual rate increases as well as
higher rates in new affiliate agreements. Program sales were up in the first quarter due to sales of ABC studio shows,
including Criminal Minds, Scandal and Once Upon a Time. Ad revenue at the network was down in the quarter as a
result of fewer primetime units sold, partially offset by higher rates.
Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at ABC Network is running 10% above upfront levels. Cable segment results were down
modestly, as lower operating income at ESPN was partially offset by increases at worldwide Disney Channels and
ABC Family. Lower results at ESPN were primarily due to higher programming and production costs and, to a lesser
extent, higher marketing costs related to the College Football Playoff and the launch of the SEC Network. This
quarter's results reflect ESPN's continued investment in what is already the deepest and broadest portfolio of sports
rights.
As a result, programming and production expenses were up mid-teens percent during the first quarter due to higher
expenses for NFL rights, and this is the first year of ESPN's new eight-year contract and additional sports rights for the
SEC Network. As we've discussed in the past, we expect growth in cable programming costs to be in the low teens, and
that increase will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect cable programming costs to be up
about 25% in the first half of the fiscal year, and relatively flat in the second half. The cost increase this quarter and
what we expect in Q2 are consistent with the first half and full year outlook. ESPN has long-term agreements in place
for the most valuable sports rights. While the first year of new contracts may result in above-trend cost increases and
adversely affect results in the short term, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow ESPN over the long
term.
During the first quarter, we renewed a major affiliate distribution deal, marking the completion of new agreements with
our 10 largest affiliate partners. Due to contractual provisions in ESPN's new affiliate agreements, ESPN will no longer
defer a portion of its affiliate revenue for most of its contracts, as was previously the case. Domestic cable affiliate
revenue was up 20% in the quarter, reflecting the benefits of new affiliate agreements, lower deferred revenue at ESPN
and the launch of the SEC Network. The 20% increase in affiliate revenue includes a year-over-year benefit of $136
million as ESPN deferred $136 million in affiliate revenue in Q1 last year compared to no deferred affiliate revenue in
Q1 this year.
Adjusting for the timing of deferred revenues at ESPN, domestic cable affiliate revenue was up low double-digits. Ad
revenue at ESPN was down 2% in the first quarter. While total-day ratings were up, ad revenue was lower as ratings for
certain key programs were down compared to last year, partially offset by higher rates. So far this quarter, ESPN ad
sales are pacing up 18% on the strength of the first College Football Playoff, which aired last month. The increase at
worldwide Disney Channels was due to higher affiliate revenue at the domestic channel and higher advertising revenue
at international channels, partially offset by higher programming costs. The increase at ABC Family was driven by
higher affiliate and advertising revenues, reflecting an increase in units sold.
At Interactive, operating income increased 36% in the quarter, driven by higher results from our Global Games
business due to the continued success of Tsum Tsum as well as lower product development costs, partially offset by
lower results at our Console Games business. Lower console game performance reflected higher per-unit costs driven
by Disney Infinity, lower unit sales and higher marketing costs. The decrease in unit sales was driven by lower sales of
catalog titles and Disney Infinity figures, partially offset by higher sales of Disney Infinity starter packs.

We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation by investing for the long-term sustainable growth, while
returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we repurchased 15 million shares for about
$1.3 billion and increased our dividend by 34% from $0.86 per share to $1.15 per share. Fiscal year-to-date, we have
repurchased 50.5 million shares for about $1.4 billion.
Overall, we feel great about this quarter. As we look across our businesses, there is a lot to be excited about in 2015 and
beyond, but we are not taking anything for granted as we recognize we have a lot of work ahead of us. We believe the
strength of our brands, coupled with the integrated nature of our company, can create long-term sustainable value for
our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lowell, and we'll be happy to take your questions
Robert A. Iger
Okay. Thank you, Jay. Operator, we are ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from
Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: I have one for Jay. So, Bob, now that we've seen the Dish Sling offer, we had a
question. We wonder if you have any insight into whether or not the ESPN viewer is also a heavy RSN viewer and if
so, how does that affect the take-up rates of a bundle that doesn't have an RSN but has ESPN?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Michael, we don't really have that much data on one – how much Dish has succeeded in selling
the Sling package to its customers. And we don't have data on the customers themselves right now, so we just don't
know. I will say though, since you've given me the opportunity, that it's all designed to attract consumers or households
that are either cord nevers or cord laters. And we believe that there's an attractiveness to or a real justification for trying
to convince particularly millennials to sign up for some form of subscription TV when they might not have signed up
for any.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: But I guess the question is, are millennials who are sports fans also RSN fans or do you
think it's starter package for them using ESPN?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We just don't have – we don't have data. I think your premise is interesting. That if they want
ESPN, chances are they're RSN viewers and if they're RSN viewers then they probably have the expanded basic
bundle. So we're probably – I'm guessing that, I think I'm not sure what you're inferring here. Maybe what you're
suggested is that there aren't many left. In other words, if they're sports fans then they probably have to be expanded
basic cable because they'd have to get it to get RSN. Is that what you're saying?
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Yes. That's what I'm saying.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: There are not many left. We'll see. We don't have enough data yet.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. And let me move to Jay. Thanks, Bob. And then, Jay, you said occupancy in the
hotels in Disney Parks and Resorts were up to 89%. Going back to history running Parks and Resorts, once you get to
89%, can you talk about what types of pricing levers you see historically? Because I think that's probably the best
number we've seen pre-recession or post-recession.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Michael, I think hoteliers in general will tell you that to try to fill a hotel beyond 89%, 90%, 91% is
extremely difficult. Because it takes – to go beyond that, it takes too many match ups of people who are staying three

nights checking out replaced by five nights, replaced in rapid succession, it becomes quite difficult. So I think that
you're right that when you see occupancy in that kind of range, you're getting close to pretty much a full house. And
those, were historically the numbers at which we started to think about expanded capacity. Of course relative to the
Orlando market there are many – still many, many more hotel rooms off property than they're on – are on property.
And I'm sure they're not experiencing rates of occupancy anything like that.

Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks. I guess on the theme parks, two things, is there any – on MyMagic+, is there
any way you can give us some color or quantify the impact on guest spending and guest flow? That's something you
mentioned that it would improve efficiency? How should we think about the benefits of MyMagic+? And the second
question is – in this ramp-up to Shanghai, can you give us some more color or detail on the financial impact in fiscal
2015 as you spend into the opening of 2016?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, on MyMagic+, Jessica, I'll take this one. First of all, about 10 million guests have already
worn the bands. And so far, what we're hearing from them is overwhelmingly positive basically, the percentage of that
rate is excellent, is significant. So what that basically tells us and what we actually have seen is that it is serving the
purpose that we set out to serve, which is to essentially make the experience more seamless, basically make it easier, to
give people an opportunity to enjoy what they do when they visit Orlando or Walt Disney World even more than they
used to and make them enjoy more of it, meaning experience more. Just to give you for instance, there were days
during the holiday season where we were entertaining 250,000 guests at a time on property.
And when you just consider how many guests you have to flow through the gates, when the park opens in the morning,
the fact that you have a band that enables you to basically walk right in, touch the band to a kiosk and keep going
instead of handing a ticket to a cast member making sure the ticket is right and then going in, that's obviously creating a
huge improvement meaning much quicker entrance into the park. And what this all adds up to is our ability to manage
more people at a time without in any way diminishing guest experience. We did see in the quarter a positive impact to
the bottom line from MyMagic+, just the beginnings of it. We will continue to see more of that. But we do not have
data that we can share with you right now about specific guest spending.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Jessica, this is Jay. Tying in your second question about Shanghai pre-opening costs, I'm not going
to go into the details of what that will be in fiscal 2015. But following on what Bob just said about MyMagic+
becoming accretive this quarter, I will tell you that the increase in contribution from MyMagic+ this year will outweigh
the pre-opening spending on Shanghai Disneyland in our total numbers for fiscal 2015. So that might give you some
sense at least that Shanghai will not be a drag on our earnings in fiscal 2015.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Thanks, Jessica.

Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. So one for Bob and one for Jay as well. Bob, your comments on Sling TV
and not having data on the customers hit squarely on the question I wanted to ask you, which is with the
broadband-only, non-pay TV market growing in size, I would think it becomes ever more interesting for Disney to
address that. And I think the default is to generally support the existing pay TV bundle and highlight Hulu and Sling as
dipping your toe in the water. But I was hoping you would address whether there's a potentially superior business
model for Disney to capture the distribution margin yourself, benefit from dynamic advertising, targeted, of course, and
having that direct relationship with the consumer that you've been seeking.
And I'll just throw Jay's question in there now as well. You've been asked a lot of questions on recent calls about
ESPN's top line. I wanted to refocus on margin. So with the March 2015 quarter, the company's finishing long and
expensive build out of sports rights. It seems like the rest of the decade, you've only got a couple of tough quarters
when the NBA hits. Are we thinking about that correctly, that even if ESPN revenue growth might moderate a bit, cost
growth is also moderating? Any reason to think that margin shouldn't generally be flat to up going forward ex those
NBA quarters? Thanks so much.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Doug, I'll take the first part of the question or your first question since it was directed at me.
And you're right. There are 12 million right now, subscribers of broadband-only service. And that's the subscriber that
we're trying to reach with this Sling, or that Disney's trying to reach with the Sling package. And we believe that it's a
worthwhile experiment or a worthy attempt to try to convince young people or younger people to sign up to cable when
they either wouldn't have signed up for it at all or they might have waited, Michael's comment aside.
There is definitely an opportunity not just for ESPN, but for other Disney brands to openly put products in the
marketplace that reach consumers directly. We think we have that opportunity with Disney branded service. We may
have an opportunity to bring out a Marvel-type product and possibly even Star Wars. But we also are mindful of the
value of the expanded basic bundle to this company and we do not believe that there is any reason for us to attempt to
take out some of this product, particularly ESPN, quickly or right now. In other words, there's time. If we see that the
market dynamics are changing in such a way that it's better for us as a company to take the product out directly and to
not only improve our margins by taking out the middleman but to create a closer relationship with the consumer that
can be mined for other revenue-generating purposes, then we'll do that. But we think if we were to do that now, it
would be somewhat precipitous of us, and there doesn't seem to be any reason to be that way.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Understood. And then Jay?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: In terms of your question on costs, let me tell you this, Doug. First of all, there are only a couple of
bumps left, big upticks, in the ESPN programming cost space over the next – let's call it four years or five years. The
first one we're in the middle of, which is our new NFL deal, the launch of the SEC Network and next quarter, in a
pretty significant way, the BCS College Football Playoffs. And the second big one down the road in 2017 is the
beginning of our new NBA deal. Other than those bumps which as I said, one we're in the middle of, in fact we gave
you some guidance on costs this year, that we would be experiencing very heavy ESPN programming costs in the first
half of the year and much lighter in the second, I can tell you that those numbers look like about 25% in the first half of
the year, and only a 1% – flat to 1% increase in the second half of the year. And then there's 2017 when the NBA deal
sticks in – kicks in. So we've told you many, many times, yeah, these – of course I'm talking about overall cable
margins because that's all we speak of.
Other than that, we've told you many, many times, we don't run ESPN on a margin basis. We won't give you guidance
on what the margins will look like, but we expect the business to continue to grow. We have those two periods of
year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter cost increases and other than that, we still have high expectations for growth in
this business.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thank you very much.

<A - Robert A. Iger>: Doug, thanks for those questions. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Two questions if I can. First, are you seeing the fantastic momentum in the
Consumer Products business continue past the holiday season, and how early can we sort of begin to see a ramp in front
of Star Wars? The second question, sort of a bigger picture question on advertising. [ph] You kind of – (30:53) it looks
like you have a strong start to the year around advertising in ESPN, I guess in part from those very good ratings there. I
guess any broader color you can provide on the advertising market, what you're seeing? I think you had mentioned
earlier, Bob, that you'd see a little bit of flattening out to the share shift to digital. I guess, any color on that.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We can't give you much guidance on Consumer Products right now, except to say that the
business that we saw in January was quite strong. And we clearly were seeing some, I'll call it, even post-holiday
momentum, which is unique in terms of our experience, and I think it speaks to continued demand for our franchises.
We've got a great lineup of product in the marketplace this year when you consider Cinderella, which is in March and
it's a great film, and clearly that's a very important franchise for the company. And then we've got Avengers in May,
and then of course two Pixar films in calendar 2015, although we don't know that any one of them will drive significant
Consumer Products. And then Star Wars as you mentioned, Alexia, the end of the year.
We're not going to predict whether there'll be a ramp-up of buying ahead of Star Wars, except that we believe because
of the strength of the franchise and the buzz around the movie, which we saw certainly was the case when we put the
teaser trailer out just around Christmas time, that we're likely to see some buying in advance of the movie of Consumer
Products.
The other thing that I wanted to mention because we've talked a lot about Frozen, though you didn't mention it, is that
we're coming out on March 13, attached to Cinderella, with a 7-minute Frozen short that's just great, that has the – all
the key players, both the voice talent and the character talent, and the characters and a great song. And we actually
believe it's going to generate some more buzz for Frozen, and that should generate more buying in terms of Consumer
Products. Maybe Jay and I can maybe both address advertising.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yeah.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, Jay, why don't you go ahead...?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: So taking – kind of looking separately at the advertising market for ABC and the advertising market
for Sports, let me start with the latter. The Q2's marketplace seems to be improved on the Sports front. And with the
powerhouse lineup of rights that we have and the sporting events that we have in Q2, particularly around the college
BCS College Football Playoffs, we are going to be able to take advantage of that uptick in the Sports marketplace in
Q2.
On the ABC front, I think that we're not seeing any radical change in the market from what we've talked about in past
quarters. Again, we are very, very happy with the lineup of shows that we've introduced, both on the drama and
comedy side. We have more of those coming into the market. And so we're hopeful that we can also take advantage of
the dollars that are out there on the primetime side.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: And one other thing to add, I spoke to the Head of ESPN Sales this morning. There haven't
been that many new car launches in the last number of months. I know that one of the big automotives just released
results, which were quite positive. We think there's some real potential, particularly for ESPN in the automotive
category, which has not been a hot category. If you watched the Super Bowl there weren't that many automotive spots
in the Super Bowl for instance. But that's an opportunity in the rest of the year for ESPN as car companies roll out more
new models, which they haven't been doing.

<A - Robert A. Iger>: Alexia, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay. Thanks. I have two questions for whoever is willing to answer them. The first one is a
follow up on the last question actually. I was a little surprised at the revenue, or the advertising revenue declines at
ABC in that this is one of the most successful seasons to date that I can remember for ABC. 18 to 49 I think you are flat
to marginally up. You're really sort of outperforming the rest of the industry. And I would think with a modicum of
pricing you would have had stronger growth. So maybe looking for a little bit more color there. And the second
question is. Jay, can you give us the actual change year-over-year in total sub-count at either ESPN or what you'd call
the expanded basic bundle? Thanks very much.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Okay. Thank you, David. Let me start with the advertising question. So to recap, scatter pricing was
up in the market and overall ad sales, as you said, were down as ABC sold fewer units this year compared to last year.
And the lower unit sales can be attributed to a number of factors and I think a combination of those factors had an
impact on this quarter, making the advertising sales numbers lower. And those are related to the length of the show,
how the shows are written, the number of promotional spots we put in the shows as opposed to sold spots, the number
of ads we insert into the programs, and how we use inventory in the quarter to manage our make good liability. And
those all combined to deliver, notwithstanding the relative ratings we had this season to slightly depress our advertising
revenue. I think ABC is extremely well positioned this year relative to its peers? We expect a tightening of inventory as
the year progresses and I think we are well positioned to take advantage of the market conditions, hopefully as they
improve in the course of the year. On the subscriber side, I'm not going to give you any help there. We don't talk about
subscribers. We can't give you any guidance there. So I'm sorry about that.
<Q - David Bank>: Can't blame me for trying. Thanks very much, guys.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: David, it was a good effort. Thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
We have Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: All right. Thanks. Let me take an effort at looking little longer range at the Parks, if I may. So as
the fruits of the slate of Parks investments projects are now, I think successfully rolling in and Shanghai's grand
openings in sight. I wonder if you're at a stage where you're ready to share with us anything on your thinking about the
future horizon beyond that? I know you won't announce any specifics, but just generally. Are there types of
opportunities that you could generalize that you find particularly interesting at the top of your list? Or are there certain
things that you considered and rejected? How should investors think about your appetite to continue expanding your
Parks program?
And then the second follow up, Jay, if you could just remind us how you're thinking about leverage with all the growth
and EBITDA and cash flow. I don't think you've issued much debt lately. So just remind us how you think about
leverage as you move through the year? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: So in terms of the Parks, I think what you have to consider is that we're in construction to build
a sizable Avatar presence and Avatar land at Animal Kingdom in Florida that's slated to open sometime in 2017. We
have a fair amount of design and development work going on right now to greatly increase – this is no surprise, Star
Wars presence in multiple locations around the world. We'll have more details probably about that later on in 2015. The
plans are ambitious, and so it's going to take some time for them to actually be built and open. But let's just say that
we've got big plans for it and huge belief in that franchise as a parks experience.

I think it's also likely that you'll see expansion at Hong Kong and at Shanghai. Obviously, Shanghai has yet to open. So
that maybe it would sound somewhat premature but the size of the land that we have there, the expansion opportunities
in a market that we think is just perfect for a Disneyland experience suggests that once we open, it's just the beginning
in terms variety of offerings that we'll be able to provide.
And then, of course, to – well the franchise we talked about earlier which is Frozen. But I think that actually says a lot
about other franchises, too. There are clearly more opportunities to mine some of these great franchises across the
Parks. And when you go to Imagineering there's an embarrassment of riches so to speak in terms of stories and
characters that the Imagineers have to draw from to create great park experiences. And I think one of the things that
we've – we're seeing now in our Parks and one of the reasons why the results were so strong across-the-board,
Christmas time, is that there is definitely a halo effect that consumers have for Disney based on all of these franchises.
And it's not just what exists in the Parks. I think you have to include Marvel and you have to include Star Wars as well.
The brand strength has never been stronger. The array of franchise has never been greater. We've said we've got 11
franchises that are going to generate $1 billion this year in retail sales. And that just, I think, results in, in enthusiasm
for the brand and an enthusiasm for the park experience that we provide that gives us not only ample opportunities to
create from all of that but for consumers to basically engage with us in more ways, in more places than ever before.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Todd, in terms of the balance sheet, and our overall perspective on leverage, I guess I'll say that
we've been – we're very happy with our balance sheet. We're very happy with our strong rating in the debt markets at
all three agencies. And it really is a strategic asset for the company whether you look at our average cost of debt, the
amount of subscription we get to any debt issuance we put out, the rates at which we're able to manage our working
capital through commercial paper. And, of course, the ease with which we can – we have thought about and executed
on acquisitions without a concern about the impact – the impact of those transactions and potential transactions on our
rating and on our – having the debt capacity to do that.
So I think in general, I don't expect – you shouldn't expect a radical change in that strategy. It doesn't mean we won't be
in the debt markets this year. But I would expect that you'll continue to see a balance sheet that reflects kind of the
strategic use of not being – strategic positioning of not being overleveraged on the operation of our company and our
ability to go to the Capital Markets.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: That's very helpful. Thank you, both.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You're welcome.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Todd, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Ben Swinburne.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Two questions for either of you. The first one on Consumer Products. Can you
help put Frozen into context for us now that you have a calendar year behind you including the holidays where you had
the inventory where you wanted to? I think years ago, we thought Cars was the high watermark in terms of annual
revenue contribution. But can you tell us whether Frozen has now exceeded that and if you believe this is sort of a
recurring and growing, licensing contributor year in, year out irrespective whether there's film product? Any comment
on the margins too. I think your incremental margins at CP were in the almost 80% range. So any color on profitability
would be really helpful. And then I just wanted to make sure that the cable guidance was reconfirmed. The high single
digit OI guidance, Jay, if you just could confirm that, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Okay. Let's start with your Consumer Products question. So look, I don't think that we can
underestimate the impact that Frozen has had across our company in all of our businesses. But I don't think it would be
right to take from that the implication that even our Consumer Products business was overly dominated by the Frozen
franchise this quarter.

You asked whether we think Frozen has – to put words in your mouth, do we think Frozen has legs? We absolutely
believe that this is the beginning of a long-term franchise for the company, and that will reflect itself in all of our
divisions, Consumer Products certainly not the least of which. But even if you look at the last quarter, many other
franchises were contributors to the success of the Consumer Products division. By the way, not the least of which was
Mickey and Minnie, the Disney Channel franchises and we like what Frozen delivered but it's not – it's certainly not the
one and only for us.
We have 11 franchises that now retail at over a $1 billion as of the last year. So our Consumer Products business really
has a lot of breadth in addition to depth. And we're only beginning this year to see what The Avengers and overall
Marvel franchises are going to deliver, which has also been a huge contributor. And I think if you look down the road,
you can imagine that we'll be adding Star Wars up to that pantheon in a very, very significant way with the release of
that film.
So it's a broad-based business. And I think that Frozen will continue to play a big part in it. But I wouldn't make the
mistake of thinking that it is to say dominant force that you have to worry about repeating year-on-year in the
Consumer Products business.
In terms of margin, obviously the licensing business is incredibly highly leveraged, but I think the real margin story for
this past quarter has been the Disney Stores business, where we saw increases both in the physical brick and mortar
stores, in all of the three regions we operate, which is Japan, Europe and North America as well as the online business
in those three regions. So we've – I would venture to say and I think I'm right about this, we had historic margins in that
business this past quarter. And it was a big contributor to the margin story for Consumer Products.
Your second question was about...
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: High single-digits, yeah.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: OI growth guidance for domestic cable? And I'm only going to repeat – we don't give
quarter-to-quarter or annual guidance on that. But I'm going to reassert what we said back in April last year at our
Investor Day that fiscal 2013 to 2016 we are expecting high single-digit growth in cable OI and we still are on target to
achieve that.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You're welcome.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Thanks for the questions, Ben. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Two very quick ones. You mentioned $1.3 billion of buybacks in the quarter and $1.4
billion fiscal year-to-date. Was there anything that would cause you to be out of the market? Or in other words, if you
are in our shoes, do you think we should be moderating our buyback for the quarter? And then second, we've been
surprised at the strength in international inbound flights into the Orlando airport, particularly in light of the stronger
U.S. dollar. Do you guys have any hypothesis for why international visitors would be up so much? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Okay. On buy-back, I guess I'll say this. I'm not going to really give you much guidance on this, but
we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as we have been through dividends and buy-backs. You know
this year we announced a very significant increase in our dividend of 34% bringing it up to $1.15. And that happened in
this quarter. And I wouldn't focus too much on the first couple of weeks of this fiscal quarter as an indicator or any kind
of guidance as to where we will wind up on the entire fiscal year relative to buy-backs. So I don't have any big news for
you. Our dividend is almost $2 billion that we paid out in quarter two. And I think you have to look at return to
shareholders – capital return to shareholders in aggregate, which is the way we think about it.

Your second question on arrivals, so I don't think that we know or have seen an impact on international arrivals due to
exchange rates. I've said for many, many quarters, the overall range of our international business is between 18% and
22% of total attendance at our domestic parks. Q1 is usually on the low end of that range. It was again on the low end
of that range this year. And I think that if there's going be an effect of the varying exchange rates around the world, it'll
take a while, and if those exchange rates affect the economies from which our international business is sourced, we
might see an impact. But as of yet we have not seen that, and actually quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year, there wasn't a
huge change in our international business between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thank you very much.

Operator
Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks very much. I have one question for Jay first and then one for Bob. Jay, on the
broadcasting segment, this has been four straight quarters of operating income growth in addition to the ratings
resurgence at ABC. Presumably retrans and affiliate comp are a big part of that growth, so I wonder if you would help
us with the shape of the trajectory of retrans and reverse comp over the next two years or three years, and maybe even
as part of that give us an update as to what you are annualizing on that, either in 2015 or on an annual basis?
And then for Bob, just on acquisitions, when Disney first made the acquisition of Maker Studios, you said that you saw
it first and foremost as a distribution platform. And at a high level I was just wondering if you could give us your
thoughts on vertical integration – or your updated thoughts – particularly vertical integration in digital? How does a
more vertically integrated acquisition like Maker compare strategically for you to more horizontal acquisition in
content, like Lucas or Marvel? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Okay. Let me start with your Broadcast question. We have said in the past that we expected by
fiscal 2015 to be in the $400 million to $500 million range in terms of retrans. Well, it's 2015 and we're there – we will
be there comfortably, but I'm not going to update any further than that.
On the overall Broadcast business, I think that we've been saying for many, many years that our play in this business is
to be the creator and owner of great shows, and those shows pay back in the aftermarket when we sell them either to
other networks into syndication or increasingly sell them to other distributors, and that's what you're seeing in our
Broadcast results this quarter. It is exactly strategically where we want to be in this business, and the fact that we have
shows on the network today that are being incredibly well-received, have legs and are rating well, is a very good
indication for where we can be in this business.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: To respond to the question about vertical versus horizontal acquisitions and Maker. First of all,
Maker's results in terms of consumption, number of videos streamed since the time that we bought them, has been up
substantially, just huge growth. And what that tells us is really what our instinct was when we bought them, and that is
that we were really interested and compelled by substantial increase in consumption of short-form video on digital
platforms. We had consumption of short-form video on our own digital platforms like espn.com, disney.com, ABC, but
we didn't have the kind of traction or the kind of traffic that Maker had, and we thought this would be a great
opportunity for us to distribute much more effectively in the short-form – form, in short-form.
It also was an entree into a world of creativity that we thought we ought to – we could tap into, particularly when we
allow those that are creating in that space access to our franchises and our brands, so it was kind of a combination of
things. It was just distribution expertise that we did not have as much as we thought we should, and certainly,
production and creative expertise that we thought we could use. And it was, I think a unique acquisition opportunity for
us again given all the growth in short-form consumption. I don't think it necessarily suggests a direction in terms of

where we're heading as a company overall. The power of this company largely is in its brands, and storytelling and the
creativity that runs across platforms and is often distributed by third parties whether they're movie theater owners, big
box retailers or MVPDs to name a few, or new platforms like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu.
So I think you'll – the primary thrust of the company is going to continue to be investing in its brands and its creativity
and selling as broadly as we possibly can. But we like being in new space as well. And one last thing, because I think
this is going to loom larger and larger in terms of Disney's future and we've touched upon it a little bit earlier today, is
that I think this company needs to focus more on creating a tighter or closer relationship to its customers for a variety of
reasons. Not only to mine customer data and usage and obviously create revenue opportunities from that, but to provide
customers with experiences that they want and demand basically to be even more user friendly, more customizable,
more personalized. That's really important in terms of the long-term future of this company. And you'll see in various
initiatives that are aimed at achieving just that.

today.
Operator
We have David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead
<Q - David W. Miller>: Yeah, hey, guys. Congratulations on the stellar results. Just a couple offbeat questions. I guess
I'm going last here, so a few of the obvious questions were taken. Bob, just first of all, I'm surprised you didn't call out
the delay in Shanghai. I guess you can't really call it a delay. Is the sort of postponement of the opening just due to –
you want to open this thing kind of coinciding with the Chinese Lunar New Year in the spring? Or were there other
nuances? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks a lot.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: When we signed the contract for Shanghai and when we broke ground, we said publicly that we
were targeting the end of 2015 as an opening date. Targeting, which I think is important. We obviously were embarking
on a very large fairly complicated project, one of the largest we've ever engaged in, probably one of the largest ever in
China. After we opened, we decided that the opportunity existed in China and specifically in Shanghai to build
something even bigger with more attractions and basically more capacity so that we could handle more guests. And so
not only did we design but we agreed with our partners to build approximately $800 million more in capacity, which
obviously added to the scale of what we're building.
So now that we are well into construction, we released a great photo today of the Disneyland Hotel, which gives you an
idea how far along we are. We believe that targeting the – not the spring actually. It's more than targeting. We plan to
open in the spring of 2016 is much more opportune for us, given the size of what we are doing, what we are building
and the complexity of it. And given the fact that the weather is better in the spring, as you said David, it is after the
Chinese New Year where we expect there'll be huge demand and it's a bit easier to open after that than right before it. I
think I might have misspoken. I meant after we broke ground we decided...
<Q - David W. Miller>: Right.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: ...that we'd build larger, not after we opened. And so we've got a great project unfolding. I was
there the week before last, and every time I go I'm just amazed at the scale of it and the variety and the uniqueness of
this. And I continue to believe heavily in the opportunity that we've got to bring a great Disneyland experience to the
most populous country in the world. And my enthusiasm has only grown for it but because we're building something
bigger, and we like spring, versus winter, then the spring of 2016 it is. And we probably will be more specific about an
opening date, I'm guessing some time the middle of this year.
<Q - David W. Miller>: Okay. And just a brief question on Inside Out. And there is just some mild confusion here –
albeit, not that much confusion – but was Inside Out, and I'm just asking out of just personal curiosity, was Inside Out
