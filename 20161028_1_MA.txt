MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day. My name is Jack and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone
to the Mastercard Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background
noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the call over to Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, Jack. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for a discussion about our third quarter 2016
financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina
Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd also like to welcome Warren Kneeshaw, my successor, to his first
Mastercard earnings call. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to
get into the queue for the Q&A session. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask a question. Even if you think
you have already dialed in to the queue for Q&A, you will need to register again following our prepared comments.
This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations
section of our website, Mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC
earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. Both the release and the slide deck

include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents.
We've also added a table at the end of both documents, which provides additional information about the impact of
Article 8 of the EU's recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Since we are no
longer charging de minimis fees on co-badged domestic volume that doesn't use our network in markets such as France,
this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics. We saw the partial impact of this in the second
quarter and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. The table adjusts growth rates for the impact by eliminating the
related co-badged volume in prior periods so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on
the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates.
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include
some forward-looking statements about Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially
from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are
summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Ajay.
Ajay Banga
Thank you, Barbara, and, Barbara, thank you once again for your outstanding decade of work for us. And, Warren,
welcome to the company. Good morning, everybody. Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased
with our strong results this quarter. As you've seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of
19% after excluding last year's special item, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
Our perspective of the global economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter.
You have all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We continue to believe, like we said in the previous
quarter, that the U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment and wages holding firm, of
course, unless something unforeseen happens starting out of the upcoming elections. But basically, the U.S. is in a
steady growth path. Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery led by Germany as economic
sentiment holds steady, unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and its impact
on Europe remain a concern, it's going to take a few years to understand the full implications.
Again, you saw the British GDP report, which kind of sees it holding steady. Interestingly, underlying UK consumer
demand remains stable. And, in fact, as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the UK is picking up over this
last quarter.
In Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply, and you all know the
concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively
strong growth trajectory. In Latin America, Brazil, even though it's expected to remain in a recession for the near
future, seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully
improve economic conditions for the next 6 months to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is
deepening.
In Mexico, the economy continues to expand but with increasing dependence and consumer spending growth. So in
sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we continue to grow. We're seeing double digit
volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals as we execute against our
long-term strategy.
So now, let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. The first step is now
complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the UK regulator to perform the antitrust
review. The second step, which will be led by the UK regulator, generally has two phases. We are hopeful to complete
the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase.
We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017. So before we go to our
business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all ask us about from time to

time. So starting with the United States, as you know, the merchant litigation is now back in the Brooklyn Court.
In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments on the appointment of class counsel for merchants.
Now once the court appoints that counsel, we expect the litigation to proceed, and we intend to resume the settlement
negotiations. But given its complexity, we think this process will take some years to resolve. In the UK, as many of you
know, a proposed class action was filed in September on behalf of UK consumers seeking damages related to
interchange fees. The court will set out the timeline for the case soon. We've had good experience addressing similar
claims in the United States, and we believe strongly that, in fact, far from being harmed by interchange, UK consumers
have, in fact, benefited significantly.
Finally, following legal submissions and an oral hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversation with the
European Commission to find a resolution to the 2015 case around our interchange rates and interregional cross-border
transactions, and the central acquiring rules.
So now moving on to some of our recent business activity, you heard a great deal of all of this from us at the recent
Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see firsthand, a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling
out, so I'm going to stick to very few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer
business, building around recent momentum in debit. We're actually excited to highlight two new deals that deepen and
strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. bank and Regions Bank, which have now been expanded to include
preferred Mastercard routing for their PIN debit businesses. Outside of the U.S., we're actually pleased to have flipped
a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples. In Europe we are building on the long-term debit deal we announced last
year in Italy with Poste Italiane. We are now expanding our partnership and converting a significant portion of their
prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services such as Advisors to help drive their financial
inclusion and innovation agendas. Another example with Denizbank, which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to
flip their credit business, which also leverages Advisors.
Now, the domestic opportunity in China. We are awaiting a more detailed interpretation of the final PBOC regulations,
particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these will impact our implementation of on-soil
switching, while protecting our systems and our data. We hope these will be available over the next couple of months.
We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market.
In the meanwhile, we continue to make progress in China by building a number of new deals with banks, including
HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC, and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new
single-branded cards targeted at the country's growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.
We highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including fleet card and WEX, both of whom are
driving B2B and cross-border spend in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added two new
deals in Europe, one with Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where
Mastercard is the exclusive card provider. The other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our
relationship within their corporate banking business.
So now, on to digital strategy; and over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we have given
you a number of updates on the significant progress we are making with Masterpass. And just to recall, we are taking
two parallel paths. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto enroll cardholders through
their online banking app and helps to drive scale for us by keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships.
We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months.
The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in-app,
online or in-store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous. So today, I'll discuss a couple
of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using Masterpass with our partners around the
world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodacom, two telecom providers who by the way, put together,
have a market share of about 70%, to allow their customers to securely pay for airtime minutes from their mobile
device using Masterpass.

Prior to this, subscribers would either have to stand in long lines at a third party service location or go to an ATM to
transfer funds to the telecom provider, and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since its launch, more than 4.5
million users have registered for the service and airtime distribution costs for the mobile network operators have been
reduced by as much as 15%.
Another example, in Europe we've partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country to integrate
Masterpass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants in the transit space and to modernize mobile
ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would have had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launch in
early 2015, users have grown significantly and Masterpass now accounts for nearly 8% of all Czech Railways
transactions. Both of these examples I hope demonstrate to you that through Masterpass, we're not just enabling digital
payments, we're actually trying to create a better consumer experience.
From an acceptance standpoint, Masterpass continues to grow. It's now available in more than 300,000 merchants
online and in-app, as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that allow contactless payments. We are
continuing to add new merchants and, for example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in
Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week, we signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ecobank Group to
loan us Masterpass QR, a mobile person-to-person merchant service – sorry, a mobile person-to-merchant service
across 33 African countries. This solution will be integrated with their mobile banking platform and will enable users to
safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small and medium
enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a
traditional POS terminal.
So, our Masterpass partner-centric approach that you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at
delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefits issuers, digital players and merchants. Earlier this week, we
highlighted that issuers like Capital One, who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further
integrating Masterpass into their Wallet offering. Users of the Capital One Wallet can now shop online and in-app, and
check out using their same MDES tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the
world where Masterpass is accepted.
Similarly, at Money20/20, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships. And starting sometime
early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Microsoft Wallet will also enable the same online and in-app consumer
experience that I just mentioned. And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this. Since they've already integrated
Masterpass, there's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who
already use these other wallet services or will in the future. Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend
their reach globally. We actually recently helped Android Pay move into Poland, in fact, helped Apple Pay expand into
Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with Mastercard.
Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber, as well as Stripe and Lyft at Investor Day, and
how they are leveraging the Mastercard Send platform to make convenient and secure payments to drivers, delivery
people, and others. We just added Allstate, who will leverage Mastercard Send to make claims payments to their
customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics.
Martina?
Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Starting with page three, you see there are minimal differences this quarter
between non-GAAP for reported and currency neutral growth rates. These figures exclude the impact of a special item
related to the termination of the U.S. defined pension plan taken last year. As you can see from our numbers, we have
delivered another strong quarter.

Here are a few highlights. Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continued to invest in
our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating
performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25, we
have $1.8 billion remaining under our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We
ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.
So let's turn to page four, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara
mentioned, the growth rates I am quoting are adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations.
Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppts from the prior
quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6%, respectively. As expected,
this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices.
And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 ppt versus last quarter due
to slightly lower growth in each region. First quarter volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 ppt higher
than the 10% we saw in the second quarter, and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.
Let me turn here to page five, and here, you see processed transactions grew 18% globally to $14.5 billion, which is a
4-ppt increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards
grew 6%, with 2.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.
Let's turn to page six for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I
call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency neutral basis. The net revenue growth of 14%, we saw a
strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and
incentives grew 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line
items on a currency neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth.
Cross-border volume fees grew 15%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3-ppt gap is due to some pricing
actions partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity.
Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with processed transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew
23%, predominantly driven by Advisors, safety and security, and loyalty.
Moving to page seven, you can see that excluding last year's special items, total operating expenses increased 12% in
the quarter, of which more than 2 ppt is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet
remeasurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continued to invest in
digital, services and geographic expansion, as well as higher data processing costs in line with our transaction growth
and Russian domestic processing costs to NSPK.
Turning to slide eight, let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3
except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global
growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter with double digit growth in each region
outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 3%, down more than 3 ppt from the third quarter, with the
same growth in credit programs but lower growth in debit programs primarily due to the deconversion I mentioned
earlier.
Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. Gas did not have an impact on our October growth
rate. Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, and that's actually up 1 ppt from the third quarter with higher
growth in each region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 17%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third
quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was similar to Q3, while the U.S. growth was down 3 ppt. And
with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally, up almost 1 ppt from the third quarter with faster growth
in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.
Now looking at the full-year 2016, there is really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at
Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double digits on a currency neutral
basis. When you model on an as-reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there
would be about a 1-ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line. This is less of a headwind than what we

said in September given the continued moderation of exchange rates.
Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total
operating expense growth in the low double digit range for our as reported results excluding special items. On a
currency neutral basis, we continue to expect low double digit growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect to see
positive operating leverage for the year. And you should now assume a 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28%
to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017
outlook until our year-end call in January.
Now, let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?
Barbara L. Gasper
Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people as
possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Jack?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open.
<Q - James Schneider>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe kind of
give us an update on the B2B payment space and the opportunity you see there. And specifically, can you talk about
how [ph] Zell (24:37) and Mastercard Send fit into the strategy for you?
<A - Ajay Banga>: Sure, sure. I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth,
and you just let me talk a little about Fleetcor and WEX and virtual cards, and give you the example of UBS and Credit
Suisse. But what we're basically seeing in addition to the transaction side of this is we're seeing an adoption of some of
our products: Smart Data, which is our reporting and reconciliation tool, as well as InControl, which is a virtual card
system, for commercial payments is kind of getting well-embedded.
I'm also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card users. Technology providers embed
commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms, and payment aggregators and verticals such as
construction insurance. You see these guys coming into play as well. So there's a series of things we are doing in the
B2B space, in the T&E space, in the SME space that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts.
The Mastercard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment service that facilitates
the delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers, both domestically and internationally. If we take a
single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you could be a merchant, you could be a government, a
non-profit, an issuer, some other sender, and you can send money to consumers, whether it be banked or unbanked,
most importantly, whether they're domestic or overseas as well. And that's kind of what we're trying to do here.
Because in the overseas markets, we combined with a JV that we have launched some time ago called HomeSend – not
to be confused with Mastercard Send, there's just internal Mastercard confusion, I don't want you to get confused – and
HomeSend is a unique asset for cross-border payment that kind of expands our reach to billions of bank accounts
across more than 70 markets through their phone numbers and systems. And so the combination of this ability to move
money to any bank account in the U.S. through Mastercard Send, whether it's got a Visa debit card or a Mastercard
debit card at the front end of the account, combined with HomeSend, which can connect to these billions of bank
accounts across 70 markets using phone systems, that's what we're up to.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Great growth here. I was wondering if you can maybe give us
your perspective on why your growth rate, on a reported or constant currency basis, has been growing at such a big
premium to Visa. Any color there? Because obviously, they've been boarding a lot of new clients, so I'm surprised by
the magnitude of the premium.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Well, look, Tien-Tsin, you know that we are extremely disciplined when we go to
market and when we actually work with clients and the kind of agreements that we are striking. And as we have
discussed at Investor Day, we are not just doing a core product kind of deal where we look at a credit product or a debit
product or a prepaid product or a commercial product, but we are also adding quite a lot of our services to that kind of
agreement. And when you look at the growth rate in the other revenue line items, where most of these services are
actually residing, that's where you're seeing the extra juice coming out from these kind of agreements. So I would say
between the discipline that we have and the services, the differentiated services that we can deliver to our clients, you
can actually see that coming through.
<A - Ajay Banga>: I think you should, Tien-Tsin, think about the fact that with – both our companies are winning
clients around the world from each other, but also the growth of geographic expansion, new issuers, new types of
issuers coming into the system. It's not my impression that a great deal of growth comes from either of us by getting a
client from each other. And I would rather focus on an opportunity that exists in this industry to grow where there is so
much more to do.
Remember, 85% of the world's retail transactions are still in cash and check. And that's – I think our focus is giving us
the benefit of thinking that through in a way that's allowing us to build assets and capabilities to aim for the bigger pie
and keep assets over a period of quarters. There will be quarters when we do better, I'm sure there will be quarters
when somebody else does better, and I'm fine with that. I'm more focused on that we're executing for the next few
years.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Appreciate that. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Hey, guys. Just wanted to build on Tien-Tsin's question. Obviously, you've got 14%
constant currency growth year to date, if I'm not mistaken, but still guiding to low double digits. So just doing the math
on Q4 would imply a lot of decel. Is there some rebate timing to consider or what other factors should we be building
into the Q4 model? And does this put you kind of at high end of low double digits at the risk of putting too fine a point
on it?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Jason, nice try. And so – no, it's still at the low double digits. But what you have to
consider for the fourth quarter – and you're absolutely right, year to date, it's 14%. Actually, this is the third quarter this
year that we're producing a 14% net revenue growth rate and we're obviously extremely pleased with that. But, yeah,
you will see a slowdown in the fourth quarter, and you have to consider two factors. One, you have the USAA roll-off,
and that will be pretty much complete by the end of the year from what we understand. So, of course, that's a bit more
of an acceleration than what we had thought before earlier this year.
And secondly, on the rebates and incentives side, it is normal for us in the fourth quarter, just before year-end, to sign a
whole bunch of new agreements and renewing agreements. It's actually nothing different than what we've seen in prior
years, but you should expect that there will be more rebates and incentives coming in, in the fourth quarter. Both of
these factors will weigh down on net revenues.

Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Ajay, it looks like cross-border is continuing to tick up here. Could you talk a little bit about
the comment on the commercial improvement in Europe? Is that just sort of organic or are you seeing market share
gains? And then also what are you seeing in terms of outbound China? I know some of your competitors have talked
about some stabilization or improvement.
<A - Ajay Banga>: So the first part – the second part, which is that [indiscernible] (31:41) transactional piece of
information on outbound China. I think you'll find growth through certain parts of the world but not to others. It's not
coming into the U.S. and Europe as it used to. It's actually going much more to the Asian markets, so Australia, to
Japan, to those parts of the world. That's actually similar to what I may have said at Investor Day, but I don't fully recall
if that question came up. But that's kind of what we're seeing on the China part of it.
The cross-border growth in Europe – remember, we pointed out commercial in Europe because that's the one thing
that's different from prior quarters. It's not as though that's the largest reason for our growth. So you've got to take it in
context. It's the one thing that's different, and in that, yes, we are seeing the activation of a bunch of programs in
commercial in Europe that we have signed some deals earlier that come on board, there's a series of activations going
on, but our cross-border growth is built off really blocking and tackling on a series of portfolios around the world
where our account teams engage with the issuers and the merchant community to look at how to work on cross-border
opportunities. And this is not a new thing. I think I can recall this for years now. It probably was being done before I
even showed up seven years ago, and I think it's just a series of focus items in Mastercard around cross-border.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Thanks, guys. Great results. I just wanted to question on the thought process around incentive
growths. We've had now, I think, two years of around 20% incentives and rebates growth, and obviously outpacing
gross revenues. Obviously, there's been a lot of deals and now, I think, Martina, you just mentioned Q4 probably has a
step-up also. Just can you give us a little thought process around what's happening in the industry around – is it
competitive dynamics? Or – and then really, with SunTrust and others, should we expect another type of year like that
going forward? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Hello, Darrin. I don't think you're – for the last couple of years, you're really seeing
nothing – we have not seen anything different than what we've seen in the last couple of years. Just a reminder,
everybody, in 2015 we had a step-up in rebates and incentives given that we signed some fairly mega agreements.
Right? We signed an agreement with one customer for 10 years, another agreement with another customer for 20 years,
and so we did talk in 2015 that we had to step up the incentives.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Right.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: The accounting was a little bit different. So, in the early part of the years, we are
actually amortizing more of those incentives. You see that second year, so the 2016 number and it's going to be with us
in 2017, et cetera, you see the same kind of step-up.
In addition to that, when you look at our results this year, you do see some better revenue rates coming in on the growth
side. You will see some more contra being draft with that. What's happening in the fourth quarter from a renewal, as
well as from new agreements, in terms of what I'm seeing from our business people, we're seeing nothing different in
terms of how we are actually signing the agreements. It's just the normal activity and the normal terms and conditions,
by the way, that we're seeing in the fourth quarter

<A - Ajay Banga>: Remember, we actually incent issuers to give us a share of their wallet, and that's built into this
thinking. So if they grow well in numbers, in absolute numbers, and they also grow well...
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Right.
<A - Ajay Banga>: ... in giving us some share, they actually get a higher percentage discount. And so, this is actually
good for [indiscernible] (35:15). And it's built in many ways to help with that.

Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thanks. Good morning. Martina, when I look at the revenue yields for domestic assessments
in cross-borders, those accelerated some, and then transaction processing fees kind of decelerated some. I know you
mentioned last call that there were some anniversarying of fee increases, but how should we think about those – the
trajectory of those yields going forward?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So on the domestic assessment yields, we typically say that they will be trending down
over time simply because of what we – we've been saying that when you sign larger agreements and you're incenting
customers, to be actually – being given more volumes to you, that should be happening. So you would have to factor
the contra into account. If you just look at the domestic assessment for this quarter and for the prior quarters, you have
a little bit of a change in mix coming in.
Remember, we've been talking a number of times that when you go and do work in a number of Asian countries,
African countries, Russia, Venezuela, et cetera, that those come typically with lower yields. And it depends which
quarter, which part of the GDV is growing at which country in terms of how the mix is coming in. And in this quarter,
we had a little bit better mix coming in. So that's all on domestic yield. What was your second question?
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: No, I guess even the cross-border number on an adjusted basis was up a little bit. Does that
just continue? And then the USAA impact, I mean, the numbers you quoted, is that – does that include all of it rolling
off or is there an additional drag that we should expect?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, on the cross-border side, we did have a little bit of pricing action in that, and that
will be anniversarying very soon. And on the USAA side, yeah, I mean, we believe that our comments are
comprehensively assuming that USAA is rolling off by the end of the year. Now, just – you're going to have to take
into account that because this happened all this year, that you're going to have a knock on impact to the growth rates in
2017.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about Europe. Thanks for the
disclosure on the co-badged transactions. But does that mean, if we exclude these transactions that had very low
revenue yields, that your prior commentary on European revenue yields being in the high teens would actually be in the
20s if you exclude these transactions? And then if you can just summarize, for PSP2 and all the changes that are taking
place in Europe, can you summarize like the fundamental impact on your business? It seems to be positive at this point,
and if it is, give us a little color on why. Thanks.

<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So on the European revenue yield, first of all, just to make sure that everybody
understands where our European revenue yield is, for our – Chris, can you please put us on mute? Chris, can you put us
on mute, please?
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Sorry, yes.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Thank you.
<A - Ajay Banga>: That sounds pretty exciting wherever you are.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: What we have said in the past, our global yield of around 21 basis points, and we
talked about our competitors' yields because the information was out there, they're kind of in the 10 basis points, 9 basis
points, and we are somewhere in between. That revenue yield will not change whatsoever by this particular change in
terms of not charging de minimis fees on these co-badged transactions. There will be absolutely no impact to that. So
you should not be assuming that our yield on GDV in Europe is changing. It is not.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: And the second question?
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: PSP2.
<A - Ajay Banga>: Oh, PSP2. Okay. So, PSP2, the first thing we did was to – the most important thing we did was to
enable access to the consumer bank accounts through a series of what they call PSPs, payment system providers. I think
that's going to lead to a series of some more competition, more innovation, and it's something we should expect to
happen over the next few years. One thing is for sure, ACH will become even more relevant in the PSP2 environment,
and you know that we have talked about that when we talked to you about the reason that we were keen on getting into
the ACH space, particularly into the fast ACH space. There are other elements of PSP2.
There are elements to do with strong customer authentication, particularly for online transactions. But depending on
how it actually gets rolled out, it could actually create either a hindrance to the simplicity of an e-commerce checkout,
or if it's done very smartly, it could actually make it smooth and safer. And obviously, we want the latter. But there's
many conversations to be had between here and the actual implementation of the stronger consumer authentication
philosophy than PSP2 data.
<Q - Christopher Brendler>: Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Jeffrey>: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I think it's notable, Ajay, that you're calling out services, not
the first time, obviously, as a differentiating point when you bid for business and win business. Given the success
you've had over an increasingly extended period of time now, do you see competition, whether from traditional
competitors or perhaps new entrants – I don't know off the top of my head who those might be, but do you see folks
trying to replicate the services success you've had, and can you comment a little bit on the competitive barriers you
think you've erected that can continue the share gains?
<A - Ajay Banga>: So actually, I do see people coming into the system, but our services are not services generically.
They're services that very tightly connect back to the idea of an authentication, clearing and settlement system that
gives us the insight into a payment transaction. So all our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security,
be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with Advisors, all of these connect back to that idea
of being connected to the payment transaction and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively
good job of tying the two things together when we speak in terms of the logical way a service we provide would be
incremental value-add to the clearing authorization and settlement stream.

In a number of ways, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment you keep putting into them. To keep
staying ahead in terms of both technology and innovation. I mean, take safety and security. Anybody who will tell you
that they've figured it out for safety and security is probably somebody you should run a mile from because there is no
such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying to break in to everyone's systems. You read that all the
time. So you're only as good in safety and security as the efforts you keep putting into it to keep your clients having
products and capabilities that keep them keeping their promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of
products that use artificial intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space. We're going to keep doing
that.
This – they will be, I will tell you, in the first innings of a baseball game on that kind of space. We're a little better
when it comes to tokenization. We're well into the middle of the game. We are better when it comes to EMV, we're
better – well into the latter part of the game. So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of
maturity in terms of what they're solving for, and therefore, require different levels of investment to keep them growing
and competitive. And I think our competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas and expenses
for the last seven years. And it's one of the reasons why I kept telling you I'd like to make sure that you take the
expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this company and instead, give you a really healthy margin,
but use the revenue growth of the company to invest back in creating competitive and, frankly, great differentiators for
future revenue for where we're going.

Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi. Thank you. Martina, at the Investor Community Day in September, you had discussed the
same topic of services and you had said that the services division did a 40% combined margin, if I'm remembering
right. The thing I wanted to get at is you said that it would scale – the services margins would scale over time. I was
wondering if you could help dimensionalize that, like what's going on with service margins? Did they just scale
because this was a really good quarter or how should we be thinking about services margins over time?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So here we are just a few weeks after ICM and you think there will be something
different than what we said on services. First of all, there is no such thing as a services division. Okay? There are many
different services that we are actually providing. And here, I called out three, but we have a ton of other ones, right? So
I don't want you to just bundle this together. We bundle it together because it's an easier way of contrasting it to our
core business. Right? So in terms of what I said on the margin, it's that when you add all the services with their many
different margin profiles right back to what Ajay has been actually explaining on the safety and security side, together,
if you were to add that together, the margin as a whole at this point in time is 40%.
And what I also said is that – and, by the way, this is not on a fully loaded basis, right? So things like corporate costs, et
cetera, are not in there. But I also said that over time, as we are scaling these services, that we would believe that the
margin would increase. Okay? And just to remind you that with this one chart in ICM, we actually showed which
services are at a higher margin level versus which services are lower margin level. And the safety and security side was
actually really at the higher level, and then we kind of worked our way down. Advisors was the next one down, the
loyalty was the next one down, and processing was actually on the lower side. So all of those services, we are working
to scale, and with scale, you will be getting some better margin on these businesses.
<A - Ajay Banga>: Interestingly, I don't look at these as one unit. That's a really important issue. I don't look at our
P&L that way. I don't look at the business that way. It's broken up among a bunch of different people. They come in
and they talk to me on our monthly and quarterly business reviews. Each of them has a different conversation about
what they're doing with their independent units and their businesses, and that's how it's constructed all the way. But the
real implication actually is that our sales force at the front end is learning how to sell something that's way beyond our
traditional credit, debit, prepaid, and frankly, even commercial is not as traditional.

But these are completely non-traditional in our selling process, and some things, they can do themselves. Some of
them, they need experts to come help them sell. We have that kind of sales structure built, and it's constantly changing
as well to keep pace with where this space is going. So it's a mix of many things that are going into services. I just feel
that so long as we can keep it tightly connected to our authorizing, clearing, and settlement business, we're actually
building yet another leg of the stool for our company for the next couple of decades to come.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks. And I guess mainly my question is just around the PIN share gains
that you mentioned. That's helped processed transaction growth accelerate. Is – I guess, first of all, is that share gain
sustaining into Q3? And isn't that lower yielding? Because your transaction yield was actually up 1% sequentially, but I
would have thought this was lower yielding.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah. So, yeah, absolutely right. In the United States, PIN debit is lower yielding,
absolutely. There's no question about it. How this actually came in, and we already talked about this at the last earnings
call, is that we did win a couple of PIN agreements, okay? So we showed up on the back of the card, and then you have
to remember in the PIN debit market, the merchants are actually then aligning the routing. They're choosing the routing
over which network to route. So there is a second thing that you have to think about in terms of, yes, you can go on the
back of the card, but then do you actually get to see the transaction. And we have a very analytical methodology in
terms of trying to see how many transactions we want to see, and that actually influences the pricing that we put out in
the market every day. And so you will see our PIN share going up and down. So you saw it in the third quarter going
up with new agreements coming in. You saw it in our three weeks in October, it's coming a little bit down. That's why
you're seeing a little bit less processed transaction. So you should expect it goes up and down.
<A - Ajay Banga>: By the way, we had a previous earnings call where some guy I once explained that as we go to
some of the larger merchants, their level of sophistication that goes into the decision-making of the routing of a PIN
debit transaction is way beyond the price. The price is interesting and it's kind of table stakes, but they do enormously
sophisticated thinking on the time taken for approval on the number of turndowns on all kinds of aspects. And you can
move up and down the routing table five times a day in some of these merchants depending on what's going on. And so
it's a little difficult to predict where that goes when it's lower yield business. So the overall impact on the revenue
stream of the company tends to be kind of buffered or, let's say, shock absorbed. But it's an interesting learning for all
of us.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Timothy Wayne Willi>: Thank you, and good morning. I just wanted to touch on the comments around loyalty.
And just in general, when you sort of talk with merchants with banks about that topic, I guess is there any sort of new
dynamic or way that they are thinking about approaching it, particularly with the continued evolution of mobile
payments, shopping in-store? Just anything you might be able to add there and sort of how you think about the
momentum around that business line.
<A - Ajay Banga>: There's actually a series of things going on in loyalty and rewards. One of those, you actually
picked the correct topic, which was e-commerce, digital, mobility – that whole space. If you think about this, sort of it's

almost like simple things like cashback become even more attractive. But even voucher management and the
management of keeping track of your loyalty rewards card number and how it all accumulates into that, all those
become very important, even more so than the physical world. There's a – the loyalty business has got many elements
to it. It's got the accumulation of rewards, it's got the offers every day that go into the system, it's got the aspect of
what's funded by banks and what's funded by merchants, it's got the aspect of are you a complete program manager in
some markets or are you only providing a portion of the service and only a portion of the value chain.
As you know, we bought Pinpoint in Asia and Australia. Pinpoint is a complete program manager. Truaxis on the other
end is a merchant reward generating engine, which is not a complete program manager, and it's something we bought a
couple of years before Pinpoint. So we have got a series of different capabilities now in the company, and in some
ways, we are probably one of the more interesting global players on loyalty and rewards. But you've got to package it
very tightly with, as I said, the clearing, authorizing and settlement business, whether in digital or in the physical space.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan with CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Thomas McCrohan>: Hi. Thanks. I'm just trying to get a sense of trajectory of operating expense growth going
forward. And just looking at kind of history, it was kind of averaging high single digits; a little higher than that this
year. And I know you don't want to give forward guidance at all, but maybe you can just speak to maybe the intensity
of investment spending. Has it gotten more intense given all the geographic expansion, all the digital changes,
everything that's going on in this space? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Clearly, Tom, over the last couple of years, I would say over the last three years, the
intensity of the investments have really taken off. Just imagine what have all happened in the digital space. A
significant amount of spend went into the digital space. But then, in addition for us to be developing all of these
services, so what we did from an Advisor point of view, from a data analytics point of view, from a loyalty, and from a
safety and security investment point of view, some of the investments that Ajay was talking earlier about was very
important for us to do.
Some of the numbers are masked in terms of when you look at the foreign exchange hedging activity that came in, in
2015, which actually was a benefit there for us, and in 2016, it was a drag. So when you actually take that out, our
operating expense growth is relatively similar. We would continue to expect that we will have to invest. And, yes, I am
not going to go into 2017, but as you can see, for 2016, we really have not changed our forecast at all in terms of how
we think we are rounding out this year, which is the low double digit growth number that we gave on a currency neutral
basis.
<A - Ajay Banga>: You've got – I'll add one element to that conversation. The discipline that Martina has in our
company around acquisitions is that at the end of two years, the acquisition becomes part of our base. When we talk to
you, we're talking about our base expenses as well. The acquisitions we are doing, because it's the kind of industry
we're in, don't exactly come fully loaded with revenue and unloaded with expense. They tend to come as capabilities
that bring expenses and revenue that we need to build over a period of years by putting them together with what we
sell.
Typically, the lag in that – the timing lag of that creates a higher growth rate of expenses than on revenues for the first
few years of owning that property. That's part of what we are talking about when we talk about putting investment
capital and expense dollars to work. The acquisitions that are all in areas of strategic growth opportunity for us, a
number of them are in the services space that Martina was loosely talking about a little while ago, and that's kind of
what we're putting our capital to work at.
But a lot of our expenses, aside from the acquisitions, tend to go into the digital space because that's where a lot of
opportunity will get laid out over the next decade. Revenues, not as much as staking out capabilities right now.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher Roy Donat>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ajay, I wanted to go back to
something you said in your prepared remarks about inbound cross-border volume into the UK being strong. I'm just
trying to understand how sustainable this might be, and I'm wondering if you can comment on anything from historical
examples of devaluations or sort of the opposite case where the Swiss franc appreciated in January 2015 and how that
affected outbound volumes with Switzerland. Just trying to understand if the UK is going to see a lot of inbound
volume for months or years here.
<A - Ajay Banga>: So, first of all, I'm glad you called them prepared remarks. Barbara is always nervous when I'm
speaking because she's tracking all that I'm saying. It doesn't always follow the script. But I will use your comment as
proof of my being relatively thoughtful. The second part is the UK, which is your real question. I'm just cracking up on
you. I'm taking it out on Barbara for ten years of this.
So the UK, be careful about assuming that a lower currency will necessarily lead to inbound travel, either tourist related
or business related. It works in a place like the UK because it is one of the world's most attractive tourism destinations.
If you drop the currency value in Venezuela, it doesn't lead to anything. But it does in the UK because of the nature of
the UK being what it is as an attractive location.
And in addition, from what we are seeing really in the third quarter – I don't know whether I can tell you right now off
the top of my head, I actually don't know whether the breakup is commercial traffic or tourist traffic. So I think Martina
knows that, I don't know it today. But I do know that you can't assume that tourist traffic or even business traffic will
necessarily follow the pattern of a currency moving around. Right now, there's no doubt that in the UK, tourism is up
1%, 2%. There is a great deal of reinterest in acquiring assets in the United Kingdom because if you are sitting outside
of the UK, the values of assets in the UK have not only gone down by the change in the currency, but they have also
gone down by the extreme reaction that the market had to the fears around Brexit. And that has also created a lot of
interest in people traveling in to look at assets in the UK.
Again, I don't know if that will persist because the latest UK GDP report actually shows the Brexit response to be [ph]
cannibalizing (58:25). It will take time to come. It won't happen in quarter in terms of real GDP change. And so this
may change the valuation of market assets in the UK. So I wouldn't draw too many conclusions either from the past or
even the UK specifically about where this is going.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So just one thing to add. For the main travel destinations, we are seeing some of this
over the last ten years. So when you look, for instance, where the dollar is trading versus where the pound is trading
versus where the euro is trading, tourists are actually, relatively sophisticated who go to these kind of locations, and we
have seen that the tourism travel is getting adjusted as people are coming to New York or people coming to London or
people going to Paris, that people are adjusting their travel plans because of the – because of some of the factors of the
currency. And we've seen that over the last ten years. But as Ajay said, that does not expand to many other countries.
It's really for the top tourist destinations.
<A - Ajay Banga>: And shopping destinations. The UK – the U.S. right now, inward tourist traffic is down with the
dollar being strong, whereas outward travel by Americans is quite strong. And so those are all just natural things that
we already do as well.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.

Your last question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One quick Martina question. It did look like
underneath the covers, Asia volumes were a little bit unusually low this quarter. I was curious what was driving that.
And then for Ajay, it looks with this flurry of announcements around wallet interoperability and convergence, it kind of
gets a little bit complicated in terms of what's going to be accepted where. How do you just envision how Masterpass
will play into the overall wallet landscape and how you see it evolving? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, Lisa, first on the volumes, you're absolutely right. On Asia Pacific, the volumes
year-over-year are a little bit lower. China plays into that. We are now at low single digits from a China growth point of
view, that was higher last year. Australia, India and Indonesia also had a little bit of lower growth.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Masterpass. Masterpass, my view is that on a small mobile screen, it's unlikely that
merchants on their checkout page for browser – I'm talking browser right now, which is still the largest portion of
digital commerce – probably will be a very large portion for the next four years, five years. Very unlikely that you're
going to find them putting many different wallets up in the checkout page because the total space available on a mobile
phone is relatively restricted. And therefore, there's going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right
infrastructure of wallet acceptance over time. And I think you'll find that the kind of things we're trying to do, we're
trying to ensure that one of the brands in the checkout page is Masterpass because if you could put your digital wallet,
as well as your user wallet, to all using Masterpass as an acceptance brand, then that's a good thing. In our view, and
I've said this many times, Masterpass is not a B2C effort. It's a B2B effort.
What I'm doing is not just building wallets because a bank could have their own wallet, a merchant could have their
own wallet or they could take a wallet from us private label to open APIs. That doesn't matter. And all things come
through in a safe, secure way using tokens, come through a Masterpass acceptance mark. And the idea is to build all
our services capabilities or to open APIs and we've already done that in a substantial way. If you go to
Mastercarddeveloper.com – on developer.Mastercard.com, I think I'm mixing up the – what came first and what came
later, but developer.Mastercard.com, you will find that it's relatively easy, if you do strike a deal with us, to get the
cryptogram to unlock the API to then connect it up to your capabilities either as a merchant or an issuer. So I've seen
Masterpass now as a wallet.
I've said this for a long time, I've seen Masterpass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our company. I see the
Masterpass system as an acceptance system that enables safe, secure payments, that enables open APIs to be connected
to that for services, and that's the offering which is very partner-centric and enables issuers to own their consumer
experience by making it digital-by-default and connecting it to their online banking app. It enables digital giants to
create a seamless acceptance system, and it enables merchants to not have to repeat their acceptance capability time
after time. Because once they're on Masterpass, they can accept the others. That's what we're trying to do.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific. Thank you.
Barbara L. Gasper
Ajay, some closing comments?
Ajay Banga
Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay. So, a couple of closing thoughts. And just to sum up, I think our business continues to perform
well. I think you see that reflected in our strong revenue earnings growth, and that's despite the usual uneven global
economy that everyone talks about. I think we are executing well against our strategy. We have our ups and downs, but
we are executing consistently, growing our share, continuing to leverage services as a strategic differentiator to further
drive our core business around the world. We are in a very dynamic industry, and just as I was just talking to Lisa, we
are working very hard to deliver secure digital payment experience for consumers using Masterpass across all devices,

And, of course, I continue to believe in the long run, we're driven by strong secular growth opportunities that we have,
and we continue to hope, hopefully, position ourselves well for that future. So thank you for your continued support of
the company. Thank you for joining us today.
