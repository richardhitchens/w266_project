MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg
Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations.
This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download on UTC's website at
www.utc.com. Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operation, except where otherwise noted.
They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.
The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash expectations, and any other forward-looking statements
provided in this call, are subject to risks and uncertainty. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports,
provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the
forward-looking statements.
Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give
everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by re-inserting yourself into the queue, and we'll
answer as time permits. Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release, UTC reported 2013
earnings per share of $6.21. Our integration of the transformational deals and solid execution drove 16% earnings
growth, despite a slower than expected recovery in our end markets. For the full year of Goodrich, UTC Aerospace

Systems generated over $2.1 billion of operating profit. The addition of IAE or International Aero Engines, along with
aggressive cost reduction helped Pratt & Whitney grow earnings by $177 million. And Climate, Controls & Security
also delivered a strong 2013 with 9% earnings growth and 15.7% operating margins.
Even with the investments we're making for the ramp in aero, we delivered strong free cash flow at 102% of net
income for the year. Total sales for the year were $63 billion. That's up 1% organically. So as you see on slide 2, strong
momentum as we exit the year. Organic sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter after being flat for the first three
quarters. In the commercial businesses, we saw 7% growth in the Americas, driven by a continued U.S. economic
recovery. Europe was flat, and Asia grew about 4% with ongoing strength in China where sales were up 9%, more than
offsetting weaknesses in the other Asian countries.
In Aerospace, continued weakness in defense was more than offset by a very strong growth in our commercial OE and
aftermarket where overall sales increased 14%. So it's an accelerating top line to go along with an improving economic
environment. In the U.S., consumer sentiment and spending continued to improve on strength in the equity and housing
markets. Europe has also seen moderate improvement with the PMI expanding for six consecutive months and return to
modest economic growth. And in China, construction starts and property transactions were strong for the year, giving
rise to solid backlogs across our commercial businesses.
Okay, slide 3. In addition to the accelerating organic sales growth and an improving economic outlook, continued
strength in orders positioned us well as we enter 2014. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 8% with broad-based
strength around the world. Climate, Controls & Securities global equipment orders grew 5%, with double-digit growth
in the Americas. In the Aerospace business, commercial spare orders were up 20% at Pratt & Whitney and 19% at UTC
Aerospace Systems.
Okay. Taking a look at the fourth quarter earnings on slide 4 now. As always, a few puts and takes as we close out the
year. Earnings per share of $1.58 included $0.11 of restructuring charges, partially offset by $0.02 in gains from tax
settlements and the ongoing portfolio transformation CCS. Offset restructuring and one-time items in both years,
earnings per share increased 29% versus prior years, and that was driven by a few different items. First of all, very
strong performance at CCS and Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems, which all delivered profits in excess of
our guidance to you.
We also had the absence of $100 million of inventory step-up costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of last year,
related to the Goodrich acquisition. We also saw lower tax rate this quarter. It was $0.06 better than last year and $0.04
better than what we had expected back in December. And, of course, lower Canadian Maritime Helicopter program
charges this year.
On Sikorsky, operating profit grew 10%, including the absence of the 2012 charge related to the CMHP. Sikorsky
shipped 77 large helicopters in the quarter and 240 for the year with 100% on-time delivery to the U.S. government. As
we said in the press release, we did not recognize revenue on any of the CMHP helicopters in 2013, resulting in a net
$0.06 benefit versus our expectations. That's $0.08 from the lack of deliveries, partially offset by a $0.02 charge for
cost growth associated with the delay.
As was reported in the press, Sikorsky concluded principles of agreement with the government of Canada on December
31st. This is a positive step towards replacing the aging Sea King fleet. Preliminary pilot training is ongoing in
Shearwater, Canada and will be completed as planned this month, which will allow for the start of operational testing
by the Canadian forces shortly thereafter. The $89 million of liquidated damages associated with late deliveries were
fully reserved in prior years. We continue to work with the Canadian government on a final contract amendment, and
we are going to maintain our placeholder eight aircraft for 2014. Okay enough on Sikorsky.
Let's go back to the fourth quarter. Total sales increased 2%, and as I mentioned, there was 4% organic growth which is
offset by 2 points of headwind from ongoing divestitures at CCS as well as Pratt & Whitney's Power Systems business
which was divested earlier in the year. Free cash flow of 136% of net income in the quarter, and we paid down an
additional $1 billion of debt. It's important to note in the last 18 months, we've now paid down approximately half of
the debt associated with the Goodrich acquisition. We also bought back an additional $200 million of shares in the

quarter, which brought us to $1.2 billion total for the year. We remain confident in our growth outlook and we
announced a dividend increase of 10.3% in October.
The businesses continued to reduce their cost structure in 2013 and identified solid payback restructuring projects
totaling almost $500 million for the year. Restructuring was offset by one-time gains and spread across the business
units. Pratt & Whitney led the way with over $150 million of restructuring. At UTC Aerospace Systems, CCS and Otis
each spent close to $100 million, and we continue to see pull from the businesses for additional restructuring as we
enter 2014. So a strong close to what was a good year at UTC.
I'll be back to talk about 2014 in a few minutes, but first let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segment
results. Jay?
Jay Malave
Thanks, Greg. Turning to page 5, Otis sales improved 4% organically in the quarter with new equipment sales up 10%,
including double-digit growth in China and the Americas and modest growth in service. Operating profit was flat at
constant currency, as profit growth in Asia, led by China, was largely offset by continued factory transition costs in
North America. Profit in Europe is stabilizing.
New equipment order growth remains robust, up 8% at constant currency with mid-teens growth in China and the
Americas and strength in the Middle East. New equipment backlog ended the year up double-digit versus prior year.
For the full year, operating profit was flat at 4% higher sales.
On slide 6, Climate, Controls & Security increased profits 12% in the quarter on a 1% increase in sales, resulting in
another sharp increase in margins, up 150 basis points from prior year of 15.2%. Organic sales continue to steadily
improve and were up 4% in the quarter. Geographic mix was consistent with recent trends. Europe was flat. China was
up high single-digit, while Asia overall was flat, due to mainly by a decline in Australia. Americas was up mid-single
digit, driven by 18% growth in the residential HVAC business, and Transicold was up 22% with solid growth in the
Eastern European truck and trailer business and a robust recovery in the container market after a weak quarter last year.
Profit growth in the quarter was driven by strong conversion on organic sales, restructuring savings and net
productivity, which more than offset headwind from divested earnings. Orders for global commercial HVAC
equipment were up low single-digits in the quarter. Orders for global Fire & Security products were up 10%, although
that was largely offset by a decline in the Fire & Security field businesses. Global commercial refrigeration orders were
flattish, while Transicold was down mid-single digit following a 70% increase in the third quarter. For the full year,
CCS grew earnings by $221 million or 9% on a 1% organic sales increase. Operating margin of 15.7% was up 160
basis points from prior year, and comfortably above the 15% margin target set for 2015.
Turning to Aerospace on slide 7. Pratt & Whitney delivered strong results with 23% profit growth and 5% higher sales,
resulting in margin expansion of 170 basis points. Organically, sales were up 14%, reflecting growth across the
businesses, led by high-teens growth in the large commercial engine business where aftermarket was up over 20%. The
military engine business was up low double-digits driven by a higher JSF program sales, while Pratt & Whitney
Canada was up mid-single digits. On a reported basis, sales were up 5% as the organic sales growth was partially offset
by the Power Systems business divestiture.
Profit growth in the quarter was driven by the benefits from higher organic sales and restructuring savings, as well as
lower E&D, which more than offset headwinds from adverse large commercial OE mix, Power Systems divestiture,
and higher pension costs.
For the year, Pratt & Whitney delivered profit growth of $177 million, exceeding its prior expectation of $150 million
based on its seamless integration of IAE, solid execution of cost reduction and restructuring, and improvement in the
commercial aftermarket.

On slide 8; UTC Aerospace Systems delivered its strongest quarter of the year with operating profit of $544 million on
sales of $3.5 billion. Sales were up high-single-digit, with commercial aftermarket up high-teens and commercial OEM
up 10%. Overall, military sales were flat to prior year, with mid-single-digit growth in military aftermarket, offset by a
low-single-digits decline in military OEM.
Year-on-year profit growth was driven by the absence of last year's inventory step-up costs, higher aftermarket volume,
and continued synergy traction. As Greg mentioned, orders for commercial spares grew 19% on a year-over-year basis.
UTC Aerospace Systems delivered strong results in its first full year, with operating profit slightly above the $2.1
billion, and the integration remains on track towards delivering solid growth in 2014 and beyond.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 9. Operating profit increased 10% on 13% lower sales. The sales decline was driven by
lower international military OEM and military aftermarket volumes, which were partially offset by higher commercial
shipments. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 77 aircraft, putting 58 based on military platforms and 19
commercial.
On profit, lower overall sales volumes, the unfavorable mix of aircraft and headwind from higher pension and
compliance costs were more than offset by the lower year-over-year CMHP charges. During the quarter, Sikorsky
delivered its first fully configured S-76D aircraft into service. Customer interest in S-76D is strong, with a backlog in
excess of $600 million.
For the full year, Sikorsky delivered 240 aircraft. Operating profit of $644 million was down 16% and 8% lower sales.
Based on 2013 results, we are updating our 2014 expectations to flattish operating profit and high single-digit sales
growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Jay. So, a good year for UTC. In aggregate, the business units delivered solid margin expansion to
15.7% and EPS grew 16% despite a slower than expected global economic recovery. On top of the solid financial
results, we continue to achieve significant milestones on development programs and secured key wins for the future. At
Pratt, 31 GTF engines have now completed more than 7,000 hours and 16,000 cycles of full engine testing including
750 hours of flight time.
The CSeries engine achieved certification in February of 2013 and successfully powered the maiden flight of the
CSeries aircraft this past September. The A320neo engine is on track for certification in the back half of 2014, and our
customers recognize the value of the GTF and have now ordered over 5,000 engines including options.
We also quickly realized the benefits of the Goodrich acquisition. In our Propulsion & Aerospace Systems
organizational structure in 2013 when Embraer selected UTC to provide a fully integrated propulsion system; that is the
engine and the cell and the controls, along with the electric system and wheels and brakes for its second-generation
E-Jets. These combined wins highlight our ability to leverage our technology across our Aerospace businesses to win
more content on new aircraft, while providing greater customer value with more integrated systems.
Sikorsky continues to see strong civil demand for deepwater – from deepwater oil and gas exploration around the
world, and has a total commercial backlog now nearly $3 billion. And the investment in X2 Technology has paved the
way for our agreement with Boeing to co-develop a demonstrator for the next generation of multi-role helicopters.
New three and four year labor contracts were also ratified by the union membership at Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky
respectively, and these agreements are a good result for both the company and our employees.
On the commercial side of the business, Climate, Controls & Security continued to see success leveraging a
combination of our Carrier and Fire & Security businesses, and delivered a record 15.7% operating margin. And going
forward, we'll leverage the combined capability of CCS and Otis in the new Building & Industrial Systems

organization to accelerate top line growth.
Otis had several key wins in 2013, including the Tianjin 117 and the Abu Dhabi Airport. Worldwide, Otis new
equipment orders were up 14% from 2013, including 22% growth in China. So a good momentum that will allow us to
deliver solid growth in 2014, and really no changes to the expectations of what we laid out in December. A solid
organic growth in backlog exiting the year gives us confidence in our sales assumption of 3% to 4% organic growth in
2014, and we expect continued recovery in our North American markets, slight growth in Europe and solid growth in
China.
Okay, looking into DoD budget. The developers in Washington are encouraging, but it's still a little early to determine
the impact on our businesses for 2014. We're still planning for a 3% to 5% decline in our U.S. government aerospace
sales which Louis mentioned in December, and that will be more than offset by strong growth in our commercial
aerospace businesses. Overall, we continue to expect total sales of around $64 billion this year, including almost $1
billion of headwind from divestitures.
As always, we remain relentlessly focused on cost reduction and leveraging our global scale. Last year, we invested
nearly $500 million in restructuring, and for this year, we expect about $300 million, all offset by one-time gains.
Restructuring spending in 2014 should be evenly distributed across the quarter, so expect about $75 million of
restructuring charges each quarter, while the gains are probably going to come in the middle of the year.
Strong operating leverage across the business should allow us to deliver earnings of $6.55 to $6.85 this year. We
remain confident in that guidance range with earnings growth accelerating during the year. Specifically in the first
quarter, we have about $0.22 of headwind year-over-year. You recall that last year's first quarter had $0.11 of net gains,
while this year we expect $0.06 of net restructuring. We also had about $0.05 of good news at Pratt & Whitney last
year which is not going to repeat in this year's first quarter.
So wrapping up with cash flow, we expect to invest about $2 billion in CapEx this year, after investing $1.7 billion in
2013, and that $2 billion should be the peak. The timing, of course, will be dictated by program schedules. These are
critical investments for our commercial aerospace business as we prepare for an unprecedented ramp in production.
And while these investments in the non-cash pension tailwind create some pressure on cash flow, we continue to target
free cash flow equal to net income for the year.
So, in conclusion, solid year for UTC and the momentum we have exiting the year gives us confidence in 2014. We've
got the right strategy and the right portfolio in both the developed and growth markets, along with an organizational
structure and experienced management team that will capitalize on the continued global economic recovery and deliver
sustainable earnings growth both in 2014 and into the future.
So with that, Stephanie, let's open up the call for questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Carter.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just wondered if you could give us a little bit more granularity on the commercial
aftermarket order numbers and kind of parse that, maybe at Pratt what you're seeing on the large commercial side for
the PW4000s versus the Vs, any differences in the trends there? And then broadly speaking, maybe UTAS differences
in military versus commercial and the outlook there?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sure. That's all pretty good news as you would expect on the commercial side. Spares orders
were up at Pratt about 20%. We saw that UTAS or Aerospace Systems grew 19%. What I think was most encouraging
for us is what we saw on the services side. This is in our shops around the world, where we saw sales up over 40% in
the quarter. And we have finally started to see the airlines switch from these light overhauls we've been talking about
for the last couple of years to more heavy overhauls and that really drove a tremendous amount of volume in the shops
and drove the order rates as well. So, airlines are making money and things look pretty good. We saw delinquency and
the receivables down because the airlines are making money. We saw spares. We saw heavy overhauls. It was all pretty
good on the commercial side of the business. As far as the split, Jay, in terms of the Vs, I'm...
<A - Jay Malave>: Sure. Carter, the V2500 was up high single digits in the quarter, PW4000 was up high teens, and
PW2000 was very, very strong, there was an order there for delivery in 2014. But all models did pretty well in the
quarter. On the Aerospace Systems side, the provisioning was strong in the quarter and again, that was narrow-body
growth as well as some 787 provisioning. Again, as Greg mentioned, we're seeing these higher, stronger overhauls,
heavier overhauls with profitability getting better, traffic continuing to grow, cycle and the hours are there. So, the
trends – all the fundamentals, as we've been saying all along, really, we've seen that in the quarter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And what about on the Sikorsky's side in terms of the orders there, I mean, obviously the
spares were off a lot, the orders were off a lot, have you seen any reversal in that trend?
<A - Jay Malave>: We saw just on the sales, military aftermarket was a little bit better. It was down low teens.
However, that was on an easier compare. Last year, military was down high single digits in the aftermarket; so, not all
that much better.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I mean, I would just tell you, we think we've kind of bottomed out from the impacts of
sequestration at Sikorsky in terms of the after-market. As you guys have all seen, It looks like the defense budget for
2014 will be the same as it was for 2013, when they restored that $20 billion IN cut. So, we don't expect much further
deterioration at Sikorsky in terms of the order rates, but clearly the backlog is going to be down going into 2014, which
is why we think the military sales will be down again about 3% to 5%.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Carter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Great Sam.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you share a little bit more about the Canadian helicopter in terms of this potential
agreement? You said you're still going to assume eight deliveries this year. Is this going to give you any ability to treat
the production and the service differently and maybe be able to write-off any of the production cost, anything else you
can share along the lines of that agreement?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think – again this POA, or this Principles of Agreement that was signed on
December 31 really is a milestone for us. I think we have a path forward with the customer to deliver the aircraft now.
We got a lot of the bad news behind us, I think, on the program. We weren't able to revenue recognize any of the
helicopters, but again, I think as we go forward, we've got a clear path this year to revenue recognize, eight. The
contractor's amendments should be finalized by the 31st of March and hopefully, by the time we stand up in front of
investors in March, we'll have some more details in terms of that contract amendment, but right now it looks like we've
got the ability to deliver out through 2018. Our goal is to get those things delivered all by 2016. So, we think eight this

year, eight next year, and eight the following year. I think importantly, the customer recognizes the value of the aircraft.
There was talk in the Canadian press about termination and all of that. They need these helicopters. These are the best
damn military helicopters – maritime helicopters out there. So, I think it's all very positive for Sikorsky. As for the
accounting, while I wish we could get this behind us, Sam, I don't see a way, based upon the structure of the contract
that we're negotiating today to do that. So, again, I don't see any more bad news beyond that which we've expected
today. We're going to lose about $14 million in helicopter going forward. It's unfortunate. I can't get that behind us. If I
had a way to do it, I would, but at least for right now, we'll just assume that's the plan.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then the change in the segments for Sikorsky. Isn't that going to be flat in terms
of the profit year-over-year instead of up 0 to 50? It doesn't look like the other segments changed, so really, where is
the offset? Is it tax rate, interest, share account? Where do you offset that?
<A - Jay Malave>: If you look at – it's just a change from where they ended, Sam. If you look at – based on our
guidance the absolute number for Sikorsky, the expectation is the same. And so – at our midpoint, the bottom line
number for Sikorsky is really the same number it was before. It's just the change is different.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in, Greg, back in the third quarter call, I think you
talked about, I thought a tax rate somewhere close to 29%. That would seem like a little bit more than the few cents you
mentioned in terms of the variance. What was in this quarter that was different in terms of the tax rate?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: There were a couple of different pieces in here. There was a small settlement with the IRS,
which gave us a couple of pennies of benefit, which we hadn't expected in the rate. I think we called that out as part of
gains math. And then we had a little bit better year-end rate because of some planning that we had put in place earlier in
the year. I think the operational rate would have been about 28.6%, so we picked up about $40 million or $0.04
operationally because of the tax rate benefit in the quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thanks. I had a couple of questions on Otis. First of all, looking at your China OE
business there, based on the order backlog and the order trends you had through 2013, I guess, is it fair to assume that
your OE deliveries in China, the growth rate should be pretty similar this year as what you had in 2013?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we're expecting about 15% sales growth there this year based upon the backlog.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. And then within the U.S. part of Otis, do you still have a drag in the first half of
the year from the factory relocations, or that's mostly finished in Q4?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, there would still be a little bit of a drag probably through the middle of the year. I think
we had – I don't know, a little less than $20 million of headwind in Q4. That will step down a little bit each in the next
two quarters. And I think the plan right now is by the third quarter that should be generating tailwind as opposed to
headwind, but still a little bit of a drag here in the first two quarters.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. And lastly, just within Pratt, you're getting closer now to starting to shift the
commercial use, the GTF, any change in your thoughts on the kind of headwinds within Pratt that you'll see to earnings
from that ramp-up?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think it's the same that we talked about in December. We will be losing money
especially on the early delivery. So there will be headwind from negative engine margin and that's going to accelerate
as the ramp – as the ramp, so you're going to see, we've got a little bit of headwind this year, little more in 2015 and
then 2016, 2017, some significant negative engine margin. Obviously, we're working the product cost, piece of that
equation. It's a great engine and this – just sort of headwind that we're going to have to deal with. There's offsets, of

course. We've got – E&D should be coming down and you've got the rest of the business which we expect to recover.
The Vs, of course, as those go away, so will the negative engine margin on the Vs which will help offset a little bit of
this and the aftermarket should also continue to grow. So, it's headwinds, but we know about it, we're working it, and

Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open..
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On Otis, you said that new equipment was up 10%, but sales were only up 4%. Can you
talk about what came down? Is this – repairs and modifications or contract services, what happened there in the
quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It really is just mix. The service revenues were only up about 1%. That's 60% of the
business. That's what caused the overall sales only up 4%.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And then on Pratt, the CSeries, Bombardier is now talking about this being delayed going
into service until the back half of 2015. What's the impact of that on you all?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, it's good news in terms of we had talked about some negative engine margin and both
at Pratt and some negative margin at UTAS for the year on deliveries that were starting to ramp, and it wasn't a big
number. so while unfortunately the good news associated with not shipping, it's mostly going to be offset by the fact
that the program is going to be out there longer, so the R&D build is going to go up. So, it is a small net benefit but not
big.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And then just on the other side of that, now that you're starting to see the F-35 growth
begin to kick in, how do you see that going forward in terms of margins? I mean it's a good thing that you're seeing this
grow, but I would assume there should be some dilution on margin as it becomes bigger?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, again, those are – now, I think we're in Lot 6. Those were all firm fixed price at this
point. So, as we go forward here, I think we'll take cost out. We're still coming down the learning curve pretty rapidly
on that, but it'll be slightly dilutive to margin, but not a huge impact really across Pratt. The fact is the demand for these
engines and these aircrafts are much stronger internationally than we expected. So, we expect this ramp to be pretty
strong over the next two years.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I was wondering if we could just drill into Otis service a little bit, the 1% growth kind of
geographically, where you're seeing pressure maybe just kind of what's going on in Europe in particular, I guess, and
maybe that ties to your stabilization comment.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. I think, again, in the Americas, we saw a modest growth. I think it was up about 4%
service overall and Europe was down about 1%. So, the good news here is in China, service is actually up 10%, again,
it's off of a low base. The good news in Europe, if you will, is we have not seen the big continued deterioration that we
had been seeing for the last couple of years. So, while it's not exactly stabilized, since it's still down 1%, at least there's
some light at the end of the tunnel as the economy has improved. I'll tell you, this is probably the biggest focus of
Geraud Darnis and the whole team at the BIS organization today is making sure that service portfolio in Europe
continues to – returns to growth and profitable growth.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And, on China, as you said, it's a low base, but is there a visible turn in your service capture in
that business? Is that on a clear upward trajectory?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It is going up. I think, again, we're seeing, I think, OCL, the Otis China Limited brand where
conversions are right around 60% on all of our direct sales. Overall, it's still about 25%. Obviously, that's a big focus
that we have going forward as we grow that business. The new equipment business is wonderful today, but we all know
the ultimate prize in China will be service and we're focused on it, the whole team really is, in China.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just finally from me and I'll move on, pension, how did that actually end? Did you
pick up a little bit of cushion relative to your guide in the year, relative to where discount rates ended?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we did. It was – the discount rate, I think, when Louis stood up, we had expected a
4.8% discount rate and I think that's exactly where it ended up for us, but I think overall, the plan was up about 10.8%
in terms of performance for the year; really strong performance. Right now, the U.S. plan is about 98% funded on a
PBO basis, so where we were short $4 billion three years ago, today, the shortfall is only about $500 million in the
pension plan. So, we'll see probably about $100 million of additional good news on pension this year beyond that
which Louis had talked about in December. So, it adds to that cushion that we talked about at the midpoint. You're also
getting a little bit of benefit on the currencies, where I think we had forecast the euro at $1.33 for the year, today, it's
$1.36-ish. So you pick up $0.03 there. So, we feel pretty good about the midpoint as compared to where we were just
six weeks ago.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right, thank you.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thanks so much. So, the very, very strong commercial spares orders and the MRO
activity in the fourth quarter; any sense whether that might have been driven by your relatively large price hike
announcements for 2014? What are you seeing in terms of color in those areas in the early weeks of January?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, I might push back a little, Cai, on your characterization of unusually high price
increases. I think this is typical normal increases that we see almost every year. I think what was important is we didn't
see a lot of discounting in the fourth quarter this year. We saw really solid order intake. And was there a little bit of
beat the price? There may have been, but quite frankly, that wasn't a big driver of the increase. I think it really is just
pent-up demand, and again, as we've talked about more heavy overhauls in the shop which drive a tremendous amount
of spare parts.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah, and Cai, remember, the fourth quarter is typically the highest. It's seasonally that
beat-the-price activity occurs. So, the compares are pretty clean; it's not like this year is much greater than last year.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Right. And so was the activity flow over end of the first quarter, so what you've seen in
January looks about what it looked like last year in terms of percentage changes?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah, well, book-to-bill is above 1, Cai, so there will be – some of that flows over into the first
quarter.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, but the fundamentals haven't really changed. I think the airlines are still flying these
planes full. They're still flying a lot of hours. And some of this pent-up demand that we've been talking about is
continuing to play out, we expect here in the first half. Obviously, we're not going to get 20% aftermarket growth for
the full year at Pratt this year. We're thinking it's going to be...
<A - Jay Malave>: Mid-single-digits in the...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Mid-single-digits. So, if we get 20%, things will be really good, but it will slow down a little
bit again as the compares get tougher in the back half of the year, but I think so far, so good.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah, as I've said, Cai, there was one large order in the PW2000that was for delivery in 2014. So
the 20% was a little high related to that one order.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Got it. And then, we now know that the FY 2014 DoD appropriation; you're still looking for
down 3% to 5%, and then kind of when you take together the budget agreement plus the DoD, is there any potential for
favorable results relative to your expectation?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think they are, Cai. But again, most of that benefit is probably going to flow into
next year. But if you think about it, the CRH, the Combat Rescue Helicopter, was fully funded. The VXX, the
Presidential, was fully funded. If we're fortunate and get awarded those two contracts, you would expect to see some
additional revenues this year. Not much on the bottom line, obviously, because they're developing contracts in the first
couple of years. But I would expect a bigger impact to be next year. I think the good news on sequestration is at least
everybody knows what it is now. So we have a baseline. So, people aren't scrambling and moving money around in a
dis-economic fashion. I think the DoD has the ability to plan for next fiscal year, because it was a two-year budget deal.
And so, we expect some stability and not as many surprises going into the year on the downside as we saw last year on
the military.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And last one, you'd mentioned in response to Doug's question that a little more E&D
as a result of the CSeries, but what are we looking for, for E&D now for the year?
<A - Jay Malave>: Cai, we're still flattish. It may go up – a little uptick from here but generally flattish is still the
expectation.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: And you're probably talking about $10 million of pressure on E&D from the CSeries delay
at Pratt, that's a little bit smaller number at the Aerospace Systems business. So, we're not talking huge numbers here.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from the Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I might pick up a little bit where Cai left off on the military. If I

playing out or do you see something better there, Greg?

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: No, I believe it was at Pratt.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think again, Pratt -we saw actually, spares at Pratt, let me just take a look here.
<A - Jay Malave>: Pratt – were up in the first quarter.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So, you're going to have some positive comparisons there right?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Should be positive, yeah.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So, how else do you – you kind of are saying to us, be careful in the first quarter because of
the gains in some of the other items. What else on an operating basis might help you lift the number?
I think you know we're thinking at the bottom line that's going to be a tough compare, but I'm sure there's operating
performance that will make a difference.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. I think, again, what you're going to see because of the accelerating organic growth
coming out of the fourth quarter backlogs were up. So, I think you are going to see a good top line growth. And I would
expect decent conversion out of that top line growth. If you think about it for the year, we're forecasting organic growth
of 3% to 4%, and that will give us $2 billion to $2.5 billion and we should see some organic growth here in the first
quarter, which is going to help. Again, you'll see it in Otis because of the backlog. I think you'll see it at CCS and you'll
certainly see it the Aerospace OEM side. The only weak point you'll probably see in the first quarter is Sikorsky, which
again is still looking at reduced Black Hawk production this year. Recall, we've been talking about a 20% reduction in
Black Hawk sales year-over-year. So, that's probably the biggest pressure point in the first quarter.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And, so a tax rate normalized going forward is like 28.5%, Greg, is that sort of where you
are thinking about and...?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, I wish it were 28.5%. I think, again, we had some employment opportunities in the
fourth quarter and last year's rate, you'll recall, benefited from the tax extenders, which got passed back in January of
2013. So we lose that benefit, which was a full point on the rate. So from a planning standpoint, we're expecting about
a 30% rate going into the year now. If that gets better, because of extenders getting passed, again there's about a point
of good news there. We'll look for some planning opportunities, but right now we've got visibility to a 30% rate and
that's the planning assumption, at least going in.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just two more items, one on CCS. Can you – have you gotten to the point where
you feel very comfortable with the portfolio? Or are there still some other divestitures that are teed up, and does that
reflect part of what you think will be the gains?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Probably not gains associated with the portfolio transformation. If you think about it,
Geraud has been talking about $850 million of portfolio reductions or transformation at the legacy F&S business. As
we sit here today, I think he would tell you it's more like about $1.2 billion. So, if you think about the revenues this
year, I think CCS is going to see about $500 million of headwinds between divestitures we did during last year,
including like the Australia cash-in-transit business, and some of the other businesses we've divested and what's on the
block still for 2014.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And you had a very nice call on saying at the bottom that Carrier was going to show some
leverage and that housing wasn't going to go to zero. Can you put on your forecast thought for a moment and sort of tell
us how you continue to see residential, and do we see any commercial improvement at Carrier this year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, in fact, I think that's, the resi story I think is pretty well-known and we finished the year
very strong with sales up about 18% in the residential, we saw that in heating, we saw it in small package, we saw it in
cooling as well. So I would expect that, that momentum continues. But I think the Better news, if you will, it really
goes on the non-resi side, we saw Otis orders in North America up almost 30% in the fourth quarter and the CCS, the
commercial business, orders were up about 5% even though sales were down 5%. So, we're starting to see that recovery
that we had been talking about in non-res and again, we always say Otis is the leader and then CCS is a little bit later in

Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hi. Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Jay. If I can just circle back quickly on the
aftermarket. Greg, you talked a lot about the heavy overhauls for a while and it's nice to start seeing that. What's the
expectation and how long this can persist or the pent-up demand? Is this a six-month phenomenon or is this something
we can see throughout the year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, It's a great question, Peter. I think, again, it caught us a little bit by surprise in terms of
how strong the services business or the MRO business was at Pratt in the fourth quarter. But clearly, if you think about
it, over time with the airlines flying the hours that they have been flying and the dip that we've in spares over the last
couple of years, you'd expect this recovery to last at least go into the first half of this year. But I don't want to get ahead
of ourselves either. I think, you're going to – we still think 5% is probably a reasonable expectation for the aftermarket
to grow at Pratt & Whitney this year. Could it be better? It could. But I'd actually like to see another quarter or so of
this under our belt before we declare victory.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And Jay, just could you remind us, what's the aftermarket assumption for the year for
UTAS?

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Just had two quick ones. One, on the EPS guidance for '2014, I think
you had negative contingency at the high end, and then I think Greg you mentioned a couple of things on pension
currency, maybe a little bit benefit from the $100 million higher restructuring. Have you now established some positive
contingency at the high end of the EPS guidance?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, it's still stuck at the midpoint and you can do the math. So we think there is probably
about $200 million to $250 million of contingency at the midpoint at $6.70. So, there is a path to that high end today
that's a little bit more certain than it was six weeks ago, really because of pension and then currency here. So, the
restructuring gives us a little bit of opportunity. But it is January, so let's not get too excited about it. Bad things can
and will happen.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: I'll restrain myself, Greg. The 16% China Otis growth, you've baked into the guidance. Can
you remind us the dynamics of the backlog visibility for China versus the rest of Otis? Is it kind of six months that you
kind of have a 90% certainty on and then tails off in the second half?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes, Peter, six months to nine months is the typical rule of thumb that we use. Some do go longer
but six months to nine months is a typical visibility.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: It's similar in China to the rest of the business?

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So organic growth perked up finally in Q4 to the 4% level and I'm just wondering as you look
to...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: 4.5% to be specific.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I'm sorry?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: 4.5% if you want to be specific. Go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Right, okay. Well, as we look into 2014, just thinking through the quarters here, is this level
sustainable in the early part of the year or how do you see that playing out?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, I think again, the order rate that we saw exiting the year gives us confidence in the
organic growth. Obviously, backlog at Otis – I'm very confident at Otis. We've got 6% of a growth forecast for Otis this
year, I think that's almost like in the bag, because you still have to deliver it and you still have to see service recover a
little bit, but high confidence there. I think on the CCS side, we're forecasting 4% organic growth for the year.
Again, good backlog around the business on the non-resi side. The resi business looks to be good. Transicold looks to
be okay and as long as Europe remains stable and does not surprise us on the downside, I feel pretty good about that as
well. So, again, commercial OE, that all looks pretty solid for the year. So, I'm expecting pretty good growth
throughout the year.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: The challenges you're facing on the EPS line in Q1 are pretty much all restructuring and
earnings-related, EBIT-related but not really sales-related at all?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Exactly. It's really just these one-timers. Pratt had a little bit of good news last year, $0.05
[indiscernible] (47:08)
<A - Jay Malave>: [indiscernible] (47:10).
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: From a couple of contracts and then you had, of course, the gains last year versus the
restructuring headwind this year. So I just want to give you guys a heads up and it makes, personally the IR team to rest
easy and when we've got that out there, they can talk about it, but there is $0.20 plus of headwind going into the first
quarter.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And then just, my other question is on Goodrich. Could you give us an update on how
you finished the year in terms of synergies and what you're seeing, I guess, in real-time on the deal? What you're
expecting now in terms of the trajectory in 2014 and 2015 in terms of an update?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. So synergies, we're well on track. I think we ended the year, cumulative synergies at
about $270 million I think. So about $20 million ahead of what we had expected even in the middle of the year, when

we updated it last, so, a good synergy traction. We'll see another $100 million or so this year. I'll just remind you the
next tranche of synergies becomes more difficult, because it relates to moving facilities, product cost reduction and all
of those things. So, thank you, Alain and team have got their arms around this and I'm pretty confident that we're going
to see another $100 million, and then you'll see another almost $100 million in the next couple of years beyond that.

Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: On the growth you've seen in Otis China on the original equipment side, is it possible to parse
out how much of that is market share gain versus just the underlying market?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, and I don't know that I have that breakdown, Noah. I think, clearly, the market share
in China has stabilized through the course of the year. We think our share is somewhere around 15% or so, maybe 16%.
But the other market grew a lot stronger than what we had expected in 2013. So, a lot of that growth is just the market
acceleration.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on cash deployment. I know there are
placeholders, but the placeholders you have would generate a pretty large increase in the cash balance through the year;
and Greg, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, how much you've paid down debt since Goodrich. Can you just sort
of update us all on which buckets are most likely to see upside in terms of cash deployment this year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. We'll – I think, again, you've got the placeholder for $1 billion of share buyback, a
placeholder of $1 billion for M&A, a placeholder of $1 billion for debt paydown, dividends will be another, call it
about $2 billion. And as we see it today, I would tell you, the $1 billion of M&A is probably the squishiest number we
have out there just because the pipeline today is not terribly robust. But that can change. I think, again, you never know
what opportunity might be avail itself during the course of the year. So, we'll see what happens there. I'd just remind
you that the color of money for M&A is primarily outside of the U.S. because of the $2 billion CapEx spend this year, a
big chunk of which is here in the U.S. That's a big consumer of U.S. cash.
And again, the opportunity for us is working capital reduction. If we see a turn in inventory starting to come down, we
generate a little more cash. Clearly, we'd like to see that share buyback number go north of $1 billion again, and we'll
just have to see how that plays out during the year. But we don't want to see share growth again this year, although
there is a little tiny bit of forecast just with $1 billion of share buyback and the stock price where it is. We're still going
to get a little dilution from higher shares.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Is that less robust M&A pipeline just plain old lack of availability of assets? Or is it more – is it
the assets are there and there's an issue with pricing expectations?
<A - Jay Malave>: Well, there are lots of things out there for sale. But again, the focus really for this year, for last year
has been on execution. So, we haven't been really, I'd say, pushing very hard on the M&A front. We're obviously
always looking, but the focus is going to be again on execution this year. So if something comes up, I would tell you,
the prices have obviously accelerated dramatically in the M&A space, and we're going to focus in the core here. So, if
something avails itself to us, we'll certainly be in a position to do something. But I'm not hopeful you're going to see a
big M&A number this year. Not to say we're not looking though.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So, you've covered a lot of ground already. But just going back to the 2014 bridge, you've got $0.08
in for commercial OE mix. And I'm just wondering does the Bombardier CSeries push out, does that make the $0.08 a
bit more – maybe use the word squishy?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Squishy? I guess I did use that word. Yeah, obviously, it gives you a little bit of upside. I
think we talked about, as I said, $0.08 or about $100 million of negative engine margin. We'll pick up a little bit of that.
Again, it just adds to that contingency that we talked about at the midpoint, but it's not $100 million. It might be a
couple of pennies as we're going to pick up. We're still going to be shipping hardware this year. I think that Bombardier
continues to build aircraft. We're just not going to be shipping at the same rate that we had expected.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah, both UTC Aerospace Systems and Pratt both have upticks in commercial OE. UTC
Aerospace Systems has higher volume on 787 as well as A350, they're going to be delivering, that's still going to drive
some negative margin and Pratt just has higher commercial shipments. It really doesn't change that number
meaningfully at all.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. No, okay, that's clear. And then, the 80 bps at Otis. I'm assuming 50 bps on mix and perhaps
30 bps for the factory transition, but I'm just wondering are the service margins pretty stable year-over-year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Just – I think we would say they're down slightly for the year, that's again pricing pressure
that we saw in Europe.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned $2 billion on CapEx is the peak for 2014. Beyond 2014
Greg, do you think it sort of stabilizes at this level or do we come back down to a more normalized $1.6 billion, $1.7
billion?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, it should come down to this. This is really the year of the ramp. If you think about it, we
have to have the CapEx in place, the facilities in place this year, because we start delivering neo engines next year. So,
this is really the biggest year and we should see it, I would hope, come down $300 million, $400 million next year
although, don't – well I guess, you can quote me on it, but we'll see what happens.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, guys. That's great.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah.

Our final question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Greg, just on your Aerospace Systems, looking at the Aerospace OEM, that was with Boeing
pretty much at full rate on everything really this quarter with only the A350 yet to go. Is there an opportunity to take
out some of your inventory or working capital here now that we're at a fairly stable rate?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think that it's probably – as you look back on 2013, one of the, I would say,
disappointments is the inventory turns did not increase. And as production rates ramp up, we would certainly expect to
see the velocity if not the actual amount of inventory increase. So that's one of the focuses that Louis has this year is

inventory. Again, not reduction but turn rate improvement.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay. And then maybe just secondly on the engine side of things. You commented about the
technological progress on the Geared Turbofan, but I was wondering if you could comment on the market share and the
competitive situation of how it's held in versus the alternative engine on the A320?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think it – across the A320 family, I think it's a little bit north of 50%. On the A321s,
I think that the market share is much better than that. A little less on the A321 and – I'm sorry, the A319 family. So it
really varies by thrust class, but I think the GTF clearly has been the winner on the longer-range, higher-thrust variants.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Great. Thanks, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thank you.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. So I think we'll end it there as we approach the top of the hour. Just to remind everybody, a good year, 16% EPS
growth, good fourth quarter organic growth 4% and strong cash. So making great investments in E&D. We've got a
great backlog going into the year and it should be a very solid year for UTC. I want to thank everyone for listening. We
look forward to seeing you at our Annual Investor Analyst Meeting, and we're going to do it here at Hartford this year.
So we look forward to seeing you on March 13. Thanks very much.
