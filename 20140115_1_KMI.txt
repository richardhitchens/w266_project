MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Kinder Morgan Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode
until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has
any objections, you may disconnect. [Operator Instructions]
And I would now like to turn the call over to Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin, sir.
Richard D. Kinder
Thank you, Holly. Welcome to the Kinder Morgan analyst call. We'll be discussing Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll
refer to as KMI. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners referred to as KMP and El Paso Pipeline Partners referred to as EPB.
As usual, we're likely to make statements within the meaning of Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.
I'll give an overview of the results and recent developments as Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, will give the
details of business segment performance and discuss our backlog of future projects; and Kim Dang, our CFO, will go
through the financial details for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013, and then we'll take any questions you may
have.
And let me start with KMP. We raised the quarterly distribution on KMP to $1.36. For the full year 2013, we declared
$5.33 in distributions, that's up 7% compared to 2012 and 5% above our original plan for 2014 of $5.28. Our full year
DCF per unit, which we believe is an important way of measuring our success, was $5.39, up 6% from a year ago.
Indicating how strong our performance at KMP was, our total DCF was up 28% for the fourth quarter, 26% for the full

year. And segment earnings before DD&A was up 22% for the quarter and 27% for full year 2013.
Steve will discuss the drivers of this growth, but overall we were pleased with the performance of all five business
segments. But I think particularly noteworthy were the integration of the Copano and El Paso assets in our Natural Gas
group, a nice increase in refined products volumes at our Products Pipelines group, and increased oil and NGL
production in our CO2 segment, particularly at our SACROC Unit.
I'm also proud of the progress we've made on numerous growth projects at KMP that position us for a strong future.
We've detailed those in our earnings release, but especially important in my view were these recent developments.
First, the series of expansions on our Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate line running out of the Eagle Ford into the
Houston Ship Channel, where we have now committed about $1 billion in capital, and we have long-term commitments
for over 200,000 barrels per day when this capital is fully ramped up.
Secondly, our very successful binding open season on Tennessee Gas Pipeline for incremental north to south natural
gas transportation.
Third, our purchase of American Petroleum Tankers and State Class Tankers for $962 million which we expect to close
this month.
Fourth, our joint venture with Imperial Oil for a major crude to rail terminal in Edmonton, Alberta. And fifth, our letter
of intent with NOVA to construct a new NGL pipeline from Harrison County, Ohio to connect with our Cochin
Pipeline at Riga, Michigan, which in turn will transport the product to Windsor, Ontario. All these and a host of other
projects result in a backlog of $13.5 billion at KMP alone and I think bode well for continued growth at KMP for the
future. As we previously announced, we expect to declare distributions for 2014, a $5.58 per unit and that's up 5% from
2013.
At EPB, the story is not as robust, at least not in the short-term. Total distributions declared for the full year 2013 were
$2.55, that's up nicely 13% from 2012, but the distributable cash flow per unit was $2.62 for 2013, down from $2.82 in
2012. Cash generated by EPB's pipeline assets improved year-to-year and there were a number of moving factors there.
But the GP incentive paid to KMI increased by approximately $65 million as a result of higher LP distributions and a
slightly higher number of EPB units outstanding.
Also EPB faced some headwinds from two rate case settlements and from some contract renewals on some of our
Western pipelines. The significant recent development at EPB is that Shell has notified us that they will move forward
with phase two of the Elba Island LNG JV, which at max volume would involve an additional CapEx of around $500
million, bringing the total investment in that facility to about $1.5 billion. There will also be additional investment and
earnings for EPB from required expansion of pipelines connecting to that facility and other ancillary facilities. At EPB,
as we've previously stated, we expect to declare a distribution of $2.60 for 2014 and we expect to drop KMI's interest in
Gulf LNG and the Ruby Pipeline to EPB during 2014.
Let me turn to KMI. I think we had another fine year at KMI. Again, I believe the numbers speak for themselves. For
the full year 2013, KMI generated cash available to pay dividends of $1.713 billion, that's up 21% from 2012 and
exceeding our budget number of $1.632 billion. We declared dividends of $1.60 per share for 2013, that was up 14%
from 2012. And our cash available per dividends per share was $1.65 per share. With a total backlog of $14.8 billion in
projects at KMP and EPB, we think we have excellent growth in the future at KMI and that that growth will extend for
years to come. We expect to declare dividends for 2014 of $1.72, an increase of 8% over what we declared in 2013.
Now, I'd be remised if I didn't speak of one other topic before turning this over to Steve. While we had an excellent
year at the Kinder Morgan companies, both financially and operationally, our units and stocks underperformed the
market by a wide margin and perhaps we failed to adequately communicate our story, although we certainly tried, and
maybe we did communicate it and the message was not accepted. I don't know the answer to which it was, but I do
believe that particularly KMI and KMP, these securities are trading at the greatest disconnect to appropriate valuation
since the period in 2006 just before we took the first KMI private. Like now, back in 2006, we had an enormous
backlog of projects and like now many experts opine that we were too big to be able to continue to grow at an
acceptable rate.

We proved the doubters wrong the first time around and I anticipate the same result this time. Reflecting this belief in
the Kinder Morgan companies, as many of you know, I've been a buyer of KMI shares. I purchased over 800,000
shares in December alone.
So I guess my message to those who saw the story less positively was you sell I'll buy and we see who comes out best
in the long run.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with the project backlog. As Rich mentioned, we've been updating this
backlog really starting with the investor conference in January of 2013 and intend to do it probably quarterly going
forward.
In the fourth quarter, the backlog increased from $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion and this is a combined KMP and EPB
look. And we had that increase even though we had over $900 million worth of capital projects going to service and
come off the backlog during the quarter.
So the project additions grew the total backlog while offsetting the projects that went into service. The larger projects
that went into service were on our TGP system, both the Northeast Upgrade Project and the Marcellus Pooling Point
Project as well as some export coal terminal facility expansions in our Terminals business segment.
Now a few facts about how we put this backlog together. First, it's made up of those projects that we are highly
confident will get done. Not guaranteed but highly confident, high probability. We would expect to actually do more
projects and invest more capital than what we have in the backlog, but until we consider a project highly probable, we
don't add it in. So for example, we don't have in the backlog our current joint venture Y-grade project from
Pennsylvania to Texas. We believe that project is very attractive as a solution for producers in the Utica and Marcellus
and we're actively marketing it, but we won't put it in the backlog until we see strong indications of commitments
coming through.
Now, the business unit by business unit composition and change in the backlog is as follows. The Gas group went
down in the quarter from $2.9 billion to $2.7 billion, that's because we had over $500 million worth of expansions
come online in the Gas group during the quarter, and that was partially offset by additional expansions, primarily at
EPB, associated with our liquefaction JV with Shell at Elba Island and the associated pipeline expansions.
One other development to keep an eye on, we had a recent very deep freeze as everybody knows, a little over a week
ago, and we were able to keep all of our firm customers [ph] hold (11:00). We met all of our firm requirements
including two electric generators who had firm transport capacity on us. But as most of you know, there was a lot of
gas generation that was offline in the U.S. Northeast and was being replaced by more expensive and less
environmentally benign fuel sources.
What that tells us is that the U.S. Northeast needs a lot more firm transport, and we are actively dealing with customers
to try to put something together in the way of an expansion. We think it's going to drive additional investment
opportunities for us, but we're not yet putting it in our backlog.
The Products group, it's up slightly to $1.1 billion in the backlog due to projects further expanding our crude and
condensate network in the Eagle Ford. Terminals is up a little under $200 million since the last update to $2.3 billion.
We had a little under $100 million where the projects go into service and come off the backlog during the quarter. But
these were more than offset by the tanker buildouts associated with the Jones Act ships acquisition, some of which are
under construction, along with additional expansions of our crude by rail capabilities.
Now there is another point worth noting here that lot of activity in two hubs in North America, Edmonton and Houston,
and we're rapidly expanding our already large positions there. So in Edmonton, we're increasing our storage capability

by 50% to about 6.8 million barrels, and our huge position in the Houston Ship Channel by 26% to just under 40
million barrels capacity. So put that in context, we believe the largest independent liquids terminal facility in the world
in the Houston Ship Channel and we are growing that by 26% in capacity. So activities at those two hubs continue to
drive midstream investment opportunities for us.
CO2 source and transportation, the part of the business where we produced CO2 and transported for our use and for
third-party use, we continue to see strong demand. We're up slightly here on the backlog, but still rounds to $1.8 billion
as it did last time.
In our enhanced oil recovery portion of CO2, we're up to a little over $1.5 billion from a little under $1.2 billion in our
last update, primarily due to additional projects at SACROC and in our residual oil zone recovery new developments.
Now in this area, unlike the rest of our business where we're doing these expansion projects with a lot of third-party
contracts, this part of our backlog can change based on changes in our development plans and we had some changes in
those plans in the quarter.
And, of course, our biggest project is in Canada, the $5.4 billion Trans Mountain expansion unchanged from our last
update, but we did cross a key milestone in the quarter. We've got our voluminous Facilities Application on file with
the National Energy Board, which starts that process under a defined timeframe by the federal authorities and as we
seek approval for that project.
In our recent investor presentations, we've also divided our projects across the years and we've had some backend
loading associated primarily with TMX and some frontend loading associated primarily with just the newer projects
that we've gotten developed with kind of a hollowed out middle, if you will, 2014 and 2015 in the backlog. And that's
because it takes us a year or two to develop the projects. We said we would probably be filling in that middle as we
took projects from development stage into the backlog and that in fact happened. So, since January when we first did
this to the current update, we've added $2.4 billion worth of projects in 2014 and 2015. So bottom line is we're
continuing to find new opportunities that are more than offsetting the projects we're putting into service.
So now I'll go through the segment review and I'm just going to focus on 2012 full year performance versus 2012 and
then a little bit about the outlook. So starting with Gas segment, Gas segment of KMP was up 70% in 2013 on a
segment earnings before DD&A on a full year basis compared to 2012. That increase is the result of drop down
transactions TGP and EPNG and the closing of the Copano acquisition in May of 2013. And those acquisitions more
than offset the decline year-over-year associated with having divested certain assets in the Rockies associated with our
El Paso acquisition.
This segment also successfully and the corporate group as well successfully integrated the Copano assets and we
exceeded the economics in our acquisition model for the year. On EPB asset earnings before DD&A were up slightly
on a full year basis, the negatives, which Rich mentioned, electric generation on the SNG system and the impact of rate
case settlements were offset by the other EPB assets on a year-over-year basis.
Looking ahead here, we continue to be very bullish on the opportunities presented by our natural gas pipeline storage
and processing network. We had a couple of large projects come online as I mentioned. But we continue to add projects
and overall continue identifying capture opportunities and expansions that are driven by, one, exports Mexico LNG and
even Canada now, Eastern Canada. Two, the demand from electric generation and industrial and petchem uses. And
three, the need to transport gas out of the shale plays, primarily Eagle Ford and Marcellus. And our really epic open
season on Tennessee Gas Pipeline for backhaul capacity out of the Utica and Marcellus is evidence of that.
The headwinds in the Gas segment are rate cases and the decline in basis spreads on some portions of our network.
CO2 segment earnings here before DD&A were over $1.4 billion for the year, up 8%. Growth was driven by higher
volumes and higher prices. I think noteworthy here, oil volume growth was due to performance at SACROC, which
was over 32,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter, up almost 6% on a quarter year-over-year basis and on a full-year
basis. Growth also came from improved volumes at Katz and the addition of the Goldsmith Unit in 2013. Katz
averaged just under 2,700 barrels per day, that's up 56% from the average in 2012 and ended the year at around 3,500
barrels a day.

We continue to see a strong demand for CO2 and we brought on additional supplies in the quarter with the in-service of
our Doe Canyon source field expansion in Southwest Colorado which came in slightly better than budget, way ahead of
schedule and at higher production than planned. So very successful expansion there. And we continue to pursue several
large development projects to get more CO2 to our fields and to others.
In the Products group segment, earnings before DD&A were $784 million, that's up 12% versus last year, essentially
flat to plan. It was flat to plan even though it was negatively – essentially flat to plan even though it was negatively
impacted by the California Court of Appeals rate decision disallowing the tax allowance in the second quarter of 2013.
That was offset by strong performance at Cochin transmix and the terminals facilities within the Products segment. It
was very good work by the Products team to overcome that regulatory negative and get within 1% of plan for the year.
Also of note here is we're finally seeing some increase in refined products volumes on a year-over-year basis with
volumes up 6.3% with Plantation, 2.6% without Plantation in Q4 and 4.5% on a full-year basis. We also saw the first
material increase in volumes year-over-year on our Pacific system since 2007 and we were up 2.1% on a full-year basis
on the mainline volumes. Looking forward, we continue to add projects to the backlog in this segment primarily
building off our KMCC system in the Eagle Ford and with additions to our Cochin system – additional projects in our
Cochin system.
Terminals, here segment earnings before DD&A were $798 million, up 6% from 2012, but below plan. But this group
had, I think, even though being below plan, had a very good business development here in terms of laying the
groundwork for the future and developing additional projects. Highlights here, we started bringing online our BOSTCO
terminal project in the Houston Ship Channel and our Edmonton Terminal expansion. Those projects both had
expansions under contract before the first phase was done. So, again, highlighting the strong demand for our services in
those two locations. And again, we continue to identify and capture numerous opportunities for expansion there.
Kinder Morgan Canada segment earnings were $199 million for the year, down 13% from 2012 due to the sale of
Express and increases in book taxes. But the main story here continues to be the expansion of Trans Mountain from
300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels a day, expansions under long-term contracts approved by the NEB. We've got
our Facilities Application on file and we expect to complete construction still at the end of 2017.
And that's it for the segment overview. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Great. Thanks, Steve. Just going through the numbers. Looking at the first page of numbers in the KMP press release is
our GAAP income statement, and on that you can see the declared distribution today of $1.36, which results in a
distribution of $5.33 for the year.
I'm going to turn to the second page and walk you through our calculation of distributable cash flow and the drivers of
the growth. That distributable cash flow is reconciled to the GAAP numbers on the first page. The $1.36, we generated
DCF per unit, as Rich said, of $1.44 which was up 7% versus the $1.36 distribution. That resulted in $36 million of
coverage in the quarter consistent with what I told you last quarter. We expect to have positive coverage in the fourth
quarter. We also have positive coverage for the year. For the year, distributable cash flow per unit was $5.39, up 6%
versus our declared distribution of $5.33. That's $22 million in excess coverage for the year. That comes in just slightly
below our budget, $12 million below our budget of $34 million in coverage.
Total DCF $635 million in the quarter, that's up $140 million or 28% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. And just to
walk you through the pieces of that, the segments are up $279 million, or 22%, with approximately 70% of that $279
million or about $191 million of the increase coming out of the Gas group for the reasons that Steve mentioned.
$55 million is the growth in CO2, $27 million in Products, $23 million in Terminals. And then, as Steve said, Kinder
Morgan was down for the quarter about $17 million due to the Express sale and book taxes. Now as you know, book
taxes have no impact on our total DCF because in our calculation of DCF, we add back book taxes and subtract out

cash taxes and there was not a corresponding increase in the cash taxes. And then the Express sale overall is accretive
to KMP, just that it's negative in the segment. We used the proceeds to reduce debt and reduce our equity issuance and
so the benefit of that transaction shows up in other lines.
In the quarter, G&A expense was $127 million. That's $19 million increase in expense, that's largely associated with
the El Paso acquisition and the Copano acquisition. Interest expense was $225 million in the quarter, that's up $45
million. So $45 million in incremental expense in the quarter. That's primarily associated with balance, which is up on
average about $2.9 billion. And then in the quarter, we had increased sustaining capital versus the fourth quarter of last
year of about $6 million. So if you take the $279 million increase in the segments, you subtract out the $19 million
increase in G&A, $45 million in interest and $6 million on sustaining CapEx, you get to the $140 million increase in
distributable cash flow for the quarter.
For the full year, total DCF $2.24 billion, up 26% or $466 million. The segments generated $5.55 billion of earnings
before DD&A, up $1.17 billion or 27%. Similar to the quarter, Natural Gas Pipelines, they generated over 80% of the
growth. Natural Gas Pipelines was up $962 million with the biggest piece of that coming from the drops well north of
$800 million, close to $850 million came from the combination of the dropdown assets and including the half of
midstream that we bought from KKR.
CO2 for the year up $106 million, Products up $81 million, Terminals up $46 million and then Kinder Morgan Canada
down $29 million for the same reasons as I discussed that impacted the quarter. G&A expense for the quarter was $521
million, that's up $89 million versus 2012, also largely similar to the quarter, largely as a result that the El Paso
dropdown assets and the Copano acquisition.
For the full year versus our budget, G&A was $19 million incremental versus our budget, so $19 million negative
associated primarily with the Copano transaction. Interest expense was $850 million for the year, that's increased
expense of [ph] $218 (26:37) million and that's a combination of balance and rate on the – the balance on average was
up about $3.6 billion. And then on the rate, the debt associated with the dropdown transactions which was assumed
with those transactions was at a slightly higher rate than KMP's existing portfolio and that's largely what drove up the
rate.
Versus budget, interest expense was very close to budget within $2 million and that we had increased interest expense
associated with the Copano transaction and that was offset by increased capitalized interest as a result of incremental
expansion during – added to our expansion CapEx during the year.
Sustaining CapEx was an incremental $42 million in 2013 versus 2012 and actually came in about $12 million positive
versus our budget. Our budget was about $6 million of the $12 million was timing and about $6 million was
incremental, was positive capitalized overhead versus what we originally budgeted.
So that's KMP's DCF. Looking at KMP's balance sheet, I'm going to look at the bottom total debt, total net debt, we
ended the year at $19.5 billion in debt. That result in debt to EBITDA of 3.8 times consistent with where we told you
last quarter where we would end the year.
Our original budget was 3.7 times, but once we revised it to incorporate the Copano acquisition, we expected to end up
at 3.8 times. The change in debt for the quarter and for the full year, for the full year I'm going to reconcile to our actual
December 31, 2012 debt balance of $15.35 billion.
What you have on the balance sheet is consistent with GAAP but it's been restated. So it's not actually a recast for
common control accounting. So it's not our actual debt balance at December 31, 2012.
So, using the actual debt balance, the change in debt for the quarter was $458 million and for the full year it was $4.2
billion increase in debt. For the quarter, we spent cash on expansions and contributions to equity investments of a little
over $980 million. We issued equity of almost $440 million. We received insurance proceeds of about $48 million
associated with claims on Hurricane Sandy to rebuild the terminals in the Northeast, and we had coverage of about $36
million.

For the full year, we spent about $10.6 billion on acquisitions, expansions, and contributions to equity investments, and
then this also includes the first half of the debt associated with EPNG that came on to KMP's balance sheet when they
acquired the second half. We raised $6 billion in equity. And just as [ph] aside (30:12) we raised $1.1 billion in equity
through our ATM during the year.
Express proceeds were about $320 million net of tax. We unwound some swaps for $96 million. We had contributions
from our JV partners of $126 million. These are for investments or actually assets where we consolidate the asset, and
then we receive contributions for our partners for their share of the CapEx.
And then insurance proceeds for the full year $89 million and then we had a working capital use of capital of about
$234 million, which is largely associated with AP and AR, storage gas and also some of the acquisition expenses on the
Copano transaction. So that's KMP.
Turning to EPB. The first statement, statement of income, you can see our distribution of $0.65 which is up 7% result
in $2.55 for the full year, up 13%. So, turning to the second page of numbers, our calculation of distributable cash flow,
which like KMP is reconciled back to our GAAP income statement. We generated DCF per unit of $0.66 in the quarter
versus a distribution of $0.65, so about $2 million in excess coverage.
For the full year, generated $2.62 of DCF per unit versus $2.55 distribution, so about $60 million in excess coverage
and that's about $10 million below our budget due to the delay in the drop of Gulf LNG. Total DCF was $144 million,
down $19 million in the quarter. And just to walk you through that, the earnings for DD&A were $307 million in the
quarter that's down $11 million as both Steve and Rich mentioned primarily the rate cases on WIC and SNG are the
reason for the reduction as well as lower contract renewals on WIC.
G&A during the quarter, $20 million expense, that's about $3 million incremental from the fourth quarter of last year.
Interest is essentially flat. Sustaining CapEx was reduced expense at $15 million of about $2 million. The higher GP
incentive was $7 million and that gets you to the $19 million change for the quarter.
For the full year, the $569 million in DCF is a $21 million reduction versus a year ago, looking at the drivers there. The
assets generated about $28 million. You can see $20 million of that on the line earnings before DD&A, and then $8
million as a result of reduced non-controlling interest because we acquired the incremental interest in CIG. $20 million
decrease in G&A as a result of some cost savings. Interest was $11 million increased expense, primarily increase in rate
as we termed up debt associated with the May of 2012 drop downs towards the end of 2012. And then the GP incentive
was higher by about $66 million. The $28 million increase from the assets, about $40 million, so more than all of that
was associated with acquisitions and then that was offset by the rate case impacts and the other things that I mentioned
impacting the quarter.
That's EPB's distributable cash flow. Looking at EPB's balance sheet, we ended the year at total debt of $4.178 billion
that resulted in debt to EBITDA of about 3.8 times, that's up from the third quarter 3.6 times due to some timing on
working capital which I will go through in a second, but the 3.8 times is consistent where we expected to end and what
we told you last quarter.
The change in debt, for the quarter we had a $67 million increase in debt. We spent $28 million on expansions and
contributions to equity investments, and then we had coverage of $2 million in working capital and other items of a
little over $40 million. And the working capital is just timing on accrued interest and property taxes.
For the full year, we had a $55 million reduction in debt. We spent over $100 million – about $104 million on
expansions and contributions to equity investments. We issued $87 million of equity. We had positive coverage of $16
million. And then working capital for the full year was a benefit or a source of about $56 million.
Turning to KMI. KMI's distributable or cash available to pay dividends, $482 million in the quarter, that's up $43
million or 10%. That results in cash available per share of $0.46 and so versus our $0.41 distribution or dividend,
results in coverage of $55 million. The increase in cash available to pay dividends of $43 million, let me just reconcile
that for you quickly. The cash coming from our two investments in the MLPs and for the investment of KMP and EPB
was up $83 million in the quarter or 15%.

G&A was relatively flat, interest was a reduced interest of about $12 million, so it was a benefit and that's largely
associated with pay down in debt as a result of dropdown transactions. And then assets, the assets – the other assets that
we own, we had a reduction in the cash that we received from those of about $31 million as a result of dropdowns.
We had a $21 million increase in tax because of increased income that gets you to the $43 million. For the full year, as
Rich said, $1.713 billion in cash available to pay dividends results in cash available per share of $1.65, which is $49
million in excess of the declared dividend of $1.60. The $1.713 billion is an increase of a little over $300 million versus
the fourth quarter of last year, and is also in excess of our budget by approximately $80 million.
On the $300 million increase from 2012, the cash generated from our investments in the two MLPs, up $505 million.
G&A was increased expense of about $15 million as a result of a full year of the El Paso transaction. Interest expense
was increased expense of $27 million and that was the increased interest associated with the El Paso acquisition, offset
by the pay down and debt associated with the dropdown transaction to KMP.
The other assets or a reduction in income of $64 million as a result of the dropdown transactions, and then cash taxes,
an increase of $97 million associated with the increased income, and that gets you to the $302 million.
KMI balance sheet; KMI ended the quarter at $9.8 billion in net debt, that's down from $11.4 billion at December of
2012 – the $11.4 billion similar to what I explained on KMP is our actual ending debt balance at December of 2012.
What you see on the published balance sheet is a recast number.
So the $9.8 billion is – results in debt to EBITDA on a fully consolidated basis of 5.1 times and on a standalone basis of
about 3.5 times. The change in debt for the quarter and the year. For the quarter, we had a $48 million increase in debt
and that was we spent about $174 million on share and warrant repurchase. We had about $47 million in outflows
associated with some legacy El Paso items such as the marketing business and environmental. We had coverage of $55
million and then we had other items, a source of cash of $118 million with the largest piece of that or even more than
that being associated with the difference in the cash taxes that we have in the metric versus the cash taxes that we
actually pay.
Because we are in an NOL position, the cash taxes that we actually pay are much lower than what's in the metric. The
metric only assumes about a $300 million use of the NOL. For the year, the change in debt is $1.6 billion reduction. We
have $2.2 billion reduction from asset sales. We have share and warrant repurchase of, which is a use of cash of $600
million and almost $640 million.
We had a pension contribution of $50 million, investments in the MLPs including the units we took back associated
with the drop to KMP of $66 million. Contributions to equity investments, this was before we dropped most of the
investments to KMP was $49 million. The legacy El Paso we spent about $95 million, coverage was a positive $49
million and then we had working capital and other items of about – or inflow of $232 million. Again, all of this and
much more is associated with the difference between the taxes reflected in the metric and the actual cash taxes that we
pay.
So that's it for the numbers, Rich.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Darren, how are you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Hey, fine. Thanks Rich. Good afternoon. Two quick questions from me. The first, and I
recognize you're going to provide a lot more detail at the Analyst Day in a few weeks. But I'd like just your macro
thoughts on the downstream expansion on repurposing opportunities on KMCC. And I know that you've got that lateral
in Gonzales County, so that gives you access to the Ship Channel and also the joint venture with Magellan gets you
there as well as Corpus.
And Steve provided a lot of detail which we appreciate on all those terminal expansions. But when you think about the
overall demand pull that drives the export of higher end distillates and gas oil to areas like Latin America, let's just say.
If you could just outline the opportunity set and required capital that might be necessary in order to meet that demand
beyond 2015, that would be helpful.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, first of all, from a macro standpoint, of course, we continue to extend KMCC
outward into the Eagle Ford and one of the benefits of the Copano acquisition was the ability to connect KMCC to
Double Eagle.
And so we can now provide a producer with optionality. He can connect and either go all the way to the Houston Ship
Channel on KMCC or if he's in the right place go down Double Eagle to Corpus. So that's our initial contribution to
moving the condensate around. Obviously, I agree with you that the export refined products is increasingly in vogue.
We are handling a fair percentage now that in all of our assets along the Houston Ship Channel and we will continue to
expand that by more connectivity, by more berths that we are building and by more storage capabilities.
For example, in conjunction with the splitter which is an outgrowth of KMCC in which we're investing about $360
million per 100,000 barrels splitter that's fully subscribed by BP, we're building two sets of new tanks for that and that
will facilitate with the ability to move the split product out. It's not refined products, but it will facilitate that ability. So
I think we're pretty much on top of it given all the connectivity we have and I think we'll be able to continue to benefit
from what we see is a significant trend. Steve, anything else on that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, I mean the KMCC right now is about two-thirds full under contract, so there's more room
for shippers to get in there as Rich mentioned. It's interconnecting with Double Eagle, so there's really kind of a
network down there now connecting either Corpus or the Houston Ship Channel. And then in connection with the
splitter project, we're putting in three new cross channel lines between Galena Park and Pasadena adding to the existing
cross channel lines we have there about five, I think.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Six.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Six? Okay. And with BOSTCO, we're adding ship docks, adding 12 barge berths looking at the
potential to connect Pasadena and Galena Park with BOSTCO, all those things, it's very hard, Darren, to say well how
much total capital will you put to work there, it's really a question of how much growth there is, it looks like there's
going to be a lot and what customers will sign up for, but we're very happy with the network that we've got and its
expandability.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Right. I appreciate that. And Steve, last question, I just want to go back to the comments
that you made about TGP's open season for that backhaul capacity out of the Northeast and I know that you said in the
prepared comments, you're looking at additional expansions there, but can you just give us an idea as you're looking at
basis differentials and talking with producers, what you think the scale and scope necessary to meet that production
profile to get incremental gas to the Gulf Coast could be, because it seems like recognizing you're not going to build it
before commitments are signed, but it seems like it could be significantly larger than existing capacity in the ground?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: That's – we believe that is absolutely true. And so, we're out talking to the market right now
about another potential expansion. I'm sure others are as well. It may have as much to do with how much gets expanded
into New England. So how much of the gas ends up going in that direction or into the Northeast generally. But we were
– I guess, maybe some people said they weren't surprised, I was surprised. It was a very strong open season and it has
prompted us to start very quickly on the next round and I think we just have to see whether the first ones are cheaper,

the next ones are more expensive. We have to see if the customers are there for a higher price point and they may not
be immediately, it may take some time and some build-up and some ramp-up and production in the Utica for people to
really get a sense of what they have, but we expect there is more to come. Tom, do you want to add anything to that.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I mean I think [indiscernible] (46:59) that we're doing out there [indiscernible]
(47:01) Bcf maybe closer to 2 Bcf, [ph] not (47:08) all of that is something we'll get, but I think it's certainly a
representation of what kind of scale is out there and we're certainly – option that we have to get back to the Gulf Coast
and/or taking to the....
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Look, what's happening is that the production of Marcellus and Utica, as all of you on this
call know is so huge that while there is need for more connectivity into the Northeast, particularly New England, the
amount of production there is in the process and has already in some respects swamped the demand that can be sucked
up by the Northeast. And so lines like Tennessee are obviously going to become in some respects bifurcated lines. They
are going to move a huge chunk of gas downstream from the producing areas of Marcellus and Utica into the [ph]
Northeast (48:00). And then as we found in this open season, we're going to move a lot of gas south to where we think
the huge demand is going to be down here along the Gulf Coast with all the new downstream facilities being built. So, I
think, it's a very good opportunity for us. The caution would be that obviously, as Steve said, that the cheapest
expansibility, the low hanging fruit is always the first one and that's why I think we were so tremendously
oversubscribed in the open season, but now we're working to see what the next level of demand is, and I think we'll
capture some of it, certainly others will capture some too.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Thank you.

The next question comes from Brian Zarahn with Barclays. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey Brian. How are you doing?
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Good. Looking forward to seeing everyone in two weeks. First question is on the
long-term distribution growth guidance. Is that unchanged with 9%, 10% in KMI and 5% to 6% in KMP and EPB? And
is that from a full year 2012 base?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: So right now, we're going to be able to give you more of update on that – we're right now,
that's certainly the last, the guidance we've given and we've talked about that 5% to 6% at KMP and 9% to 10% at
KMI, and now in preparation for the conference in a couple of weeks, we're now updating that and extending [ph] it to
KMI (49:25) through 2018. So we'll have an update. We haven't even completed running those numbers, but that will
give you horseshoes and hand grenades look from 2014 out through 2018, and we'll have it for you at the conference.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay, we'll stay tuned on that. On dropdowns, what are your thoughts regarding FGT,
previously you mentioned that would be dropped this year. It seems like it's going to stay a little bit longer at KMI. So,
any color around the ownership of FGT long-term?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: No. Right now, we're keeping it – we've budgeted for the year staying up at KMI. We're
just going to continue to look at it. We're going to drop the two other assets to EPB this year and we just haven't made a
decision on when we [indiscernible] (50:15).
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. And on the marine transportation acquisition, can you provide some color on to
the strategy and expanding to that business and about the timing of the EBITDA ramp-up from the $55 million now I
guess to the $140 million or so you're expecting?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Happy to. I think some people look to that as this was a big step out for us and although I
think most people saw through as to what our real reasoning is, but let me just take you through it. We are in the
midstream transportation business and the greatest single opportunity and why, in my roughly 35 years in this business,
this is the most interesting time we've had is we have all this tremendous increased production coming from areas, and

this is true across the board, whether you're talking about crude oil or natural gas, condensate or indirectly even refined
products. We have a tremendous need to transport that from new production areas to market areas. And there are a lot
of ways of moving it and we're primarily a pipeline company of course. And so, the cheapest, most effective long-term
way of moving with all these products is by pipeline.
That said, and we've discussed this before, there are a lot of reasons, some of it is infrastructure not being built on a
timely basis or permitting delays, some of it is optionality that producers or others want. But there are reasons why
pipelines don't satisfy everybody's need. An outgrowth of that is obviously crude by rail. Another outgrowth of that is
the Jones Act and that's why we're pretty bullish on this area.
If you think about it, if you're talking about moving crude oil, for example, from the Eagle Ford, very simple to take it
down to Corpus and you can put it on a barge and move it over here in Houston or over to New Orleans or you can put
it on a Jones Act ship and take it up to the refineries in the Northeast. And, I'm sure you've seen these figures, and I
maybe off a little bit on the numbers, but in 2011 there were something like 5,000 barrels a day moving out of Corpus.
This year, in 2014, I think the projection is something along the lines of between 350,000 and 400,000 barrels a day
moving out of Corpus.
Now, some of that will go by barge, some of that will go by Jones Act tanker. So, we think this is an asset, the Jones
Act tankers, that are very important to the energy infrastructure and there are at least two or three ways in which they're
going to grow, the demand for them is going to grow. One is some of the Bakken crude, as you know, is now being
shipped by rail, or at least there's talk of this going to Oregon and Washington and then going down by ship to the L.A.
and San Francisco refineries. We think that will see some growth. Obviously another area of growth is as the Panama
Canal is completed, increasingly we're talking to people, no firm commitments, who think that they will use Jones Act
tankers, that have to be Jones Act, to take production out of Texas and move it through the canal and back up to
California.
And then finally, of course, the Colonials line is completely full on refined products, there may be opportunity to move
refined products. So I think that's what's driving the increase in day rates, as you know and we showed I think in our
release. Our average day rates under these long-term contracts are in the $55,000 to $60,000 per day range. The market
today is at least $70,000 and Exxon just did a one year charter which was publicized about two weeks ago for $100,000
a day. And that was for one year, not five years. But we think there is going to be increased demand. We think this is a
nice place to be in.
We have a good operator who is doing the operator ship for us. So we look at this as an adjunct, another alternative in
the area of transportation that we can offer our customers and we think it's going to pay real dividends for us and we
like the fact that we have a whole lot of this cash flow locked in including all of the new ships being built.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: And on the – I appreciate the color – on the ramp-up to $140 million of EBITDA, is that
sort of a 2017 timeframe, would you expect?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Dax, do you want to?
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: November of 2015 through October of 2016 are the vessels will be coming on.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: So, by everybody – all the new vessels will be on by the end of 2016, right.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: So, it ramps up and I think it's actually more than...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, it's about $146 million.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: ...$146 million that we expect for 2017, once they're all in.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay, great. And just lastly from me, can you update the number of warrants
outstanding at KMI?

Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hello, Ted. How are you doing?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Hey, doing well. Thanks, Rich. Hey, I want to follow up on some of your opening comments
there and the underperformance of the stock and talking about how you think it's cheap. Maybe you can be a little more
specific around any kind of actions that you might actually be able to take. It seems like you alluded to it, but I'm just
wondering, if you can give us anything more there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, the action I hope is that you guys will be so impressed with our performance that the
stock price will rise meteor-like. But, somehow, I don't see that happening in the next 24 hours anyway.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: You never know.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: What we're looking at trying to do a better job of communicating the story. I'm [ph]
befuddled (56:25) because we have this tremendous backlog and each of these projects has so much potential. If you
take the Trans Mountain expansions, and you look at the spread between our cost of capital, what we're going to make
on an unlevered basis on $5.4 billion and start calculating that and then split it between KMP and KMI and that alone is
a huge growth mover.
If you look at some of the projects in the CO2 field where we're bringing all this additional CO2 on and the new
developments in the ROZ, on the other end of it, tremendous growth. We just took our board on a tour of the Ship
Channel yesterday right here in Houston. Kinder Morgan is spending $1.8 billion along the Ship Channel. That's the
total projects, along there both in the Terminals and the Products group. All of these are coming online. We'll build the
rest of KMCC. We started out with one commitment on Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate, which was from
Petrohawk, now BHP, for 25,000 barrels a day the first year, and 50,000 barrels a day thereafter. And that justified a
15% unlevered return on a $220 million investment which as you know we converted some of our natural gas lines to
hold down the cost of the investment.
Today, we have extrapolated that into spending $1 billion in the area. We now have long-term commitments for over
200,000 barrels a day, and we're going to be adding volume on top of that. That led to the splitter, indirectly led to the
reversal of Cochin which is about a $300 million project. You look at what we just signed up with NOVA to connect
into Cochin to the east end of Cochin, we'll be spending $300 million or so building a pipeline there. It too will have
expansibility.
So I look out there and I see this huge damp footprint across North America and every time we turn around, we see
more ability to extract value out of it. But I guess I haven't been successful in convincing the rest of the world of that
because a lot of people don't see it. That's where we think we have such an advantage and such a growth profile for the
future. That's why I have never sold a share; I just keep on stupidly buying more. But that's the guts of it, Ted, and I
don't know what we – again, we try to make these points. I'm looking at some of Kim's preliminary presentation for
two weeks from now. I mean it makes me sit up and take notice. When you look at the tremendous growth next year,
we have a growth that's sustaining CapEx next year, which we built from the bottom up, which is a little over $100
million growth in sustaining CapEx at KMP, if we had held the sustaining CapEx flat to this year, if you just take a
$100 million and divide that out for what it would have done for KMP and KMI, it would have been a whole different
story. So, we're going to try to do the best job we can of explaining, but we think this is an incredibly strong story. And
again, look at the footprint and look at the opportunities to expand off of that footprint.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: That's very helpful and I appreciate all the color there. Next question from me is just thinking
about your Y-grade pipeline out of the Marcellus, and I guess I'm a little worried here about any abandonment issues

you might have with the FERC. You just mentioned that there's tremendous demand to move gas north to south, is
there any risk that the FERC say, hey, we need to keep this pipeline in gas service and we can't take it out to service?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, look, we're in a very good position there, Ted. This is a pipe that's in-demand, and it's in
demand for gas service. And we think, it maybe in demand for Y-grade service. And so, that does raise the concern that
you identify, but we do think and what we're aiming for is the prospect of doing a further expansion on TGP to move
additional gas out and still be enable to make room for the Y-grade. Now, we'll have to do it realistically and the
Y-grade line will have to pay for or bear some of the burden of making sure that there's additional capacity on TGP to
replace what's being used, but we're shooting for both. We're shooting for the expansion of gas service and Y-grade
conversion. But you are highlighting a good problem to have, which is we've got pipe in the ground that's in demand.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: And on these sort of backhauls, are you just basically charging max rates, is that the way we
should think about that on TGP now for the gas?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Max rates, I mean they're – the market rates and they're going up, so.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: So you've got some headroom effectively, if you wanted to go to max, is that fair?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: [indiscernible] (61:36). Okay? Did I answer your question, Ted?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah, no, sorry, I was just asking if there's a lot of room between sort of market and max, I
guess, that's what I'm trying to ask, get out of there and...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: He didn't hear the answers.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. No, there's room, I can't get into the specifics, but yes, we've got somewhere between
the market rates and the max rates.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it, sorry I didn't [indiscernible] (62:05).
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: This is actually forward moving. We're actually physically moving molecules from north to
south.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And I think the market continues to refer to it as backhauls, but as an old pipeline, this is
really a forward haul and that those molecules are going to end up in the Gulf Coast, tremendous demand for that and
as Steve says it's [ph] way of a (62:25) nice problem to have.

The next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hello, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi. Good afternoon. Looking forward very much to getting together and hearing that wonderful
presentation done in Houston.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, well, Kim's going to be the star. We're just the supporting cast, but go ahead.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: As always. So a couple of different questions. Let's start maybe with LNG. How is the FTA
contracting going for Gulf LNG? Any update on how you guys see authorizations coming through for non-FTA
requests for Gulf and for Elba. And can you remind us if you do get that, just how large can the growth pipeline
expand?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, there is a lot of things assumed in that question. First of all, let's look at our efforts as
an LNG developer. The right way to think about Elba Island, even though we're certainly like everybody else applying
for non-FTA is we don't need non-FTA for that.
And Shell, in December, just exercised its option on the first part of phase two. Now, there is another option that can be
exercised till the end of this year. But all of that, and if they exercise their second option, we will end up there with a
project on [indiscernible] (63:56) basis something in the $1.5 billion range. And it will be moving about 350 million
cubic feet a day through there, that's relatively small by LNG standards, but it's a very nice project for us. We own
51%, Shell owns 49%. And in addition to that, it gave us the opportunity to spend money on other infrastructure
necessary to get the LNG there and the associated facilities around the terminal. So, it's more than just our 51% of $1.5
billion or so. So, great opportunity for EPB.
On the Gulf LNG, we continue to look at opportunities there. We talk to customers. And we don't have anything to
announce anything at this point. Another big part of the LNG story, of course, is the ability of our pipeline network to
serve the LNG facilities, particularly those along the Gulf Coast. And we'll have a role at [ph] Magnolia (65:00),
assuming that gets built. We think we'll have a role at Cheniere. Some of the additional trains at Cheniere five and six.
We certainly believe we will furnish a significant part of the gas at Freeport. And so all along here we have as many
miles of pipeline or more than anybody else and the ability to connect all kinds of sources of supply and get it to these
LNG facilities. And in the long run that maybe the greatest opportunity for the Kinder Morgan family of companies.
We're going to continue to look at opportunities at Gulf LNG; we'll see how it plays out. We don't do anything unless
we get firm commitments on it. So we'll see there, but the opportunity for serving these facilities through our pipeline is
enormous, it comes back to what I was saying a question ago which is the size and scope of our footprint.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And let me follow up on Brian's question about Citrus, how full is FGT now. Is there
still that – what was it, 20%, 30% capacity on the old phase eight expansion that was originally un-contracted and does
the tax status have any implications of any dropdown decisions
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Dax, do you want to answer that [indiscernible] (66:19)?
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: [indiscernible] (66:21) Rich.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, the first question was on the capacity, is there any remaining on phase eight and the
answer is yes, I'm not sure what the percentage is. And then the second question was on tax status.
<A - Dax A. Sanders>: Yeah, there is approximately 184 day remaining of capacity that we're still in a little bit of
uninterruptable basis. And we're constantly looking at the market to see what we might be able to sell on a current
basis. We've had conversations with several people, tough to tell, we're getting things done on a near-term basis. And
from a tax perspective, we certainly – we have some NOLs and some depreciation associated with the phase 8
expansion that we'll be running out over, call it, the next four, five years and the cash tax obligation of Citrus will
ramp-up over what I'd call the next four years pretty substantially, so.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And last line of questioning is around EOR ops. I noticed the nice bump sequentially
from third quarter for Katz. Is that finally kind of on track with the modeled performance and was the 9% jump from
the third quarter in SACROC expected or well ahead of expectations? Looked like a nice jump there and if the market
continues to be flustered by that business which I don't understand why since you've had it for so many years and it's a
smaller part of the business today, but if it is would there be any way to monetize a portion of the assets to reduce the
overall size, minimize production rollover concerns and help fund the growth projects?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Let me start with Katz. We believe Katz is on track. There are no guarantees, but certainly
we've just went through a review a few days ago with the CO2 team. We think it's in good shape and moving up. As we
said so many times, it was a delayed response, but we believe we'll get the same amount of barrels out of there as we
expected when we first developed it. It's just they're coming a little later.

SACROC, we've said before, the old phrase that Tim Bradley taught me, which was, big deals get bigger. And I think
that's what we're finding in SACROC. We're just finding a lot of additional opportunities to drill there. A nice increase,
that increase is continuing through January. We're averaging between 32,000 barrels and 33,000 barrels a day there. I
don't think anybody on this call has mentioned the fact that also last year we set an all-time annual record on the NGL
side at about 19,500 barrels a day of NGLs associated with SACROC. So, it's going very well and we think we're going
to have additional opportunities to continue to grow SACROC.
I think monetizing these assets would be very difficult. We're not in a game of selling things, we're in the game of
buying and expanding. And so, we don't have any intension of doing that now. And you're quite correct, I mean, CO2,
we hold it to higher level of expected return than our pipelines investments and rightly so, and it's declining part in
terms of the overall company. We're happy to have it, it's a good asset. And remember, a big chunk of it and a big
chunk of the future growth there is not on the EOR side, it's over there on the S&T side, where we're finding some
really good ability to produce more CO2 and get it to the Permian Basin.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Right. And one last follow up on that EOR question, can you update us, it seems like propane's
recovering, even ethane pricing some degree, can you talk about what's you're seeing in terms of trends there and also
for the basis differentials?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Jim Wuerth?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah. We are seeing – we typically look at NGL as a percentage of crude and obviously
that's climbing up primarily driven by propane, and we continue to see that we expect that to continue to happen over
the next few years.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Yeah.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, John, how are you?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Doing well, Rich. And, hope – it sounds like things are continuing to move forward. Just
following up a couple of the earlier questions, just I'm curious on the TGP expansion on the gas side. And then,
comparing that to the proposal to move NGLs, I'm just curious which opportunity do you view as bigger? The further
backhaul opportunity or with the NGL transport opportunity, would you view that as larger?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I guess, I would say, John, it's bigger if we can do both, and so, we're trying to figure out
a way to do both. And that is a function of being able to expand our backhaul, our gas backhaul capacity on TGP, and
still leave room for a Y-grade option, and that's really the path that we're on. Now, the thing that we have – there are a
few things that have to come together in order to make that happen, the biggest one of which is that Utica and
Marcellus producers have to be ready to commit.
And so, as you know, we extended the open season, we and MarkWest extended the open season on the Y-grade line,
and – to the end of February and we're working actively with customers. We think it's a good project. We think it's a
good solution. I think MarkWest – I know MarkWest thinks it's a good solution and a necessary outlet for producers
out there. But, it sometimes takes a while to have that materialize into commitment. But our approach is we think there
is a way to do both. And so, that's what we're pursuing right now, but it's not entirely within our hands, it's up to the
market in part.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay, fair enough. I mean, can you comment at all on what you think might be, what's
causing the hesitation to commit or is that something you can't talk about?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well. No, I mean, I think it's – look, if you look at the numbers, people are projecting 1 million
barrels additional NGL volume coming out of the Marcellus and Utica or the [ph] Martica (73:21), I guess, the

combined play. And, if that's the case, I mean you can fill up two pipelines expanded. Right? But there is a time lag
between projections and projections coming through and people being confident in what they have, and needing an
outlet and signing up for an outlet.
And so it's really just a function of, I think, a natural producer. They're working – not so sure it's a hesitation – they're
working first on their production and figuring out how to get it out of the ground and what it is that's coming out of the
ground. And then, they start looking for their downstream solutions, and that's a question of timing. They're going to
need them. We're convinced they're going to need them. We're convinced that an outlet to Mont Belvieu is going to part
of the answer, but they have to be prepared to sign up.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay, that's really helpful. And then, what the – moving over to SACROC, with the
increased production you're seeing and maybe you'll get – cover this further at Analyst Day. But as far as, you keep
pushing out the year when you see production rolling over. Is it fair to say that that's going to be pushed out further
once again? And, is it now going to be pushed out to say somewhere around 2018 or so, if you could talk a little bit
about that?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah, I think there's a number of things that are obviously impacting the infields we're
finding from some of the seismic we've run are working out very well. We still have a lot of opportunities there. Our
platform area is doing better recovery than we expected. We're doing some horizontals up there that are looking really
good. These horizontals will allow us to go back in and pickup some bypass pay. This will extend SACROC out several
more years and we'll get into that in the conference, but I think you'll be surprised how many years out it will extend it.
Our Harvest wells continue to do well. In fact we are backing off of those a little bit, just to – we started those when we
needed CO2. CO2, now we've kind of got with Doe Canyon coming on at full strength. We've got a little bit more CO2
coming into the basin, so we backed off the Harvest a little bit, not doing as many as those as we had planned this year
or next year probably, but still we're around the 2,900 barrels a day with the Harvest well, so that's a good project there
too.

Next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good afternoon.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: I was just wondering, I had a couple of questions. If you're looking at the Natural Gas
Pipeline segment and you took out what happened with the Copano acquisition, just wondering how that baseline
business stacked up against the original budget for the year, if you have that available.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Sure, I think Kim covered that. [ph] take through (76:27).
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: I can take you through it. So, Natural Gas versus its budget or versus the original budget
was up about 10% without Copano. Without any benefit of the Copano acquisition, it would have been down about 3%.
And the reason that it would have been down was poor performance out of our trading business, lower storage revenues
coming on our Texas Intrastates and then our investment in EagleHawk, our 25% investment in a JV with BHP didn't
ramp-up as quickly as we expected it to in our budget.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. Great. And then for Kinder Morgan Canada as well, how do things look if you
excluded the impact of the Express-Platte sale?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: If you exclude – and Express has an impact on Trans Mountain as well, because we had
a management fee that Trans Mountain was getting. And so, if you just look at Trans Mountain, other than the loss of
revenue from Express, Trans Mountain would have been on its budget.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. That's it from me. Thank you.'

The next question comes from Kevin Kaiser with Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Hey, the first question I have here is on the Natural Gas segment, transport volumes were
down 5% year-over-year in the quarter and gathering volumes down to 3.4% year-over-year in the quarter, can you talk
about what's driving that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I think at least on the gas transport side, I think it was -- and Tom you correct me, we had
record electric generation volumes associated with relative coal to natural gas pricing. That was probably a contributor,
not sure if that was the whole story there...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: In 2012 versus 2013.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, in 2012 versus 2013, right. I think our sales volumes were actually up. So I think you
may be right on transport and gathering, but the sales volumes were up on the Texas Intrastates. And then gathering
probably a function of the KinderHawk or the KinderHawk volumes. And so both on the transport side, and in that case
if that's the explanation that KinderHawk, we have minimum commitment, so it's demand based on the gas
transportation side and it is take or pay, effectively demand based on the KinderHawk asset as well, contract
minimums.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. Moving to the CO2 segment, what was the EOR side – in the EOR side of that business,
what was capital expenditures in the fourth quarter? Total CapEx for EOR in 4Q 2013?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: I don't have it with me. Hang on a second.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: [indiscernible] (79:36) EOR versus the rest of CO2.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Go to your next question and we'll see if we can find it.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. And KMP, what's the coverage guidance for 2014, DCF versus the guided distribution?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We haven't given it yet and we're going to go through the entire budget in two weeks at
the Analyst Conference or a week and a half, two weeks at the Analyst Conference.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Including the expected coverage.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And expected coverage on KMP, EPB and KMI.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. The last question I have is, have you considered amending KMP's partnership
agreement for how sustaining capital was defined there? I mean, if you look back at it when the partnership agreements
put in place, there wasn't [ph] E&P (80:24), there wasn't shipping, there wasn't coal royalties, so do you think that
amending that partnership agreement would be appropriate to protect the limited partners from dilution?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I don't think we have any present plans, Kevin, to change the partnership agreement. We
think it works very well, something that's put into effect to 1992, long before we bought it. And, we think it does a
good job of protecting the limited partners.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We think our limited partners have gotten a very nice return over those 12 years.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: [ph] Yeah, I agree with you. (80:57)

<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And we expect them to continue to get a nice return in the future. The expansion capital
for 2013 for the S&T business was a little over $200 million and we spent about $675 million total in CO2.

<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: S&T and then the rest would be oil and gas.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yes, about $475 million.

total CapEx in there was about $330 million, $340 million, the total DCF on a combined basis was a little over a $1
billion.

Thank you. And our last question that I'm showing comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line
is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hello, Becca.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Good afternoon guys. On EPB, flat distribution this quarter and your guidance is for flat
distributions for the rest of 2014, can you talk about what visibility you have on being able to maybe increase that
distribution beyond 2014?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Again, we're going to take you through all of that in two weeks at the conference and that's
we're working on now looking as I said across all of the companies out through 2018. But, horseshoes and hand
grenades, the key thing on EPB is that, it's relatively flat, it has very good solid contracts, but has some headwinds
relatively flat. It obviously has – we'll get a nice bump when the Elba Island assets come online. But we're going to take
you through that, like I said, we're running numbers out through 2018, and going to be able to take you through on all
three companies in two weeks.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thanks, and then on SACROC. It's probably the biggest bump in production that I've seen on a
quarter-to-quarter basis, is that – I think you spend – I just want to clarify, is that largely being driven by horizontal
drilling?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah, that's particularly in the north platform. One of the things we're seeing there is the oil
bank was probably pushed more towards the well bores prior to us even injecting because there have been CO2 injected
in that area back probably in the late 1990s with [ph] Penn's Energy (83:20). So CO2 had already been on the ground
and that's the upside on this as we're seeing that in tight zones, that's the longer the CO2 sits in there, it starts making
that oil bank.
And we drilled some horizontals. We had trouble getting – delays in getting permits from the Railroad Commission for
two or three months and we were producing 400 barrels, 500 barrels a day out of those horizontals that we're using now
as injectors. So, that gives you an idea of the oil bank that was already there, and that's what gives us a huge
opportunity for some of the bypassed oil back in some of the other areas and in Bullseye and so forth where we put a
lot of CO2 into the Middle Canyon, and just didn't produce the barrels out that we thought we would. There is a great
opportunity to go in with horizontals and get that back in there.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Can you speak to how many horizontals you drilled during the quarter?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: I believe we drilled four during the quarter.
<Q - Becca Followill>: And then, any plans for 2014?

<A - James P. Wuerth>: We've – can't remember all of them. I know we've got a couple of that we're going into test
the bypassed oil. And then, I think we've got just in our regular development up in the platform area, I think we've got
four or five of them set to go there.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then, last question on the per unit DD&A in the CO2 business, it looks like it
was a sizable drop quarter-to-quarter, about $2 a barrel. Anything in particular going on there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Drop in the DD&A...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Per unit.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: ...per unit.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: I think the key thing there was just the additional barrels that we've produced in – at
SACROC, lower rate that we've been able to push in there. We've got a lot more barrels. The infrastructure is now
getting to a point where we're not having to add a lot of extra infrastructure to get to additional oil and so that, over
time, is just going to push that rate down.
