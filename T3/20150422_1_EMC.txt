Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Today,
we are joined by EMC's Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO; and
Zane Rowe, EMC's CFO. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the market environment and EMC's vision,
strategy and execution. Zane will then discuss the consolidated EMC results and some additional details regarding our
performance. David then will provide some commentary on the EMC Information Infrastructure business, what he is
seeing in the market and the Q1 performance. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your
questions.
We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2015. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and
discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful
in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your

that, it's now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony. I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q1 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. Our take
on Q1 was mixed. We were pleased that we slightly beat our Q1 non-GAAP EPS board plan as we achieved $0.31 per
share. On the other hand, we were disappointed that we fell a bit short of our Q1 revenue plan, approximately $75
million short.
This $75 million revenue shortfall occurred in our storage business. That said, our storage product backlog did increase
by $100 million year-on-year, right on plan. David will give you a lot more color on our storage business in a little
while, but I want to make it clear that we could have and should have made this revenue plan and we offer you no
excuses. About two-thirds of this miss was due to the fact that we did not execute as crisply as we normally do. The
other third was due to negative geo-political effects in Russia and China that slowed down bookings. China and Russia
aside, we understand what we need to do better. We have taken corrective actions and David and the team are confident
they will meet their FX adjusted board plan for the year.
Let me now turn and comment on the IT market and customer spending trends. Overall, the IT market is pretty much
playing it out like we thought it would. Customers are very focused on building their new digital agendas and in effect,
become true digital enterprises. This digitalization is changing the way enterprises are building their products, the way
they service their products, the way they sell and the way they interface with their customers, partners and supply
chains. And as such, more IT spend is being pushed toward this priority.
And it goes without saying that in this digital era, every enterprise is increasing their focus on cyber security as the
surface area for attacks will expand geometrically.
To help fund these two areas, CIOs are searching for ways to reduce costs and increase efficiencies in their current
infrastructures and legacy applications, while maintaining and even enhancing overall quality and performance.
Collectively, these top three IT priority mandates helping build a digital agenda and increase focus on cyber security,
and relentlessly driving lower cost and improved efficiency in legacy applications and data center operations are
causing the biggest secular shift in the history of IT. And we have been equally as clear that while this shift is very
disruptive, it is also extremely opportunity rich.
To better prepare ourselves to capitalize on the vast opportunity side of the secular shift, we have moved to our
Federation model to increase focus and effectiveness and made a number of medium and long-term strategic
investments on behalf of you, our shareholders: investments we believe will pay off handsomely, investments in a new
modern open cloud developers platform and a new data fabrics and data platforms, investments in advanced identity
protection and verification technology and security analytics and in technology that helps assure proper governance and
compliance around cyber security, investments in mobile device management security, investments in hybrid cloud
solutions that include software defined compute, software defined networking, software defined storage and advanced
management orchestration and automation technologies, investments in converged infrastructure in new flash and
scale-out x86 appliances, and investments in sales, support and service that assure we meet and beat our customer
expectations.

In short, these investment areas have given us a compelling technology advantage, which is well recognized and
regarded by our customers throughout the world. At our recent Strategic Forum on March 10, we highlighted six new
strategic products and/or businesses that further strengthen our ability to help customers meet their top IT priorities,
namely AirWatch, NSX, Pivotal, ViPR, ScaleIO, Elastic Cloud Storage, DSSD and XtremIO. And we promise to
regularly update you on their progress. To refresh your memory, we said that collectively these six areas would
generate $2 billion in revenue for us in 2015, which represents 100% year-over-year growth. I am pleased to report
that, in Q1, these six businesses together grew well over 100% year-over-year and they are on target to meet their $2
billion goal.
The key metrics I continue to look at to determine our Federation traction are the number of large multinational
companies and the diverse set of industries that are relying on Pivotal, VMware and EMC II, as they build out their
next generation digital agendas and applications. And similarly, I examined the list of large companies that have
engaged us to compete for and/or implement their private/hybrid cloud infrastructures and IT transformation. And I can
tell you without hesitation or sales puffery that these lists are dozens of companies long and growing.
For sure, our impressive set of Federation-wide technology assets, service and support capabilities, our partner
ecosystem, and our strong leadership and talent bench is being recognized by an ever-growing list of large companies
that are placing huge mobile, cloud, Big Data and security bets with us. And even more impressive is the fact that our
win rate is very good and it's getting even better.
Before turning the call over to Zane to drill down on our Q1 performance and 2015 outlook, I would like to comment
on two areas that have been talked and written about quite a bit lately, namely our M&A philosophy and CEO
succession.
On the M&A front, we will continue with our string of pearls approach. Our highest priority is to ensure that we
augment our strong product portfolio and roadmap with additional compelling technology assets that will help make us
a winner in this mobile, cloud, Big Data era, assets that will differentiate us from the competition and help us win,
assets that will produce a solid return on investment.
Additionally, as the violent secular shifts in the IT landscape play out, I believe there will be consolidation
opportunities that could be quite accretive. And if so, as you would expect, we will certainly investigate those
opportunities. And I assure you, we will always balance all M&A and investment opportunities with return of cash to
shareholders.
As to CEO succession, the first and most important thing that I want you to know is that I love this company. I believe
in its mission and bright future and I am fully engaged and enjoying coming to work every day. I am traveling to see
customers more than ever. I am spending time on strategy, Federation, and alignment and on assuring we create
long-term shareholder value. I also assure you that our board is very active, is in full alignment with our strategy, has a
robust succession process in place, and is squarely focused on creating value for you, our shareholders.
Thank you again for joining us today. I will now turn it to Zane. Zane?
Zane C. Rowe
Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone. In Q1, EMC consolidated revenue was $5.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year and
up 6% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $0.31. These results were broadly in line with our expectations for the
quarter and earlier outlook for the year. EPS was slightly ahead of our expectations due to favorable gross margin,
operational efficiencies, and good cost controls.
As expected and previewed on the last earnings call, EPS was impacted by lower Q1 revenue growth relative to the full
year as a result of our fulfillment process changes as well as the impact of the consolidation of VCE. Revenue was
slightly softer than expected due to geographic weakness in China and Russia, a product transition-related pause, and
organizational changes to realign our storage business. I want to thank everyone across the broader EMC family for
their efforts in delivering these results and positioning us well for the remainder of the year.

On a geographic basis, we grew in all theaters in constant currency. North America grew 5% year-over-year. EMEA
was down 2% and up 5% in constant currency. APJ was up 1% and Latin America was up 8%. They were up 6% and
14% respectively on a constant currency basis. The incremental FX changes during the quarter did not have a material
impact on our quarterly results due to the effectiveness of our hedging program. However, current FX rates are
expected to further reduce our 2015 revenue by approximately $400 million.
Pivotal Q1 revenue was up 8% year-over-year. As you know, the reported revenue results do not tell the real story as
Pivotal continues to make its transition to a software subscription business model. While subscription revenue was up
several hundred percent year-over-year, it was on a very small base. It is indicative of the customer interest in both
Pivotal Cloud Foundry and the Big Data Suite, where Pivotal added a number of significant new customers this quarter.
We are also seeing good progress in other metrics such as subscription ARR and backlog. Customer interest is high, the
trajectory is good and bodes well for the continued success of Pivotal's evolution to a subscription-based revenue
model.
Pivotal Cloud Foundry continues to gain strong momentum in the marketplace as customers experience the value of
easily managing their full application lifecycle in both private and public clouds, while leveraging strong DevOps
functionality. Pivotal CF enables customers to build a new generation of cloud native applications that are transforming
their businesses and dramatically lowering their operating costs. The broad industry acceptance of the Cloud Foundry
Foundation and Cloud Foundry as the leading cloud native application platform is providing great dividends to Pivotal.
During the quarter, Pivotal, in combination with 16 other companies including Hortonworks, IBM, Teradata, and SAS
announced the formation of the Open Data Platform initiative which is shared industry effort to help promote and
advance the state of Apache Hadoop and Big Data technologies for the enterprise.
Pivotal also announced a strategic partnership with Hortonworks that enables Pivotal's Big Data Suite, including
HAWQ product, to run on Hortonworks Hadoop distribution and other ODP-compliant distributions. This significantly
expands Pivotal's addressable market. This announcement has really excited the industry and is opening up many
opportunities for Pivotal.
Pivotal's agile development services had continued success in the first quarter. Highlighted by the transformational deal
with a top fitness brand that created a new application to engage users and to simplify personal health data and fitness
activity tracking tools. Early success with the Pivotal developed mobile application has led to follow-on purchases of
both Pivotal Cloud Foundry and the Big Data Suite. This combination of software and a new engagement application
continues to differentiate the company in the highly competitive fitness space.
VMware's first quarter was a solid start to 2015. Q1 revenue within EMC grew 12% year-over-year and was up 14% in
constant currency. There were a number of highlights in the quarter including license bookings beyond standalone
vSphere, which grew over 30% year-over-year in constant currency. This business continues its successful transition in
enabling the software defined enterprise.
VMware success in hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings continued in Q1 with bookings growing over 100% versus last
year. VMware also continued the positive momentum in end user computing with bookings in this business, including
AirWatch, up 50% on a constant currency basis. They continue to be a leader in enterprise mobility management and in
March at Mobile World Congress, AirWatch was awarded the Best Mobile Cloud Service or App for EMM at the
event.
VMware is seeing a significant increase in the adoption of newer products and solutions like NSX, and seeing a
significant increase in the percentage of customers adopting the full SDDC portfolio and solutions like Enterprise
Hybrid Cloud from our federation of companies.
We are also seeing good traction with cross federation solutions including capabilities from both VMware and EMC
Information Infrastructure. For example, we are working with a large U.S. media and entertainment company, who is
looking to implement a private cloud, provide a self-service portal for app developers and enable provisioning for
compute and storage. We showed our combined strength through standing up an Enterprise Hybrid Cloud proof of

concept based on VCE Vblock infrastructure that enabled the provisioning of Linux and Windows VMs via the EHC
portal, all in three weeks.
The unique combination and tight integration of capabilities from VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure
enabled us to win this deal. This is just one example. We are encouraged by the size of the pipeline of these types of
opportunities.
The Information Infrastructure revenue totaled $4 billion, down 1% year-over-year and up 3% in constant currency.
Emerging Storage revenue was up 14% year-over-year and normalized for a large Atmos deal last year, it was up close
to 40% year-over-year. Isilon and XtremIO both had very good growth in the quarter as well. We continue to expect
Emerging Storage portfolio to grow more than 30% for 2015.
Within II, high-end storage outperformed our expectations while unified BRS was weaker than expected. David will
give you additional color on Information Infrastructure business in a few minutes.
As the IT market is transforming, customers are becoming increasingly focused on successful outcomes versus buying
individual products. We've anticipated this and have transformed our business to better address changing customer
needs. Pivotal, VMware and EMC Information Infrastructure are each leaders in their respective markets. Individually,
they are very successful, but together, we are able to offer customers truly unique capabilities. EMC converged
infrastructure and cross federation solutions are delivering the requirements that customers need to succeed in the
digital age and positioning EMC to be a more strategic partner. An important factor in the success of our strategy is the
progress we're making with these integrated solutions and in our six key growth opportunities.
We once again saw significant growth in these six in the quarter and, as a group, they are tracking well towards our
expectations of $2 billion in revenue this year. As these products are integrated into our unique solutions, they grow
quickly and become an increasingly significant portion of the overall business.
Transformational opportunities are both large and long-term in nature and are at a level of strategic engagement that is
new for EMC and would not be possible without the strength and the capabilities of the Federation. As a sign of
growing interest, our consulting services group is seeing tremendous success in our IT transformation workshops with
requests for these engagements almost doubling quarter-over-quarter.
An example of our growing strategic relevance is at one of the world's largest heavy equipment companies. This
customer is undergoing a multi-year transformation of their IT and was not originally an EMC customer. Our
consulting group engaged with the customer on an IT transformation assessment, roadmap, and business case. Given
the success of this work, the roadmap is now their go-forward plan to implement over the next few years. We followed
the consulting engagement with a sizable data domain and Avamar deal, and currently, we are working with the
customer on an Enterprise Hybrid Cloud solution as the next phase. Our transformation vision, approach, and
credibility has enabled us to go from no business with this customer to being a strategic partner, working with them to
achieve their long-term IT transformation goals.
The cross federation capabilities make our solutions unique in the market and position us well as a strategic partner
with our customers for years to come. We continue to innovate and produce industry-leading integrated capabilities and
solutions including most recently, the VxBlock, vScale architecture and the Business Data Lake solution. Stay tuned
for more as we will make a number of additional announcements in two weeks at EMC World.
Now, looking at the factors that drove our EPS for the quarter, I would point out that while we were slightly better than
our expectations, we were examining all areas of the business to control expenses on both the COGS and operating
expense lines.
Gross profit for the quarter totaled $3.4 billion. Gross margin was 61.3%, down 150 basis points year-over-year.
Adjusting for the consolidation of VCE, gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year. Operating expense was $2.5
billion, growing 9% year-over-year. Without the impact of the VCE expenses, OpEx grew 4% year-over-year.
The incremental cost incurred through various acquisitions over the course of the year also contributed to our OpEx
growth. Overall, growth in the operating expenses impacted Q1 EPS by $0.07. Excluding the impact of VCE

consolidation, Q1 EMC II operating expenses were flat year-over-year as this business has been very diligent in
managing expenses throughout the quarter.
The performance this quarter was helped by our continued efforts to balance investment spend with return potential for
each part of our portfolio of products and services. We've also been realigning our organizational structure to better
match with our more attractive investment opportunities. For example, in EMC Information Infrastructure, over the last
two years, we've shifted a considerable portion of R&D spend from our traditional storage products to new and higher
growth areas. We expect this portion to continue to increase as we seek to achieve additional efficiencies in our mature
products.
The year-over-year change in non-operating expenses added $0.02 due to the shift of the VCE expenses to their
respective operating lines. Our accelerated share repurchase program continues to benefit EPS. It helped improve our
EPS $0.01 versus Q1 2014. As a result, we finished Q1 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31.
We generated $755 million in free cash flow in Q1. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by a larger cash tax
payment this year. Our consolidated total cash and investments at the end of Q1 was $13.5 billion, $3 billion of which
is in the U.S. During the quarter, we returned almost $1.7 billion to shareholders via a combination of share buybacks
and dividends. We repurchased almost $1.5 billion worth of EMC shares and distributed approximately $230 million to
shareholders via our quarterly dividend.
Updating our 2015 outlook using March 31 currency rates, we expect consolidated revenue to be $25.7 billion,
non-GAAP EPS to be $1.91 and we expect free cash flow of $4.1 billion. This change from our prior outlook is solely
due to the impact of FX rates since the beginning of the year. There is nothing more important to this management team
than growing shareholder value. We are confident that our focus on gaining share, growing earnings and making
thoughtful investments will enable our continued success.
We are well positioned this year with an unparalleled portfolio, thanks to the strength and hard work of the EMC team.
We are gaining in strategic relevance with our customers, we are seeing results from closer integration across the
Federation, we are winning in CI and EHC. We continue to see success and tremendous potential in our investment
areas.
As the environment continues to be challenging, we are optimizing our operational performance and capital allocation
through share buyback and dividends. We will aggressively look for opportunities to grow the revenue line, become
more efficient and increase shareholder value.
Now, I will turn the call over to David to discuss a few highlights of the Information Infrastructure business. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Zane. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Overall storage revenue was flat this
quarter, up 3% in constant currency, and grew in constant currency in all theaters. Within this, our level of unshipped
orders was on track with our new fulfillment process which meant that, as expected, the amounts of unshipped storage
product orders grew by $100 million versus Q1 2014. Many key areas of our portfolio continued to show great traction
and growth, but storage product revenue was approximately $75 million below our expectations due to three factors
with roughly equal weighting.
The first was weakness in Russia due to the economy and currency headwinds and also in China due to increased
scrutiny of U.S. technology purchases in the government and financial services sectors. The second was due to some
customers waiting for an anticipated major product announcement in the high end of our backup and recovery portfolio.
And the third was due to a slower start than we would've liked on the go-to-market side of our business due to the
impact of the approximately 1,500 positions we eliminated across EMC II in Q1.
As we look forward to the rest of the year, we believe that our ability to deliver world-class products, services and
solutions will drive storage to return to expected growth on a constant currency basis for the year.

EMC Information Infrastructure strategy to win in this digital age is to follow a progression that expands from
best-of-breed products to our broad storage product portfolio to converge infrastructure and also to solutions. This
strategy is designed to help our customers transform their existing application environments and also to capitalize on
the third platform of information technology.
Within EMC II, our focus has been to evolve our storage portfolio by selling our newer technologies such as scale-out
file and objects, flash and software defined storage. As these technologies continue to grow much faster than traditional
storage, and assume a larger share of the storage market, they help the overall market growth. And as our market share
in most of these new areas significantly exceeds our market segment share in traditional external storage, it positions us
well going forward.
At the same time, we continue to expand the lead in the traditional storage markets by bridging the gap between current
and newer storage technologies with best-of-breed, converged infrastructure and solutions that are focused upon
helping our customers adapt to the digital age.
Within storage, our emerging products grew 14% in Q1. This category is still on track to be our second-largest storage
bucket by the end of the year. As Zane mentioned, normalizing for one very large deal that would have reduced Q1
2014 growth to 50% year-on-year, the emerging products portfolio grew close to 40% this quarter. The success of our
emerging products is a validation of our strategy and these investments.
Within the Emerging Storage, Isilon continues to lead the scale-out file and HDFS market with its unique scale-out file
systems technology and native Hadoop support. In Q1, Isilon won at one of the world's largest web scale companies as
they chose to consolidate their mission-critical workflow data on the new Isilon HD series platform.
Isilon continues to shine in the enterprise Big Data analytic space with its native Hadoop capabilities, especially
combined with the Pivotal Big Data Suite. For example, when one of the largest telecom providers in Latin America
wants to transform their go-to-market processes by leveraging Big Data, they chose Isilon and the Pivotal Big Data to
implement their Big Data analytics platform. We're also encouraged to see use cases of Isilon expanding beyond
Hadoop into other next generation workloads such as Splunk analytics.
XtremIO had very strong triple-digit growth this quarter and maintained its leading position in the all-flash array
market. As XtremIO continues to grow via success in winning net new workloads and customers, the overlap between
XtremIO and our traditional hybrid storage arrays has not materially changed from what we shared with you last
quarter. Combined with our software defined portfolio, XtremIO offers unique capabilities that are very hard to match
by any point or traditional competitor.
When a major Eastern European city's IT department wanted to modernize their data center with a software-defined
approach, they turned to XtremIO and ViPR to help address their changing business requirements. EMC won this deal
against some of our major global competitors and flash start-ups because of the completeness of our vision and
best-of-breed storage portfolio. Expect to hear a lot more about XtremIO as well as EMC II software-defined storage at
EMC World.
Our software-defined storage portfolio has been very popular with early adopters such as search providers, content
repositories, and web scale customers and we continue to enhance our go-to-market strategy to position our portfolio
across a broader customer base. We've aligned our go-to-market teams to address three software defined storage use
cases.
For customers who want to modernize their existing storage infrastructures using a software-defined platform, we have
ViPR Controller and ViPR SRM. For hyper converged, scale-out high-performance block storage needs, ScaleIO is a
perfect fit. And for cloud scale object and Hadoop workloads on Commodity hardware, ECS really differentiates itself
with its unique global consistency architecture.
This quarter, a major international service provider embraced our software-defined storage portfolio by choosing to
deploy their next generation block and object services on ScaleIO and ECS. We won this engagement due to the unique
capabilities of ECS and its ability to deliver object storage at a significantly lower TCO than the largest public cloud

and the fact that ScaleIO on Commodity hardware can deliver block storage at scale that is very cost effective.
Our high-end storage performance was slightly better than expected with new VMAX3 representing more than 50% of
the new systems sold during the quarter. The overall installed base of high-end systems continues to be stable.
Customers appreciate unique capabilities of the new platform, and we still expect VMAX to gain share for the
full-year.
Our unified and backup/recovery business was down 11% in Q1. This category was affected by currency headwinds,
our business practice changes, and the slower go-to-market start to the year. Backup and recovery was also affected by
the customer pause ahead of our upcoming high-end data domain product refresh. Since the underlying fundamentals of
this business as well as the market demand remains solid, we expect this business will improve through the rest of the
year. Expect some announcements around backup and data protection at EMC World.
We continue to enjoy strong success with our converged infrastructure portfolio that includes Vblocks, VSPEX, and
VSPEX BLUE. And we are pleased with the group's performance this quarter. Within our converged infrastructure
business, Vblock related revenue was up more than 30% compared to Q1 last year.
As converged infrastructure plays a vital role in our customers' broader IT transformations, we're adding new products
to our portfolio like the recently announced VxBlocks and the vScale architecture, which also support our Federation
level solutions like EHC and Business Data Lakes where CI is a critical building block. We'll have some exciting news
around converged infrastructure portfolio at EMC World.
Within our S&A, security analytics and Archer grew over 20% this quarter. The RSA Annual Conference started this
week and continues to be the world's premier event focused upon next generation information security, with record
industry attendance of more than 30,000.
Now turning to solutions, our Enterprise Hybrid Cloud solution that launched late last year continues to enjoy solid
success as customers embrace the value proposition of broader IT transformation. For Q1, some of the key customer
wins include one of Europe's largest publishers, a U.S. state IT department, and an international government agency.
Our momentum with EHC is a validation of our belief that hybrid clouds will be dominant in the future, and for us,
EHC is a key strategic solution that will lead to more transformational deals for the Federation with our largest
customers.
Last month, we announced our Federation Business Data Lake solution which dramatically accelerates time to value
for customers deploying Hadoop for Big Data analytics. This solution is built on the EMC Federation's best-of-breed
products for Big Data including Isilon and ECS, VMware vSphere running on Vblocks, the Pivotal Big Data Suite and
Pivotal Cloud Foundry. We are also working hard on nurturing an ecosystem around this solution by supporting
third-party analytics packages like Tableau and SaaS, and other Big Data solutions such as Cloudera and Hortonworks.
We are encouraged by the high initial customer interest in our Federation Business Data Lake solution.
We continue to work on new end-to-end Federation solutions that will drive real value differentiation for customers and
lead them into the new digital age. As we look forward to the rest of the year and beyond, our opportunity to grow are
increasing because most of the factors that negatively affected Q1 are behind us. We have successfully positioned
ourselves to win in the evolving storage landscape with our broad portfolio.
Our industry-leading converged infrastructure portfolio and our solutions that are focused on delivering business
outcomes for our customers continue to gain traction in the markets. And our strategic importance with our largest
customers is growing as we engage even more closely with federation partners, VMware and Pivotal, to leverage our
best-of-breed portfolio and collective influence in the overall IT markets.
While this quarter was not without its challenges, we also made lots of progress and I'd like to thank our team for their
hard work, and as always, our partners and customers for your continued support.
With that, I will turn it to Tony for Q&A.

Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourselves to one
question including clarifications. This will enable us to take as many questions as possible. We thank you for your
cooperation in this matter.
Caroline, can you open up the lines for questions, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
Shebly Seyrafi from FBN. Your line is open.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Yes. Thank you. You said that about two-thirds of the miss was execution related. Can you
elaborate on what were the largest execution missteps last quarter and what you've done to resolve them? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Hey, Shebly. Good morning. This is David. Let me explain exactly. First of all, make sure
we understand kind of what did and didn't happen in storage. So, to make it very clear, the vast majority of our storage
business was on track for the quarter, services, operating margin, gross margin, most of the products areas, but there
were three specific things that caused the $75 million miss – shortfall compared to our expectation on storage products.
One of them was external. We mentioned the geo-political factors in China and Russia that was about a third of that.
And those, of course, we do expect to continue during the year. The other two factors, we're kind of classing more as
execution, again two roughly equal factors.
One was the fact that it's become known amongst our data domain customer base that there's a product refresh
occurring this quarter that will be announced this quarter. So to answer your question, in terms of what we are doing
about it. Expect an announcement at EMC World that product will start shipping in the middle of this quarter. So that
should take that pressure away. And the remaining factor which was about, again, one third of the miss relates to the
cost optimization cost management we've been doing inside of the company. As you know, we are aggressively driving
cost in our traditional business to fund investments in our newer businesses.
In the course of the first quarter, inside EMC Information Infrastructure, we reduced about 1,500 positions. And
obviously, when you do something of that size, it did impact some of our field-facing parts of the business and that
caused a bit of a slowdown in terms of how quickly we got out of the gate in the first quarter on the go-to-market side.
And then to in terms of what we've done, what's happened about that, that is now behind us. Everybody is kind of
understanding what the new model is. We are back off to the races again so that disruption factor impacted us in Q1,
we don't expect it to impact us in Q2. So those are the three factors. The first one is external. The second two we're
classing as execution.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thanks. Good morning. David, you mentioned XtremIO was up triple digits. I don't think
you had much revenue in the first quarter a year ago, maybe $50 million or so. So could you talk about the bookings
run rate for XtremIO this quarter? Was it in line with your expectations? And can you talk about the competitive
landscape in the all-flash market and your overall win rates? Thanks.

<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure, Brian. Yeah, that's why I said very strong triple digit growth rates because you're right,
of course, the product was ramping quite well last year, in fact very well last year, and was in line with our
expectations. Our win rate on a head-to-head basis continues to be exceptionally high. I mentioned, but I think I'll just
clarify, in my prepared remarks that as we analyze the orders that we got for XtremIO this quarter and we kind of look
at them in terms of those three categories, what percentage of them were going to basically replace existing workloads
that exist upon a VMax or VNX, that's about a third. About a third of them are going into existing EMC customers but
for new workloads. About a third of those systems are going into new customers, so that remains consistent. And
finally, we think that we're on track for a well over $1 billion of bookings run rate or so, in total, well over $1 billion
bookings for the products in 2015.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Brian. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. David, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the core EMC gross
margins. They were down pretty substantially, I think, year-over-year 260 basis points. Was this a reflection of
execution issues? And then secondly, are you seeing some impact to gross margins from that part of the XIO
installations that are legacy VMax accounts?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Amit, so, let me talk about that for a second. So, actually the gross margins were slightly
ahead of our expectations for the quarter, so that's my first comment. The storage income statement actually did better
than we expected from a gross margin point of view, from an operating margin point of view, despite the fact that we
were slightly lower than our expectations on storage products revenues. A couple of factors, obviously volume is a
factor. We did, as we said, increase our backlog by about $100 million. That has about 5 point revenue growth impact
on storage product revenue, so volume becomes a factor. Also bringing VCE in also impacts gross margin. That
becomes a second factor. So we're actually pleased with them. Slightly ahead of where we expected for the quarter and
kind of on track with our prior guidance for the full year.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Okay. I guess, just a...
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Amit.
<A - David I. Goulden>: You had one more thing, Amit?
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yeah, no. Sorry. I just wanted to clarify, David, XIO installations that happened on VMax
accounts, how does that impact EMC's margin structure, core EMC's margin structure? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Actually, the XtremIO gross margin profile is actually quite attractive for a couple of
reasons. First of all, it sold as an appliance and hardware-software combined. Secondarily, because it's an appliance
model, we started charging maintenance on basically day one for that product. So we don't have to kind of accrue for a
multi-year warranty. So over the lifecycle of an XtremIO system, the gross margin profile is actually quite good and
very comparable to our traditional VMax, VNX blended margins.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks. Next question, please.

<Q - Rajesh Ghai>: Yes. Thanks. I had a question on the high-end storage side. Historically, an IBM refresh has –
mainframe refresh has helped you in your high-end business. Why would it be any different this year? And is the
high-end still being impacted more by the workload migration of Hadoop and other workloads to Commodity hardware
or is it more encroachment by all-flash arrays such as your own XtremIO? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: All right, Ghai. Thank you. A multi-part question, let me break it down. So first of all, the
mainframe is a very small part of the total high-end systems business. So, yes, we would expect to get some impact
typically lacked by a quarter or so from an IBM refresh. So not a material factor. And wouldn't really – you wouldn't
see it show up in your overall numbers very much.
In terms of the dynamics, it's not workload migration, and that's an important thing to understand. Workloads don't
migrate to Hadoop. Hadoop workloads and Big Data workloads are a new class of workload. And what we're saying is
that most of those workloads are being deployed on new systems like an Isilon or an ECS and that's driving growth in
that side of the business. To the extent there's any migration of workloads in the high-end, some of those are migrating
to all-flash arrays. I've spent a couple of minutes, just before, explaining that only a third of our XtremIO systems are
going into replace workloads sitting on either high-end or VNX-flass systems. So don't think that's all high-end.
So essentially, the high-end is more dynamic of fairly steady install base. And as we mentioned, there are actually a
number of installed high-end systems has remained relatively constant over last year or so. And the bigger dynamic is
in fact new workloads getting built on new classes of systems that drive things out of our Emerging Technologies
division.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Rajesh. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Just to be clear your guidance reduction from $1.92 to $1.91, you view, as
all currency, but it does assume an improvement in execution. And for example, you said China and Russia probably
weren't going to come back so I'm wondering how much risk is in that? And I also had to ask, $0.31 was ahead of the
board's plan but the consensus on the Street was $0.36. So, I guess earnings management or why the big difference?
Maybe VCE was quite a bit larger than we expected?
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: So, Steve, I'll start with that and I think David will probably want to add to that. At least for the
quarter, it was in line with our internal expectations. And I think David touched on some of the issues we found at least
on the revenue side for the quarter. And as was we've touched on before, these are back-end loaded quarters. So I think
there's a fair amount of volatility and also the fulfillment was a fairly significant part of that.
As we look for the remainder of the year, the adjustment we are making is solely due to the difference in currencies.
We originally had the euro at $1.91 (sic) [$1.21], which was the beginning of the year rate and we've updated our
currency rates for March 31, which is $1.07. Sorry, $1.21 was the euro and then $1.07, which is where we are right
now. And we feel quite confident with the plan. I think we've talked about the areas of execution that we are confident
that we can overcome for the remainder of the year.
<A - David I. Goulden>: And, Steve, just to add to that, to be clear, I mentioned this before, China and Russia, we do
expect that headwind. Obviously, it was about a third of the delta in our expectation in the first quarter. We do expect
that headwind to continue and we do expect, as I mentioned in answer to the first call, that the execution issues are
behind us and we believe there's enough opportunity out there to make that up as we go through the rest of the year. So
the only difference in the outlook for the year, as Zane mentioned, is in fact for the changes to our foreign exchange.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. Thank you. Maybe if we could get an update on Joe's plans as we think about the
whole year and into next. And also at the Analyst Meeting and also, obviously, on this call, you talked about possible
consolidation. Could you maybe just add a little bit of color to that? Would it possibly be more likely to stay in your
core areas of storage? Or is it possibly going to expand out into new areas where really you don't do as much,
something maybe in the case of networking or another area of hardware or software? Thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Lou, in your second part of your question, there's nothing specific that we want to talk about
now. I'm just making a general statement having been around a few years. I do believe, on the back of these violent
secular shifts, there will be opportunities and I don't want to talk about where we think they might be. And again, we
will be very – only if they're very accretive, only if they would really add value to our shareholders, would we even
entertain it. Our first and foremost strategy is to continue our string of pearls, which has worked quite well or will work
quite well in the case of the new six bets we placed.
As far as my personal plans, I'm here. I'm engaged. I'm working hard. The board's got, as I said, a robust process in
place and my job is to do my job until the board comes with a new CEO. And then I would agree to help as a Chairman
for a while and then watch this company flourish after I leave.

Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow generation capability. You're
guiding free cash flow to be down year-over-year in 2015 more than 18%. Is there any one-time items in there? If you
could describe how investors should be thinking about the ongoing ability of EMC to generate free cash flow, because
the magnitude of the client is pretty significant, it's hard to reconcile the statements that EMC is trying to create
shareholder value with free cash flow being down so meaningfully. But if you could try – any one-time items and how
investors should be thinking about the ongoing ability to grow or not to grow free cash flow from this number? Thank
you.
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: Sure, Keith. This is Zane. I will address it. There is in fact a, call it, a one-time or a big shift in
free cash flow that we talked about at the Strategic Forum and that's with the inclusion of VCE. Moving the impact of
the VCE acquisition into operating cash flow line has roughly a $500 million impact on free cash flow, the way we
define free cash flow. So we are still very comfortable with the ability for us to generate free cash flow. If you were to
look at the shift from the year-end to where we are today, we are still confident in our expectation. We are currently
expecting $4.1 billion and the only change has been due to currency. We've also included the VMware update into our
free cash flow line. If you recall, they had mentioned some tax payments, incremental tax payments on a year-over-year
basis. So we still feel very confident in the business and in its ability to generate free cash flow.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to touch again on the – exceeding your expectations or coming in
line with the board expectations. I guess, Zane, can you walk us through the shape of the year in terms of the linearity
to the EPS guide? And you talked about looking for cost efficiencies. But I'm wondering whether you are baking in
something meaningful here, offsetting some of the China, the geo-political issues or do you think there's upside to your
outlook as you find some of these cost opportunities? Thanks.
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: So, Maynard, again, I – and we tried to highlight this just over a month ago, as you think about
the impact that the change in fulfillment process had in our quarterly seasonality. And while we don't guide to the
quarter, we mentioned that it would be approximately 22%. If you look at that percent versus our updated guidance,
you will see it's roughly 21.8%. And I think David talked about some of the execution opportunities that we feel, we're
convinced we can overcome as it relates to the storage part of the business. The rest of it, if you were to look at revenue
seasonality through the remainder of the year, we do have a buildup. If you look at the VMware results and our
expectations through the course of the year, you do see some incremental growth through the course of year. We're
focused on the business, we feel confident in the pipeline as well as the investments. And if you look at the emerging
parts of the business, we're confident in the growth of those emerging pieces obviously having a larger portion of our
EPS growth towards the remainder of the year.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Maynard. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Zane, the VCE consolidation seems like it drove an incremental
$115 million in expenses versus last year just in Q1 alone. So as we look for the full-year number, that's almost $0.04
and I believe, in your last call, you said that the full-year impact would be roughly that magnitude. So should we think
that from here on that there is not an incremental headwind or is there still incremental headwind from VCE?
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: No, I think you may have slightly overextended the impact on the first quarter. What I did
mention is that it was going to be far more. So that you should really think of the $0.04 being a first half impact, so you
are close. We'd be happy to go through the math but the impact was more pronounced in the first half, not as significant
as $0.04 in the first quarter. So you are close but it is essentially a first half phenomenon as you incorporate the VCE
impact.
<A - David I. Goulden>: And – this is David. Just to help clarify the mechanics, so, yes, there was obviously an
incremental impact to operating expense from VCE moving into operating expense but then there is a corresponding
reduction to other expense. So, obviously, we used to consolidate 67%-ish of the VCE expenses into other income.
Now, we consolidate 100% into operating expense. So it's the delta between those two that's driving the impact. I think
you're just looking at – just at the gross amount that is sitting aside of operating expenses.
<Q - Wamsi Mohan>: Thanks, David.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.

Our next question or comment comes from Nehal Chokshi from Maxim. Your line is open.
<Q - Nehal Sushil Chokshi>: Yeah, thank you. For Pivotal, I am increasingly inclined to believe this can indeed be
your next VMware, i.e., generating $2 billion or $3 billion of free cash flow per year 10 years down the road. I know
that's really long-term thinking, but it seems like a significant portion of the value proposition for Pivotal is enabling –
utilizing any platform. Is this the right way to think about the long-term picture here? And pending the answer, I'll have

a follow-up question.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I didn't quite understand the question, Nehal. Can you do that again?
<Q - Nehal Sushil Chokshi>: Sure. Looking at Pivotal being your next VMware, the key pillar of that is enablement
of Big Data consumption on any platform. Is that the right way to think about that? And I'll have a follow-up question
pending the answer here.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Yes. At the base level of Pivotal is Cloud Foundry which is developers platform and I think
what Cloud Foundry is trying to do more than anything else is basically say you develop your app once and then you
have portability across the popular cloud platforms out there, whether it be VMware-based platform, an OpenStack
based platform, a Amazon based platform, an Azure platform or the next one on the list would be Google platform. So
yes, the answer is yes.
<Q - Nehal Sushil Chokshi>: Okay. So the follow-up question is, what's the risk that provided that this does indeed
work out that you're ending up cannibalizing your existing strong free cash flow streams from Information
Infrastructure as well as virtual infrastructure?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well, if you take the VMware side, you see the moves – the last set of announcements they're
making around VIO VMware Integrated OpenStack around what they are announcing with – how they're – have this
really slick implementation of containers. You look what David's doing in EMC II around Elastic Cloud Storage,
around ViPR, around ScaleIO, around Isilon, these are all aimed at that new world, the same world that Pivotal is
aimed at.
So we see, this is again why I am so excited about the set of assets we built across this Federation, because when you
add layer one plus layer two plus layer three, and you go to a customer, you're much, much more relevant, have a better
chance of winning and that's why I went through that, not by name, but that very robust list of customers we are
working with where they've entrusted us to help them as they build their digital agenda. And then, of course, that digital
agenda ends up being on a cloud and we have an equally robust list of customers there that rely on us for IT
transformation to a hybrid cloud. So that's the secret sauce that I've been trying to get across to everybody.
<Q - Nehal Sushil Chokshi>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks. We have time for one more question. And then we will have a few concluding
comments from Joe.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes. Thanks. Given the strength of the all-flash array market, can you just remind us
the timing of DSSD product coming to market and how you plan to position that relative to XtremIO? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Katy, yes, it's David. Let me take that. First of all, DSSD coming to market later this year.
We couldn't be more excited about that. I did mention though expect to see some exciting news around XtremIO at
EMC World as well. So the flash agenda is alive well and strong. And they're positioned quite differently, basically
XtremIO is a SAN attached block storage device designed to make existing applications run much, much faster.
DSSD is aimed more at the next gen in-memory serve platform applications. It will handle protocols like Hadoop as
well as some native protocols designed to be basically an extension of memory and the applications that we are using
these systems for are actually quite different. So they are both based upon flash technology, but the application that
they are aimed for are different and quite complementary. So couldn't be more excited about the flash agenda. You will
hear a lot more about XtremIO in two weeks' time and a little bit about DSSD as well.

Again. Let me thank everybody for joining us. The point we tried to make get across is there is a huge and inextricably
linked business and IT transformation taking place right now. A transformation like this will have winners and losers as
this transformation plays out. We have, and are, making the right investments and we have the strategy, the technology,
the people and the customer permission to be a winner. And I assure you as we play hard to win, we will keep a sharp
eye on costs. David and his team are looking forward to EMC World, the week after next and there will be a good
number of anticipated and important product announcements made there. This conference will also have an investor
