Thomas Patrick Joyce
Thank you, Matt. Good morning everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to
execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong
adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses has
served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards
optimizing our portfolio, and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A.
Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics
segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics, and we
recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be
highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these
exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher's growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to
welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher.
With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning we reported adjusted diluted net
earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5%
to $4.1 billion with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio as each of our four
reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter.
Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. Geographically, the
high-growth markets led the way driven by high single digit growth in China, and high teens growth in India.
Developed market core revenues were up low single digits. Modest growth in the US and Western Europe was partially
offset by declines in Japan.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross
profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating
margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year to date. This strong margin expansion helped
to drive double digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately
$700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion
ratio was over 150%.
Now let's take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and
reported revenues grew over 60% largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margin increased 180 basis points,
and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%.
At Beckman Life Sciences, low single digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China, while
developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in healthcare in China coupled with
Beckman's strong execution contributed to double digit gains in that region.
Beckman's particle counting and characterization business had another good quarter with double digit growth driven by
global biopharmaceutical demand. The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and
development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from a collaboration with one of our

diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer's blood gas analyzer to
create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production.
This cross-pollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at
Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio.
Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and
industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double digit
gains in the high growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our confocal business.
SCIEX posted another quarter of mid single digit core revenue growth led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and
food, as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe where academic
weakness impacted results. In the high growth markets, China and India, each maintained strong double digit growth.
Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract
renewals and attachment rates in the quarter.
As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in
chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and
environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high margin business in an attractive mid single digit
growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double digit return on our
investment in less than five years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue to creating long-term value as
part of our Life Sciences portfolio.
Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and
demand for single use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall's market-leading solutions are
at the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and nine of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year
specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides
to its customers every day.
Pall industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in
energy and machinery, as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging.
August marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation, and the team's exceptional
implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we've been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning
of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins
by over 350 basis points.
At the same time, we've been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This
reinvestment, combined with the team's thoughtful use of DBS growth tools like accelerated product development and
[indiscernible] (11:11) has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By
delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and
further enhance Pall's growth trajectory.
Moving now to Diagnostics, both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team's solid execution generated 250
basis points of core operating margin expansion and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in
China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets.
Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single digits with growth in emerging markets partially
offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong
immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double digit recurring revenue in the region.
One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen, and Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the
importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test
volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher
Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The result can be tremendously impactful: better
speed to results, operational efficiency, and ultimately improved clinician workflows.

The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest
regional lab networks in the midwestern United States. Within six months, Beckman helped them implement over 180
analyzers and four automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This
customer was recently awarded the prestigious Advanced Laboratory of the Year Award for 2016 and has mentioned
their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their lab's transformational success.
Radiometer achieved mid single digit core revenue growth, led by continued double digit growth in both China and
India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of
acute care diagnostic instruments.
At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single digits in the quarter led by high single digit growth in North
America. An expanding install base and strong consumable sales contributed to double digit growth in our advanced
staining business.
Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest
growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments
combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our Diagnostics
portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher's diagnostics offering. We also foresee
tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and
bottom line performance.
Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenues increased 3.5% and reported operating margins increased
slightly to 15% with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3% driven by our equipment,
implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter.
Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high growth markets was
supported by another quarter of double digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. Since 2010,
we've grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today and we're now positioned as
one of the leading players in the region. We've evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as
more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing
manufacturing capabilities in the region.
This approach combined with our comprehensive product suite enables us to provide a full service China-centric
offering that enhances our customers' experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market.
Let's turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare's core revenue grew at a low single digit rate, with demand for implant
systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers.
Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel
while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team's operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to
help fuel Nobel's new product and innovation engine.
Turning to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%.
Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%.
In product identification, core revenues increased at a mid single digit rate, and we saw strong demand for marking and
coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color
solutions offerings improved sequentially, and was led primarily by increased demand in the US and Latin America.
Videojet showed solid growth performance, delivering mid single digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in
developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China primarily due to industrial and market
weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market, expanding our remote solutions
offering for customers and driving high single digit service revenue growth.
Core revenue grew low single digits at Esko led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As
a reminder, MediaBeacon provides digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use

to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing,
MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support
customers across their full brand and packaging workflows.
At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single digits with strong performance in North America and China, partially offset
by the rest of Asia.
Lastly, turning to water quality, core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single digit rate. Hach's core
revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North
America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and
political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter.
ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid single digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded
their customer base in the US. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset
by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets.
At Trojan, core revenue increased double digits driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging
markets. Our increased municipal systems installed base contributed to strong replacement growth, and bidding activity
was up low single digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment
solutions have gained interest in the region.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the
steps we've taken to reshape our portfolio position positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The
diversity and strength of our businesses combined with our team's focused execution using the Danaher Business
System is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our
customers and our shareholders well.
We're initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05,
which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016,
we're raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which at the
midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015.

<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Well anyways, I'm intrigued by it's your one year anniversary at Pall and I'm intrigued on how
have your results matched up with the deal model or kind of specifically what type of return on capital are you sitting
on as you look point in time right now on that deal?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Scott, we are very, very pleased with the performance of the team, both the
Danaher team that has joined the team at Pall as well as the legacy Pall associates. The combination of those two teams
has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we've
made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of begun the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the
combination of the Danaher team that's gone in and the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress.
There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on the operational side as well as on the commercial
side. We've seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks,
we're now seeing investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real
difference in terms of getting new products, not only launched but commercialized on time and effectively.
So we're off to a good start. We took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to
$100 million, so we're a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect and I think obviously that lifts the returns here in the
near term. Relative to where we'll end up on a four or five year basis and beyond, I think again, we're off to a very good
start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns. But it's still early days and there's a lot of hard work to be
done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: And just sticking on Pall, when Pall Industrial comes back, and I'd love to hear your view on
when you think you move into positive territory there, but when Pall Industrial comes back, would you expect outsized
operating leverage on a cost out or how would you think about it, I guess, if you were in our shoes?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah, well first of all, I think we've seen us, while not the beginnings of growth on the
industrial side. I think we haven't seen, we have not seen another leg down in other words. We've seen some stability.
The industrial side was still down mid single digits in the quarter while the life science side was up mid single digits.
And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution, and DBS is playing a role there
from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective, when those improvements kick in and
we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you're going to see is in terms of the core growth to that
business and the read through on an operating margin basis from that core growth.
I don't know that it necessarily changes a trajectory from a cost out perspective. We're working on the cost structures
both on the life science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A. So I think
the real lift comes when we start to see that core growth turn positive and we start to see the read through from that
growth.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.

same as third quarter. Just looking for where you might see signs of acceleration, how you think about that trending

into next year. I know if I look at 2015, the third quarter was up year-on-year 3%. The fourth quarter was up only 1.5%.
So just wondering, is this conservative in terms of how you see them? Just give us some sense of the fourth quarter if
you could.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah, I wouldn't describe it as conservative, Steve. I do think though there's a number
of considerations that go into how we look at the fourth quarter. I mean it starts with how pleased we are with the
performance to this point in the third quarter with all four segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now
with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there is some stability in these
markets but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macroeconomically, I think there is cause for some
degree of caution in the outlook.
You're reading the same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and certainly that we are. There's a number of
sources of uncertainty in the market today, whether that's the election uncertainty in the US, the Brexit uncertainty
throughout Europe, the questions around turns in some of the high growth markets, or previously known as high growth
markets as I sometimes say around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and particularly those markets
with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So it's hard not
to be appropriately concerned with some of that sources of uncertainty. But that being said, we think we've got a
incredibly resilient portfolio right now, again underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think
that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And as you think about extending that through next year, what would be the biggest
things that would drive you from that 3% level to say something higher, even another 50 basis points? What are the few
things we should be looking for?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Right. Well first of all, we still have plenty of work to do left here in 2016 before we
get into 2017. And we'll be going through a process here in the fourth quarter around budgets and be in a much better
position to give you some specifics when we're together in December. But if you really stand back and look at us today,
I just mentioned the strength of the portfolio and the repositioning and the level of aftermarket that gives us a strong
foundation, but I think we're encouraged about the continued improvement in performance at Pall, with the addition of
Cepheid and Phenomenex coming in to the Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio and continuing to help us from both
from a growth rate standpoint as well as from an operating margin lift.
And then as we've mentioned before, we think there's plenty of opportunity for continued improvement and growth in
our Diagnostics business, in a number of our Life Science business as well as in Dental. So clearly, we could use a little
bit of macroeconomic headwind, but I think there's – or excuse me, tailwind – but I think we have plenty of
opportunities to play offense and make our own way in a good deal of the portfolio.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And Steve, just to add a few things, one, on a year-to-date basis, Pall is up mid single digits.
That's not been in the core number. As Tom alluded to, that's with no benefit from the industrial side of Pall. So even if
industrial stabilizes a little bit, Pall should be a net contributor, adder, to our core growth next year. Our industrial
instrumentation business at Hach has been weak. Our experience, that tends to not last very long. I think that would be,
we would expect better numbers out of Hach here in the fourth quarter going into next year. So even those two items,
even before Cepheid comes in, again Cepheid won't impact our reported core number but will help our pro forma core
number in 2017 as well.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.

Apologies. We'll go next to the site of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Morning. Could we build a little bit more on your discussion about the uptick in muni
activity? It feels like that has been building for a couple quarters now, and I just wonder if you could give us a little bit
more color on geographically what's going on and what the pipeline business looks here for the next call it six to 12
months?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: And Jeff, specifically in the muni world?
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Yeah, muni world.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure, sure. Well, I think the brightest spot that we've seen in the municipal world
around water, our municipal water business, has been at Trojan, where we've seen good performance this year, where
we've seen double digit growth in the last quarter. We've seen increasing win rates and a reasonable lift in bidding
activity. But I wouldn't say that that bidding activity necessarily suggests that that double digit growth rate is a
sustainable one. This is more of probably a mid single digit type of market. But we have been very encouraged by the
performance at Trojan. Their competitiveness I think has read through in terms of their win rates, and so we're in a
reasonable market right now. I think we're winning share.
So I think that's encouraging from an equipment and an infrastructure perspective, and we're seeing that globally. I
think there's a different side of the story though, which is on the municipal business in North America. The day to day
consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan. We're seeing low single digit
growth in that market right now. Still a very good market and Hach continues to be gaining share there, but not nearly
at the rate that we're seeing some of the infrastructure build out in certain markets.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Great. And then just on Phenomenex, I don't know a lot about the company obviously,
but interesting that it's 100% consumables, and I always think about the strength of your consumable business being
tied to the inherent strength in your platform and equipment businesses. Are there other assets like this that are kind of
tuck-ins? Are these 100% consumable companies under strategic and competitive threat as folks like yourself build an
equipment business? And just any perspective on how to think about just kind of the dynamics of that company and
how it's shaping up, what the landscape is there?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Well it's – Phenomenex is a great franchise and it is a virtually 100%
consumables business with great gross margins, gross margins in the 70% neighborhood, and mid 20s operating
margins, but still with opportunities for improvement via DBS. And we're thrilled to be able to acquire this asset. We've
admired that business for a long time. We were able to acquire it at an attractive valuation, and I think for those who
have asked us about return thresholds in the past, this is clearly a business that we believe we will achieve double digit
return on invested capital in in less than five years.
And so – and that obviously for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a
number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business, to your point about installed base versus consumables, where
Phenomenex has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment agnostic, and they focus on
specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems, and therefore create unique customer
value. We've had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years and it's been a very successful one,
but as some of you may recall, we're also consumables agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX.
And so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers
without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that installed base. Obviously that can be very
attractive strategically when you have it, but in the particular case of the life science world, being able to customize
solutions for these unique applications and customer challenges is a real competitive advantage.

<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: And Tom, that doesn't create a channel conflict for all the other folks they were agnostic
with and there's some bleed away on their other business as a result of it?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: It really doesn't, Jeff. Again, we have excellent relationships with other partners in the
consumables world and in life sciences. We had sourced from multiple – I shouldn't even say source. We had
customized solutions for customers across a number of different consumables suppliers for a long period of time, and
we expect to maintain those relationships and continue to be focused on what are the specific needs of the customers
today and how do we serve them best.

And we'll go next to the site of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: Hey thanks. Tom, I'm wondering if you can comment on the academic markets? The NIH
data was pretty negative for September. I think budgets down about 13%. And I know you called out some softness for
Leica Microsystems. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the academic market
specifically?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Good morning, Tycho. We certainly participate in the academic market in our
Life Science businesses, but we don't have enormous direct exposure to NIH. If you really looked at the direct exposure
across a number of our businesses, we're probably in the $150 million or less with direct exposure to NIH funding.
Now there's more than that in terms of indirect funding, but I would say that that funding issue that you mention clearly
has had an impact on a broad basis when you talk about a variety of things that are indirectly funded or go through a
number of different stages before they ultimately get to a supplier like us. We have seen weakness in that market. We
have not seen any particular cause for optimism in the academic market, particularly in the US. Europe has hung in
there in pockets. Japan is weak and certainly continues to be that way. So it's not an area of strength right now, and
clearly the NIH funding issues have not been, net, particularly helpful
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And Tycho, I would add that we probably saw a little bit more of a bifurcation in Life
Science in the quarter, meaning that biopharma remained very strong, traditional pharm, food and environmental
remained solid, consistent what we saw in the first half. But we did see both academic and sort of industrial markets,
particularly at Leica, weaken in the third quarter.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: That's helpful. And then on Beckman, if I go back to your comments last quarter, I think
you'd talked about growing at a market rate. If we look at the results from some of the peers, they're still growing a
little bit faster, including in the high single digit range for one of them. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your
view of whether you can get Beckman back to maybe a mid single digit growth trajectory?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: We absolutely believe that we can do that, Tycho. We've made terrific progress thus
far. We've seen improvement certainly in our clinical chemistry and our amino assay business. Our urinalysis business
continues to perform very, very well. That business is up double digits in the third quarter. And I think with the
addition of Cepheid and a broader position in molecular diagnostics, particularly with the potential growth that's
available at the point of care and potentially ultimately in the physician office lab, we do believe that both the core
legacy business at Beckman will improve its growth trajectory over time with the addition of those higher growth
segments that we've acquired will be accretive to that growth profile.
<Q - Tycho W. Peterson>: Okay. And then just one last quick one. Can you quantify the biopharma growth from Pall
that you saw in the quarter?

And we'll go next to the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Good morning, gentleman. So on Dental, it's sort of interesting. I mean the macro has been all
right I would guess in the US., but it feels like on North American consumables, we're seeing a little bit of choppiness.
Curious at your thoughts for that. And then conversely, it seems like overall the segment is doing quite well, but it's
equipment, which I guess doesn't correspond with the macro question, and then on the implant side where it seems like
you're doing quite well with the Nobel acquisition. So help us make sense of what you're seeing in the segment and
how much is market related and then how much is better execution on your end in some of the segments that are
outperforming.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Thanks, Ross. Good morning. We're pleased with how the Dental business, the
segment performed in the quarter at up 3%. And there was clearly some better execution on our side in a number of
different areas. And you've heard us speak in the past about some of the changes that we've made both organizationally
and operationally. We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective and we're
seeing the benefits there.
Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business,
up mid single digits and yet the consumables business up more like low single digits. And really I think that has to do
with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that
are making a difference there. And overall, I think we're well positioned from a portfolio perspective.
You've heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of
July and August. I think we, as the quarter came to a close in September, we started to certainly see some of that play
through and I think that absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double digit growth in places like China
and India, but the US much slower and certainly we're seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the
Middle East. So definitely a tale of two cities.
You asked also about the implant side. Nobel continues to perform very well. They've got a number of new products in
the market right now which are helping in that growth rate. And they're executing well just on a commercial basis day
in and day out and some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side where
we've been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D.
Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing and I think will pay off.
That will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Great. and maybe just moving back to the capital allocation. You guys have obviously been quite
busy and obviously since you've taken over, there's been a distinct bias towards growth. I guess, what should we learn
about your vision of what Danaher will be over the next five or 10 years based on these assets? You've obviously
gotten some real crown jewels within the tools complex and Phenomenex and Pall and obviously in Cepheid you get a
high growth potential. So how should we think about how you're sort of reshaping this portfolio and what the – I'm not
looking for quantitative – but maybe more qualitatively how you think about the evolution of this asset at this point?

<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Well Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with
the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important
and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were three of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that
we had, Nobel on the implant and consumables side as you mentioned, Pall to enhance our life sciences, specifically
biopharmaceutical production position, and then Cepheid to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics.
We've had to focus strategically on the consumables side of life science and Phenomenex, to use your term, a crown
jewel in the consumables side of life science.
So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn't trade our portfolio, the four segments that we
have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental & Applied Solutions for any portfolio in the
market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead as it has been in the past is continue to deploy our free cash flow
strategically with a strong bias towards M&A into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan at least
in the near term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these
acquisitions is to focus on probably smaller midsized bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position that
hopefully will, as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories and
hopefully that would be the case, certainly on the margin side if not initially, certainly over time. So I think that's the
game going forward, and it's been the plan over the last couple of years.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Thank you, Ross.

And we'll next to the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. My first question is on high growth
market trends. In the third quarter, high growth market revenue growth was I think around, I think you said mid single
digits. As you describe it, there continue to be some headwinds relative to what we've seen, at least compared to
historical trends. Recognizing a lot of this is out of control, I'm just wondering if you'd could speak a little bit about the
actions and investments you are taking to better position these markets for better growth in 2017.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Sure. Thanks for that question. I think as we look at the high growth markets today, I'm
not sure we would necessarily say that there was much of a change recently in those markets. We continued to see
strength in China across a number of our businesses, if not all. Business in China is up high single digits, real strength
in Life Science, in Dental, in Diagnostics, some softness in Hach and Videojet. Those are businesses where that
softness largely comes from equipment and more industrially oriented end markets. And you've heard me mention a
number of times the strength that we've seen in India, which has been very consistent level of strength over the last
couple of years.
And with those two markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those
markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investment are going. We're largely
doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near term.
What improvement we've seen, and it's been very modest in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia,
are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be
weak. And so while we've sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in
commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating
our investments today. Instead, the biggest incremental investments are going into those markets where we're seeing
continued strength.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Great. That's helpful and insightful. Thank you for that. My second question is on Diagnostic
core margins. They improved 250 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, there was some nice improvement in the
first half of about 210 basis points year over year. So it's got even better in Q3. Some of this may be a function of

comps, but to the extent it isn't, could you provide a bit more detail on what's really driving accelerating improvement
and how we should think about sustainability?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Well, we're certainly seeing continued improvement in the margin performance at
Beckman Diagnostics. Across our Diagnostics portfolio, you have Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, both businesses
we've owned for a number of years and have made tremendous progress in enhancing their operating margins.
Beckman obviously a more recent acquisition, but still five years ago; we've seen great lift in those operating margins
to this point. But as I mentioned, Beckman represents a large business that still has quite a bit of headroom for margin
improvement. And so we've seen it to this point, but we think there's more runway ahead.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: So really it should continue? Sorry, go ahead.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah Doug, it's Dan. We did benefit in Q3, it was a slightly easier comp. Despite having said
that, again it was a very strong quarter of core margin expansion. What we're seeing is a continued increase in the gross
margin side, continued leverage on the G&A side, while we're also stepping up R&D and sales and marketing. So we're
seeing the mix you'd like to see from a margin perspective, where we're getting the expansion but we're taking part of
that and putting that into more growth investments.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: No, that's great. That's kind of what I was getting at is, is it a continuation of trend which has
been good, or are things actually getting a little bit even better, which it sounds like they are.
Last one, there's clearly been a lot of questions about what's going on in different geographies and different end
markets, and you guys have been great at providing a lot of directional qualitative information to help us out there. I
just figured I would ask in case you guys would be willing to, whether or not you could just give us core revenue
growth by end market and by developed geography in the quarter across all businesses.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, we don't give quite that level of detail but we did talk about continued double digit kind
of mid-teens growth in India, high single-digit growth in China. Both the US and Western Europe were up low single
digit. That's been pretty consistent. I would add as a footnote, probably seeing some incremental signs of weakness in
Western Europe where our overall numbers in Q3 were pretty comparable to what we had in the first half. Tom alluded
to the academic comment, seeing a little bit of that industrial weakness in places like Hach. Not a big change but
probably on the margin, the tone is a little bit cautious in Western Europe. And Japan we continue to be down low to
mid single digits.
<Q - Doug Schenkel>: Okay. Thank you again.

We'll go next to the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Derik De Bruin>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Derik.
<Q - Derik De Bruin>: So before I ask another geography question, I just wanted to ask a Diagnostics question. So it's
been – you've closed the Cepheid – or you haven't closed it but you've announced the Cepheid transaction. You've had
a little bit more time to think about it. Any further additional thoughts on where you think you can ultimately get the
gross margin on the Cepheid products? That was sort of a topic when we did the call the last time. I just wonder if you
had any further thoughts on it.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Derik, thanks. I don't know that we have a lot more to offer. During due diligence, we
were able to spend a good deal of time with the team and understand the roadmap that they had laid out for gross
margins. You've heard a lot of that from the business in terms of the opportunities around improving the cost structure

of the cartridge. We think those are very credible. We think they've got a solid roadmap for executing on those
improvements and obviously once we've closed the transaction and we can engage directly with them, we'll be bringing
the tools of the Danaher Business System that we've used successfully in a number of other businesses to improve gross
margins. You just heard Dan comment about what we've done at Beckman and we'll obviously bring that to bear at
Cepheid and I think you'll see those improvements come through.
<Q - Derik De Bruin>: Great. And just one more Western Europe question. Are you seeing, is it budget delays that
you're seeing? Are people just canceling orders or people just hesitating on spending? Just a little bit more color on
what's going on in terms of specific just trends, if there's anything you can sort of draw from what you're seeing across
the businesses?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Derik, was that a Europe question? I'm sorry.
<Q - Derik De Bruin>: It was a Western Europe question, yeah.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yes, much more in terms of delays than cancellations. We tend to see both at the
tendering level as well as at the purchase order level folks hanging back. In certain cases it's because budgets haven't
been fully approved yet. In other cases, they're just trying to get paperwork through approvals, and normally that's a
circumstance where because of some levels of austerity, folks are just slowing things down.

And our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks guys. Good morning.
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Morning, Nigel.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, I feel like we've covered a lot of ground, so I want to keep this relatively quick. But I did want
to come back to Dental, And there's obviously a lot of noise from some of your competitors regarding the US channel.
So I'm just wondering, given the recovery we've seen, the nice recovery we've seen in core growth rates in Dental, how
confident are you that you can sustain this level of growth in the sort of the 3% surplus bracket?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Well clearly, there is some cause for concern or caution around that given some of the
narrative that we heard from the channel during the course of the quarter. We saw some of that in the month of
September come through in terms of the order rates on the consumables side. So I think we feel pretty good about
continuing to improve our own execution, particularly on the equipment side. also at Nobel. But I think on the
consumables side, we'll need to make sure that we're seeing some improvement in the sell out either from a
programmatic perspective or just from an overall macroeconomic perspective.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Great, okay. And then Diagnostics, we don't have a great history on the quarterly performance of
Diagnostics, but it does feel like last year we saw sort of maybe an unusually large Q-over-Q step down in margins in
3Q followed by a pretty big pickup in 4Q. Would you expect to see a similar 4Q buildup as 3Q? And then more broadly
on 4Q restructuring across the portfolio, in the past Danaher had very heavy restructuring actions in 4Q. I know this
year is not going to be anywhere like that, but maybe just comment on how you see 4Q restructuring actions across the
portfolio?
<A - Thomas Patrick Joyce>: Yeah Nigel, on Diagnostics first, seasonally Q3 tends to be a little lighter. You saw that
play out again this year, though a big improvement versus Q3 a year ago, and we do expect a nice seasonal pickup in
Q4. We'd expect margins above where they were a year ago Q4, which was north of 18%. Regarding restructuring, we
continue to take actions throughout the year. We don't really kind of call those out. I would expect our overall
