MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Exxon Mobil Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff
Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My
comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.
Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil
earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite a challenging
business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemicals
segments. ExxonMobil's diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct
competitive advantage through the business cycle.
We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals. While we continue to capture market savings in the current
environment, we also remain resolute in our drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our

integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment.
Finally, as I'll share with you today, the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments.
We are effectively progressing selective strategic investments while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safe and
reliable operations.
Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw modest global
economic growth in the third quarter. While the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth
rates slowed in China and remain soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat although volatile, whereas
natural gas prices strengthened on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as
production continued to outpace demand. And chemical commodity product margins remained strong, while specialty
margins held relatively flat.
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on slide 5, as indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7
billion, or $0.63 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2
billion, down 45% from the third quarter last year, reflecting the corporation's capital discipline and strong project
execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.3 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.1
billion, and debt was $46.2 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances increased from
$4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and
our ongoing asset management program yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash,
including shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion, debt, and other
financing, increased cash by $1.7 billion.
Moving now to slide 7 to review our segmented results, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion
from the year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were
approximately flat to the prior-year quarter, although below our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700
million on average over the next few years. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide 8, earnings decreased
by $950 million on stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 9, third quarter Upstream earnings were
$620 million, down $738 million from the year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations,
which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel and gas realizations fell by $1.13
per thousand cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million. And all other items added $60
million, driven by lower operating expenses.
Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year, totaling
just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 120,000 barrels per day, as growth from projects
and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due
to third-party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day, as new project
volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11, Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the
second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per
barrel and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced
earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefiting from reduced operating
expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects.
Moving to slide 12, sequentially, volumes decreased 146,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, or almost 4%. Liquids
production dropped 119,000 barrels per day from downtime events, entitlement impacts, and field decline. Natural gas
production decreased 161 million cubic feet per day, as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were
partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from U.S. work programs.

Moving now to Downstream results, starting on slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a
decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6
billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170
million. Other items, including lower operating costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains,
increased earnings by $580 million.
As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. To date,
more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model, resulting in an earnings impact
of $380 million in the quarter.
Turning to slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by
$330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity, increased earnings by $240
million. All other items added a further $490 million, mostly from asset management gains and lower expenses.
Moving now to Chemical results, starting on slide 15, third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion decreased $56
million from the prior-year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance
expenses. Moving to slide 16, Chemical earnings decreased $46 million sequentially, where stronger margins partly
offset increased maintenance activity.
Moving now to slide 17, key to delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to
investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating costs down, especially in the current
business climate, with year-to-date CapEx and operating costs lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior-year
period.
We strive to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total lifecycle costs. With our global
procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to
changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement with the service sector on developing
and implementing lower-cost solutions.
Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design
and execution phases that capture these structural advantages while ensuring high integrity in our operations. For
example, by leveraging our Fast Drill process and Flat Time Reduction initiatives, we realized cumulative drilling
savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved
performance in places like Angola, Guyana, and Russia. A hallmark of our success has been our committed focus
across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower-cost alternatives, but also to enhance
integrity and reliability, improve productivity, increase product value, and minimize environmental impact.
On slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of proved reserves and asset impairments. Our
results are in accordance with the rules and standards of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves, as I indicated, our reporting is consistent with SEC rules, which prescribe
technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical
12-month average of first day of the month prices in a given year. As such, the low price environment impacted our
2015 reserves replacement, resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas reserves being
reduced by 834 million oil equivalent barrels, primarily in the U.S., reflecting the change in natural gas prices, offset by
liquid additions of 1.9 billion barrels.
Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on an SEC pricing basis, we anticipate
that certain quantities of currently booked reserves, such as those associated with our Canadian Oil Sands, will not
qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with end of
field life production for certain other liquids and natural gas operations in North America also may not qualify.
However, as you know, amounts required to be debooked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked in the future
when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the
debooking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect the operation of these assets or to alter our outlook
for future production volumes. You can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K.

Now regarding asset impairments, we follow U.S. GAAP Successful Efforts. And under this standard, assessments are
made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment
opportunities. This is different than the SEC price basis for reserves that I just described.
As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year we undertook an effort to assess our major long-lived assets most at risk for
potential impact. The price basis used in this assessment was generally consistent with long-term price forecasts
published by third-party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that the future
undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value. Again, this is detailed in our 2015
10-K.
In light of continued weakness in the upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and
budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-lived assets, similar to the exercise
undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our year-end
financial statements.
Moving to slide 19, I'd like to provide an update on efforts to further enhance our development portfolio and advance
major projects. First in Guyana, the Liza-3 appraisal well was successfully completed in October, increasing our
confidence in the aerial extent of this world-class resource. Well results now confirm the Liza discovery to be in excess
of 1 billion oil equivalent barrels. These results are being incorporated into early engineering plans for the initial phase
of a 100,000 barrel per day development.
The Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Payara exploration prospect, located approximately 10 miles to the
northwest of the Liza-1 discovery. Payara is expected to be completed late this year or early next year, after which the
rig will move to another exploration opportunity, also on the Stabroek block.
In West Africa, the Owowo-3 well, located approximately 56 miles offshore Angola, reached target depth in October
and discovered significant oil resources. This well builds on our successful Owowo-2 well drilled in 2012 on the
neighboring license. Together, these wells confirm a 0.5 billion to 1 billion-barrel oil discovery.
ExxonMobil continues to invest in its exploration activity to grow our prospect inventory across the globe. Recognizing
the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing counter-cyclically in large-scale seismic
acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data covering
diverse geological basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Ireland, South Africa, and
Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new
potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advanced seismic imaging
and high-performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data.
In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large-scale developments. The Kashagan
project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable restart of production in October. Work is ongoing to safely and gradually
increase production to a target level of 370,000 barrels per day over the next year.
In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped four LNG cargoes from Gorgon since August, and the second LNG train has
now started up.
In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron utilities and process
module, or UPM, was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and
Labrador. The topsides, including the UPM, will next be mated with the concrete gravity-based structure, shown in the
background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to start up by year-end 2017.
Moving to slide 20, this slide illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our
ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program. As shown, cash flow from
operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions and, together with a moderate increase in
debt financing, supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a
competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through the cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities.

ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year to date, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our
business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per
share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015.
Moving now to slide 21, so in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through the cycle.
Year to date, the corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated $16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset
sales, benefiting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil equivalent barrels
per day, and we anticipate that full-year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million
barrels a day, driven by our value-based choices. ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline
regardless of the business environment. Year-to-date capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain
committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend
distributions totaled $9.3 billion.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Hey. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Phil.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: The first question is the capital spending. You continued to see a reduction sequentially in the
CapEx year to date, and it's obviously trending well below what you had expected at the beginning of the year. So I
guess my first question is given the degree that it's lower than you had guided, are you surprised by the degree of
savings that you've been able to achieve? And as we look ahead, where are we in this cycle of CapEx savings?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That's a real good question, Phil, and I'd say that first I just want to recognize the
organization for how focused they've been on it, and particularly in the low-price environment continuing to capture
benefits. We, as you highlighted, have been below our capital guidance to you all. We've been able to capture many
capital efficiencies. We've continued to effectively respond to the market and capture market benefits. Importantly,
Phil, we've continued to deliver the projects on budget and on schedule. And as I've said previously, we have adjusted
the pace of some of our investments in order to make sure that we're maximizing the value proposition given where we
are in the business cycle. If you look at our spending pattern, I would tell you that it is trending towards an outlook of
between $20 billion to $21 billion.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: $20 billion to $21 billion for the full year.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: For the full year.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Okay. And then as you look at the M&A activity, there has been a lot of M&A activity in the
U.S. shale space lately, some of which has been acreage that's been contiguous to yours. Maybe if you could, just
comment about how you're thinking about valuations in U.S. shale today.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So as we've talked in the past, Phil, we continue to be very alert to where there may be
some value propositions. We're looking for opportunities that would create incremental value. These opportunities need
to compete with our existing investment portfolio and provide accretive strategic long-term value to us. We have been
successful over the recent past taking on bolt-on acquisitions, particularly in the unconventional business, where we
saw some of those unique synergies that added accretive value. We continue to be very alert to where there are
opportunities. But as I said, they really need to be able to add incremental value versus the portfolio that we currently
have.

We'll go next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: Good morning, Jeff. How are you?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Neil. How are you?
<Q - Neil Mehta>: Doing well. Jeff, I always appreciate your views on the near-term oil macro. I know Rex [Tillerson]
had made some comments out in London talking about a more subdued market over the next couple years. Can you just
talk about how you see the balances over the next couple of years, both from a supply and demand perspective? And
then I'll have a follow-up.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: All right. So, Neil, if you think back and look at where we've been here in the recent past,
I'll start with demand. Demand has been generally reasonably strong, when you think about it, a 10-year average
demand growth of somewhere between 1 million to 1.1 million barrels per day. Since 2014, we've seen demand growth
in excess of that, so fairly reasonable demand growth in the recent past.
If you look, focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in an oversupply situation, with production
exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, we are seeing convergence
in the second half. But I'll tell you that as you continue to progress that, we'll probably end up this year oversupplied by
anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million barrels per day of supply. Now of course, all this is going into commercial
inventories.
So as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see convergence, maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But
I'd caution that we've got to recognize that there's still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial
inventory build since the end of 2013 that's got to come out of inventory at some point. And then of course, there are
still uncertainties in the supply trend, some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. unconventionals will have an
influence on the supply/demand balance. So I think when you heard Rex's comments, he was reflecting on all these
factors as to how that will impact price in the near to medium term.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: I appreciate that, Jeff. And the follow-up is related to exploration. If you can provide some
additional color on both Guyana, where there has been some exploration success with Liza-3, and the opportunity set
you see in Nigeria, that would be appreciated.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So as I said in my prepared comments on Guyana, we were very pleased with the
outcome of the Liza-3 well. The well is located just north of Liza-1. It has given us confidence in terms of the aerial
extent, the reservoir quality, and thus our communication that we believe we're in excess of 1 billion barrels now. We're
completing the Liza-3 well. As I indicated, we'll move on to an exploration well which is to the northwest of the Liza
discovery. We are integrating real time all of this well data. And of course, we took a very extensive 3-D seismic
survey. And all that's being integrated into our development planning. So in short, I'd say we're very encouraged by not
only Liza but the prospectivity on the block, and we see this as a high-quality asset for the corporation.
Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I'd tell you that this is a continuation of an initial discovery. The
Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper
objective, so again, very encouraging. As I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion
to 1 billion barrels of oil discovery, and we will clearly integrate that into our development planning.
I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization in its integration is
able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this
deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development there. So I think it's a

Operator
We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Thanks very much. Hi, Jeff. I had two questions for you actually. The first was around the
impact of the forward statement that you have and the comments that you made about the proved reserves. I'm just
trying to understand. In Canada, it looks like in 2015 you actually had some fairly significant positive reserve revisions.
And so I'm just wondering if the $7 change that we've seen in WTI from year to year is the primary driver on why those
reserves could now potentially be at risk. And is Kearl an all-or-nothing thing, where it would be the full 3.6 billion
barrels or it would be nothing? If you could, just comment around that.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good question, Jason. The first point is, as I mentioned, we're seeing almost a 25%
reduction in prices on an SEC basis year to date. Now of course, we need to wait until we get the last two data points
for that calculation. But given what we were seeing to this point, we felt it was appropriate to signal the potential
impact from the SEC pricing basis on proved reserves. Yes, we did add some reserves in Kearl in 2015, and then the
drop that we're potentially going to experience in 2016 is all due to the pricing basis. The second question was – I'm
sorry, Jason, was related to what?
<Q - Jason Gammel>: It was really just you referenced 3.6 billion barrels in the press release that's related to Kearl. Is
that an all-or-nothing thing? In other words, is it the full operation?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: For the most part, it is. For Kearl itself, if you remember, it's a very, very long, flat
plateau. So it would be all or nothing.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Sure. And are you positive cash margin there right now, Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We manage all of our assets to maximize cash flow. I will tell you that the organization
has done a remarkable job at Kearl. Remember, if I step back a little bit, Kearl is an advantaged asset from the
standpoint that we did not put an upgrader in place. We used proprietary technology in order to avoid that upfront
capital investment and the subsequent operating costs associated with it. The organization has – just what we're really
primed to do is continue to improve overall reliability of the mine operation as well as significantly reduce our cost
structure there, and they will continue to work on it like we do everywhere. And we manage these assets in order to
maximize long-term return, and I'm very confident that that will happen here in Kearl as well.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Great, I appreciate your comments, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes.

We'll take our next question from Evan Calio at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Maybe my first question is a different slant to Phil's prior question. Just given the success you've
had adding resources from the drill bit in Guyana and Nigeria, brownfield opportunity in places like PNG [Papua New
Guinea], a pretty significant opportunity set, does that really contribute to your cautious take so far on the asset market

or the acquisition market? Maybe broaden what Phil asked more for the U.S., but your view on the global market and
perceived need and/or interest.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, it's a good perspective, Evan. I would tell you it's not either/or for us. We're looking
at where can we get the greatest value. But I think you draw out a very important point as it relates to how we manage
the portfolio, and that is we maintain an active exploration program that is clearly defined at high-grading the value
proposition in our portfolio. And you've highlighted some of the important resources.
When we get to the point in the asset's life where we don't think that there's that much incremental value, that's when
we put it into our process of considering how else can you monetize that asset. But at the same time, we're also very
alert to where there may be some value propositions from acquisitions, and I think the InterOil transaction is a really
good example. We discovered a substantial resource base in Papua New Guinea. We've continued our exploration
activity, looking towards an expansion of the existing LNG facility. And in addition to that, we saw the opportunity for
synergies, value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically the Elk-Antelope resource that we could
combine with our existing resources there. And with the great success we've had in terms of the operating reliability
and the cost structure there, it puts it right up to the top of the portfolio. So think about all of our actions, Evan, as what
is the best value proposition? That may come organically or inorganically.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, that's fair, and maybe a follow-up on Liza, maybe just more detail here on how success
affects your 2017 wildcatting program across your various blocks, potentially adding another rig. Any preliminary
thoughts on how that affects the development plan you filed in July, potentially adding a second FPSO. And maybe just
to clean it up there, just any color on [ph] pyar (36:32) or what you learned from Skipjack.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So as I indicated in the earlier question, we're very encouraged with the progress that
we're making at Guyana. I think you also know that we also are very measured in our pace in terms of exploration and
development. We want to make sure that we are not leaving any value on the table. We also want to make sure in the
exploration program that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves. We want to make sure that we're fully integrating the
learnings into the regional geology so that we upgrade our potential exploration program going forward. So it's a paced
program. It's making sure that those learnings are being fully integrated, and then making sure that when we do
discover additional resources or learn important information like we learned at Skipjack that we integrate that into not
only our exploration program but the scope of the full development.
As it pertains to our initial phased development, it's been fairly consistent in scope, as it was conveyed in the permit
application. We filed for environmental review with the government. I will tell you that this is real time. The
organization is looking for ways to further enhance value. And as we progress that development planning and early
engineering, we'll learn more, which will cause us to make adjustments. But very optimistic about the future in Guyana,
and we think we're bringing a lot of value to the government and people of Guyana.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, on the prospect?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On Payara?
<Q - Evan Calio>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So I'd say it is a similar reservoir section to Liza, also a stratigraphic trap. Other than that,
it's really too early to say much more.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great, thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet.

<Q - Sam Margolin>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: I'll start out. It's been a number of years since people have had to think about an OPEC cut and
filtering through partners. Can you just remind us of the potential impacts to the business? I'm thinking specifically of
Upper Zakum and some other projects that start up next year within member states.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sam, I'm not really going to speculate on what OPEC might ultimately decide to do. I
think what's important for you all to think about is that – rest assured that we are working to create incremental margin
in the business. So directionally, it could impact you in several ways. One, there could be restrictions, but we're going
to continue to make the value proposition. But at this point, it's just too early to speculate on what we may or may not
see from the agreement from the OPEC parties.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: Understood, thanks so much. And then I'm curious about this evaluation you mentioned in the
press release about another chemical complex in the U.S. Gulf. Does that reflect – I recall at the Analyst Day, there
were plans to ramp U.S. unconventional activity that were unveiled. So is this new chemical complex potentially a
reflection of you or associated with that at all and maybe some view on continued at least localized length in liquids
and other associated products coming out of your oil fields in the U.S., or is this just a separate economic decision?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So like most everything in ExxonMobil, it all starts with our view on the long-term
energy supply/demand picture. And when you think about chemicals, the chemical demand growth based on our latest
outlook has, from an overall perspective, chemicals growing about 1% above GDP. And from an ethylene perspective,
we're expecting that chemical demand will grow such that you'll need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new
capacity per year. And to put that into hardware, that would be three to four world-scale crackers per year.
So that really sets up the value proposition. First, as you know, we're expanding the Baytown complex to add another
1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity, a corresponding investment at Mont Belvieu adding derivative units to
produce ExxonMobil's high-value metallocene and polyethylene. And then we announced – to your question, we
announced a potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast that
would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker that produces about 1.8 million tons per annum and corresponding
derivative units that would be built alongside that. But I think the value proposition is there. I think we're ahead of the
game in terms of making some world-scale investments in this and a very strong component of our Chemical business.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: Thanks so much.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet.

We'll move next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So, Jeff, the new CapEx guidance seems to be following a trend that you've indicated goes lower
again next year. Cut you've also said that in a recovering environment, you could quickly pivot back to unconventionals
in the fourth quarter again. I think the number I have in my head is an incremental 200,000 barrels a day net to Exxon
by the end of 2018. Can you just walk us through where you stand on making that decision and whether I'm
categorizing it correctly?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So if you recall, back in the March analyst meeting, we provided an outlook through the
end of the decade for our capital investment program. And if you remember, we had 2017 flat to down. And of course,
the experiences that we've realized during 2016 will be integrated into that, and we'll update that outlook going into the

next analyst meeting in March of next year.
As you reflect on our ability to pivot, remember there are two components to our investment program. There's a very
large component, being our long-cycle investments. Nothing's really slowed down in that regard on how we're working
through maximizing the value proposition for those investments. And as I've said earlier, we're trying to take full
advantage of the cycle benefits.
On the short-cycle side, you may recall, and I think the number you're picking up with is in our unconventional
program we shared in March, that we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture a higher price
environment in our unconventional program, to the order of magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So
we've got a lot of flexibility in our short-cycle program.
And when you think about what really sets the balance between short and long-cycle investment and the way I think
about it from a short-cycle perspective, Doug, is really maintaining a program in a low-price environment that allows
us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits. You don't want to go much beyond that because you're trying to
also maximize value. So I think we're very well positioned. If your recall, in the second quarter of last year of our last
earnings call, we shared with you some statistics around our unconventional program where we continue to drop the
costs, and we have a pretty sizable ready inventory to go ahead and move on.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I appreciate the details on it, Jeff. My follow-up, if I may, I'm afraid is back to Guyana again. I
wonder if I could just probe a little bit to try and clear up some comments that your partner made, so really about next
steps on timing. My understanding is that you're still on location on Liza-3 looking for deeper objectives. So my
question is are you done there? Have you found [ph] gross (45:50) oil or not, water contact? And maybe comment on
your partner's suggestion that the range of Liza is now at the top end of your prior disclosed range.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I'll start with the second half of the question, and that is that right now, our guidance is
that we're likely above 1 billion barrels, and really no more detail beyond that at this point, Doug.
On the Liza-3 well, we did go ahead and deepen the well. We were targeting a higher-risk, deeper interval that had not
previously been penetrated on the block. What I would share with you is that the results were positive and it does
support the presence of oil-bearing sands deeper in the section, but it is still very early. This is real time. Evaluation is
still ongoing, and that information will be used to integrate not only in the Liza but also in the rest of our exploration.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So did you find oil/water contact, or is that another appraisal well planned?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Did we find an oil/water contact in the deeper interval?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: No, no, in the original section.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We were targeting – it goes back to the objective of the Liza-3 well. We were targeting
water in the lowermost sands, and we did encounter that water in the sand. We're still evaluating the results from the
well, Doug, but suffice it to say, we're pleased with the results and they are consistent with our pre-gel expectations.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right, thanks a lot. I appreciate it, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Doug.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: To the extent that I say in excess of 1 billion barrels, yes.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Okay. And then I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail around Skipjack. Can
you describe at all what happened there geologically and why it was ultimately a dry hole? And how did it inform the
future drilling plans, and were prospects eliminated based on the result, or was the drilling schedule changed?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Skipjack did not find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, but it did find the same
excellent reservoir quality sands that we see in Liza. As we've been saying, we have numerous additional prospects as
well as different play types on the block. So we're very encouraged by the successes to date as well as the future oil
exploration wells. There's really nothing more to share on Skipjack at this point. We are still doing some final
evaluation. And of course, as I alluded to earlier, those learnings are being fully integrated into our exploration
program.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Okay, understood. And then switching to Nigeria, certainly a very large apparent production
impact in this quarter. Can you talk about what the current status is of your production there? I know you or at least
reportedly recently lifted the force majeure there.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So when you think about our liquids shortfall versus the third quarter of last year as well
as sequentially, it was all primarily driven to the downtime in Nigeria, and there were two third-party impacts. The first
one, I think I may have mentioned it in the second quarter earnings call. The first one had to do with the third-party rig
that was transiting that impacted our export line, which had an impact on our production. That issue has been
addressed, and the production is back on. The second one had to do with a third-party impact to the line. And let me
just say that we're still investigating with the government. We do not believe it was accidental or due to mechanical
failure.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Okay.

Our next question comes from Ed Westlake at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yes, good morning. I guess there have been press releases out of Mozambique
saying you have a done deal with Eni, so I'm just wondering if there are any comments that you can make in public on
that.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Ed. I know there has been a fair bit of media interest in this. There's
really nothing that I can comment on with respect to those media reports. You may recall also that ExxonMobil and
Rosneft were given the rights to negotiate for a PSC on three offshore blocks in Mozambique, and we're actively
working that opportunity. In fact, we're participating in a 3D survey right now that started up in January and is still
underway.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Okay, and then a second question. I see a lot of ways that you can get on the
offense, and we've spoken about a lot of them on the call. Maybe we haven't spoken enough about integrated value
growth in the downstream. But there is this issue around impairments. So if I may, thanks for putting that on the
agenda. One of the triggers that you have in your 10-K for impairments is operating losses, and obviously the U.S. has
been in an operating loss for much of 2015 and 2016. And then oil sands may or may not be in an operating loss. So we
don't get that disclosure, but let's say it is. I'm just looking in your accounts, and your net capitalized costs for
consolidated subsidiaries in the U.S. is $83 billion and then in Canada is $36 billion. So maybe just walk through the
process of how you'd go through those impairments. Say the trigger was there, and how the corporation would think
about the type of impact it might have.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: As I said my prepared comments, Ed, we did an assessment in 2015. And in that
assessment, as I was very clear in my comments, we saw that the cash flow fully covered the carrying costs of those
assets. As I indicated, Ed, we're going to do another analysis very similar to the comprehensive assessment we did in
2015, and we'll report on any results. But you can see some pretty good detail of what we go through, and in fact
maybe you've already looked at it given your comments in our 10-K that really defines the process pretty clearly. But I
really don't have any more to share on the specifics of the mechanics that we go through. But rest assured, we're in full
compliance with the rules and standards of both the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: I guess we could take the RP [Reserves to Production] ratio as a proxy for the years
of undiscounted cash flow, and then we can make our own forecast of how much cash flow you make at the strip and
compare that to the carrying value would be at least a first approach to it. I guess I just worry that if you deep up
reserves, then you'll have less reserve life to multiply by the cash flow to then, on an undiscounted basis, carry against
the asset value.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I don't have anything else more to add on this, Ed. We'll continue to be transparent on
this. That was the whole purpose of putting the forward statement in there. It's part of our normal planning and
budgeting process to look at the profitability of our assets, and that sometimes causes us to step back like we did in
2015 and do a more comprehensive assessment.

We'll go next to Asit Sen at CLSA.
<Q - Asit Sen>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Asit. How are you?
<Q - Asit Sen>: Good. Good, so two unrelated questions, first on global gas. Could you remind us? What percent of
your LNG volume is not under long-term contract? And given slowdown in traditional Asian markets, particularly
Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, are you seeing more near-term opportunities in other regional markets? And just wondering
if you have any incremental thoughts on the European gas picture. And I have a follow-up.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On the global gas, first let me remind everybody that from our energy outlook, we have
gas growing about 1.6% and LNG growth just under 3 times where we are in current LNG capacity. As you go
forward, and we've said it many times, Asit, that our LNG business is a very important part of our portfolio. I don't
have a specific breakdown of our total gas production between pipeline sales and LNG contract sales. But recognize
that a large part of our Asian gas coming from Qatar and Papua New Guinea is under long-term contracts, and a good
part of them are liquids-linked. So that's about all I can give you on that.
In terms of the markets, clearly the Asian Pacific market is an important market for LNG. We've got a very expansive
marketing organization to go and identify value opportunities. We are primarily interested in locking in long-term
contracts, either a point-to-point or a portfolio sale. You may recall that before we take an LNG project to a final
investment decision that we will lock in a majority of those volumes on a long-term contract. We've then really
developed a very strong reputation and credibility with the buyers through our ability to deliver these projects on
schedule and our responsiveness to managing through the contract terms. We've got a new operations center that we put
in place in Asia-Pacific to facilitate the transactions with our many buyers.
<Q - Asit Sen>: Okay, thanks. And my second question is on Brazil. It appears Brazil is opening up in an area where
Exxon is not really involved. Given Guyana traction that you have now, could you update us on your latest views in
Brazil?

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Brazil is a country that's really blessed with a large endowment of resources. It's really
high-quality resource. Remember how we approach our investment activities is one, in making sure that we get
attractive returns for our shareholders. The trends in Brazil have been encouraging. We continue to look for where there
could be good value opportunities in Brazil. And certainly, if we think that we can get engaged there on resources or
exploration activities that will be competitive on a global perspective to the other opportunities that we've got in front
of us, we certainly will consider that.

We'll go next to Ryan Todd at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe if I could follow up on an earlier question in terms of CapEx trends and
activity levels, you've seen, as was highlighted before, your CapEx year to date is trending well below official
guidance. And even at $20 billion to $21 billion for the year, it's still relatively low and impressive. It's to the point
where you actually cover CapEx and dividend here in the quarter. So I guess first, I guess with you effectively breaking
even in the current environment, I know it's just one quarter. But how should we think about how you manage
additional cash flow into 2017 as the oil and gas price recovers? How do you prioritize an increase in activity levels
versus growth in distributions versus reduction in leverage?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: It's a good question, Ryan, and I know we've talked about it before but it's always good to
update on this issue. As you know, let me just first talk about capital allocation.
From our cash flow from operations, the first thing that the corporation wants to do is go ahead and pay a reliable and
growing dividend. The next thing is the remaining cash is put towards an investment program that has gotten to the
point where we believe that we have maximized the value proposition for investments. If we've got enough cash to go
ahead and invest it to fund that investment program, then the remaining cash will either be put forward to either stock
buyback, share buybacks, or paying down our debt. If we don't have enough cash, as you've seen us do in the recent
past, is we'll go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional
debt because the service costs associated with that debt is more than benefited by the return we get from these
investments.
So it's important to recognize that while we are very mindful of prudently managing our cash, we also believe it's very
important for us to continue to invest through the cycle. And we do that in a very measured way that we're not leaving
any value on the table. And that's my – and therefore my comments I made earlier about making sure that we're
optimizing value at the bottom of a cycle.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great, thanks. Sorry, maybe as a follow-up on that, you had mentioned earlier on the call how you
guys have done a good job. You've generally maintained a decent amount of investment level on your long cycle-type
projects. But when you're looking at this point at your pre-FID inventory projects, can you speak to the progress that
you've seen on large-scale conventional projects in terms of cost deflation or evolution in fiscal terms towards
enhancing the competitiveness of this part of the portfolio? Have you seen what you need to see at this point to go and
kick off investment in that – to continue new investment in that part of the portfolio, or is there more that you need to
see at this point?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Let's break it up into a couple components, Ryan. First, I'd say that we want to make sure
that all the learnings that we're getting from our capital efficiency efforts year to date are being integrated into those
projects. And we've talked about how we do this to reduce the upfront capital invested like I've talked in the past about
progressing projects and parallels that we can benefit from the learning curve in subsequent projects. So capturing the
market response, capturing the capital efficiencies that we've built in, in a low price environment, as you've highlighted,
there are times where we may want to go back and purchase some additional resources or do some exploration like in

Owowo, to add additional resource to make the investment, the project investment even more robust.
The last thing I'd mention is the application of technology has been fundamental, absolutely fundamental to our past
success and into the future. And you think about where you're getting those benefits across the full value chain, from
the Downstream, our Chemical business where we use proprietary technology to provide high-value metallocene, to
our unconventional business with fracking technology. So the application and the growth of these technology solutions
has been a key element. And sometimes, some of these projects are really waiting on some of the technology work
that's underway. So we've made great progress. I think we're very well positioned. We've got a solid, diverse portfolio
in which to go ahead and selectively invest into the future.

And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Hi, Jeff. I just wanted to – I had a question with regards to the way you look at your asset
impairments versus the way that you look at acquisitions. I'm just trying to square the fact that you haven't written
down assets in 2015, given you've got, I suppose, a fairly constructive view on commodity prices with the opposing
fact that you haven't done a deal over the last year or so, given that you haven't seen attractive enough assets in the
market. Can you just talk about how those two things work together?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: From my standpoint, there are two separate processes. Our asset management activity is a
function of making sure that we are capturing opportunities, as I said earlier, that are competitive to our existing
portfolio. The objective here is making sure that we're growing shareholder value. And if we think that we can acquire
an asset like the InterOil transaction and we can add incremental long-term value, then we'll go ahead and pursue those
type of opportunities. Our determination of asset impairment, which we've talked about, is a comprehensive process
that we follow. And as I said, it's detailed in our 2015 10-K, and it's a separate process. It's not informing or influencing
our asset management activity.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up on Nigeria, you've made a number of discoveries in
Nigeria, a number of things that you highlighted as potential developments. Could we expect any of these to be
sanctioned for development in 2017? And if so, which are the ones that have most progressed?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So, Anish, as you highlight, there are a number of projects that we have in our portfolio
that we've shared with you all in our F&O, and several of those have gone through various stages of development
planning to capture some incremental value. I would tell you that, just like any project, there are a lot of variables that
we have to address, and some of those variables may take some time. But we continue to actively work with the
co-ventures and the government on the Nigeria portfolio. I think the Owowo-3 well is a good example of how we've
added some additional value to our portfolio and strengthened that project opportunity.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: And any of it could be sanctioned next year?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Anish, we don't pre-communicate our FIDs, but the portfolio that we share with you in
the F&O, we've got various stages of development planning underway in those projects. Some of them are in [ph] PID
(1:06:35). Some of them are even more advanced. Like one of them, Tengiz, has been FID-ed. But we don't provide
advanced guidance on our FIDs.

<Q - Roger D. Read>: Just maybe coming back a little bit to broader cash flow, CapEx questions here, a number
people have asked the question, does CapEx, is it troughing here? Does it go up? I guess to some extent, that's going to
depend on oil price and cash flow. But how do you look at it in a world where prices have increased quite a bit from the
beginning of the year, and then balancing cash flow, CapEx, any asset disposition plans? And then can you lay out any
of the parameters for when we should anticipate a recovery in the share repurchase program? What do we need to see?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I really want to be careful not to speculate on what prices will do in the future. But I will
tell you, as we discussed a little bit earlier, that our investment, our long-cycle investment plans are progressing. When
we believe those investments are at a point of maturity where we optimize on value, then we'll make an FID decision.
Recall that we're making those decisions by our long-term view on supply and demand. We're very constructive on
long-term energy demand, and that's what's really informing those long-cycle investments. It is not what current prices
are doing. Now having said that, we balance that with other factors that we may be able to capture some incremental
value in the near term and causes us to pace those investments out on a longer cycle in order to make sure that we're
fully capturing the value.
On the short-cycle investments, as I alluded to earlier, we want to keep activity levels in the down cycle commensurate
with the learning curve benefits that we've been realizing such that we are enhancing value across the full portfolio, but
it doesn't make sense to do much more beyond that if you recognize that you want to optimize value. But as I
responded to Doug earlier, we're very well poised to go ahead and pick up activity on the short-cycle investments if
supported by the business climate and we've got flexibility to do so.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Sure, the correct response on prices is always just to say fluctuate, right? But in terms of
thinking about the share repo side of it, is that a – do you need to be at a point where you're comfortable, you can let's
say maintain roughly flat production levels and generate free cash flow, or how should we think about balancing
production returns, cash flow? I'm thinking about a more normalized environment, which it appears we're headed to
over the next year or two.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So go back to my discussion on the capital allocation approach with the buybacks. That's
determined each quarter considering a number of factors, including the company's current financial position, our capital
requirements, our dividend requirements, as well as what we see in the near-term business outlook. It's all those
variables that really inform the company as to whether we believe it's appropriate to go ahead and distribute some of
the benefits of the corporation back to the shareholder via buybacks. Remember, the corporation does not believe we
should be holding large cash reserves. If we don't have an immediate use to put it to work on, we'll go ahead and
distribute it. Now to be clear, that consideration will also be mindful of the merits of going ahead and paying down debt
if appropriate.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, thanks, and just an unrelated follow-up. Regarding the Kearl assets, is the indicator there
best to use a bitumen price or to use a WCS price? And that's just for us to do our calculations.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I think the WCS benchmark is probably reasonable.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: All right. Thank you, Roger.

We'll go next to Paul Cheng of Barclays.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Hi, Jeff. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Two quick ones hopefully. For Liza, do you have already sufficient well data from Liza 1 and 2
appraisals that you need to make an FID on the early production system, or do we need additional appraisal wells?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On Liza Guyana, at this time, I don't think we believe that additional appraisal wells are
required prior to FID decision. But I would tell you that, as I said earlier, Paul, that we will continue to integrate the
data that we've got. And there may be a point where we step back and say, given the risk profile, we may want to
collect some additional data. But right now, it's not planned.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay. And on Permian and Bakken, can you tell us what is your number of rigs and what is the
current production?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: For Permian and Bakken, I think we've got a total of 10 rigs going in the third quarter.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: And what's their production?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Production on a gross operated basis for Permian and Bakken is about 240,000 barrels a
day.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: And one of your pretty large competitors that was talking about in the preparation indeed that they
are going to add some additional rigs by November. I'm just curious whether Exxon has any preparation of increasing
your activities at this point?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Paul, as I just said a moment ago, we're very well positioned to respond if we think it's
appropriate. But I'm just not going to forecast whether we plan to add anything in the near term.
<Q - Paul Cheng>: Okay, very good. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You bet, Paul.

And our next question comes from Iain Reid of Macquarie.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Iain.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Just a quick question. I was intrigued to see a news report that Exxon is considering setting up a
trading organization. And I was listening to the answer to your question on LNG and point-to-point deliveries and
coverage by long-term contracts. Can you foresee a situation where Exxon would, rather like some of your competitors,
actually take some of the equity volumes itself from LNG development and then redistribute via other mechanisms?
Because I don't think Exxon has ever done that. You've always been a point-to-point energy player and never played in
the trading or diversion game. So I'd be interested in a comment on that.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Iain. I'd tell you, by and large, we're price takers. We don't typically speculate or
take positions in markets. Beyond that, in terms of the inner workings and how we want to manage that going forward,
there's really nothing more that I can share. We continue to be very mindful, from an LNG basis very mindful of what
is of interest to the buyers. And I think I referred to being open to portfolio sales, but we're still very much interested in
locking in those contracts on a long term.

<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. And as a follow-up, can I just ask a question about the long term on cash again?
Obviously, you're just ramping up the initial phase now, but what is the consortium thinking about in terms of going
further than that? Because the resources obviously could support a much larger level of production. And given the fact
that you've already got the facility onstream, you must be thinking about the next phase now. So that would be
interesting.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: To be real transparent, the joint venture company and the shareholders have been very
focused, and I'm sure you'll appreciate this, on getting the initial phase fully up on production and to maximum
capacity. As I said in my comments, that would be about 370,000 barrels a day by the end of 2017.
There is a second tranche to that subsequent to reaching 370,000 barrels, and that is with additional gas re-injection
facilities for sour gas that will take us up to about 450,000 barrels. And certainly, the joint venture company and all the
shareholders are very focused on given that we've restarted production, how do we move forward and really maximize
value, and that will include at the right time looking at additional resource development.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay, that's clear enough. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Ian.
