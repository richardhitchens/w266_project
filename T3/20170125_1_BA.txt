In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. We've provided detailed financial
information in today's press release and you can follow the broadcast and presentation through our website at
boeing.com.
Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals in our discussion today are likely to involve risk
which is detailed in our news release, various SEC filings and the forward-looking statement disclaimer in the
presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of
non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I will turn the call over to Dennis Muilenburg.
Dennis A. Muilenburg
Thank you, Troy, and good morning. Let me begin today with a brief overview of our 2016 operating performance,
followed by an update on the business environment and our expectations going forward. After that, Greg will walk you
through our financial results and outlook in greater detail.
With that, let's move to slide two. Throughout 2016, employees across our company worked to build on the strength
that have positioned Boeing as the aerospace industry leader after 100 years in operation. In delivering on our customer
commitments during the year and extending our broad market leadership, we generated strong revenue, solid core
operating earnings and record cash. We redoubled our focus on profitable, long-term growth strategies, disciplined
execution of our production and development programs, growing our services business and driving further quality and
productivity gains across the enterprise.
We also demonstrated our commitment to investing in our people and our business while once again returning
significant value to our shareholders. For the full year, we returned nearly $10 billion to shareholders through the
repurchase of 55 million shares for $7 billion and dividend payments totaling $2.8 billion.
In December, we deepened our commitment in this regard as our board of directors authorized a new $14 billion share
repurchase program and a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increases are part of our balanced cash
deployment strategy and reflect the confidence we have in our strong lineup of products and services in our long-term
outlook for the business.
Turning to our core operating performance for the year. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported revenue of $65 billion
driven by 748 deliveries which further extended our market share and leadership in airplane deliveries to a fifth
consecutive year. Net new commercial airplane orders were a healthy 668 which added to our robust backlog of
approximately 5,700 airplanes which is more than seven years of production at current rates. Key milestones in 2016
included first flight of the 737 MAX and completion of the first eight production aircraft. We also began final assembly
of the 787-10 in December and we started manufacturing components for preproduction testing on the 777X.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security had a solid year as well with healthy revenue and margins and with the team making
progress on critical program milestones including first flight of our T-X trainer aircraft. In the quarter, we also
successfully completed boom envelope testing on the KC-46 tanker program. Notwithstanding additional costs incurred
for incorporating known changes into the initial production aircraft which Greg will cover in more detail later, we
continue to transition from development to production with testing tracking to plan and no new technical discoveries
during the quarter.
Overall, we continue to see the tanker program as a profitable long-term franchise program for the company with the
need for approximately 400 aircraft worldwide. The $2.8 billion contract in 2016 from the U.S. Air Force for the first
19 KC-46 tankers highlights the demand and market opportunity we see for this program. Other key contract awards
and commitments for our defense and space business during the year included a contract from the U.S. Army for 117
remanufactured Apache helicopters and a $2.5 billion award from the U.S. Navy for 20 P-8 Poseidon aircraft.

In summary, during what was an exciting and memorable centennial year, we delivered solid core operating
performance, achieved record cash generation and strengthened our business for profitable long-term growth while
making strategic investments to accelerate into our second century and returning cash to shareholders as promised.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide three. We continue to see generally solid overall demand for
our products and services across our commercial, defense and space and services businesses. In our commercial
airplanes business, our global customers continue to recognize the compelling value proposition that our new more fuel
efficient product family brings to the market. Order deferral activity is approximately 2% of our backlog and remains
well below the historical 15-year average of 6%. New order activity is continuing at a moderated but healthy pace. For
2017, we expect our new order intake to be approximately the same as what we captured in 2016.
In the narrow-body market, we're seeing continued strong demand as illustrated by the 550 orders we captured in 2016
including the December 737 MAX orders from GECAS for 75 aircraft and the SpiceJet order for 100 aircraft. In the
wide-body market, we are seeing varying levels of demand across aircraft models. For the full year, we captured orders
for 118 wide-body aircraft with 58 of those being orders for the 787. However, on the 777, the near-term hesitation in
order activity we discussed with you on previous calls resulted in a total of 17 orders booked for the year.
Over the long-term, we remain highly confident in our commercial market forecast that continues to project strong
global demand with customers expected to order more than 39,600 airplanes over the next 20 years. That forecast
includes the need for more than 9,000 wide-body aircraft, underpinned by a large upcoming replacement cycle early in
the next decade.
Our overall confidence in the long-term market outlook is based on solid ongoing replacement demand and traffic
growth. Global passenger traffic continues to solidly outpace GDP with IATA reporting 6% growth in commercial
passenger traffic and 3% growth in freight traffic for 2016 during November.
Turning to individual airplane programs. As I previously mentioned, customer demand remains strong for the 737 with
a robust backlog of more than 4,400 firm orders for the NG and MAX models combined. We remain on track to raise
the 737 production rate from the current 42 per month to 47 in the third quarter of 2017, followed by 52 per month in
2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. And importantly, even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be oversold.
Simply put, this is a big attractive market and the 737 family's position within it is solid.
Our confidence in the future of the 737 MAX is reinforced by the fact that within our top 20 narrow-body customers,
we continue to see a large capacity for additional orders when we compare existing order totals to their overall fleet
size. For the current generation 777, our backlog at year end was 136 airplanes. In December, we announced our
decision to lower the 777 production to match supply with near-term demand. We have transitioned to the seven per
month production rate this month before we lower to the production rate in August to five per month as previously
announced.
Within the updated rate plan, delivery slots for the 777 are now nearly sold out for 2017. For 2018 and 2019 when we
begin phasing in 777X production, we are now approximately 90% sold out for both years where, as a reminder, we
will be delivering at a rate of approximately 3.5 per month. This rate plan includes the recent agreement from Iran Air
for 15 777-300ERs, and we continue to work a number of 777 sales campaigns to fill out the remaining production
slots. Based on the current sales environment, we believe the rate plan we've put in place establishes a production floor
for the 777 program. And we have a strong foundation of 320 777 exporters and commitments that support our
production plan for ramping up 777X deliveries.
Our 787 Dreamliner program also stands on a strong foundation for long-term production with 700 firm orders in our
year end backlog. Securing additional 787 orders to solidify the 14 per month production rate at the end of the decade
remains a priority. We've booked several new orders in 2016, but there's still more work to do.
On the 747 program, we are encouraged by the modest recovery in the air cargo market and the October order from
UPS for 14 747-8 Freighters with options for additional 14. This order helps to fill the production skyline for the
foreseeable future and significantly de-risks the 747 program.

We continue to see the commercial and defense services market as a major growth opportunity for us. We are
aggressively targeting this market as we strengthen our services and support areas, including our traditional parts,
modifications and upgrade business as well as expanding further into data analytics and information-based services.
Furthermore, in December, we announced plans for Boeing Global Services, an integrated new business unit that we
are forming from key elements of our commercial aviation services and global services and support groups. When this
new business unit begins fully operating during the third quarter, it will leverage synergies across the company and
further support our growth ambitions in this market. That market is expected to total $2.5 trillion over the next 10
years.
Turning to defense, space and security. We continue to see solid demand for our major platforms. While the fiscal year
2017 U.S. federal budget is not yet finalized, DOD and congressional support for our key BDS programs is firm. And
we continue to anticipate modest defense spending growth over the next five years. International demand for our
offerings remains healthy as well, in particular, the rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites and services.
We are encouraged with the notification to congress regarding the foreign military sale of 48 Chinooks to Saudi Arabia
and 37 Apaches to the UAE. And we have cleared congressional notification for 36 F-15s to Qatar with options for 36
more and 28 F-18s to Kuwait with options for an additional 12.
Additionally, we are pleased with the announcement of Canada's intent to purchase 18 F-18 fighters. We will remain
engaged with the Canadian government as we work to finalize this sale. The F-18 has a proven track record of
demonstrated results with unparalleled mission success for our warfighters while providing the best value for our
taxpayers. The defense, space and security team remains focused on driving market-based affordability of our products
and services and increasing overall profitability.
During the quarter, we announced additional organizational streamlining and major facilities consolidations in support
of these efforts. With these plans by the end of 2020, we expect to reduce facility space by an additional 4.5 million
square feet. Concurrent with the steps we're taking to improve cost competitiveness and affordability, we also continue
to invest in areas that are priorities for our customers such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services,
human space exploration and autonomous systems. Much of that investment supports the priority we have placed on
capturing future franchise programs where we are leveraging capabilities and technologies across the enterprise for
JSTARS recapitalization, ground-based strategic deterrent, advanced weapons programs and other important
opportunities such as the T-X trainer and the unmanned aircraft carrier-based MQ-25A.
In summary, our team is intent on building upon the strategic progress and business performance momentum
established over the past several years to meet our commitments to our stakeholders and accelerate improvements in
quality, safety and productivity, all to drive further innovation in our products and processes and deliver long-term
growth and value creation for our company.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our 2017 guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everybody. Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our full year results. Revenue for
the year was a strong $94.6 billion on solid commercial airplane deliveries and continued growth in our services
business. Core earnings per share totaled $7.24 a share for the full year, reflecting strong core operating performance
across the company that was offset by the charges on the tanker program as well as the second quarter 787 R&D
reclassification and 747 charge.
Operating cash flow for the year was a record $10.5 billion. The robust cash generation was largely driven by solid core
operating performance for the full year and a slight impact from favorable timing of receipts and expenditures at year
end.
Moving now to our quarterly results on slide five. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.3 billion driven largely by solid
commercial airplane deliveries and healthy defense revenues. Core operating margins for the quarter were 8.9%,

reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses that were more than offset the fourth quarter after-tax charge on
the tanker program. Fourth quarter core earnings per share was $2.47, again on solid core operating performance that
again more than offset the $0.32 charge on tanker.
As Dennis mentioned, we have more work to do on the EMD program, but we're making good progress on the test and
certification efforts as well as retiring risk. The tanker charge this quarter was primarily on the production phase of the
contract as we incorporate changes on the airplane in the factory and make investments in our production system that
will allow us to build future aircraft in a more efficient manner.
Let's discuss commercial airplanes now on slide six. For the fourth quarter, our commercial airplane revenue was $16.2
billion. Commercial airplane operating margins in the fourth quarter were 9.1%, excluding the tanker charge and BCA
generated operating margins of 10.6% on favorable delivery mix, lower R&D and improved overall performance.
Commercial airplanes captured $23 billion in net orders during the quarter, strengthening our backlog that now stands
at $416 billion and more than 5,700 aircraft. For the full year, we captured $49 billion on 668 net orders.
On the 787 program, the deferred production balance continued its downward trend, declining another $215 billion in
the quarter. The improvement was driven by the delivery mix, internal productivity efforts and supplier stepdown
pricing. Over the long-term, we continue to focus on 787 cash generation, again, driven by the favorable mix, internal
productivity improvements and additional supplier stepdown pricing.
Let's turn now to defense, space and security results on slide seven. Fourth quarter revenue at our defense business was
$6.9 billion and operating margins were 11.8% largely due to solid core performance and timing of deliveries. Apart
from the tanker charge at BDS, the segment generated operating margins of 12.8%. Revenue at Boeing military aircraft
decreased to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting from timing of deliveries, and operating margins were 11% in
the quarter. Network and space systems revenue declined $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter on lower planned satellite
volume, and S&S generated operating margins of 8.7%.
Global services and support reported revenue of $2.4 billion and generated strong operating margins of 14.9%, driven
by performance and favorable contract mix. Defense, space and security reported $8 billion of new business in the
quarter and the backlog now stands at $57 billion, of which, 37% represents customers from outside the United States.
Turning now to slide eight. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was better than planned at $2.8 billion. The
strength of our cash flow was driven by solid performance across the company as well as slight impact from favorable
timing of receipts and expenditures at year end. Again, operating cash flow for the year was a record $10.5 billion. The
robust cash generation for the full year was driven by solid deliveries, strong core operating performance and continued
efforts on disciplined cash management.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $672 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 4 million shares
for $500 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2016 repurchase activity to 55 million shares for $7 billion. As
Dennis mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our board of directors increased the share repurchase
authorization back up to the $14 billion and increased the dividend another 30%. We now have increased our dividend
per share by more than 190% in four years. And over the same period, we have lowered our share count 18% through
the repurchase of 174 million shares.
Our capital deployment strategy demonstrates the strength of our backlog and our confidence in our marketplace and
our business performance going forward. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support
future growth remains top priority for us.
Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide nine. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable
securities. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. This financial
strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of our business, return cash to shareholders and execute on
our balanced cash deployment strategy going forward.
Let's now turn to slide 10 and we'll discuss our outlook for 2017. Our guidance for 2017 reflects solid core operating
performance, plant productivity improvements as we have long discussed growing cash flows. Operating cash for 2017

is forecasted to increase by approximately $250 million to $10.75 billion largely driven by improvement, 787 cash
generation, higher 737 production rates and overall disciplined cash management efforts, all of which more than offset
the cash impact from the lower 777 volume.
We expect 2017 pension funding to be approximately $500 million which is an increase from $100 million of funding
in 2016. As 777X investments peak in 2016, capital spending is forecast to decline in 2017 by approximately $300
million to now be approximately $2.3 billion. Revenue for 2017 is forecast to be between $90.5 billion and $92.5
billion, largely reflecting lower planned 777 production and military volume which more than offset the planned higher
737 production and growth in commercial and defense services. We continue to expect revenue growth over the
remainder of the decade with additional commercial airplane rate increases planned as we deliver on our robust backlog
and execute our services growth strategy.
Core earnings per share guidance for 2017 is set to be between $9.10 and $9.30 per share. Our 2017 commercial
airplane revenue guidance is between $62.5 billion and $63.5 billion. As we have previously discussed, this is largely
based on deliveries ramping up on the 737 program, offset by the lower 777 volume. In all, BCA is expected to deliver
between 760 and 765 airplanes. Commercial airplanes operating margin guidance is between 9.5% and 10% on
improved operating performance that more than offset the impact of the lower 777 volume.
We continue to assess the implementation of the next 787 rate increase that is currently scheduled to ramp up 14 per
month at the end of the decade. A production decision could impact 2017 BCA margins but this is largely bounded
within the guidance range we've provided. Defense, space and security revenue guidance for 2017 is between $28
billion and $29 billion, reflecting the defense spending environment and lower planned C-17 deliveries. Operating
margin guidance at our defense business is approximately 11.5% reflecting continued productivity efforts as our team
work to offset the lower volume.
We expect research and development spending to be relatively flat year-over-year in 2017 at approximately $3.6
billion. With about 75% related to BCA primarily driven by planned increases in 777X development while BDS
continues to invest in key strategic opportunities. Consistent with prior years and given the seasonality of our business,
as we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be the lowest of the year. Core EPS is estimated to
be approximately 20% of our full year earnings, and 1Q cash flow is forecasted to be near breakeven, again, driven by
the timing of receipts and expenditures.
Turning to 2018. Let me provide you some brief insight. We focused on delivering on our backlog and continue to
aggressively drive productivity which supports our outlook for 2018. We're expecting growth in key financial metrics
for 2018, growth in revenue, deliveries, BCA and BDS operating margins, core earnings per share and finally operating
cash flow.
Furthermore, as we've discussed over the remainder of the decade, we continue to expect to see revenue, earnings, cash
flow growth as we execute on the robust backlog including the 787 production rate ramp, improve 787 cash generation,
capture further working capital efficiencies, further implement our services growth strategy and deliver on
enterprise-wide productivity efforts.
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Dennis for some final thoughts.
Dennis A. Muilenburg
Thanks, Greg. In retrospect, with solid fourth quarter results and focus on meeting customer commitments, we now put
2016 in the books as a year of solid core operating performance, record cash flow and healthy return to our
shareholders. Furthermore, we continued to de-risk our business and advance our strategies for sustaining our
leadership in the aerospace industry and earn our place as an enduring global industrial champion.
As we look to 2017, we are intensely focused on profitable long-term growth, disciplined execution of production and
development programs, expanding our services business and improving quality and productivity across the enterprise.
Our priorities are to continue leveraging the unique competitive advantage we have in operating as one Boeing,

building strength on strength to deliver on our existing plans and commitments and to stretch beyond those plans by
sharpening and accelerating our pace of progress on key enterprise growth and productivity efforts.
We are giving clear and consistent attention to the profitable ramp up in commercial airplane production, continuing to
strengthen our defense and space business, growing services, delivering on our development programs, driving world
class levels of productivity and performance throughout the enterprise to fund our investments in innovation and
growth and to develop and maintain the best team and talent in the industry; all of which is to position Boeing for
continued market leadership, sustained top and bottom line growth and to create increasing value for our customers,
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.
Now with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. Good morning, Dennis and Greg.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Good morning, Howard.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: You're, Dennis, sometimes I might call you the chief salesman and sometimes a wannabe
always worried about risk. And so could you help us walk through a little bit of some of the opportunities you have to
improve operating performance? We saw a little bit in commercial in Q4 with – excluding the charges, some very good
operating numbers. But what more can you do going forward? Or can you provide a little bit more framework as to
how we're going to get to some of the longer-term margin goals you've talked about?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet, Howard. Thanks. And that's a very keen focus for us as a team. We're
committed as an enterprise, as I said, for the longer run towards the end of the decade, getting to mid teens margins for
our business. You see us stepping in that direction as we head more deeply into double-digit margins in the coming
year. Exclusive of the tanker charge that we took this past quarter, you'll see that reflected in the underlying
performance as well. So we see signs of progress with more work to do.
We have a comprehensive program in place to drive productivity, quality and safety throughout the enterprise. This
includes our Lean and Capturing the Value of Quality initiative. It includes an initiative around our Partnering for
Success effort with our suppliers. We anticipate additional investments in our Development Program Excellence
initiative will pay off, and albeit we took a tanker charge in the fourth quarter, it's very clear that we are driving risk to
closure on that program and our development program excellence efforts are paying off. We see that reflected for
example in the 737 MAX program which is delivering on schedule and on cost, actually, a bit ahead of schedule. So
that comprehensive investment in productivity efforts is really important to us.
I can tell you we're committed to it at the leadership level and it's in the culture of our company and our people are
committed to it. In addition to those initiatives, we're also driving longer-term investments around things like second
century design and manufacturing, bringing additional automation and technology capabilities into our manufacturing
facilities. And also as we invest in services, we anticipate that our services business will be accretive to margins as we
grow that business. So look at this as a comprehensive well defined program. It's across the enterprise. We're
leveraging all of Boeing's capacity to do that and we are committed to driving productivity and quality in everything we
do. And in the end you're going to see that show up at the bottom line. You'll see it in margins and you'll see it in
earnings and cash performance.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Greg, a couple accounting housekeeping and a question for you Dennis. On the accounting,
Greg, when do you hit another 100-unit block on the 87 fixed costs, presumably that has an impact on the deferred
production. And additionally, with all this moving around, are we going to get program accounting disclosures on the
777 at some point? And then question for Dennis, I hate to put it so bluntly but we've clearly had a series of charges on
the tanker program at this point. And I'm just sort of wondering are we to the point where you can draw a line in the
sand and say you think you've got it appropriately bounded or just want to get a kind of a – take your temperature on. Is
the bad news fully behind you at this point? Thanks, guys.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Greg, you want to take the first one?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, sure. Yeah, we break into that next block in the summer timeframe, Carter. And
obviously as we move forward, that's obviously – helps our overall margin. There's mix obviously. There's supplier
stepdown and then there's learning curve. I would say with our – from an internal perspective, team is doing a great job.
And when I say doing a great job, Charleston, Seattle, working together, focused on unit-over-unit improvement,
sharing best practices. Teams are very engaged and really, again, on a daily cadence work package by work package.
So, certainly, a lot of work to do, but they're doing a terrific job there. And then again, we've got the other elements
that'll help overall. So kind of in that summer timeframe. On the 777, we'll go through that disclosure as we get closer
to delivery and the accounting block size and so on. So we've still got quite a bit of time before we get into that.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Okay. And, Carter, to your second question on tanker. Like you, we're disappointed
with the tanker charge we took in the fourth quarter. But it's well understood and defined. I will say that the nature of
the risk on the program's clearly changing as expected and we've moved now from the development program into the
initial production program. Last year, we were talking about key development risks, flight test risks, and you recall that
we had to work through some challenges on the refueling boom. Just to give you a sense of the progress there, that new
boom has now been flown, cleared throughout the envelope. We've completed all the boom envelope testing as part of
the development program and we've closed out that risk. We've got five aircraft in-flight test. We've completed more
than 1,500 hours of flight testing and we are steadily knocking out test points every day.
So, while we still have flight testing to go, it's very clear now that we're not discovering new technical risks. It's now
about getting the first 18 aircraft delivered. The charge we took in the fourth quarter was around the previously defined
configuration changes, the wiring changes that you recall from last year, now implementing those at the detail level in
the initial production aircraft. That work is known. It's well defined. We have some job categories that are just taking
longer than planned in terms of hours per job, and that's what you see in the charge in the quarter. This is not new work.
It's well understood. It's very clear to us that the risk is closing out. And we're going to drive it to closure and begin
delivering tankers this year. So we're in the final stages of doing that, and then we'll move fully into the full production
program.
We're working very closely with our Air Force customer, very strong relationship there, confident in the long-term
strength of the program. And I think it's again important for us just to step back and understand, while the development
program has been challenging, this is a great long-term franchise program. And we expect this to be 400 plus aircraft in
the long run, and it will go for decades. It'll be a great airplane for our customers and will be good business for Boeing.

Our next question's from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So your fourth quarter commercial margins, if we back out the
tanker charge, really look quite good. Could you give us a little bit more color regarding any block changes, any catch
up adjustments, where were period expenses? All of those issues. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, yeah, sure, Cai. Look, there was no block extensions. There was actually a
contraction on the 777 as we brought that rate down. So, overall margins, there was improvement there. And then taken
into account of course, again, the 777 rate change. And we did have some favorable period expense. I would equate –
certainly not all of it, Cai, but a lot of it to a lot of affordability action taking place as we've talked about and some of
that taking hold in the fourth quarter and us being able to bring that to the bottom line. So I wouldn't say it was one
single thing. Again, it was across the board on product as well as support and even on G&A as well. So team did a
great job with a very strong finish to the year.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: And, Cai, just to add a little color to that, as Greg said, this focus on driving
competitiveness and affordability at the team level, really proud of the progress our team is making. And our team
understands the connection between driving affordability and margins and our ability to invest in the future and win in
the marketplace. And we know we're in a competitive marketplace. Our team is focused on winning. And you can see
all of the drive on competitiveness is showing up in increasing margin performance. That'll allow us to invest for the
future. So that dynamic is clearly owned at the team level, and that's some of the energy you see in the numbers.

Next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Stuart Harned>: Dennis, in November, you made two very important moves. One, naming the first
outsider that I'm aware of to lead BCA, and then standing up the new services unit. First, can you point to things that
Kevin McAllister may be doing that will be different for BCA? And then for the services unit, it's not in guidance, but
how large do you expect that unit to be for commercial and defense? And what kind of growth do you expect to see
over the next three to five years?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Doug, thanks for the questions there. On the first one regarding Kevin, and we're very,
very pleased to have Kevin on our team, and as you know, as I've told you many times, one of the most important
investments we make is our investment in leadership and talent. Now I will say, although Kevin's coming to us from
outside of Boeing, he's been a very close partner for many, many years. Understands Boeing well, great fit with our
culture. He's been a close partner during his time at GE, and that's been a seamless transition for us.
That said, I think it's also healthy for us as we build our team for the future to have both internal and external
candidates and teammates. And Kevin coming in with some new eyes and fresh views and new ideas, I think there's
synergy to be had there. And already, we're seeing that in our team, the combination of some of the ideas we already
had, some new ideas and approaches that Kevin's bringing to the table is going make us better as a team, better as a
company. So I'm pleased with that.

And then with Ray Conner's help, again, the whole transition and ensuring that goes very smoothly with our customers
and with Ray's mentorship further just accelerating Kevin's ramp up in the company. So I'm proud of that, and we're
going to continue to invest in our team.
To your point on services, yeah, that was a big strategic move for us. So we said for some time we're looking at and
targeting services growth for the long run. And as we've evaluated our options and the investments we're making, we
thought one of the key strategic steps was to create an integrated services business whose number one job every day is
to serve our customers and grow our services business. That's in combination with the other investments we're making
in both organic and inorganic growth. Growing our parts business, growing our mods and upgrades business, growing
our data and analytics business, it's all part of a holistic services growth strategy. We'll have that unit fully up and
operating in the third quarter this year. At that point, we'll begin showing you integrated financials for that unit, but we
expect that to be one of our fastest growing businesses going forward.
And as we've told you, we've put a longer-term target out there to make that a $50 billion a year services business.
We've got a lot of work to grow it to do that capacity. But we're focused on a strategy to enable that. We're putting the
building blocks in place today. And you'll see when we build that business out fully in the third quarter, that it's already
a healthy strong business but a lot of upside to grow. We see services as a $2.5 trillion marketplace over the next 10
years. Today, we have about a 7% market share in commercial services and about a 9% market share in defense
services. So we believe there's plenty of market space to grow. And by attacking that market as a one Boeing entity and
integrated services strategy with the right cost structure and the right capabilities to pursue it, we think we'll be
successful in growing market share and growing within an overall market that's also expanding.

Next question is from Ken Herbert with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth George Herbert>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth George Herbert>: Hi, I wanted to ask Dennis about the defense market. It looks like when you back
out the C-17, revenues you had in 2016, you're flat to down slightly in 2017. Maybe clearly in the last couple of
months, both with the election, the backdrop seems to have improved. It seems like you're getting more fraction with
F-18 and some other programs. Two questions on it really. First, has the outlook changed post 2017 for maybe the top
line on the defense business? And how are you thinking about growth in that business now? And then second, at what
point do you start to feel the need to maybe start to accelerate investments in that side of the business to perhaps
capture some of the more emerging opportunities?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You bet. Well, first of all, we see our defense businesses healthy core business today
and albeit our guidance for 2017 is down a bit on revenue based on planned delivery rates and C-17 coming down,
longer-term, we still expect low to moderate top line growth in our defense business. That's been our projection
previously and we continue to see the defense business as a healthy moderate top line growth kind of business. We're
also investing to continue to drive bottom line performance. And you see that in the underlying margin performance in
that business getting well into the double-digit margin range. That's allowing us to invest for the future.
Now, when we look ahead, I would say that we see some signs that are strengthening our prospects in the defense
market. We think domestically, we're seeing some additional strength on the underlying defense budget, alternatives to
sequestration which we fully support. So we anticipate seeing some strengthening defense bucket domestically. We
also see continuing high demand internationally for our products. And we believe the products that we have, both today
and the ones we're investing in, provide a great capability cost match for our customers, leading edge capabilities at

best value. And that spans commercial derivatives, satellites, fighters, helicopters, our services business and more
broadly our human space exploration business. We intend to lead in those business sectors and we're investing
accordingly. To those future investments, as you alluded to, some key opportunities right in front of us including T-X
and JSTARS as examples, places where we are investing and leveraging across the Boeing enterprise. We see our
defense and space business today as a healthy core business. It's got some upside potential. We see some strengthening
signals in the market and we are investing for the future to both grow top and bottom line.

Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Good morning. Hi, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hey, I wanted to ask on 787 demand, the average annual new order number there has been – it's
been 50 on average for I guess six or seven years now, post financial crisis. And so I wonder if we should start to think
of that as a trend or not. And with running deliveries closer to 140, if you were to have that gap for a few more years,
the backlog that still looks sizable would wind down fairly quickly mathematically. And so not asking if it's your base
case, but I just wonder if there's any discussion in our internal scenario analysis about backing off that supply level,
keeping a safer coverage in case demand stays here? Or do you have substantial reason to believe that order pace picks
up pretty soon?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, hey, Noah, first of all, I think it's important to note that operating at 12 a month, right
now we're at record production rates for wide-body program and the program is running well. And you see it showing
up in the numbers in terms of the efficiency of the program. We're very confident in the underlying operations of the
program and confident in that 12 per month rate structure.
As you noted, we currently have a backlog of 700 787s. Now orders will vary year-to-year, but we have 700 aircraft in
backlog. And our confidence in being able to continue to operate at 12 a month is high. We are currently evaluating our
decision around going to a 14 a month rate towards the end of the decade. As always, we're going be very disciplined
on that decision. We're going to make sure that we match supply and demand. And while we've had some 787 sales, as
I mentioned earlier, we still have more work to do to fill out the profile to 14 a month. But those are slots now, what
we're looking at filling towards the end of the decade. So we remain very confident in the 787 line and our current rate
and we'll make a disciplined decision on 14 a month towards the end of the decade.
The other thing to remember is longer-term outlook, is the 20-year market outlook within our 39,000 aircraft that we
see in our current market outlook, 9,000 of those are wide-bodies. There is a significant wide-body replacement cycle
in the coming decade early, in the next decade, and we have the 787 and the 777 families very well positioned for that
upcoming replacement cycle. So all of those lead us to great confidence in the 787 line. We're going to continue to
drive productivity and efficiency into that line that'll further drive our competitiveness in the marketplace that we can
win going forward.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Yeah, agreed the 700 looks sizable for sure. I was – just back of the envelope if you thought
about 150 deliveries depending on where you are between 12 and 14 and 50 orders, it's 100 unit annual gap. The 700
could come down pretty quickly. I guess do you have visibility into 50, that 50 pace changing in the near to
medium-term?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: As I said, orders tend to move around year-to-year. And so don't take any one year and try to
draw a trend line through it. Our customers will buy in cycles and you'll see year-to-year variation in order volume on
787. On the wide-body production line, 700 aircraft in backlog at current production rates is more than four years of

backlog. That is a very strong position to be in. And the 787, especially now as we're getting ready to roll out the
787-10 is extremely well positioned in the marketplace. It is the most efficient airplane in the marketplace, clearly, in
that seat range, and we're very confident of our ability to compete and win in the marketplace. And we're going
continue to drive affordability progress again internally to make us even more competitive.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Terrific.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I think when the 787-10 gets into the marketplace that's even going to put more confidence
in that product line.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: You got it.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: And I think the other thing that Dennis eluded to, this airplane has opened up 130 new
markets, either planned routes or ones that are already being executed. This thing's a differentiator, obviously, in the
marketplace. Our job is to continue to ensure that it – we invest in that program like we are in the 787-10, and continue
to lead in this segment of the market as the 787 has. And I think that's demonstrated in the 700 airplanes that are in
backlog. So we've got a great machine here. And we're focused on the day-to-day execution. Getting this 787-10 up to
rate. Get it in the market. Get it in the hands of our customer and we think they're going to love it.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: That's great. Hey, Greg, would you tell us what's in the 2017 cash guide for change in work
capital?

Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Gursky>: Hey, good morning. Hey, Greg, just a quick clarification on the tanker. Can you just let us know
whether the cash burn on that is – the peak of that is still in front of us or if it's now behind us given all the charges that
you've taken? And then Dennis, can you just provide us maybe a comprehensive update on the 777X program, what
milestones have you hit thus far? What's still in front of us and how much of the risk on that program is retired at this
point? Thanks, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. On the tanker cash, yeah, 2016, 2017 is the primary burn and then we'll be cash flow
positive later in 2018.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Okay. And then on 777X, we're continuing to march smartly through the development
program. Development continues to be right on track. We're making the right capital investments upfront as you are
well aware of. We've recently opened the composite wing center in Everett and getting ourselves in position to
manufacture the fourth-generation composite wing for that airplane. We're also pulling ahead some of the
manufacturing technology to de-risk it in the current 777 line, again, to get us ready for a smart and efficient ramp up of
the 777X. The development program itself is going well. We're right now working through a detailed design. We'll be

We'll begin working our way through assembly. As you saw, we're already beginning to build parts for the 777X. We'll
get into final assembly in 2018. And we continue to be on track for entry into service in 2020. So feeling very good
about the program. It's on track. Clearly, we have work to do yet to get it to the finish line but all signals here are the
investments we've made in Development Program Excellence are paying off. And we're confident that when the
airplane comes to the marketplace, it's going be a high value airplane for our customers. We're seeing very strong
performance in all of the testing that's underway. And then the production system preparation is also on track. And
we're confident that we'll be ready to ramp up.

Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi. Thanks [indiscernible] (52:07). A little more on 777X. How are you thinking about or are
you thinking about maybe extending or even deepening some of the discounting to incent maybe a little more stability
in the backlog given you've got, I think it's almost 80% of your customers or the ME3 carriers whose results are
obviously continuing to weaken. So is there a concern maybe not just from the lack of order activity in general but a
lack of diversification in the skyline? Are you willing to maybe buy a little backlog in exchange for some longer-term
stability as you ramp?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah, the key thing here is right now we're focused on filling the bridge from 777 to
777X. We do have 320 777Xs in our firm backlog and commitments with our customers. So we're – our trim 777X
skyline is in very good shape in terms of our production ramp up. Our key focus right now is filling the bridge and that
includes finalizing those 777-300ER sales through the bridge. We're seeing the airplane pricing holding up reasonably
well in the marketplace. It's competitive but not unusual. And we have a number of campaigns underway with our
customers to fill those remaining bridge slots. We think we've made the right decisions to balance demand and supply.
As we said, we're stepping down to a production rate of five per month in August of this year. That effectively sets the
floor for the production program. Against that profile, we're about 90% sold out in 2018 and 2019. Now, again, we still
have work to do to fill those slots. But the value proposition of the airplane is clear. Our customers recognize it, and
we're just going to continue working on those campaigns to finish filling out those slots and move smartly into the
777X production ramp up.

kind of gotten accustomed to a healthy dose of conservatism early in the year that we've unlocked throughout the

course of the year. Would you characterize this guidance in 2017 as different than prior years? If so, is it because of the
risk profile or am I mischaracterizing it?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Greg, you want to take the first one?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, 787-10 didn't have a significant impact on deferred in the quarter, Myles. Obviously,
team's doing a great job getting that thing implemented in the production system. And frankly, it's coming together very
well. So it hasn't been a big drag, and I don't expect it to have significant. Now quarter-over-quarter as you know, you
know that there's going be ins and outs on the deferred. But overall, we expect to continue to improve that going
forward with the 787-10 ramping up as well.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: And Myles, to your second question, our approach to our guidance is the same, same
process, same approach. We take a diligent look at our business plans, the marketplace and how we expect to perform
and you see that reflected in our numbers. So I'd say our fundamental approach hasn't changed at all. That said, when
you look at the numbers that we've guided to and you see the strength of those numbers both in terms of EPS and cash,
I think that reflects the underlying confidence we have in the business.
As we've mentioned to all of you previously, we are on a solid growth trajectory in an aerospace sector that's healthy.
We have the right plans and products in place, and we are prepared to ramp up our commercial airplane production as
we delivered in the mid 700 aircraft this year. We're guiding to higher deliveries in the coming year, and we still expect
that towards the end of the decade we're going be well north of 900 aircraft per year. On top of that, we're growing our
services business and we're selectively growing our defense business.
So all of that gives us top line strength. You combine that with our backlog, that's allowing us to make the investments
to drive bottom line performance. We see that reflected in our EPS guidance. You see it reflected in our cash guidance.
And as we told you before, our expectation is that this is a year-over-year cash growth business. And our guidance
reflects that confidence.

Next question's from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: Hi, thanks for the time. Just a question on the 787 side. Greg, you made a comment about a
production decision this year going to 14 a month and how that could impact that 9.5% to 10% margin at BCA. Just
some color here on how to think about that. And then just relating to the 787, any color on how to think about the
deferred trajectory through the year? You gave some good commentary before, I guess last year, so just something
similar there.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, quarter-over-quarter, we expect deferred to improve and really again, kind of,
Rajeev, falls into those again three major categories. Obviously, improved unit performance in our factories, but that
supplier stepdown I mentioned on a question earlier that will move into that next block in the summer timeframe. And
that will be favorable. Quarter-over-quarter, again, you're going to see delivery mix impacting there. But that – all that
will be more than offset of just continued improvement quarter-over-quarter on deferred. So – and then, of course, as I
mentioned, mix. So getting that 787-10 in smoothly as it has and replicating how we did that at the 787-9 is exactly the
game plan everybody's working to, so that's key in there. And we're assuming all those goes as it has been going per
plan. And that'll all translate into deferred.
Now I would tell you stepping back from that, obviously, big focus on cash improvement overall on the program. And
certainly, deferred's a key part of that. So making our deliveries on all models on time and ensuring that we're
executing at that level on top of the overall productivity, the advances associated with our current delivery rates at 12 a
month and beyond. So all – every element of, I'll say, cash flow is being actively managed quarter-over-quarter, and
obviously, we've broke – we're cash flow positive last year and we're going to be even more so this year. And it's really

all in those elements that are driving that bottom line performance.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: I'm sorry, Greg, the other part to that question was just – and correct me if I'm wrong, but I
thought you made a comment about how making a decision on going to 14 a month could impact margins for this year,
just some color there.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, we just – we kind of put that in the range of the guide. Obviously, we're assuming at
this point that we go to 14. The market supports that going to 14. But as we – we don't have to make the formal
decision yet. So, as we get closer to that, we'll continue to monitor the marketplace, fill in those unsold positions and
then look at, I'll say, more over a longer-term until we make that formal decision. But so that's why we kind of put a
range in
there to try to take that into account if we decided to hold out the 12 a month at least for the near-term.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: It's bounded in the guidance.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: And as always we're going make a very disciplined decision here.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: It's in our mutual interest to make sure we're aligning supply and demand and keeping
the production system healthy while supporting our customers.
<A - Troy Jeffrey Lahr>: Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.
Operator
And that will be from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Dennis, Greg. Thanks for squeezing me in.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey, first, just a clarification, did you mention what the expectation is around MAX deliveries
this year? And then second part of this question is just more, Greg, how you think about the sensitivity in the backlog
when you're thinking about in terms of customers, particularly I'm thinking EM with the move we've seen in the dollar
and expectations given the policies that are going be going forward that we may see a further strengthening, how do
you think about that? Thanks, Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Peter, maybe I'll take the first one and, Greg, you take the second.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: So, on MAX deliveries, as we said, the flight test program remains on track. We
announced that we're going to begin delivering aircraft in the first half of this year and we're on track to deliver our first
MAX in the second quarter of 2017. So we feel very confident and the airplane is performing well. And we're on track
to begin deliveries this year.
For the remainder of the year, as we ramp up the production system, the MAX will end up being about 10% to 15% of
the total 737 deliveries this year. So a meaningful portion but a fraction as we begin ramping up. Our team is doing a
great job in the factory in Renton to make sure that we continue to deliver NGs while we ramp up the MAX. The
production line preparation is on track. And, again, you can see that in the underlying performance of the 737 program.

So we remain very confident in that program. The market is strong. The airplane is selling well. Flight test is on track,
and we'll begin delivering airplanes here in the first half of the year.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, and with regards to the backlog, Peter, certainly something that we look at and
analyze from multiple, I'll say, angles as we assess the backlog and look for any potential areas that may be of softness
and what mitigation plans. So we really try to get ahead of that if we have any of that and. And move customers around
within a skyline. But certainly, first and foremost, it starts with staying really engaged with your customer and
understanding kind of what their fleet plans are and any specific timelines around deliveries.
And we're going to continue to do that. And if we see any changes, then I'll say we'll change accordingly. But we're not
seeing anything at this point that is, I'd say, anything outside the norm of what you all have seen where we've got, as
we've talked about, and particularly wide-body areas of softness. So we know where they are and we're deeply engaged
and we'll make – back to Dennis' point, we'll make the right decisions if we have to around supply and demand as we
face into those.

And we'll go to Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hi, Julie.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Hey, Dennis. Could you discuss your strategy for China, especially with some of the rhetoric
we've heard and the possibility of trade tensions rising? Trump last year on the campaign trail took a shot or two at the
737 finishing center and also warned potentially of hiring being affected in the U.S. Where do plans stand at this point?
And are you still committed to moving forward?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, Julie, great question. First of all, I think it's really important for all of us to
understand that healthy trade relationships between the U.S. and China are important. I'm very confident that the
incoming administration understands that. Mr. Trump, President Trump is very much engaged with business. We've
had the privilege of having a very open dialogue with him on business issues. And all of the actions that are being taken
around things like tax reform, regulatory reform, focus on trade policy, those are all things that are going to allow us to

grow economically and ultimately allow us to grow and add manufacturing capacity in the U.S. So we're very
supportive of those actions, very confident that those are headed in the right direction and being done with the right
tone and tenor.
Now regarding China itself, that relationship continues to be very important. I know we all understand that a productive
and healthy relationship with China is key. It will be grounded in principles of fair trade and a level playing field for all
competitors. If I look at the marketplace, it's a commercial airplane marketplace of 39,000 plus aircraft over the next 20
years, about 6,800 of those are in China. So it's important that we be able to compete and win in China and to be a
partner there as they grow their aerospace industry. It's a highly competitive environment and so actions that are being
taken to ensure U.S. competitiveness are positive actions and we support those. So we're going to continue to work
hard in that direction.
Regarding our China finishing center, again, that's an important part of the partnership equation here. That finishing
center is a location where we'll be able to add value in China. But every airplane that goes to that finishing center is
being built here in the U.S. And this is a great example by making the right targeted investments in China with our
partners there, we're able to add volume, increase sales in China. As we increase sales in China, we increase building
airplanes here in the U.S. and that's U.S. manufacturing jobs. It's a great example of how growth in China creates
growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.
And if I could even more broadly on the aerospace front, if you look at global trade, the aerospace sector continues to
be the strongest sector in the United States in terms of trade balance with a positive trade balance of more than $80
billion per year. Boeing is a big part of that. We're the U.S.'s biggest exporter. And within that, we and our supply chain
of more than 13,000 companies in the United States create and sustain about 1.5 million aerospace jobs. So aerospace is
a big important manufacturing sector for the U.S. Global competitiveness will help us drive that in the long run and a
healthy U.S. China trade policy and relationship is an enabler for growing U.S. manufacturing jobs.

Our next question's from Doug Cameron with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Cameron>: Good morning, everyone. I think I can spot a theme developing amongst our questions this
morning. Dennis, given you're in the business of providing affordable solutions for the new administration, as indeed
its predecessor, have you discussed border security at all with the President? And do you think there's anything from
good old SBInet from yesteryear that you can harvest for the current initiatives being discussed?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: That's not an area that we're currently actively pursuing. Again, when and if the
government has some opportunities there where they need some assistance, we're happy to provide some technologies
and capabilities. We do have some very low cost affordable and effective autonomous systems solutions, unmanned
aircraft, things like the ScanEagle which have been used very effectively throughout the world for a variety of
surveillance purposes. Those are the kind of capabilities that are available as we look to future solutions. And we're
standing by to support where we can any U.S. government decisions that are made along that path.

Next question is from [ph] Penny Weldmire with the Financial Times (01:09:10). Please go ahead.
<Q>: Yes, you've spoken a little bit about what kind of changes we might expect in the Trump era, tax reform, et
cetera. Can I ask you a little bit what it's like to actually operate in this new environment where you know the Dow
breaks 20,000 because there's optimism about what Mr. Trump will do to the business environments, but at the same
time, we never know when the next Tweet is going to come out of left field. What word or phrase would you choose to
describe your mood in the current environment? This is for Dennis.

<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: President Trump's clearly very focused on enacting policies that will grow the U.S.
economy and grow American jobs and we're very supportive of that. So I'm encouraged by his engagement. His
approach to engaging business, having an open dialogue, discussing the issues, finding solutions, finding ways to grow
U.S. manufacturing jobs I think are all very positive. And that engagement is a productive approach. We welcome it.
We've got a voice at the table. And as we move forward on things like tax reform, regulatory reform, defense budget
strength, trade policy, creating jobs, investing in manufacturing for the future, things like the Ex-Im Bank, all of those
are big enablers for us. And I think the direct engagement and the open dialogue is very healthy. We very much support
it. And I'm encouraged about what it means for future economic growth and growth of the aerospace sector.

Next, we'll go to Dan Catchpole of The Everett Herald. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan Catchpole>: Hey, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my call here or my question. Was wondering if there is
reliance on a global supply chain if America – or Trump's focus on America first economics will affect your ability to
procure components and materials and if there's any changes that you're making in terms of the procurement and supply
chain relationships and the potential effects?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: We don't see any big changes here. Key thing to understand in our business model
while we have a global supply chain and those partnerships are very important us to and we'll continue to invest in
those partnerships, in the end, as our products come together and we do final assembly, 90% of our final product space
is built here in the U.S. and then delivered around the world. And that's a very strong example of leveraging our global
supply base while producing U.S. based products. And that strength is going to continue going forward. We see the
aerospace sector as fundamentally having an advantage in that regard.
We do have a global supply chain. But in the end, 90% of our Boeing employment is here in the U.S. and we deliver
about 75% of our product base to customers outside of the U.S. That's a big reason we have a strong contribution to a
trade balance in the aerospace sector. As I said before, north of $80 billion a year favorable trade balance and Boeing is
a big part of that. We're the U.S.'s biggest exporter and we leverage those global supply chains to create the world's
greatest airplanes and it's advantageous not only for our global partners, it's also advantageous for growing U.S.
manufacturing jobs.

Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Hi. Dennis and Greg, can you hear me all right?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Yeah.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Great. So productivity gains you've made have clearly been very important in the results and the
operating performance you've shown. But since you probably picked a lot of the low hanging fruit, can you talk about
what we can expect in terms of additional cost savings at this point? And where do you see that happening? Is it new
processes, is it automation, is it label reduction, is it more supplier price cuts through Partnering for Success? What's
your view on that going ahead? If you can be specific that would be helpful.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Let me start, maybe Greg you can add onto that. I would say this is – this will be a
relentless effort going forward. So our work on affordability and productivity while we've made some strong strides
over the last couple of years you see it reflected in the performance. We have much more ahead of us than what's
behind us. And I don't see this effort losing any steam, any momentum. In fact, I see a great deal of opportunities ahead
of us. Those are both internal and external.

Internally, we're continuing to look at opportunities to lean out our operations in both our factories and office spaces.
First time quality is a key emphasis for us. Our working capital initiative is key opportunity for us. With our supply
chain, working as partners under our Partnering for Success initiative, our value engineering work where we're finding
win-win solutions with our supply base, still much more opportunity under Partnering for Success ahead of us than
what's behind us.
So, while we've made some good initial strides, I would say those are initial steps with an expectation that there's much
more still ahead of us. And that's what drives our expectation that we're headed towards those mid teen double-digit
margins towards the end of the decade and driving year-over-year cash performance. Greg, anything you want to add?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, I think as part of that, we've – obviously, we're resetting the bar of where we
want to be near-term and long-term and going – getting some market-based, I'll say, affordability targets put in place
that not only are in our markets but also looking at what I would call or we would call kind of a top quartile industrial
and where can – how can we learn from that? Whether it's on program costs or even functions as we look across
functions in Boeing. How do we compare with those companies? Sharing best practices and all of that combined with a
lot of the things that Dennis said, that's what's going fuel our – that's what's going to allow us to win the marketplace.
That's what's going fuel our investments. That's what's going to allow us to return cash to shareholders.
So that combination of effort is definitely accelerated and – but at the same time, bringing an outside-in perspective
combined with our inside knowledge, and how do we leverage the best not only of Boeing but even outside of Boeing
and bring that rate to the bottom line. And that's – again, that's what's going to allow us to win, be competitive in the
market. And that's what's going to allow us to continue to invest in this business and drive a lot of the employment
numbers that Dennis talked about. It's a unique portfolio we have here with regards to what gets made here and the
technology and the amount of investments we make in technology here in the U.S. and exporting 75% of our product
outside. And that will continue to be our focus going forward. And we've got a big market to plan, and we're focused on
capturing all the share that we can capture in that market and deliver value back to all of our stakeholders.

Our next question's from Glenn Farley with KING Television. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Farley>: So how are you guys doing this morning?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Farley>: So my question is, with all the push that we're getting from the new administration on buying
American, do you fear a protectionist backlash from countries like China that do want to build their own aerospace
industry and other places?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Glenn, again, we take a look at the actions that are being taken here. This is all about
helping business be successful, growing the economy. And we know in the global business that we operate in as we
grow our business here in the U.S., it provides lift around the world as well. That's the nature of our aerospace business.
And it is a bit of a unique business in terms of its structure.
And the fact that again, as Greg and I have both said, with around 90% of our employment here in the U.S., yet we
export 75% of our products, we create a tremendous volume and strength in our U.S. business base and economic value
that we add here. That said, as we deliver airplanes and we enable global travel and global cargo delivery, it drives
overall economic growth around the globe as well. And the administration's very focused on ensuring that we're
implementing pro business actions and policies and implementing trade agreements that will be fair and ensure U.S.
competitiveness.
And that's what we look for in our trade agreements is our ability to compete around the world, compete on a level
playing field. And when we can compete on a level playing field, we'll win. And that'll grow our business. It'll be good
for our customers. It'll be good for global economy. So we're going to continue to engage and work very closely with

Our next question's from Jon Ostrower with CNN. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, John.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Good morning. Just a question about the DNA of Boeing right now. Dennis, you've been on the
job for 18 months, and you've had a chance to take the reins and really kind of dig deep into what Boeing is. Your 777
rate went up 8.3, heading down 60% to 3.5 on deliveries. You've got a, what looks like a very, very small almost
under-investment from an airline perspective on 737 MAX 10 with a expected huge investment coming on NMA.
Are you – really curious, as you look to again more huge production ramp ups on the 737 towards the end of the
decade, how do you see the cyclicality of Boeing internally? And its expenses on keeping a stable business and whether
or not you've thought about how to engineer that out of your company and really whether or not there's any steps you're
taking with Kevin in his new leadership role to think about cyclicality internally in a different way?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: Hey, John, the way I look at that is we are designing and implementing a long-term
sustained growth business. And we're in a fundamentally different position today than we've been in anywhere in the
first century of Boeing. And today we have north of 5,700 aircraft in backlog at a composite level. That's six to seven
years of production rate. It's the most highly diversified backlog we've ever had with two thirds of that backlog outside
of the U.S. and Europe. We have a strong fundamental defense and space business as well with some increasing market
prospects there.
So that combination allows us to have a much longer-term view and design the business to have sustained long-term
growth rather than being a tight cyclical business. This is the longest-term backlog that we've ever had by far. So we
can have a much longer-term view of how we design our business. We're also very mindful of the risks. And now with
this kind of backlog that we have in position, we can look out a little farther and think about our investments and make
sure that we're matching supply and demand. That's why we've been very diligent on our rate decisions so that those are
sustainable rate decisions, and then making the right investments for the future. Rather than having a choppy profile in
our R&D investments, we have a very well defined smooth profile.
Just as we're now wrapping up the MAX and delivering it on schedule, we're into the heart of the 777X development
program now, feathered in very nicely on the backside of MAX. We're contemplating decisions on our next generation
of product lines, both defense and commercial, and those investments, again, will continue to dovetail very nicely on
the backside of 777X. So we have a long-term investment profile that will drive innovation and drive stability in our
financial structure. Combine that with a strong backlog and diligence on our production rate decisions, this is all
designed to be a long-term sustained growth business, top line and bottom line.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.
Operator
And that will be from David Koenig with the Associated Press. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Koenig>: Yeah, hi, thanks. My question was asked and answered, but if I can just follow-up on something

critical tweets and comments about one of your programs? And aren't you worried that that could happen again, that
demand for the cost reductions in some of your programs? Can you talk about that?
<A - Dennis A. Muilenburg>: As I said, I'm very encouraged by President Trump's engagement. And as you noted,
we had some targeted discussions, well publicized discussions on things like Air Force One and fighter aircraft. I think
those were very productive discussions as well. This is all about making sure we're providing best capability for our
government and our war fighters at best affordability, best value for our taxpayers. And we're exactly on the same page
there. So whether it's those kind of targeted discussions on programs, which I think have been fairly productive, or
broader discussions on pro business decisions around trade and tax reform and regulatory reform, those have all been
excellent conversations.
And I give a lot of credit here to reaching out and directly engaging. President Trump has had business leaders at the
table. He's listening. He's engaging, and making decisions that'll help us grow the economy and ultimately grow U.S.
manufacturing jobs. So I'm encouraged by that dialogue, and I think having direct open dialogue is productive and very
good for the future.
