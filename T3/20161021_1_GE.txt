MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen and I will be your conference coordinator
today. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's
conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Good morning and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Jeff
Immelt and our CFO, Jeff Bornstein. Earlier today, we posted the press release, presentation and supplemental on our
Investor website at www.ge.com/investor. As a reminder, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are
based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on
our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Hey, thanks Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth environment. We continue to see challenges in the resource
sector as customers adjust to a lower price environment. Globally, growth continues but at a low level. There's

sufficient opportunity to achieve our goals. At the same time, we plan to control our costs even tighter as we navigate
this environment. GE grew organically by 1% and EPS grew by 10%. Segment profit grew by 1% year-to-date, ex-FX.
Industrial margins were up 40 basis points again, excluding foreign exchange.
CFOA was $8 billion including $2.9 billion of Industrial cash flow. We ended the quarter with $319 billion of backlog
and we accomplished our financial goals despite the impact of $0.04 per share in foreign exchange headwinds
year-to-date.
We continue to execute our capital allocation plan. We have virtually completed our pivot in Financial Services with
$193 billion of signings. Year-to-date, we've returned $24.6 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. For the
year, we're increasing the buyback by $4 billion from $18 billion to $22 billion and total cash returned to investors
would be at least $30 billion for the year.
We continued to invest in the company. In the quarter, we announced investments in additive manufacturing, digital
platforms and wind turbine supply chain. These will add to earnings in 2018 and position the company in fast growth
markets in the future. Orders were $26.9 billion, down 6%. Alstom orders were $5.2 billion and backlog is up $3.2
billion since the acquisition.
Overall, backlog is up 6% versus a year ago with service backlog up 11%. We had substantial strength in Renewables,
Healthcare and Power. Renewables grew by 59% including our first substantial offshore order at $600 million and a
$400 million order to repower the installed base.
Healthcare, HCS Equipment had the strongest orders growth in five years at 12%. This includes 12% growth in the
United States and 15% in China. Aviation Service orders were up 10% and growth market orders were up 21%.
Oil & Gas orders were down 21% in the quarter. There are still pockets of growth. Our Middle East orders grew by 5%
and Latin America was up by 19%. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of backlog and we expect fourth quarter
orders to be about flat with a year ago.
AGPs remains on track for 135 to 150 in the year. Software orders were about $900 million in 3Q, up 11% and at $2.8
billion they're up 15% year-to-date.
We saw significant growth in Power, up 72%, Oil & Gas up 10%; Transportation up 21% and Grid up 43%. Customer
wins include Gerdau, NEC, Aramco, Haier and [ph] CN (4:27).
We continue to build our foundation for growth. We have 243 partners on Predix and are on track for 20,000
developers by year-end. Our productivity at $500 million is already above target and should be strong for the year.
We see orders strengthening in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and that will position us for 2017. GE is executing
well in the environment. As I said earlier, organic growth was up 1%. Excluding Oil & Gas, organic revenue growth is
up 6% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date.
We had several strong business performances. Power was up 7% with 15% growth in equipment. Renewables grew
44%. Aviation Service was up 12%. And the GE Store contributed to growth with Vertical financings which supported
$4.2 billion of Industrial orders. And meanwhile GE-to-GE revenue, which is a measure of internal pull-through, grew
by 25%.
Organic growth is accelerating through the year. The fourth quarter will be at 4% and for the year, we expect organic
growth to be 0% to 2%. We continue to see a drag in Oil & Gas with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year and the
rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace. The Oil & Gas team is executing well in a tough environment. We continue to
aggressively manage costs while positioning for long-term growth. The business fully leverages the GE Store and will
come out of this cycle stronger.
Core margins grew by 40 basis points and gross margins grew by 110 basis points ex-FX. We've seen solid work in
value gap and cost productivity, slightly offset by mix. Service margins again led the way with 220 basis points of
expansion. Our analytical tools have been critical to enhance service margins. Our businesses have done a nice job in a

slow growth environment. For instance, Transportation grew margins by 90 basis points despite lower volume.
We continue to invest in the growth and competitiveness of GE. Alstom remains on track and we're building backlog
and winning key new orders. We're on track for synergies of $1.2 billion in the year. Year-to-date, Austin orders were
$12.7 billion, up 13% versus 2015. We pulled forward more restructuring which should help 2017 and beyond.
Alstom remains on track to deliver $0.05 EPS this year ex-FX and we expect to complete purchase accounting in the
fourth quarter by booking an incremental reserve of $2.4 billion to cover customer contracts and legal and tax reserves.
This is consistent with expectations. The net present value of synergies is more than $21 billion. And Alstom will
generate a mid-teen return over time.
In September, we announced the acquisition of SLM and Arcam, which will position GE as a leader in the fast growth
market for additive manufacturing equipment while opening up potential for an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of
productivity over time.
Also in September, we announced the acquisition of Meridium, a leader in asset performance management. This
completes our suite of maintenance optimization, machine and equipment health and reliability management. It's a
perfect fit for our digital strategy and will accelerate our growth.
Last week, we announced the acquisition of LM Wind Power. This gives us enhanced margins and technical expertise.
In addition, this opens up growth in emerging markets. LM and GE have a deep pipeline of innovation which will lead
the industry.
We had a pretty good quarter for cash. Industrial CFOA was $2.9 billion, up 13% from 2015. Year-to-date free cash
flow was $17.3 billion including a Capital dividend of $5 billion. We received an additional $2 billion dividend from
Capital in October.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Industrial CFOA to be more than $9 billion based on high earnings and lower working
capital. In addition, we should receive a $4 billion dividend from GE Capital. So for the year, we expect free cash flow,
plus dispositions, to be more than $32 billion above our goal.
As I noted earlier, we continued to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness. And with the improved outlook on
CFOA, we plan to boost our buyback by $4 billion to $22 billion with the total cash return to investors expected to be
$30 billion including the dividend. Our balance sheet remains very strong. All of our cash metrics look solid for the
year.
So now let me turn it over to Jeff to go through operations.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. Revenues were $29.3 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial
revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 4% reported
and up 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.32
in the quarter, up 10%. The operating EPS number of $0.27 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including
headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page.
Continuing EPS of $0.23 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net EPS of $0.22 includes discontinued
operations. Total disc ops impact was a charge of $103 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs.
As Jeff said, we generated $18.3 billion of CFOA year to date, up from $6.5 billion last year, driven by increased
dividends from GE Capital. Excluding deal taxes, Industrial CFOA was $3.4 billion year to date, down 45%. We
generated $2.9 billion of Industrial CFOA in the third quarter, which was up 13% versus last year. This was driven
primarily by working capital improvements in receivables and inventory.

Progress collections was a usage in the quarter on lower orders, principally in Oil & Gas. Free cash flow was up 17%
and free cash flow conversion was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting free cash flow conversion for the mismatch of gain
income and cash, which is included in other investing activities, free cash flow conversion would be 99%. Alstom
generated $25 million of CFOA in the quarter.
As Jeff said earlier, we now expect GE Capital dividends for the year of $20 billion versus the planned $18 billion.
Fourth quarter will be another large Industrial cash quarter on $5 billion of cash income and continued progress on
working capital, principally around inventories related to higher volume of deliveries in the quarter. Industrial CFOA is
expected to generate between $11 billion and $12 billion of cash for the total year.
The tax rate was 11% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 13%. In the third quarter, we adopted an
accounting standards change related to the treatment of tax benefits on stock option exercises, which had a favorable
impact on our 3Q tax rate of about two points. The impact on our year-to-date rate was about a point. Given that
change, we now expect the total year GE rate to be in the low-teens versus the mid-teens rate we guided to previously.
The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on pre-tax continuing loss.
On the right side are the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 4% reported and up 1%
organically. Excluding Oil & Gas, which has clearly been challenging, organic revenue was up 6% with strength in
Power, Renewables, Aviation, and Healthcare.
Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and down 3% organically. The organic number excludes the impact
of $14 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $128 million of negative FX transactional
impacts year-over-year, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This related to remeasurement and mark to
market on open hedges principally in Oil & Gas, Renewables and Energy Connections. Excluding all FX, organic
operating profit was flat in the quarter.
Including corporate operating costs, Industrial op profit was down 6% reported and down 4% organically and flat
excluding all FX. As you see at the bottom of the page and as I mentioned earlier, Industrial operating plus Vertical
EPS was $0.32, up 10%, with Industrial operating EPS up 8%. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered $1.03 of EPS,
which was up 29% versus the prior year.
Next on Industrial other items for the quarter, we had $0.05 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other
items that were taken at Corporate. Charges were $683 million on a pre-tax basis with $200 million related to Alstom
synergies investments that we've made to drive results, $100 million related to continued cost-out actions in Oil & Gas
and actions taken in Lighting and other segments. We also closed the Asset Management transaction in the quarter,
resulting in a $400 million pre-tax gain. This gain was partially offset by a charge associated with the anticipated sale
of our majority share in a nonstrategic business in Aviation that makes aerostructures. The net gains for the quarter
were $0.02.
At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for 2016. We continue to expect gains and restructuring to offset for
the year at about $0.24 both in earnings and charges.
Next I'll cover the segments. First is Power. Power orders in the quarter totaled $7.5 billion, up 56% including Alstom.
Excluding Alstom, orders were $4.7 billion, down 3%. Core equipment orders were flat at $1.7 billion. Gas-powered
system orders were higher by 6%, driven by aero and gas turbines, offset partially by Distributed Power resets. We
booked 36 aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 26 last year on strong demand in sub-Saharan Africa and
Argentina. Gas turbine units were 11 versus 22 a year ago. Although the number of units were lower, the dollar value
of the orders were up 10% on much larger units, principally the H with six units ordered versus four last year. We have
33 Hs in backlog and received orders for 50 inception to date on the program. One of the H orders in the quarter for
three units was full scope and included additional Alstom scope totaling $760 million. We continue to see a real
opportunity for growth and equipment pull-through between GE and the Alstom businesses.
Core equipment backlog grew 34% versus last year. Core service orders of $3 billion were lower by 4% on lower
power services driven by no repeat of a large plant upgrade in Japan last year and timing on 10 AGP orders. AGP
orders in the quarter were 24 versus 22 last year. We have booked 50% of the 10 AGPs that moved to the fourth quarter

as of this call and are still on track for the year for 135 to 150 AGPs in total.
Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion. Equipment orders totaled $2 billion including $1.1 billion for the
Hinkley Point U.K. power project. We also booked another three HSRGs and three steam turbines related to the full
scope H1s I mentioned earlier.
Alstom service orders were just under $900 million. Alstom backlog ended the quarter at $17.7 billion which is up 15%
since the acquisition, with equipment up 49% and services down slightly.
Power revenue in the quarter totaled $6.5 billion, up 37%. Core GE revenue of $5.1 billion was higher by 7%. Core
equipment revenue of $2 billion grew 15% driven by gas-powered systems higher by 16%. We shipped 30 gas turbines
including 7 H's versus 16 a year ago. Aero units were higher by nine versus last year. Core services revenues of $3.1
billion grew 2% on outage volume and upgrades. We shipped 28 AGPs in the quarter versus 22 a year ago. Alstom
revenue in the quarter totaled $1.5 billion with $530 million of equipment and $920 million of service revenues.
Operating profit in total was just shy of $1.2 billion with core op profit of $1.1 billion and Alstom op profit of $91
million. Core earnings were higher by 3% on positive value GAAP and volume, partly offset by the mix impact of
seven H's versus zero last year. The H's we shipped in the third quarter were profitable, but drove a 70 basis point
margin contraction in the quarter. The $91 million of Alstom earnings included a $16 million FX headwind.
Through the third quarter, the team has delivered $650 million of Alstom synergies versus the $777 million total year
target that we shared with you last year. And the business is delivering on [ph] its H (18:19) profitability in the second
half. For the year, we expect to ship 25 H turbines and about 110 to 115 gas turbines in total.
Next up is Renewables. Orders in the quarter totaled $3 billion, up 59%. Core orders excluding Alstom of $1.9 billion
grew 3%. Core orders were driven by large service orders for $400 million associated with repowering and upgrading
existing units, offset partly by fewer new unit orders of 592 turbines versus 821 a year ago. Over 90% of the new unit
orders were the large new machines. We expect fourth quarter orders to be strong as the final fully qualified U.S. PTC
orders are placed. Repowering, upgrades and new units provide a strong outlook for the fourth quarter and the future.
Alstom orders in the quarter totaled $1 billion, driven by a large offshore wind win in Germany [ph] of which (19:17)
$600 million and $400 million of Hydro Orders. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.9 billion.
Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 66% with core GE revenues of $2.4 billion higher by 43%. The business shipped 970
wind units versus 735 wind units in the third quarter last year. Alstom revenue totaled $381 million in the quarter.
Operating profit of $202 million was up 16% with the core business higher by 22%, driven by higher volume offsetting
negative foreign exchange. Op profit rate was down 150 basis points excluding Alstom, reflecting new product mix and
$58 million of negative foreign exchange versus last year. We continue to improve margins on the new 2 megawatt
machine. Alstom synergies in the quarter totaled $46 million and Alstom op profit was a loss of $12 million. For the
year, we now expect to ship 3,000 to 3,200 wind turbines versus the 3,000 we had previously communicated to you.
Next on Aviation, global passenger air travel continues to see strong growth despite a slight increase in capacity
relative to demand. Year-to-date August traffic was up 5.8% with strength in both domestic and international markets.
Airfreight volumes were up 1.4% August year-to-date with FTKs growing 3.9% year over year versus last year.
Orders in the quarter were $6.2 billion, down 6%. Equipment orders of $2.1 billion were down 27% on lower
commercial engine orders driven by 9X, GE90 and GEnx. In the quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of new engine orders
including about $400 million in LEAP, $250 million of CFM and $350 million of GEnx. Military equipment orders of
$204 million were up sharply, driven principally by T700 orders from Turkey. Total equipment backlog of $33.7
billion was down 4%.
Service orders grew 10% with commercial service orders up 13%, driven by CSAs up strongly at 29%, overhaul up 9%
and the spares order rate up 6% at $42 million a day. Military service orders were down 12% on no repeat of a large
Air Force order last year. Total service backlog grew 15% to $122 billion.

Revenues of $6.3 billion were up 5%. Equipment revenue was down 3% with commercial up 5% on higher deliveries
including 22 LEAP engines, while military equipment revenue was down 33% on lower shipments. Service revenues
were higher by 12%. The commercial spare shipment rate was up 5% to $39.7 million a day.
Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 10%, driven by higher volume and cost productivity. Margin rates improved
120 basis points in the quarter. Third quarter was another solid execution quarter for the Aviation team and we are on
track for the ramp up on LEAP shipments this year. We have shipped 33 LEAP engines to date and there are currently
six LEAP-powered planes flying with two airlines with departure performance of 100% and some of those planes
operating more than 10 cycles a day. We expect to deliver about 105 engines this year.
Next is Oil & Gas. The industry remains very challenging. Some market indicators showed modest sequential
improvement in the third quarter. U.S. onshore rig counts were higher by 15% versus the second quarter and U.S. well
counts rose 3% versus the second quarter. Both rig and well counts remained down about 50% from where they were
last year. External forecasts for upstream spending for 2016 have been revised to be less negative and with 2017
slightly more positive. Flow markets on our Industrial applications remained stable, but Oil & Gas flow and OpEx
markets continue to be weak.
Orders for Oil & Gas of $2.5 billion were down 21% in the quarter, with equipment down 22% and services down
21%. All segments saw equipment declines, except subsea and drilling, which was up 33% on easier comparisons to
last year. Service orders declined in all segments.
Backlog ended the quarter at $21.6 billion, which is down 7%, equipment backlog down 32% versus last year while
services backlog grew 14%.
Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 25%, with equipment revenue down 33%. All segments were lower
except downstream technologies, which grew 16% in the third quarter. Service revenues were down 16%, with declines
across all the segments. Op profit of $353 million was down 42% driven by lower volume, price and foreign exchange
partially offset by cost execution. The business took out $245 million of costs in the quarter. Total cost-out year-to-date
is $535 million. The team expects to deliver total cost-out for the year of between $700 million and $800 million
adjusting for cost actions related to volume.
The business remains on track for op profit down about 30% excluding the effects of foreign exchange. No doubt, it's
an incredibly tough environment, but Lorenzo and the team have executed well on their cost-out initiatives and
capturing available growth opportunities as they present themselves.
On Healthcare, Healthcare business had another solid quarter. Orders in the quarter grew 6% to $4.8 billion. In terms of
geography, orders grew organically 5% in the U.S., 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia-Pacific. China orders were up 2%,
but up 13% excluding the KUBio bioprocess facility order we took last year.
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems organic orders were up 8%, driven by strength in imaging, up 12% on
strong CT and MI, and ultrasound higher by 11%. Life Science orders grew 4% organically, with bioprocess and core
imaging both up 5%. Excluding the prior year KUBio order I just referred to, Life Science orders grew 11%, with
bioprocess higher by 22%.
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 5%. Healthcare Systems revenues grew 4% organic, with ultrasound
higher by 13%, partly offset by imaging down 1%. Life Sciences grew revenues 11% organically.
Op profit was up 10% in the third quarter and up 12% organically. Strong volume and cost performance more than
offset price and program spending. Margin rates expanded 70 basis points in the quarter. Gross margins improved 90
basis points in the quarter.
Healthcare continues to execute. Through three quarters, they've delivered over $300 million against their $350 million
of cost-out commitments for the year. We expect they'll outperform the 50 basis points margin goal. China growth
continues to improve, with public tender activity up 20% in the third quarter and the U.S. and Europe markets are
seeing stable growth.

Next is Transportation. The difficult cycle for Transportation continued in the third quarter. North American carloads
were down 5.4%, driven by coal lower by 14.6% and petroleum down 23.4%. Intermodal volume was down 3.6%.
August and September volumes did improve versus July, but are still well below 2015. We expect the trend to continue
through year end.
Orders in the third quarter of $695 million were down 21% and down 15% organically. Equipment orders of $109
million were down 23%, but up 18% organically on orders for five locomotives versus three a year ago. Service orders
of $586 million were down 21%, driven by lower local parts and mining. Backlog ended the quarter at $19.9 billion,
which is essentially flat with last year.
Revenues in the third quarter of $1.249 billion were down 22%, down 17% organically, with equipment lower by 22%
and services lower by 13%. We shipped 200 locos versus 259 a year ago. Op profit of $309 million was down 18% on
lower volume, partially offset by positive mix and the benefits of restructuring. Gross margins improved 180 basis
points and op profit margins were higher by 90 basis points.
The business continues to grow its international business as demand in the U.S. continues to be a challenge, while
driving hard on products and service costs. We expect total year locomotive shipments of between 740 and 750 units.
Energy Connections & Lighting, this is the first new presentation of the two segments together. The businesses have
not changed. We are reporting orders for Lighting for the first time. Lighting really has two businesses, the current
business and the legacy core lighting business, which we are in the process of restructuring. The current business
represents professional lighting sales for North America and other key countries, energy management and control
systems and software. Reported orders and backlog apply to only the current business as these are longer-term projects.
Orders for this segment totaled $3 billion with Energy Connection orders of $2.7 billion and current orders of $328
million. Energy Connection orders were up 31% reported with core GE orders of $1.4 billion, down 14% organically.
Power Conversion was down 33% on tough comparison to last year when our Renewables orders were up four times.
Industrial Solutions orders were up 6% in a market that was down 4% in North America.
Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion in the quarter. Total backlog finished at $11.5 billion. Current orders of $328 million
were driven by LED retrofits including large orders from Financial Services. Revenues for Energy Connections were
$2.6 billion, up 45%. Core Energy Connection revenues were down 9% organic, with Power Conversion down 12%
and Industrial Solutions down 7%. Grid revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Lighting revenues were down 8% with current
growing revenues 10% and legacy lighting down 22% as the non-LED market continues to decline and we restructure
and exit many markets.
Operating profit in the quarter of $48 million was driven by $63 million of earnings from Energy Connections and a
$15 million loss in Lighting. Energy Connection had $64 million of profit from Grid and a small loss in the core. The
core was driven by lower volume, foreign exchange and mix, partly offset by value gain. The Lighting loss was driven
by a build-out of our current business. The segment continues to make incremental progress, improving each of the last
three quarters and we expect the fourth quarter will improve, again, relative to the third quarter.
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our Vertical businesses earned $466 million in this quarter, up 33% from prior year, driven
by lower impairments in Energy Finance, partially offset by lower gains. GECAS, Energy Finance and Industrial
Finance all had strong quarters and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the third quarter, the Verticals funded
$2.8 billion of on-book volume and enabled $4.2 billion of Industrial orders.
Other continuing operations generated a $441 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense,
restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and headquarter operating costs, partially offset by tax benefits.
These costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we right-size the organization structure.
Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $100 million, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets partially offset
by tax benefits and other items. Overall, GE Capital reported a $78 million loss. We ended the quarter with $103 billion
of ENI excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $57 billion.

Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $16 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed
transactions through the end of the quarter to $173 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $12 billion in
the third quarter, bringing the total signings to $193 billion. We expect to be largely done with signings by the end of
the year and we're on track for the 1.1 times price/tangible book that we originally estimated.
GE Capital paid $5 billion of dividends during the third quarter. In October, they paid an additional $2 billion and we
expect an incremental $2 billion dividend before the end of the year for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the $18
billion target.
Overall, the capital team has continued to execute ahead of schedule in all aspects of the plan that we shared with you
18 months ago. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Jeff. Now let me punch through our operating metrics for 2016. We're narrowing the EPS range to $1.48 to
$1.52. In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwind. We expect organic growth to be positive but
near the low end of the range. And our corporate cost control and margin execution remain very strong.
Free cash flow, plus dispositions, will be above plan mainly due to GE Capital dividends, all other cash metrics remain
on track. And we're increasing the buyback from $18 billion to $22 billion and this makes the total cash returned to
investors $30 billion for the year ahead of plan. So in a time of volatility, the GE model is performing.
Finally, let me reflect on the company's earnings going forward. When we launched the Capital repositioning in April
of 2015, we established the goal of $2 EPS by 2018. Since then, our outlook for Oil & Gas has worsened and foreign
exchange has hurt most global companies and GE is no exception. At the same time, the rest of GE is performing well
and we see that continuing in the future. And we should be even better than our original plan for buyback and Alstom
continues to perform at or above plan. Going forward, we plan to drive out more cost and supply chain program spend
around product launches and corporate. And we will continue to grow our funding on digital transformation.
Incremental leverage exists with the idea of pushing beyond our goals.
We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December, but all of our metrics for compensation purposes will continue to be
linked to $2 of EPS in 2018, we're aligned with investors.
Matt, back over to you for questions.

<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Your final question comments, Jeff, were interesting. I mean, A, you're not backing off the $2
number which is a relief to some of us, but your comment about potentially stretching leverage. I mean, can you be a
little bit more clear on what that means? Is there a comfort level around ratios that you have now that's increased versus

maybe where you were before? Is there a comfort level around M&A and the stuff that's available? I mean, just give us
a little bit more there, please.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yes. Scott, really I didn't mean to change at all the way we've thought about leverage in the
past. I think what I've tried to differentiate is the build to $2 bucks has always assumed without leverage that the extent
to which we do incremental buyback or M&A, it should push above that point. So that was really the only context for
the point on leverage.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. So still a $2 plus, plus in using your...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, no, in other words, we're trying to do the build. Our intention is to not change the
bridge the way we've articulated over the last couple years.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, Energy Connections is not a
business I know very well, but the [ph] end (36:41) margin is pretty weak there. You said you're doing restructuring.
What do you think a pro forma margin looks like in that business once you're done with your restructuring?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, here's what I'd say, Scott, is it's really three businesses and it starts with the Grid
business which is a combination of our legacy Grid business and Alstom's business. That business I think is or I think
we think is performing actually quite well; it earned $64 million in the quarter. It's delivering on all the Alstom
synergies that we talked about it delivering.
And then you have the Power Conversion business which has a higher concentration in Oil & Gas historically than the
balance of Energy Connections. That part of that – of the Power Conversion business has been enormously challenged.
We've replaced a lot of that volume with Renewables volume. The Renewables volume is not as profitable as what
we're doing in Oil & Gas and so Power Conversion has been a challenge.
We've been breakeven to lose a little bit of money here through the first three quarters. And then that leaves you with
our legacy Industrial Solutions business which had a reasonably – a good orders quarter. I mentioned earlier up 6% on
orders in a North American market that feels like it was down 4%. But on execution in revenue in the quarter was less
than what we expected it to deliver. That business ought to earn between $100 million and $140 million a year. The
Power Conversion business until oil turns around I think is going to be a little bit of a challenge and we have a good
outlook for our Grid business. And when we think about 2017, we expect the Energy Connections business to be a
meaningful contributor to earnings growth when we move from this year to next.

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Morning, Steve.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve. How are you?
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: I'm good. Thank you. So just to be clear on the new profit guide for the fourth quarter,
for the year, I think the Street's around $18 billion I think backing into using your free cash flow guidance and kind of
backing into what that would imply for a profit guide for the fourth quarter, somewhere in the $6 billion to $6.5 billion
range? Is that kind of the right number?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think that's about right.

And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the components exactly behind the revenue growth guidance
reduction. What proportion are coming from, say, transport or power? And then when you're thinking about the scope
for recovery sort of timing and magnitude, how are you communicating on that in light of the weak ongoing order
intake?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, I think the revenue is primarily Oil & Gas, Julian, with maybe just a touch in some of
the other ones. But I would think about it in that context. And then, again, I would come back and talk through backlog
growing, service backlog particularly strong as being a big driver of organic growth and the fact that underlying Alstom
orders that will play out in 2017 and beyond are actually quite strong as well. So I view orders as being kind of more or
less in line with our expectations as a buildup for what we have to do in 2017 and 2018. And then Q4, I think we
believe will be a pretty good orders quarter as well. I don't know if, Jeff, you want to add to that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, let me address revenue. So when you think about the year, we had 1% organic
revenue in the third quarter. When you exclude Oil & Gas, if you get back to the rest of the portfolio, in the third
quarter, our organic revenue grew 6%. On a third quarter year-to-date basis, it grew 4% and we expect it to be really
solid, excellent gas – really solid organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter. So the 2% to 4% – moving from 2% to
4% to 0% to 2% is mostly about where we think the revenue number is going to end up with Oil & Gas. Having said all
of that, we've not changed our outlook on Oil & Gas op profit [ph] for the year (41:19) ex-foreign exchange. We still
think plus or minus, that's about 30% down.
Operator
The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Todd Sprague>: Hey. I just want to go Jeff, either Jeff really, to the extent that you can provide color on
just how to think about the underpinnings of the bridge to 2018? And what I mean by that is we're still at $1.50
midpoint for 2016, but we're now looking at segment OP of $1 billion lower. So we got lower tax and other things
going on. We see this change in goodwill at Alstom. I don't know if there's other moving parts. But can you give us any
thoughts on kind of the OP ramp in your business to 2018?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Why don't I start, and then, Jeff, you – so what I would say, Jeff, if you just context in 2016,
I'd say headwind in Oil & Gas, headwind in foreign exchange in 2016. We think some of the foreign exchange actually
comes back our way in 2017 and 2018. We think Oil & Gas is going to continue as you look forward to be a drag. Our
team is doing a really good job. We're executing well. We're taking cost out, but we're not really forecasting a hockey
stick in Oil & Gas. The rest of the Industrial portfolio really, which grew 8% ex-FX, I think it's well positioned to
continue to drive good, solid growth over the next few years. Alstom is on plan. We think the Alstom return still looks
solid and the Alstom earnings outlook for 2017 and 2018 still looks solid. We're going to continue to execute on the
buyback, right. So those are the main components.

And then what I would add to that, Jeff, is just a context of driving corporate costs lower, continuing to work hard on
incremental opportunities on supply chain that we see and accelerating progress in gross margins. So I think the way
you got to think about it is incremental intensity around costs that we see in our line of sight, sustained good growth in
our Industrial portfolio. Some of the FX headwind we've seen should come back to us over the next few years just by
the way the contracts are written. Buyback at or ahead of plan, and that realizes the context for, in Oil & Gas, a
business that we're executing well, but we're trying to be prudent about how we think about it over the next couple
years.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I would just add, when you think about that framework when we initially put it together,
clearly Oil & Gas is the single biggest challenge against that framework. And we're going to be much more aggressive
around costs as a result of it. And the rest of the portfolio, I think, is what – as Jeff described it, and we're going to try
to be a little bit better on buyback.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I think the last point, guys, I just would make a point that the guidance range of $1.48
to $1.52 this year, that's with us eating $0.04 to $0.06 a share of FX in that number, right? So I think the underlying
execution in the context of where we are is still pretty song this year.

The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Jeff...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Andrew, how are you?
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good. You'd talked last quarter about services order growth rising to the mid-single digits
in the second half of the year. And organic orders did turn positive this quarter after being negative last quarter, but
were still pretty low at plus 1%. Do you still see a sustainable mid-single-digit growth in orders, given continued
weakness in Oil & Gas and Transportation? And is the real issue still just the timing of AGP orders? And what are the
chances that AGP orders slip in the current environment?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So, Andrew, I'd say a couple things. Oh, firstly on AGPs. I think we feel reasonably
confident about the guide that we've given you on 135 to 150 for the year. So I don't think that, at the moment, is a
point of concern for us. We did talk about mid- to high-single-digit service orders in the second half of the year. We
still see that in the fourth quarter. We see mid- to high-single-digit service orders organically. What's really changed
versus what we said at the end of the second quarter is that it's been around equipment and most of that change in
equipment has been about Oil & Gas where we're about $3 billion lower on Oil & Gas orders. And that's about three
projects. It's really three distinct projects that have been delayed or suspended, has changed our outlook. And so,
equipment's going to be softer than what we said at the end of second quarter. I don't think there's any change to how
we see service orders here.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good. Thanks guys.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. I just want to go back to Oil & Gas. So last December, you guys had talked about
more room in the $1 billion of cost out, which was like $600 million in 2015, $400 million in 2016 and you thought
you might be able to raise that $400 million to $800 million. Sounds like you've just said you're on track to that for this
year. But as I start looking at this worsening environment, you say you're going to continue to be aggressive in cost. It
starts to really raise the question for me of how much more you can do here, other than kind of ongoing Lean and
productivity in terms of real major thinning out going forward to offset what are continuing really significant pressures.
So I know you've talked about it generally, but any kind of more precision on that front as we look further than the
fourth quarter would be helpful.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So, Steve, your math is exactly right. So we said – I think I said $700 million to $800
million of incremental cost out this year in Oil & Gas. Through three quarters, they've delivered about $530 million of
that. They will deliver all the actions to get to $800 million. We might not realize all $800 million because some of
those savings were volume-related. In other words, if the volume's not there, you don't actually get the cost savings
although when the volume comes back, it will absolutely be there. I think Lorenzo and the team would say there are
additional incremental cost actions we're going to continue to work into 2017. I think you're right. I think the depth of
which you could continue to cut costs is somewhat limited, but there is still incremental additional actions that the team
can take.
I think our comment on more cost actions generally is more of a statement across the entirety of the company given
what's happened in Oil & Gas, around program costs, structure, corporate. There are more opportunities that we're
going to run to, to try to compensate for the fact that Oil & Gas is, we expect going to earn less than what we originally
thought when we gave you the $2 framework 18 months ago.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, I would – I think Jeff said it exactly right. And then what I would say, Steve, is look,
our overall context for Oil & Gas hasn't changed. We still think it's a really good GE business, leverages the GE Store.
And I have every confidence we're going to come out of the cycle better than we went in. But I think I would echo what
Jeff said. I think we continue to see good opportunities in Corporate. We also continue to see good opportunities
around our footprint and supply chain. We've had a chance now to look across the Alstom and GE factory base and
things like that and we see some incremental opportunities that we think are going to allow us both from a sourcing
standpoint and a supply chain standpoint. And we'll be able to do that and still do the investments we need to make in
digital as we go forward. So I think that's the right context.

The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: On cash flow, progress collections I think you said was still a pressure. I mean it would
seem like that should be close to bottoming. What's that going to be this year and where do you see that heading? And
just any other metrics or dynamics you've been working on cash flow wise to just maybe give us an update?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, progress was a bit of a challenge in the third quarter versus expectation. We
definitely delivered better working capital performance in the third quarter. Progress is a little bit of drag. That reflects
equipment orders and that's largely where we thought Oil & Gas might be in third quarter and fourth quarter and where
we see them now. So we had, as I mentioned earlier, two or three big orders push, meaningful-sized orders that would
have brought a lot of cash with it.
We're down year-to-date. The fourth quarter will be better than the run rate through the first three quarters and we
expect progress to actually contribute in the fourth quarter to our CFOA performance that we talked about earlier.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Not going to ask you a question on Oil & Gas. Just to shift a little bit to Predix. In your
presentation, you sort of say that the number of partners has quadrupled on a sequential basis. Are there any revenue
and profit implications from that going into next year because it does seem to be running quite a bit ahead of
expectations?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I wouldn't change it yet, Andrew. We'll talk more about this at Minds + Machines in a little
while, but clearly on the partner side with Predix, I think we're ahead of where we had envisioned. But we'll update
those numbers in the middle of November when we go to Minds + Machines.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: But partners does have revenue implications, right, because...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Oh, for sure. Yeah, no, seriously, for instance, we partner with people. They immediately
add developers and they have revenue goals. So we expect this to be a good boost to how we think about revenue over
Predix over both short term and long term.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I would just add, we had a goal here to sign 50 partners. We're over 200; that's
really positive momentum both from a technology perspective and ultimately longer term in terms of actually
generating orders and revenue. We're way ahead on where we thought we'd be on people developing on Predix. As Jeff
said, all these metrics will be updated at Minds + Machines, but I think there's reasonably good momentum here.

<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joe Ritchie>: Hey. So I wanted to go back to Jeff's question from earlier. When I look at what you guys gave out
in EPG, you had about 5% Industrial growth ex-Alstom coming through in the $2 earnings bridge, and so we're running
this year, call it, down mid to high single digits. So have you guys updated that number? Is that number going to be
running closer to 2% to 3% in that bridge? And then my second question really is around the buybacks. The buybacks
are running ahead of schedule; I think you've done about $25 billion by the end of this year of the $35 billion. And so is
there upside to that number? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So we will update you on the bridge, Jeff will update you on the bridge when we get to
EPG.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: When we get to year end.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I'm sorry. The outlook meeting in December, we'll go back through the bridge, we'll
go back through all three pieces that we've shared with you before. I don't think we see at the moment any real change
in the Alstom. There may be – we may be a bit better on buyback accretion, which is a partial answer to your second
question and we'll walk you through the dynamics in the organic portfolio growth over that period of time. So more
detail to come on that.

On buyback, I think we're absolutely ahead of plan. I think the $4 billion incremental buyback here in the year, I think,
is important. As you know, we're constantly going back and evaluating our capital allocation plans, most of which
we've shared with you on what makes sense. And to the extent it makes sense to be more aggressive with buyback, we
will do that.
We – on the leverage question, we're mostly focused around M&A. So I wouldn't read through on that that leverage
equals buyback. I think that we had, in our capital allocation plan, we had capital available for M&A, buyback and
other reasons, and right now, we're being a little bit more aggressive with buyback.

The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey, like to stay on that capital allocation theme, and Jeff Bornstein, right where you finished off
there, because the plan had been to toggle between buybacks and M&A depending on the returns and are you implying
at all that there's fewer opportunities in M&A today versus the attractiveness in GE stock in terms of increasing the
buyback?
And then also on M&A, maybe some additional color on the LM Wind turbine blade acquisition. Is this the same kind
of de-risking of the supply chain that we saw in Avio and maybe expand on why it gives you better strength in
emerging markets?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so on the capital allocation question, we're not changing any way in terms of how
we're thinking about the trade between M&A and buyback. Certainly with the stock at $28 or $29, the buyback looks
quite attractive to us. We're not short ideas on M&A, I don't think. We're constantly evaluating M&A opportunities. I
think just what we've announced recently here between SLM and Arcam, which is an investment that's going to have a
huge payback longer-term, and most recently, the LM acquisition. We are continuing to evaluate M&A opportunities;
so I wouldn't read through as we're short ideas on M&A. We're just – I think we'd like to be more aggressive around the
stock, given the outperformance by GE Capital in terms of what they're returning to us and operationally what we're
able to do through our capital allocation model that was unrelated to M&A and leverage. So...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I would just say, Deane, I think Avio is the right way to think about LM. We see good
opportunities in the supply chain, we think, the next few years. The visibility we have on wind is pretty solid in terms
of PTC and global demand. We think between us and LM, we've got good technology that can really innovate in the
industry. And what we saw in Avio is we were able to keep the non-GE base in Avio and we think we can do the same
thing with LM.
Lastly, your question, it really bolsters us in China and India and a lot of the emerging markets where we see growth
potential for us in the future. So we look at it as a reasonably low-risk investment where a lot of the levers are in our
control and we have, I think, a disproportionate upside if we execute well.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hi. Just first of all, just a clarification on the buyback. The $4 billion extra this year, that's not a
pull-forward from next year? We're still looking at $14 billion, $15 billion for next year? But my primary question is on
the margin side, obviously good news on gross margins, good news from price/costs, but what's driving the SG&A
inflation, because there's about 150 bps of high SG&A, so if you can just address those two questions. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Okay. So first on buyback, let me be absolutely clear. The $4 billion buyback is an
increase in the model we gave you that went through 2018. We're buying $4 billion more stock than we said we would
when we gave you the plan through 2018. Okay?
On SG&A, so, in the third quarter, structural SG&A was up 1%. That was 12.6% of sales. Third quarter year-to-date,
we were actually down 4%, about 13% of sales. It was a bit of a drag in the quarter, partly because SG&A was up 1%
and volume was essentially down slightly on a calculation basis. So it ended up being about a 10 basis point drag in the
quarter. Other inflation that sits in the other line is associated with inflation on base costs and most of that is EOP.
There's other indirect expenses that also incur inflation and that's what you see on that line. Other inflation, ex-FX, if
you take out the impact of FX, or some of those marks go through the other line in that walk was a negative 60 basis
points as opposed to what we showed you in the walk.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Okay. Couple quick announcements, Jeff, before you wrap up. The replay of today's call will be available this
afternoon on our Investor website. We'll be holding the Minds + Machines Conference out in San Francisco on
November 15 and our Annual Outlook Meeting on December 14 and will be holding our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call
on January 20. Jeff?
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Matt. Thanks. Just a couple points to wrap up. I think we plan to have a solid Q4 and wrap up a really solid
2016. Looking forward, I think we're being realistic about the environment in the resource sector and Oil & Gas. But
don't be mistaken, we still think this is a core GE business and one where our team is managing it extremely well
through the cycle. The rest of GE is executing very well.
Alstom remains on track in 2017 and 2018. The buyback's ahead of plan. We've got a really good line of sight to
incrementally take more costs out of the company and be even more efficient. And all of our compensation plans,
whether it's the long-term incentive plan, or the AIP, which is our annual IC plan all tied to the bridge that we showed
you in 2015 and where we march in 2016, 2017 and 2018. So we're aligned with investors, Matt, and I think we're quite
confident in the performance of the company.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Great. Thank you for joining.
