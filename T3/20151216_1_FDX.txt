Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good afternoon, and welcome to our discussion of results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
FedEx Corporation posted solid earnings and a year-over-year EPS improvement of 19% excluding TNT integration
costs and a legal settlement charge for FedEx Ground. We continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows
and returns on invested capital. These basic trends should continue well into the future, barring major events or
macroeconomic factors. A record number of holiday shipments, fueled largely by the steady rise of e-commerce, are
flowing through the FedEx global networks. Monday, we picked up over 26 million packages globally. We greatly
appreciate the dedication of more than 340,000 FedEx team members who are delivering the holidays to our customers
around the world. Express service levels in particular have been outstanding. While we have experienced extremely
heavy Ground volumes in the Northeast, our team members have risen to the challenge and the Ground system is
running at schedule.
Adherence to our People-Service-Profit philosophy and the FedEx strategy of compete collectively, operate
independently and manage collaboratively are keys to our success. We will exceed the profit improvement program at
FedEx Express this fiscal year and the aircraft fleet modernization program is paying off in a big way. It's no secret that
e-commerce is changing the dynamics of the transportation industry and driving remarkable growth. We have strategic
plans to ensure we will continue to benefit in the years ahead from this growth.
For example, we're integrating Ground and SmartPost facilities and linehaul systems to realize incremental operating
expense savings in the future. Multiyear expansion of automated FedEx Ground facilities will allow continued
profitable growth and provides the most flexible and fastest ground package system possible. We're also deploying new
technology that will enable us to combine FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost packages going to common delivery
addresses, which will significantly improve efficiency, productivity and service.
FedEx Freight is focused on improving margin trends in a weak industrial economy through better balance in volume
and yield, and higher productivity. Our recent offer to buy TNT Express, assuming it's approved, will quickly broaden
our portfolio of solutions, particularly in Europe. Customers of both FedEx and TNT will benefit from our unmatched
global network. Despite contraction of U.S. exports due to the high U.S. dollar and low world GDP and trade growth,
the overall market for international door-to-door express continues to increase, also driven by e-commerce.
A couple of developments in e-commerce are worth noting. First, oversize packages are increasing; and second, a
number of e-commerce shippers continue to use extremely cube, inefficient packaging. Loaded density and
over-the-road ground trailers is therefore declining because of these trends. In this regard, we are extremely
disappointed that Congress did not approve the use of twin 33-foot trailers on the nation's highways versus the current

28-foot standard. 33s are already permitted in 18 states, and we have safely driven them almost 1,500,000 miles in
Florida alone. Drivers tell us they are more stable than the 28-foot trailers, with similar handling and turning.
Our industry estimates this change would, one, eliminate about 6.6 million trips annually and thereby improve safety
due to fewer accidents per year. The 33s would materially reduce congestion. Third, it would save over 200 million
gallons of diesel and reduce carbon emissions by 4.4 billion pounds per year. With e-commerce exploding and U.S.
automobile miles driven reaching a record high this year, 33-foot trailers would be of enormous benefit to our economy
and significantly improve road safety.
We'd like to welcome Chris Inglis to the FedEx Corporation Board of Directors. Chris retired in 2014 as the Deputy
Director and Senior Civilian Leader of the National Security Agency. His cyber security and information technology
expertise and significant leadership experience will be very valuable to FedEx. Regarding the vital issue of cyber
security, the pending omnibus bill contains several very positive changes to the law regarding corporations and
government agencies, and we sincerely hope it passes.
In conclusion, let me also remind you that this is the earnings call of FedEx Corporation. We manage our portfolio of
services to achieve enterprise results, which does not always translate into each segment's individual earnings and
margins.
Now Mike Glenn and Alan Graf will discuss our economic outlook and further details of second quarter earnings after
which, as Mickey said, we'll take your questions. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thanks, Fred.
I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then I'll discuss performance and business conditions in each
segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on pricing and broader industry trends
that we're experiencing. But first, I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge our team members around the world
who are delivering the holidays as we speak.
As Fred noted, we've experienced record-breaking demand during this peak season, largely driven by the rapid growth
of e-commerce. Our busiest days during peak have exceeded our forecast and more than double our average daily
volume, and it should be noted that our busiest days this year are approximately double what they were just about eight
years ago.
Our ability to flex our networks to meet this demand and while delivering service our customers expect requires many
elements. We continue to invest in new facilities capacity expansion. We apply advanced engineering and use
state-of-the-art sortation technology. We innovate the portfolio and certainly collaborate very closely with our
customers. But more than anything else, our ability to meet this demand comes down to our people, including our
drivers, couriers, pilots, package handlers, and all team members that are hard at work around the world right now to
deliver the holidays.
Now let me make a few economic comments. We continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S.
GDP growth forecast is 2.4% as we end calendar 2015, which is slightly lower than our September 2.5% growth
outlook, and our forecast for calendar 2016 is 2.6%, which is led by gains in consumer spending in the near term. We
expect industrial production growth of 1.5% in calendar 2015, which is 40 basis points lower than our September
outlook, and we have a forecast for 1.9% next year, which is consistent with our September forecast. Energy
investment, the strong dollar, and an inventory correction are restraining growth in this sector. Our global GDP growth
forecast is 2.5% for calendar 2015 and 2.8% for calendar 2016, which represents no change from our prior outlook.
Now I'll review our revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 6%, as
lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset base yield growth. U.S. domestic
package growth grew by 1%, driven by growth in overnight packages while U.S. domestic revenue per package, or

yield, decreased 2% due to lower fuel surcharges. If you exclude the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic
package yields grew by 3%, primarily due to rates and discount, product mix, and weight per package.
FedEx International Economy volume grew by 3% while FedEx International Priority volume declined by 5%.
International export revenue per package decreased 9%, as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange
rates more than offset higher base rates. If you exclude fuel, International Express package yield decreased 3%,
primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of weight, rate and
discount changes. Excluding fuel and exchange rate impact, yields actually increased 1%.
In the Ground segment, revenue increased 32% in the quarter due to the inclusion of GENCO results, higher Ground
volume and base rates, and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment.
FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 9% in the quarter, primarily driven by the growth in demand for residential
deliveries related to e-commerce. FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 10% due to the recording of FedEx
SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, which include additional dimensional weight charges,
partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package including SmartPost
increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by changes in dimensional weight rating, extra services and SmartPost
customer mix. Normalizing for the change in treatment of SmartPost revenue on a gross basis, Ground yields,
excluding the impact of fuel, increased 3.9%.
FedEx Freight revenue declined 2% and shipments increased 1%, which is directly related to the lower levels of
industrial production. We've also seen some heavier weight shipments move back to truckload as capacity has eased.
LTL revenue per shipment declined 3% due to lower fuel surcharges, partially offset by higher base rates. Excluding
the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 2% year-over-year at FedEx Freight, which was primarily driven by
shipment class, rate and discount.
As we announced in September, we will be raising rates at FedEx Express, Ground and Freight by an average of 4.9%
on January 4, 2016. In addition to the rate changes, FedEx also recently increased surcharges for unauthorized packages
in the FedEx Ground network. We've seen significant shifts in demand across our portfolio, including higher demand
for residential deliveries due to e-commerce growth. We've rapidly responded to these shifts both through increased
investments in capacity, expansion of our portfolio and pricing decisions across the portfolio. The rise in residential
deliveries brings with it operational considerations including the number of increased stops, a higher use of fuel as a
result of the increased stops and evolving package and weight dimensions. For example, packages classified as oversize
account for almost 10% of Ground home delivery packages during peak season.
This is the primary reason why we increased the surcharge on unauthorized packages in November and will be
increasing the surcharge on oversize packages in January. As we conduct our post-peak season analysis, we'll factor all
these considerations into future pricing decisions. As I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing a record-breaking peak
season with strong demand across this portfolio, especially for residential deliveries within the Ground network. Strong
customer collaboration is absolutely critical in preparing for peak, as it enables us to anticipate surges in volume and
position resources appropriately to meet the customer's needs.
We've experienced heavy demand for FedEx Ground, particularly in the Northeast, as Fred noted. But our dedicated
team members are working hard to deliver the holidays. Demand in our industry is rapidly evolving, and we have
continued to make changes to our service portfolio and adjusted our pricing strategies to meet customer needs and
generate profitable growth around the world.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, and happy holidays, everyone.
We had an outstanding quarter, and we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the second half of fiscal 2016.
We reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $10.40 to $10.90 per share. Four highlights stand out to me. First, our

adjusted EPS was up 19% for the second quarter. Second, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%. Third,
our FY 2016 guidance reflects nearly 20% growth at its midpoint. And fourth, cash flows from operating activities
increased $300 million, or 14% for the first half of FY 2016. I'm very proud of the entire FedEx team for its impressive
efforts, which are continuing during this record peak season.
Quarterly results improved largely due to higher base rates at Express and Ground, continued strong growth of
e-commerce and positive impacts from the profit improvement program that we announced in October of 2012 and is
probably ahead of schedule at this point. These positive factors were partially offset by lower operating results at
FedEx Freight, primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense significantly outpacing lower than anticipated
volume growth and a modest negative net impact of fuel.
There were two expense adjustments this quarter within eliminations, corporate and other expense. First, expenses
related to the settlement of independent contractor litigation matters of $25 million net of tax or $0.09 per diluted share.
Also expenses related to our pending acquisition of TNT Express of $12 million net of tax or $0.04 per diluted share.
The TNT acquisition will transform FedEx's European offerings and accelerate global growth. We expect the
acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar 2016.
Turning now to Express, another stellar quarter. Operating margin grew to 9.4%, which is the best margin for Express
in nearly nine years. Operating income increased 26% despite a revenue decline of 6%. While Express fuel expense
decreased 43% in the quarter due to lower fuel prices, fuel had a slight negative net impact to earnings versus last year.
The negative net impact of fuel was a result of lower fuel surcharge revenue year-over-year, primarily and partially
offset by lower fuel prices during the quarter.
Currency fluctuations have little net impact on our P&L at Express but can drive significant changes to revenue and
expense. In addition, impact to our P&L are more influenced by some currencies than others. Recent strength in the
U.S. dollar against certain currencies has caused lower revenue expenses for FedEx Express as well as a shift in trade
patterns, as U.S. imports have increased and exports have declined.
A portion of our non-U.S. originating revenue, particularly from large multinational customers, is paid in U.S. dollars
and therefore is not subject to currency fluctuations. This helps our international revenue and expense denominated in
foreign currencies to be more balanced, causing little net impact on our P&L from currency fluctuations. That will
change once we acquire TNT, and we will update you on what the impact is at that point.
In spite of weakening trends in global trade, Express is realizing benefits from its profit improvement plan as I
mentioned before. This includes strong productivity gains, a right-sized workforce, efficient and reliable assets due to
the fleet modernization program and improved base yields. These structural improvements allow us to take advantage
of the growing e-commerce market and to succeed under current global economic conditions.
Express remains focused on ensuring the right products are in the right network and is looking for more opportunities
to improve profit by using purchase transportation on a lane-by-lane basis where it meets our service level requirements
and adds shareholder value. The significant network improvements we are making enable us to profitably handle
growth around the globe and quickly address any lane imbalances due to shifting trade patterns.
Looking at Ground, FedEx Ground posted healthy results as a result of e-commerce growth, pricing actions, and
growth in market share. Operating income was up 13% due to higher base rates and volume. This is the financial metric
that we are most focused on at Ground. As we expected, operating margin was affected by the recording of FedEx
SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and the inclusion of GENCO results. Together, those items reduced the operating
margin year-over-year by 2.1 percentage points for the quarter. GENCO business itself was very good.
By definition, however, it will impact Ground's margins because of Ground's much higher overall margins. This is no
surprise to us. The GENCO acquisition complements and differentiates the FedEx value proposition and is central to
our e-commerce strategy. Opportunities from GENCO will help grow our core transportation business, especially
reverse logistics, and leverage existing customer relationships to open doors for both companies. Ground's long-term
strategy is focused on sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth.

In addition to GENCO, here are five ways Ground prepares for the long game. First is automation. We are making
significant investments to add additional automated hub capacity and ensure many new stations are also fully
automated, providing significant operational flexibility and capacity, particularly during sustained high volume and
keeping FedEx ahead of the competition.
Second is SmartPost integration. As one network, Ground is able to maximize the use of facilities and linehaul assets to
save operating expense. And moving SmartPost packages onto a home delivery truck that is already going to a
residence is significantly less costly than paying postage for the USPS to deliver the package. Over the next several
years as we combine packages that are destined to the same delivery address, we will further increase our efficiency
and profitability.
Third is Monday residential service. Online shopping is a 24/7 experience, so we began a pilot test in which we make
weekend pickups at retail locations for Monday residential deliveries in a defined area. We may consider additional
markets depending on the results of the test.
Fourth is technology enhancements. This is a cornerstone of how we operate inside the FedEx portfolio. We continue to
identify, test and implement new technology for our operations beyond automated sortation. Scanners, package photo
imaging and GPS are a few examples.
And fifth is pricing. As Mike discussed, adjustments to our dimension-based and oversized pricing help offset the
increasing package sizes that reduce our cube efficiency and increase our linehaul costs. The surcharges that went into
effect last month apply to packages that exceed the length or weight limitations with FedEx Ground network and are
handled at our option. These proactive steps help ensure that oversized packages accepted in our network are properly
priced for the space they use.
We expect Ground capital expense for FY 2017 to remain at its FY 2016 level of about $1.6 billion. 90% of that will be
targeted for growth, largely because of rising costs of land and equipment necessary for ground expansion and further
automation. This is a change from our ground capital comments on the previous earnings call.
At FedEx Freight, we are adjusting to challenging less-than-truckload market conditions. Manufacturing, especially in
oil exploration and production, has been weakening for most of the year. The latest reading for November showed the
Purchasing Managers Index, an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector, down more than 15%
year-over-year. Slower manufacturing and a weaker economy and mode shift have been significant headwinds to
Freight's performance. Freight segment operating income and operating margin decreased due to salaries and employee
benefits expense, significantly outpacing lower-than-anticipated volume growth. We are adjusting staffing levels and
other items to offset the impact of the current weak industrial environment.
Looking ahead, we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the second half. And significantly, we are
reiterating our adjusted FY 2016 earnings guidance. This equates to an adjusted EPS growth year-over-year of 16% to
22% despite the weaker-than-anticipated industrial production in global trade.
Earnings growth for the second half of 2016 will be driven by volume and the base yield growth at Express and Ground
and continued benefits from our profit improvement program initiatives. Year-over-year adjusted earnings growth is
expected to be stronger in Q4 versus Q3 due to the significant net benefit from fuel in Q3 of last year and the growing
benefits from our profit improvement initiatives.
Remember, this guidance doesn't include any impact from TNT and mark-to-market pension adjustments. We will
provide updated information at a later date. We still expect to close in the first half of calendar year 2016 and are
waiting on regulatory approvals.
Our tax rate is lower this quarter because we were able to resolve a state tax matter in our favor. The full year rate is
expected to be about 36% excluding any impact from TNT and mark-to-market pension adjustments. Our capital
spending forecast for the fiscal year remains at $4.6 billion, primarily for fuel-efficient new aircraft and support
e-commerce growth at Ground.

We will continue to invest in our people. Team members' pay increased in October. Their healthcare premium held
steady in calendar 2016, and our pension fund is strong with an accounting funded level of approximately 87%.
On November 13, we placed our revolver and letter of credit facility with a new five-year $1.75 billion revolving credit
facility that expires in November 2020. The facility, which includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit and
multi-currency capability, is available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs.
Also during the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of 30-year notes at 4.75% coupon. The rating agencies affirmed our
current ratings for this transaction. Interest will be $36 million for FY 2016 from this transaction and $60 million on an
annual basis going forward. We used the proceeds for some of our share repurchases as well as other corporate
purposes.
Since FY 2014, we have returned over $7 billion to shareholders through repurchasing over 53 million shares at an
average price of about $139, including over 8 million shares we have repurchased in fiscal 2016 to-date. 4 million
shares remain under our existing share repurchase authorization, and we plan to repurchase all the remaining authorized
shares by the end of the fiscal year.
In closing, let me remind you that despite the economic headwinds, the FedEx Corporation balance sheet is strong. Our
cash flow is improving, and we expect strong EPS growth.
Thanks very much for your attention. And now, we'll open the call up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Chris Wetherbee from Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey. Great. Thanks and good afternoon. I wanted to touch, I guess, on the Express side and
how it relates to the guidance. So, a weaker macro, maintained guidance, and you've talked about sort of the Express
profit improvement plan likely exceeding target. Can you give us some context around that in sort of how you may
think about the potential for fiscal 2016 and then maybe beyond?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking. I'll let Dave talk about it. Express' margins are going
up. They're going to continue to go up absent macroeconomic or geopolitical events. As I said in my remarks, the fleet
modernization program is making a huge difference. Alan said in his remarks the productivity, because the technology
is going up, the system form adjustments that Dave made in his network, allow us to put the right traffic in the right
network. And as I said, Express is in a sweet spot.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. Thanks for the question and thanks, Fred. We are in a sweet spot. And if you
remember, our profit improvement plan was driven mostly by structural cost initiatives and not as much on the revenue.
That being said, the revenue has been better. We've had better yield management. But again, we've had a terrific
performance in our fleet. The planes are flying at 99-plus reliability, and the fuel savings has been great. And of course,
the reliability is all around the world.
That being said, of course, our productivity and we've rightsized our U.S. operations here throughout the United States.
And really on the global basis, the traffic that we're moving on the international economy basis that's growing is very
profitable for us now because we have it in the right network.
So, yes, we're very optimistic about our profit improvement going forward. It continues to increase the profits. It
doesn't stop, of course. I saw some of the comments earlier. It just continues to keep growing and increasing. And
Fred's right. I mean we hit a nine-year high of our margins at Express, and those will continue to grow, as well will our
profits.

And we'll now go to Tom Wadewitz from UBS.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. If I could get – I don't know if this is more
for Alan or for Dave, but on the Express improvement plan, I guess it's less clear to me what the kind of metrics are
versus when you originally introduced the plan. You talked about, I think, the $1.6 billion and is that – and I think that
was end of fiscal year 2017, but then the base changed a little bit related to the pension. So could you just run through
what the right I think both absolute amount you're considering to be the plan? And is year-end fiscal 2017 still the right
timing on that; recognizing you will improve on an ongoing basis, you'll try to do that? Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Tom. I think we've mentioned this before several times, but it's important to
mention again, the 75% rate that we've captured, we captured it at the end of last fiscal year. FY 2016 built on that. All
five of the pillars are still the five that are producing the results. Quite frankly, they're better in almost every category.
You can go back and look at all the notes so you can call IR for the five pillars. But across the board, we're improving
each one of the pillars.
The one that we counted on the least was the global marketplace revenue. And actually we've been better on that. All
that being said, that was the one that we were worried about the most. We're doing very well there because we planned
it to be less than all of our cost initiatives. So I would say going forward, obviously you can see the numbers, we're
having a great year in 2016, and that'll continue into 2017.
Operator
And we'll now go to Nate Brochmann from William Blair.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Good evening and thanks for taking the question. Fred, you started off like talking about,
obviously, all the changes that e-commerce has brought and how that's allowed you to redefine your network and serve
your customers. As your customer supply chains evolve, how have you been able to help them and get deeper into that
relationship? And particularly, how does GENCO help with that?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, I'll ask Mike Glenn to comment on it after I do, but a big part of e-commerce
is handling returns. So some years ago, as we saw the market evolving, we decided it would be a very, very good thing
for us to have a supply chain capability to offer a broader portfolio of value-added services to our e-commerce
customers, because this was a huge part of the marketplace. It wasn't just planning on how to get it to the end customer,
but how to efficiently process the returns and the merchandise.
So through a, quite frankly, serendipitous chain of events, this great company, GENCO, which was coincidentally in
Pittsburgh and was by far the leader in this space in our opinion, became available and we did a deal with Herb Shearer,
a fine gentleman and a great management team that he had assembled. And so, we think there are enormous synergies
there.
I'll ask Mike and Henry to comment on it, but we're just couldn't be any more pleased with GENCO being part of the
FedEx portfolio and think it will enhance our competitive position and problem-solving ability for our E-commerce
customers.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike. I think it's important to note that our sales team has a solutions organization
that works hand-in-glove with our large e-commerce customers to help optimize their supply chains. And that includes
everything from types of information management solutions to location of distribution facilities, selection of services,
all designed to drive value for those companies. And sometimes, those solutions are good for FedEx in the short term.
Sometimes, they're not so good for FedEx in the short term, but they're always good for us in the long term because
we're working with customers to drive solutions that are going to benefit the relationship between FedEx and the
customer over the long haul. So we're well-ingrained and embedded into our largest customers and work with them
hand-in-glove throughout the year to prepare for peak season and operations 12 months out of the year.

GENCO was a significant addition to our portfolio. We recognize we had an opportunity to enhance the portfolio. As
Fred noted, they have world-class solutions in the returns segment. Returns is a particularly big part of any e-commerce
value proposition because they tend to be double-digits, whereas a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer is in the mid to
lower digit return rates. So GENCO has been a tremendous addition to the portfolio. We're well down the track on
integration, and we see a lot of benefit going forward.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: I should note that GENCO does many things other than returns within their
capabilities. They are just outstanding and the market leader in the returns space. Henry, do you want to add anything?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: No. The only thing I would add is that they've quite a footprint on the forward logistics side as
well, so customers that want, for instance, fulfillment, GENCO could do. I think it's important for the folks on the call
to understand there are a lot of transportation segments between all of these nodes on the supply chain, and this gives us
an opportunity to participate in their transportation, whereas before, we probably didn't get a chance.
Operator
And I'll now turn the conference over to our speakers for any questions that may have come over the e-mail.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. We've got some questions over the Internet. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, thoughts on Amazon creating its own network. Mike, Glenn, you want to comment?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah, thanks, Fred. I'm not quite sure how you're defining network, but let me say that
virtually, every major retailer in the United States today has a dedicated linehaul operation to move inventory between
distribution centers and stores, and Amazon's certainly no different in that regard.
Amazon is a very large FedEx customer, and we work closely with them, as I just noted, to optimize delivery needs and
of course work with them very closely to create new solutions to support their future growth. I do think it's important to
point out, however, that FedEx is a highly integrated global transportation network; in fact, one of only two operating at
a significant scale in the United States today and only one of the three major delivery networks in the U.S., the other
two being UPS and the United States Postal Service.
That's not likely to change in the foreseeable future as these networks are very capital intensive and information
intensive. And I think finally, I think it's important to note that our network is a linchpin in the e-commerce market and
our customers rely on us to support their growth. So we feel quite comfortable where we're situated today.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. There are a couple of questions here from several Internet questioners about
the update on TNT. I think we answered that in Alan's comments. We're hopeful we'll close by the first half of next
year. I'll ask Chris Richards to put any color on that if she wants. There's another regulatory question from Helane
Becker about, is there a concern the fine levied by the French will be copied by other countries, and are you
considering an appeal? Chris?
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Thank you, Fred. I'll start with the update on the regulatory approvals of the TNT
acquisition. As we indicated in our joint press release with TNT on October 20, we have been informed by the
European Commission that no statement of objections will be issued to the review of our transaction. We are
anticipating that we will receive final unconditional approval from the EU in the first two weeks of January.
In addition, we have completed the process and received clearance in 10 other countries including the U.S., Australia,
Chile, Columbia, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey, and Ukraine. At this time, we are aggressively
pursuing clearance in the remaining seven countries, Brazil, China, Argentina, Israel, Korea, Namibia, and South
Africa. And we are very confident that we will achieve the clearances that are necessary to close this transaction in the
first half of calendar 2016.
Moving on to the question about the French proceedings, no, there is not any concerns the fine levied by the French
will be copied by other countries because this proceeding involved TATEX, a French company that we acquired in

2012. And the events that are the subject of this proceeding occurred in 2010, long before we acquired the business.
The events were limited to France, but despite that situation, we are considering an appeal of this decision, and we'll
give you an update on it next quarter.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Jack Atkins of Stephens wants to know what the margin goals for the Ground
segment are. He asked a couple of other questions here, but I think they were basically answered because they concern
TNT. And he is interested to know, Henry, about the cost savings to be realized from the integration of SmartPost into
FedEx Ground.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, there's significant savings when we can marry two packages together in residential
delivery because the vast majority of the cost in any of these networks is really around stopping the truck in front of an
address. So when you can pull a package up to SmartPost, for instance, marry it up in a single network with a FedEx
home delivery package, the savings are quite a bit – the costs are quite a bit less than paying postage on that package to
have the U.S. Postal Service deliver it.
There are a number of other advantages as well. One is that we can maximize the capacity between Ground and
SmartPost from time to time. And at times even geographically throughout the year, we see volume spikes. This gives
us the ability to move, for instance, a SmartPost package into a Ground hub's small sort operation and process it there
as opposed to essentially just bringing in more people at SmartPost to handle the added volume. There are a number of
other issues just in the sense that we can share people now. We have effectively dissolved the corporate structure. So all
of SmartPost people are either being deployed in their current jobs in the former SmartPost or within FedEx Ground.
Operator
And we'll now take a few questions over the phone lines. We'll go to Allison Landry from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks. So, Fred, you mentioned early in your remarks that e-commerce customers
continue to use inefficient packaging, and you're continuing to see growth in oversized packages. So given that
customer behavior is not changing, how do you plan to mitigate this going forward? And do you intend to lean more
into pricing?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, the answer to that question is yes on the pricing. And of course, we've already
done some of that, and we've announced more. That's really where dimensional pricing came from. I mean we were
getting lots of packages that were one or two cubic feet and inside was a six-ounce stuffed toy. And that comes from
the way e-commerce is processed. These large fulfillment centers or perhaps not so large, but they're using a lot of
effort, particularly during the holidays, to speed up order fulfillment. And they put things in boxes, and it's quite
different than, say, Procter & Gamble packaging toothpaste in the most efficient, most dense way to minimize
transportation costs. So the reason this continues, quite frankly, with more effort not put into it on the part of the
e-tailers is the postal service doesn't have dimensional pricing.
And I have to tell you, I feel for a lot of our postal folks out there. They operate their parcel delivery system with
200,000 jeeps, which were basically designed for mail delivery. And watching them, it looks like a submarine. These
people – they got all these packages on the left-hand side of the truck, they have to stop, they have to pull them out,
re-sequence them for delivery. And at my house, I can promise you we're getting a lot of very lightweight cube items
coming from retailers through SmartPost or directly from an e-tailer. So over time, all markets are rational, and it does
not make a lot of sense for the e-tailer or the transportation company or the delivery company, in the case of the postal
service, to pay money to deliver air. So I think pricing will rationalize it.
As I said in my remarks, it's just a terrible shame that the 33 footers were not approved. That gives about 18% more
cube, very little increase in weight. And as I mentioned from an environmental safety standpoint, it was just a complete
layup. And the forces that opposed it, quite frankly, were not well informed on the issue.
And hopefully, the Department of Transportation will move smartly to correct this because, as I said, these are already
used in 18 states. And they're more stable because they put slightly more weight on the axle of the twin trailers. The

passing 33-foot set of doubles versus 28-foot doubles of 60 miles an hour is basically inconsequential. It's about a tenth
of a second difference.
So it was a great opportunity to have a win, win, win solution in terms of national productivity for e-commerce,
reduction in fuel and environmental emissions. And then it would reduce over – I think it was 1,000 accidents
estimated with the Ground parcel and LTL industry per year. But it is what it is, and obviously, we'll have to operate
the 28-footers. But that would have mitigated a lot of these inefficient cube developments we've been talking about.
Operator
And our next question comes from Tom Kim from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Thomas S. Kim>: Hi. Good evening and thanks for your time. I wanted to follow up on the Ground margin
question. I have question I guess around the integration of SmartPost and GENCO. In the prepared remarks, you had
mentioned that operating margins had been impacted by about 1.2% or more. Is that including any one-off integration
costs?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Well, this is Fred Smith speaking. Alan mentioned that of the Ground margin delta,
2.1% out of, I think, 2.2% was having to report because of the integration of Ground and SmartPost, the revenues at the
gross level versus the net level. Prior to our doing that, we simply took the net cost of the postal deliveries and – excuse
me, the delta between the postal delivery costs and our revenues. As a single network, the accounting rules are such we
had to take it on a gross basis. So there's no diminution whatsoever in earnings, cash flows, the performance of Ground;
it's just an accounting situation.
The second is the fact that we put GENCO into the Ground segment, and Henry is in charge of this because it is so
closely aligned with the Ground parcel, SmartPost presence in the e-commerce market. Now again, as Henry said,
GENCO does many, many other things for Express and Freight and so forth. But we're very confident in our Ground
margins.
And Henry, why don't you add to this and say it one more time what our goals are here?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, we strive for mid-teens margins at FedEx Ground. There is no discernible integration
costs in there at all. I mean this is roughly 10 basis points. It frankly falls into all other. There was no single large item.
You've got to keep in mind, with a company of this size and the fact that we recognize revenue on delivery, not on
pick-up, having a couple of thousand packages move in or out of a quarter can have a huge bearing on operating
profits.
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I was curious, could you address, please, the
Trans-Pacific and perhaps Trans-Atlantic trade lanes, how they progressed through the quarter, what you're seeing into
the coming quarter and also with consideration for capacity? Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. This is Dave Bronczek. I think I heard your question. Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic,
it's generally the same economic environment that Mike talked about at the beginning around the world. It's growing,
but it's more modest. So I wouldn't say – I think it is actually growing more out of Europe because of the currency
exchange, a little bit less out of Asia. But around the world, we balance our network. So for us, in Mike's comments,
we took that into consideration as to where we put our packages and how we flow our network.

Our next question comes from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Thanks and good evening. I guess continuing on the Ground line of questions, can you
give us a sense of what drove the acceleration in the average daily package volume growth? Was a lot of this as a result
of the GENCO acquisition? Are we starting to see some of those revenue synergies showing up? How much of an
impact was the calendar? And if there were any shifts coming out of Express's U.S. deferred volumes, which declined
for the first time in a few years, it would be helpful to kind of understand the different puts and takes there.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: The volumes at Ground are growing because we're taking market share and because
e-commerce, the delivery of individual packages to businesses and retail is growing. And on the – what was the –
Express deferred, do you want to comment on that, Mike?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah, I wouldn't read too much into the Express deferred traffic levels on a trend basis.
Again, as similar to what Henry noted, specific pricing decisions on a customer-by-customer basis can impact volumes
in any quarter, and so I wouldn't read too much into that. I mean we're pretty pleased with where we sit from an
Express volume standpoint, being up overall with the growth coming in Overnight. That's a positive thing for us.
Operator
And I'll now turn the conference over to our speakers for more e-mail questions.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. We have some other Internet questions here. Kelly Dougherty, Macquarie.
How does the greater unpredictability of online sales challenge impact your out-year planning projections?
Well, let me make a couple of comments here and then ask Mike to jump in or Alan. As we mentioned earlier, we have
this enormous sales group which I unabashedly think is the best in the industrial services sector. And as an integral part
of that, we have this wonderful solutions group. So our good customers that work with us in a partnership basis, we can
do an excellent job of anticipating what their needs are and provide the equipment in the right place in the sortation
equipment. The people that have the real problem in the e-commerce business by and large are those that view the
transportation companies as some sort of utility or a vendor, and they make some really, really bad decisions.
I mean we've just watched in amazement several of them just really digging themselves into a hole. But our good
customers, we work very closely with them. Now despite all the best efforts, despite that, sometimes they grow faster
and sometimes they grow in different places because of their customers I mentioned in the Northeast. The demand was
just extraordinary. However, FedEx Ground is very unique in this regard. Our hubs and those of you who have been in
them, you'll know this, they're essentially completely automated.
So what that means is that if we're over-volume in our New Jersey hub, we can divert that traffic to Hagerstown,
Maryland, or into Pennsylvania and sort it in a different timeframe, but we're not reliant on the manning inside the hub,
because really the only labor that's at the location are the people that offload the trucks and the people that reload the
trucks. And we've been talking about this over and over, over the years, and I don't think that a lot of people understand
the profundity of that automation and that flexibility we have. It's a big competitive advantage. It allows us to use
bigger hubs with more direct routings, which is a big part of our 27% day faster situation.
So that's how we do it as we tried to work with our customers. And I have to tell you, there are a lot of our midsize
customers that it is very clear that they are figuring out this e-commerce world. They are doing some very, very smart
things and creative things and I think, in part, that's why the market is growing as much as it is.
Mike, you and Henry want to amplify that?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, I just want to add that I think it's important to note that peak season is a very highly
planned period of time. I mean we literally will start working with customers in late January, preparing for next peak
season. The second point is we're not going to overcommit to traffic levels that we can't handle in our network. In other
words, we understand what the capacity is on a given day and our operating companies do a tremendous job flexing up
capacity. But as we've noted many times on this call, we have to cap certain customers to make sure that we're

providing the service that meets the customer expectations.
In addition to that, we have a team that essentially is conducting an orchestra for about one month out of the year, and
they have essentially a control tower that has minute-by-minute discussions with the operating companies which are
making changes to inputs that we receive from our customers which allow us to deploy our resources and adjust to
changes in demand, both up and down.
So as we say in the South, this is not our first rodeo, and we've been doing this for a while. And I think we've got a
pretty good business model here, and we've demonstrated that it works well in terms of meeting customer expectations.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. This is Henry Maier. I just like to add to this question a couple of things. First of all,
Fred mentioned the 33 fully automated hubs we have. The second thing I would add is we currently operate 49 fully
automated satellites as well which give us enormous flexibility in being able to offload volume from hubs to these
automated satellites and vice versa. They also provide a bit of a relief valve, if you will, for converting volume away
from hubs and being able to sort it and move it direct.
The biggest reason why we are successful as we are at peak and why we see these surges in volume is simply FedEx
people. We have the greatest group of people of any company I believe in the world. You add in the yeoman effort of
our contracted service providers and the dedication and professionalism, the commitment to quality and just plain
innovation, to being able to adapt on the fly. I can tell you for somebody who sits in my chair, it's nothing short of
inspirational. And I think that's the secret sauce here which allows us to be able to handle the unpredictability of online
sales.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: David Ross asked will the price of oil, if it's lower for longer, help or hurt Express?
On the margin, the elasticity will certainly create more Express demand and on the margin, it might be a bit more
priority versus economy. But the markets for Express and increasingly the door-to-door international Express are built
on customer needs and purchases.
So if you need a defibrillator for an operation tomorrow at a Cleveland hospital, you do not want that defibrillator stuck
in a package – a truck with a bunch of toys. And that is why our Express network is focused on these high-value added
type of products, and high-value added products are sold around the world in global markets.
And finally, what's really exciting is increasingly they are being sold door-to-door on an e-commerce basis. One
customer that has the entire wares of the world for a business or for a consumer, and that is going to be a very big
market and it's where the Express intercontinental network is focused. So on the margin, yes, it'll have some effect but
not as much, I think, as the fact that people use Express and Global Express when they have an urgent need to move
something in one to two business days door-to-door.
David Vernon of Bernstein asks has FedEx detailed the cost benefit opportunities and costs associated with the TNT
acquisition, and does the company intend to provide guidance on these items at any point prior to their incorporation
and to results are what we learn as we go as we have with GENCO. I'll answer the first and ask Alan to comment on the
guidance issue.
The answer to the first part of the question is, of course, we have a detailed plan. We did an in-depth strategic business
case, as we do for any potential acquisition, which was studied in great detail.
We have a very, very good integration process that's run through a formal process, headed up by Alan and Bob
Henning on the financial side, and Dave Bronczek and David Cunningham and David Binks, our President of Europe,
on their side. And this is a process, a template that we use on all our acquisitions. The acquisition, of course, was
presented to the FedEx board of directors, and it is in great detail.
Now obviously, based on imperfect knowledge and changing economic circumstances, as you get in deeper and you
understand things, things will change. But we're already far enough into it, although we're still not able to completely
get into the details because we don't have approvals to know that this is going to be just a terrific fit. And we love the
team members over there. And I think they love being part of FedEx prospectively.

So, Alan, on the guidance, you want to comment?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: We have a very detailed integration planning going under way right now that I'm very excited
about. First of all, they're executing on our outlook strategy. We agree with that. We've been supportive of that, and
they are being successful in that regard. Secondarily, the integration teams have great details to the extent we're
permitted to talk about there is on what's going to happen on day 1, what's going to happen in the next 100 days in year
1, 2, et cetera. I can tell you that the people that we're working with are terrific, that there are many, many opportunities
that are equal to or greater than I thought when we built the strategic business case.
Having said that, I will also tell you that the integration is going to take some time and it's not easy to do. There are tax
structural and accounting issues to deal with. There are IT issues. There's rationalizing the lanes, all the things you can
think of. And we've got everyone of those being worked on. We can't talk to their customers. They can't talk to ours.
We can't talk about pricing, and of course that's where some of the big numbers are. But what I'm seeing so far is I'm
very pleased with.
As I said, day one, we're not going to see big synergies financially until fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2017 is going to be a year of
getting our hands around some of these very tough issues and making sure that we don't do any harm, that business
continuity is there, that the customers are taking care of and that we don't miss a beat from service levels. So it's not
easy, but I think the reward is going to be fabulous.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So let me combine two questions here into one answer, because I think this is an
important issue. The first part of it comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Have you seen any shift changes in the
marketplace with respect to UPS's acquisition of Coyote in terms of handling the peak season? And on the same line of
thinking, David Vernon asks, does the transition to the ISP model at Ground increase the risk that these larger
contracting entities are harder to handle or deal with, in essence?
Well, a couple of things here. First of all, we already have a truck brokerage and transportation management unit inside
FedEx and have had for quite some time. But much more importantly, I think it's a misunderstanding of the FedEx
Ground business model because the very reason we have these small businesses providing our highway and pickup and
delivery capabilities is that they are very, very close to the market, very close to the customers, very close to the
understanding of the roads in the geographic areas that they serve.
So by design, we want small business people who have those characteristics and are very, very entrepreneurial, and we
do not have many contract service providers that have over seven to ten trucks. I mean, that would be a very big one,
and if you start going beyond that, you lose that tactile entrepreneurial feel. And the thing I love about it and am most
proud about in the Ground thing is these are entrepreneurs and they do very well, that they're good business people, and
it's just really fun to watch them. I hated that when we bought RPS that the single route contractor, you watch these
young folks and minorities and everything start off and get an area and build themselves a wonderful life. And then
because of all of this litigation and the plaintiffs' attorneys and the state tax people and all, we've had to move to the
point where you have to have a minimum level of vehicles and be incorporated. But be that as it may, we still retain the
best of both worlds and in fact it's probably much more productive based on our experience to have the somewhat
larger unit.
So for all intents and purposes, we'll stay with this business model, and that's not going to change. So we don't need the
same number of – purchase transportation tractors and trailers that UPS does, and so I think it was probably smart for
them to get Coyote. I'm not sure that it would be smart for FedEx and, Henry, why don't you jump in here?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, I would echo everything Fred said. I think it's important for the folks on the phone to
understand that we provide some peak incentives so that both our P&D contractors and over-the-road contractors bring
on the necessary resources within their business to handle our projected peak volumes. That just gives us unbelievable
flexibility, particularly when business spikes, et cetera. I would add that the way you need to think about them is they're
coin-operated. They are entrepreneurs. They respond very well to the opportunity to earn more revenue for their
businesses and they step up every single year.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So in essence, we have a huge truck brokerage capability through our highway
contract service providers. They get tractors and are able to put this power on much better in a geographic area than a
centralized brokerage system for us. However, again, we have a wonderful truck brokerage and transportation
management capability for our supply chain customers and to help with purchase transportation where we get it.
Let me take one more from the Internet and then we'll take a few from the telephone. Again, this is Allison Landry of
Credit Suisse. Have you seen a contraction in domestic B2B? And the answer to the question is no.
Operator
And thank you for those e-mail questions. We'll now take a few questions over the phone line. And we will go to Scott
Group from Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Afternoon, guys. So just want to follow up on the question earlier about Ground
volume growth and maybe a little bit about seasonality. So nice acceleration in volume growth to 9% in the second
quarter. Is this continuing in the third quarter? I'm just wondering if there's any impact of Cyber Monday, which was in
2Q this year, and I think in third quarter last year. So, Alan, how does that impact the seasonality of earnings? And I
know you made some comments about third quarter, fourth quarter. Can you just clarify what your point was there?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, this is Mike Glenn, and let me say – just reiterate the remarks we made earlier. I mean,
we're off to a strong start in our peak season. As Fred said, we picked up over 26 million packages on Monday. We've
exceeded our forecasts for our peak days in the month of December. And what January and February holds, we'll just
have to wait and see. We don't forecast volumes for upcoming quarters but we're very happy with where we are based
upon the start to peak season.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We don't forecast them for you, we forecast them internally. Henry and Alan want to
weigh in here on this.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Scott, this is Alan. One of the reasons that I've taken out my guidance for you on Ground CapEx
is not just the – by the way, a fairly stellar increases in land acquisitions and material handling costs, and that's all got
to do with e-commerce. It's also because Ground is going to continue to grow. What we can't do, and I'm a good
Missouri Lutheran, so I can say this. We can't build a church for Easter. So part of what we're doing about yield
management and everything else is we've got to get these packages a little bit smaller or we've got to get paid for the
space they're using. But we can't have a lot of excess capacity laying around the other 11 months of the year, and we're
not going to do that. Henry is working his people every day of the week. We're open 24/7 for this entire peak season –
the competition is not doing that. And it's made a big difference for us.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Scott, this is Henry Maier. I'll be a little bit more to the point. I've been around here for a lot of
peaks. This is without a doubt the busiest one I've ever seen, and it has been consistent every single day since 11/30,
and there's no sign it's going to let up. So that's where we are. Our people are stepping up to the task. Our network is
doing, is performing exactly the way it's designed. If we didn't have these automated hubs and automated satellites and
the great people, I think we'd be in much different shape than we are today.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me just state again what I said in my opening remarks here. We think we have
very, very good strategic plans and an in-depth knowledge of this market, better, or at least as good as, any entity on the
planet. And we have very, very creative concepts to make our assets sweat more and be able to process more packages
in all of our networks. And that's why we were so forthright in saying that we expect this to continue absent
macroeconomic or geopolitical events. And let me say it again. We continue to increase margins, earnings per share,
cash flows and returns on invested capital, and we are confident these basic trends should continue well into the future
barring major events or macroeconomic factors.
Having said that, I know it's very important for all of you folks on the call. Sometimes we're off 1% or 2% in a quarter.
This is a big, big enterprise. We can pick up, transport and deliver to virtually any address in one to two business days
to 90-some-odd-percent of the global population. That takes incredible networks. Henry Maier's network at Ground has

550 facilities. David Bronczek has 600 FedEx Express stations, which are very different in the way they are designed.
That's just in the U.S. They're very different in the way they're designed because they're designed to interface with
airplanes, not with 28 or hopefully someday, 33-foot [ph] pod (01:14:26).
Mike Ducker's FedEx Freight is very different, and as I told you, these automated hubs that Henry is operating are
some of the most incredible facilities ever put on the planet. So this is a very big, complex business with an enormous
amount of value-add, and so we can't get it within 1% or 2% sometimes, but directionally, we're very confident that we
will continue to achieve those things that I just said – increasing margins, earnings, and cash flow, and ROIC.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now go to Alex Vecchio from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Alexander Vecchio>: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. This might be best suited for Chris. Can you
just provide just a little bit more color and background on the independent contractor litigation costs at Ground in the
quarter, the extent to which we might see litigation expenses going forward related to any lawsuits outstanding and
maybe the overall defensibility of the independent contractor model that you employ? I realized that you guys have
made some changes there with respect to requesting that the contractors incorporate, but maybe we can just get a recap
of the model and the litigation expenses this quarter. Thank you.
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Yes, Alex. I'll try to give you some insight on this. First of all, all of the litigation
involves the ground contractor model that was being operated in the early 2000s, and we have made significant
changes, as you note, both requiring incorporation, but also requiring that every contractor treat all of their folks as
employees, and they provide a complete compliant program, including workers' compensation, unemployment
compensation and all of the other matters that are required by the various states to ensure that the folks are comfortable,
that these are, in fact, independent businesses running under their own direction and guidance.
We have had some litigation that has not been as positive for us, particularly out in the Ninth Circuit. For those of you
who are familiar with the Ninth Circuit, it is a very tough circuit for business operation. They tend to be very difficult
in their analysis of what constitutes an employee, and so we have had some settlements from cases where we had
adverse decisions in the Ninth Circuit. That being said, we have had positive decisions in the First Circuit and in some
other circuits, and we still have the bulk of the cases being held at the Seventh Circuit, where we are awaiting a briefing
and hearing schedule.
We do opportunistically settle these lawsuits if we get in a situation where we can do that to resolve the issues and
move things forward. You need to keep in mind that in most of these instances, the bulk of the people who are involved
in this litigation have moved on and are not contractors anymore. So this is really in our rearview mirror and while it's
my job to make sure we get through it on a satisfactory basis, we are extremely confident in our independent service
provider model and our all incorporated model that we are operating today.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on good
results in a very difficult economy. So Fred or Mike, I think for an analyst that's been covering you for a long time, if
we knew where [ph] ISM (01:18:28) was going to be and IP being negative, we would've thought a lot of earnings
contraction here for the company because you just historically had a lot of exposure to the industrial economy. So what
do you think has decoupled here that's allowing you actually to get close to 20% growth if you can hit the guidance this
year in what otherwise is a very slow growth or even contracting industrial macro backdrop?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hey, Brandon. This is Alan. We've been working for a very long period of time with the profit
improvement program and all the things that are involved in that are preparing for the very situation that we're in. We

have significantly reduced our capacity, made it significantly more fuel and maintenance pilot efficient and more
reliable, and we have a network that's running pretty tight. Having said that, we've got a lot of growth for IP to continue
to grow and move lower yielding products off that backbone network that we fly internationally.
Productivities that we're seeing in the field with our technology and automation improvements at Express are yielding
tremendous things. I mean, essentially, we're doing exactly what we told you we were going to do in October 2012, and
we're learning as we go. And we've got a lot more room to do that. And I'm going to pass it over to Dave [indiscernible]
(01:19:46).
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes, this is Dave. Alan's right. And if you remember what I said at the beginning, we
structured our network to flex up and to flex down. And we would win on either side of that equation. And quite
frankly, we're not flexing down much anymore because the economy is pretty robust for us. International economy is
growing and IP is still 72% or more of my all up revenue for international. So it's significant. It's high yield. So when
we actually can flex up or down and we win, we're in a really good spot. So that's the international network. Couple
that with the U.S. network and the Asia to the U.S. and U.S. back, that's why you're seeing such high margins in profits
from Express.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And bear in mind also we have a huge outbound market share in Express from the
United States. So the dollar exchange ratio means that our outbound is affected much more than our inbound. And I
think Dave mentioned earlier, our European to the U.S. traffic is substantially up, and our Asia to the U.S. traffic is, it's
sort of flattish, but it's not declining. And the real pony in here again is e-commerce. And you are starting to see these
patterns where people are shipping individual items door-to-door because they can now with the software that we're
putting out there and others, they can see what the landing cost is and what the duties and taxes are. So it's a sea
change.
It's the same thing that's driving e-commerce in the United States, but it's more industrial because there are business
products in the main and to some degree individual consumer B2C as well. There's the international question about
FedEx trade networks. It's an integral part of the Express segment. The request is to comment on the forwarding
industry. I don't think it's appropriate for us to do that, but it's an integral part of the value proposition that Dave offers.
The Express system is essentially focused on door-to-door Express. There is some freight that moves through that
network. We are capable of flying extra sections if customers need it, particularly at peak, and then FTN handles the
cargo, the freight and the heavy consolidation. So our FTN network, which we built from scratch, is a perfect
complement for our customers to our Express network.
Operator
And we'll now go to Kevin Sterling from BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good evening. Alan, in your prepared remarks, you briefly mentioned a
Monday residential trial run. You're trying in certain cities. Could you expand on that a little bit, what exactly you guys
are doing there, kind of some of the successes you're having? And I imagine it's trying to increase stop density, if you
will. So maybe if you could expand on that trial run a little bit with Monday residential deliveries?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Yeah, this is Smith here. Let me turn it over to Henry, because he can give you some
detail and Alan wanted Henry to answer this. But our Home Delivery network was set up to deliver Tuesday through
Saturday. Remember in my remarks a few minutes ago about we have lots of concepts based on the growth of
e-commerce how to make our assets sweat more, how do we move more traffic, deliver more traffic with the same
assets? So Henry has begun to deliver six days a week, not just the five days a week. Now B2B has always been
different than the B2C. So why don't you give some color around that, Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, since its inception, FedEx Home Delivery has delivered Tuesday through Saturday,
which means we've essentially deliver Monday's volume the previous Saturday. With the advent of e-commerce, I
mean, it's a 24x7 market. You can buy things online from your phone any time of the day or night. The way we are able

to flex up our capacity at peak every year is we essentially operate a Monday through Saturday network and we run
hubs on Sunday so that we can advance – we can pick up volume into the network so that we can smooth the huge
peaks and valleys during peak throughout the six days of the week. It's occurred to us some number of years ago that
why don't we just operate that way year-round.
With e-commerce, Mondays tend to be fairly heavy pick-up days anyhow, why not begin working that volume on the
weekend rather than on Monday, deliver the volume on Monday and then operate the network six days a week
year-round. The benefits are obvious. The first is, is that on the residential service side we essentially advance roughly
20% of the volume in the network by a whole day so the customer gets it a day sooner than they would have been.
The other thing is it gives us the ability to smooth the volume, which means that we can operate our fixed network
more efficiently throughout the week and by smoothing the capacity, we frankly don't need as much of it as we had in
years past. And we've tried, as Fred or Alan mentioned here, we've had a pilot running since roughly May of this year. I
would say it's a success. We're currently studying where we roll it out next.

Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Hey. Good evening. Just quickly on the other operating loss, it increased to $112
million. Can you kind of delve into what scaled that up?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, we had pension credit in it from mark-to-market accounting, really arcane. If you want a lot
more detail, we'll be happy to take that off-line.
