MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings and welcome to the Monsanto Company third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer for Monsanto. Thank you. You may begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO;
Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from
the IR team are Tim Boeker, Priyal Patel and Ashley Wissmann.
Our third quarter call provides the wrap up of our two most significant quarters and the early views into our outlook for
the coming year. Today we will be sharing a business and strategic overview as well as a summary of our third quarter
results and full-year outlook. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the

We've provided you today with EPS measures on both the GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the
website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press release.
First and foremost, let me review our third quarter results as shown on slide four. Our third quarter ongoing earnings
per share is $2.39, well above the range we outlined at our second quarter call, due primarily to the successful
completion of the licensing agreement with Scotts Miracle Gro, reinforcing our confidence for the year.
Our free cash flow year to date is a use of $789 million as compared to a use of $1.4 billion year-to-date in the prior
year, primarily reflecting the absence of the Climate acquisition and the Novozymes transaction in the current fiscal
year. With these results and our outlook for the year, we remain at the low end of the guidance ranges, namely $5.75 to
$6 of ongoing earnings per share and $2 billion to $2.2 billion of free cash flow as shown on slide five.
With that brief summary, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. The close of our third quarter is always a pivotal time in
our business, and never more so than this year. With our proposal to combine with Syngenta, we've put forward a
transformational plan to further drive sustainable intensification for growers in the future.
Our business and our pipeline are stronger than they've ever been. Our ethos, however, is to continually challenge
ourselves to be proactive in our thinking. With the proposal, we're looking beyond the short-term macro challenges to
drive the next evolution in agriculture.
The challenges facing the world's food supply continue to evolve. The growing population along with our volatile and
changing climate place ever-increasing burdens on global food production as shown on slide six. Equipping farmers
with the right set of innovations that will help solve tomorrow's food challenges today requires more than a new
company. It requires a new vision and a new approach.
This is what's at the heart of this new company proposal as shown on slide seven. Combining the strength of Monsanto
and Syngenta would accelerate the development of new innovations, increase our scale and reach, and provide a
broader spectrum of products for growers around the world. And it would use data science to offer a more insightful,
precise approach to agriculture.
Syngenta's announcement yesterday, albeit one-sided communication, is promising and that it does reinforce the
validity of our integrated solutions theory. But in our opinion, it overstates the risks to execute the proposal. And
without Monsanto as a partner it lacks our leading seed footprint, digital Ag platform, and track record for innovation
and execution. A Monsanto Syngenta combination represents the optimal solution to unlock this value. We believe
we're simply the best positioned to drive the opportunity with the current proposal that offers a significant premium.
More than 30% over the three-year average price of 43% premium versus their unaffected stock price and a 45%
premium over the 12 months weighted average stock price. And importantly, it provides an ongoing growth
opportunity for the combined shareowners. So I would continue then to encourage the shareowners to appeal to their
board to simply engage in constructive discussions with us regarding our very attractive proposal, one that we believe
has the best interest of our customers, our respective shareowners, and society in mind.
So let's take a closer look at the core tenants of our strategic rationale that support this assertion, as shown on slide
eight. As always, it begins with innovation. By using the R&D capabilities of Monsanto and Syngenta in the fields of
breathing, biotechnology, crop protection, biologicals, and data science, it will allow us to put new solutions in the

hands of farmers.
Secondly, a stronger, global presence with more integrated solutions unlock scale and reach that isn't possible today.
More acres, more farms, more crops, and more geographies. The new company would bring a new set of options to
farmers in certain regions of the world who, due to limitations in their access to technology, are not currently able to
maximize production. Today, our foundation and our core crops reaches $400 million of the world's 3.5 billion acres of
arable land. To fully address the demands for food production, we need to deliver technology and insights to every acre
and every farmer, from large-scale operations in the Americas to smallholder farmers in Africa. All farmers deserve the
choices and the opportunities to be successful. This combination would expand our ability to deliver innovation across
more of those acres, including the highly relevant cereal crops, which make up the majority of the global caloric intake.
Third, this would give us an even more precise approach to every acre, creating immediate and long-term revenue
growth opportunities through a diverse range of optimized integrated solutions. Near-term, by combining Syngenta's
leading crop protection portfolio with Monsanto's leading seed footprint, we would have the unique ability to provide
leading science-based recommendations of integrated seed, trait, and crop protection solutions. This integrated
approach is no longer a theory but the reality that we see today with the success of our Roundup Ready PLUS and our
Acceleron seed care programs. This combination would also allow us to more fully participate in the value creation
from our crop protection solution recommendations.
A prime example of that is our announcement today to begin our preliminary investment in dicamba production at our
Luling, Louisiana location. Pending final approvals, we're considering a potential investment of more than $1 billion
over the course of three to five years to support this 200 million acre opportunity. Longer-term and unique to
Monsanto, we will be able to unlock a new data-driven approach to provide farmers even more valuable, real-time
insights about their crops with our Climate platform. The information would provide actionable crop protection
recommendations to farmers to maximize productivity, while ensuring inputs are applied in a precise manner to meet
society's broad goal to preserve and protect our environment. And this is ultimately what makes this proposal unique.
Many in the industry have theorized on integrated strategies, but we believe we're best positioned with our strong seed
footprint and our leading digital Ag platform. This bottom line delivers new opportunities and much needed yield for
growers around the world.
Fourth, it provides synergies that create value for shareowners. We believe the proposed combination would deliver
substantial cost synergies and revenue growth opportunities that create value for shareowners of both companies. This
includes an attractive return on investment capital and a responsible capital structure, taking into account cash proceeds
from the planned divestitures. These core tenets are not new to us. Our track record and our commitment to innovation
paired with our execution and our financial discipline positions us well to lead the next evolution in agriculture. The
many milestones reached this year, as Brett and Pierre will highlight, offer the continued proof points and give us
confidence to reconfirm our full-year guidance.
Looking to the longer term, as shown on slide nine, optimized spending and the milestones that we delivered this year
reinforce our confidence in our five-year plan to more than double our fiscal year 2014 ongoing earnings per share by
2019. While we believe the combination with Syngenta is optimal to serve our customers for the long term and would
drive even greater growth in long-term earnings per share, our current portfolio and our pipeline leads the industry and
provides multiple levers to drive our long-term growth projections. We're committed to using the full range of variables
in this plan, adapting the path to our long-term target as condition shift.
While the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture creates new opportunities to meet the long-term demands of
sustainable food production, importantly, we're not allowing it to distract us from managing the business at hand. So
where are we today? We've made a highly compelling proposal to Syngenta at 449 Swiss francs per share, one that
provides a 43% or a 12 billion Swiss franc premium to their shareowners, along with the potential for significant upside
from the benefit of the growth prospects of the combined entity, as the two companies together are more valuable than
the two alone.
Furthermore, we've provided significant regulatory certainty by agreeing to divest all of Syngenta's seeds and traits
businesses along with competing chemistry products. We've underscored our confidence in obtaining regulatory

approvals by offering a substantial $2 billion reverse breakup fee if we're unable to obtain such approvals. The interest
in the sale of the seed assets has been extraordinary, giving us confidence that we can divest of the businesses at an
attractive price.
I'm personally encouraged by the reactions I've heard to our proposal from our respective shareowners, customers, and
our stakeholders. It's disappointing that Syngenta hasn't engaged in substantive discussions about the many benefits of
the combination, including those for farmers around the world. We remain committed to unlocking this opportunity and
will continue to pursue a constructive conversation, but the window for seizing this opportunity is measured in months,
not years. This vision is simply too important to delay executing to make it a reality for growers and owners alike.
So with that, I'll hand over to Brett to provide the operational business update. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line.
There's no doubt it's been a tough year with the macro pressures facing global agriculture, namely a retreat in corn
acres, currency, and pressured commodity prices. That said, I've not seen our relationships with our farmer customers,
our portfolio, our position in the market, or our pipeline stronger than I see them right now. I feel really good about our
position, and that's a real testament to the strength of our core business.
You need to look no further than this year and our third quarter performance to see the strength and the benefits of the
global portfolio we've cultivated. A real highlight this quarter stems from a core element of our strategy, our broad
licensing approach. In the second quarter, we highlighted that there were licensing opportunities that could come as
soon as this year. And in our third quarter, we announced an agreement with Scotts Miracle Gro, unlocking additional
value in the Roundup lawn and garden brand. As we look across our pipeline of new products as well as our existing
portfolio and brand franchises, we expect to continue to attract additional licensing opportunities.
In corn on slide 10, we continue to see demand for the newer hybrids and technologies, enabling positive germplasm
mix lift and footprint expansion. The portfolio mix curve is intact and demonstrates that even in this environment,
growers are demanding the newest hybrids. Exclusive of currency headwinds, we continue to expect to deliver positive
germplasm mix lift for the full year. And we continue to see footprint expansion as we remain on track to hold or grow
our branded share in every major market in the face of declining corn acres, which we still estimate to be down 11
million to 12 million acres over the past two years.
With the line of sight from our third quarter, where we've seen a good uptick in the U.S. in-season ordering, we now
believe corn acres will be in the range of 88 million to 89 million acres. We're also seeing the shift in the Channel
brand we were expecting, as the growth in that business is now largely reflected in our third quarter results. Against
that, we now expect a softer start in Latin America due to industry expectations that acres will be lower in the coming
season and also of slightly lower acres in other ex-U.S. regions such as Europe.
As I look at this 2015 season, the germplasm price/mix lift and footprint expansion we're tracking towards in a time of
compressed margins for growers reflects the continued demand for high-performing seed technologies based on strong
product performance and customer relationships, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term outlook for this business.
In soybeans, the early milestones in the decade of the bean translate to margins with our soybean platform set to deliver
over $0.5 billion in gross profit growth since the end of the fiscal year 2013. This growth highlights the significance of
the runway of opportunity in this platform.
Intacta, the single largest incremental driver of our soybean growth on slide 11, is delivering. We've reached a record
15 million acres across South America this year. And with production and operational plans in place for fiscal year
2016, we expect to penetrate an estimated 30 million acres with greater than 150 varieties in Brazil alone, a meaningful
tipping point in the 100 million acre opportunity for Intacta.

In addition to rolling out production plans, we continue to make meaningful progress with the establishment of the
POD system in northern Argentina. Approximately 70% of growers elected to pay up front, and we've now seen the
majority of the grain handling partners operationalize the system, collecting royalties for those who opt to pay at
harvest.
In the U.S., it's too soon to call exactly where acres will shake out. But with the additional clarity we have from the
spring planting progress, we expect U.S. soybean acres closer to 85 million acres versus earlier estimates of 87 million
acres. And the combination of shipments and our order book continues to indicate our share is growing, with farmers
continuing to choose Roundup Ready 2 Yield as the product of choice across our branded and licensed footprint.
Our Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System, as shown on slide 12, comes on the heels of Intacta. We continue to make
progress on pre-commercial activities in the U.S., setting up what we expect to be a record soybean launch targeting
more than 3 million acres in 2016, pending necessary regulatory approvals. To that point, this quarter we reached an
important milestone with the receipt of the EU import approval for Roundup Ready Xtend soybeans, and we've
submitted all the required data to the China Ministry of Agriculture and await their approval. Farmers are in need of
this technology, and we're looking forward to being able to deliver this to the market in 2016, setting up the next wave
of growth in our soybean business.
We can see the demand for this next generation weed control technology in cotton this year on slide 13. Despite the
pullback in cotton acres this year, our limited introduction to Bollgard II XtendFlex is sold out, with the technology
exceeding our initial target reaching more than 750,000 acres, as growers limited returns to ensure they could access
these new varieties on as many acres as possible. We expect these new best-in-class varieties to drive back-to-back
share growth in the Deltapine brand in the U.S., as we remain on track for Deltapine to become the number one brand
share position.
We're also seeing better than expected progress in the rollout of our Climate Pro offering this season. At the beginning
of the year, we laid out three key priorities for the platform. And we see significant progress against those shown on
slide 14, as well as continued evolution of the platform in this emerging technology space to set up the focus on an
integrated platform. First, we've committed to stepping up on our investment, and we've expanded our organization to
enhance our offerings and expertise. We closed on our 640 Labs acquisition in December and our organization is
already incorporating their capabilities.
Second, we targeted to increase our active enrollment in the Climate platform. To-date, we've enrolled more than 75
million acres on the Climate platform, which is roughly 45% of the total planted corn and soybean acres in the U.S.
And with the current usage trends from those who use the platform weekly, we are tracking nicely towards our active
use target of 45 million acres.
And finally, I'm most excited about the runway to our premium offerings, with a significant step up in orders this past
month our premium services now exceeds 5 million acres, that's 2.5 times our initial target. While not financially
material in this early stage of adoption, it is clear proof that farmers value improved insights to allow them to reduce
known variability and improve overall productivity. Overall, this performance increases our confidence that Climate
will serve as the integrator in our vision of fully-integrated solutions.
I'm also pleased to highlight that our bio-Ag alliance with Novozymes is off to a great start. Since the close of the deal
in February of 2014, our partnership is stronger than ever. Integration of the existing business is occurring smoothly
and joint product and R&D teams are established and running well. In fact, roughly 2,000 microbial strains, which is an
increase of four times the prior season's quantity, have been sourced from our joint discovery efforts, fermented by
Novozymes and coded on corn and soybean seeds by Monsanto. These have now been planted across more than 50
sites in the U.S. In addition, our teams are running microbial field tests in over 50 countries in North and South
America, Europe, and Asia in our effort to discover new transformational microbial solutions for farmers.
In Ag Productivity, our third quarter was a significant one. Not only because of the Scott's agreement, but also because
we're seeing the volume shift to our branded business we expected, as we provide customers with more of our branded
products for their critical over-the-top applications. This puts us on track for a significant step up in the portion of our

business that's sold as a branded volume this year. Against that, we're seeing some incremental softening and price at
the retail level. So consistent with our strategy, we continue to adjust our pricing to maintain a premium over the
generics within our targeted ranges. Further, across the industry in the U.S. with the early and quick planting window in
some regions, coupled with the extended periods of rain in other areas, we've seen some decline in volumes for Q3. As
of today, growers patiently wait to make the critical over-the-top space in the fourth quarter.
As I step back and look at this year, it's evident that the power of a balanced portfolio coupled with differentiated
brands and technologies drives growth. This is allowing us to better withstand a challenging Ag backdrop, and backs
our confidence in our growth longer term. We fully expect the macro environment to recover and are well-positioned to
participate when it does. That said, as we develop our operational plans for next year, we are taking a clear-eyed view
and we expect that many of these headwinds will continue into fiscal year 2016.
As we proactively plan for the success of our long-term growth vision in light of these trends, we plan to continue to
optimize our operating cost structure. As we target the next level of savings, we plan to optimize processes, streamline
administrative costs, and use automation and data science to optimize the way we do work in the lab and in the field, in
products we deliver and in ways we deliver the experience. This is about using technology and smarter processes to
maintain our operational effectiveness, while continuing to invest for the long-term success of our new growth
platforms.
I'd like to close my operational update with our announcement to begin our preliminary investment in a dicamba
manufacturing facility. We are setting the stage for the industry's next leading integrated solution in weed control,
shown on slide 15. The Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System has a practical fit of more than 200 million acres when
looking across soybeans and cotton in the Americas, and has the potential to be even bigger if ultimately expanded to
include corn. Today's dicamba production capacity covers less than 20% of the expected opportunity. Bottom line, with
today's announcement, we're taking the initial step to ensure that growers have access to all elements of the Roundup
Ready Xtend Crop System.
Over the next decade, as the technology penetrates more of the 200 million-plus acre opportunity, this holds the
potential to further diversify our Ag Productivity segment and provide a source of growth longer-term. This is a prime
example of the integrated solutions we've been sharing in our vision for a new combined Ag company, and
demonstrates how we can more fully participate in the value we create and deliver an expected attractive return on
capital with the proposed investment.
In summary, our business accomplishments this year, in a more challenging Ag environment, are remarkable. They
highlight the strength of a strong portfolio and the importance of disciplined business plans. Importantly, as I look at
this year, we've delivered on many key milestones that we expect to propel our growth longer term. These milestones
along with licensing opportunities, disciplined spend and a solid capital allocation strategy backs our confidence in our
ability to deliver on our long-term target to more than double our 2014 ongoing earnings per share by 2019.
As Hugh indicated, the pursuit of this next evolution in agriculture is of utmost importance to us to meet the long-term
demands of sustainable food production, and I look forward to engaging in constructive discussions with Syngenta to
begin that journey, fully recognizing that the strong healthy base business we have in Monsanto today is vital to the
success of the new company.
With that, I will pass it to Pierre for the financial update. Pierre?
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone.
With the close of our third quarter, we have essentially met our full-year earnings per share guidance for the fiscal year
with the delivery of $5.75 of ongoing earnings per share on a year-to-date basis. This was accomplished through a
combination of leading innovation, a balanced portfolio and financial discipline in terms of how we manage our spend,
in how we capture the value from our portfolio, and in how we advance our capital structure.

So let's look at the highlights. In soybeans, we see continued strong performance of our Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the
U.S., topping off the tremendous growth from Intacta in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, we delivered more than
$200 million of gross profit growth in global soybean and improved our gross profit margins by four points.
In our global corn business, germplasm mix lift remained positive when excluding the effects of currency, and our
year-to-date gross profit margins were essentially flat at 63% versus the prior year, with a five-point improvement in
the third quarter. Our margins benefited from the change in our business model in the U.S. Channel brand and from
global germplasm mix lift, which now offset the decline in trait pricing in Brazil and the increases in corn COGS,
primarily in Brazil and Europe. On an absolute basis, the total corn gross profit declined by about $300 million, as the
benefit from germplasm price mix lift and the growth in our global branded and licensed share was more than offset by
the decreasing global acres, weaker foreign currencies and increased cost of goods.
In cotton, while the absolute gross profit is down, primarily from the declining acres in the U.S. and Australia, gross
profit margins improved by four points, driven by the adoption of new, higher-value cotton varieties in the U.S. and
increases in our licensed business in India. With the one-time benefit of $274 million related to the sale of an
intellectual property perpetual license to Scotts and an increase in the branded mix of glyphosate-based herbicides, our
year-to-date Ag Productivity gross profit shows an increase of about 2%. However, the decline in generic glyphosate
pricing has continued and we also saw some delays in glyphosate volumes in Q3. Further, our teams have remained
extremely disciplined on the spend front through effective management of variable spend and open positions.
Year to date, our total operating expense were flat with the prior year, effectively absorbing more than $100 million of
inflationary increases and a ramp in spend on our new Climate and biological platforms. This discipline has allowed us
to lift our year-to-date EBIT margin by nearly 1 point. Finally, we successfully completed our 6 billion accelerated
share buyback program this quarter, and our share count now stands at 469 million shares outstanding, a reduction of
more than 55 million shares since we initiated our new capital allocation strategy just a year ago.
With this strong year-to-date performance and the line of sight we have on our fourth quarter, we reconfirm our
full-year guidance for ongoing earnings per share at the low end of our original range of $5.75 to $6, as shown on slide
16. Practically, this means that our fourth quarter is now expected to be close to breakeven, as the benefit from
licensing transaction we had expected in Q4 in Seeds and Genomics came to fruition instead in Q3 Ag Productivity
with the signing of the agreement with Scotts. The amount of this benefit exceeded our placeholder estimate of about
$100 million into the fourth quarter and the increase is helping offset some additional market softness in corn, Roundup
and soybeans for the full year. At this juncture, we do not expect any additional material licensing agreements before
the end of the fiscal year.
Looking at our full-year guidance, we now anticipate that our gross profit for Seeds and Genomics will be essentially
flat year-over-year, but with roughly a 0.5 point in gross profit margin improvement. The evolution since our Q2 call is
twofold. First, our global corn gross profit is now expected to be down more than $200 million for the full year, as we
are not expecting Latin America to have as strong a start as originally anticipated and because planted acres across
Europe ended lower than we had expected, while their COGS increased. Second, global soybean business gross profit
while still expected to grow by more than $200 million for the full year is down slightly from prior estimates and it now
appears that U.S. acres will be modestly lower than expected.
For Ag Productivity, we now expect the gross profit to be down only slightly for the full year reflecting the benefit of
the Scotts transaction as an offset to the anticipated 15% to 17% decline in gross profit related to the softening of
generic glyphosate pricing and currency headwinds this fiscal year.
From a spend perspective, we still expect our total operating expenses inclusive of the new platform investments to be
down in a range of 3% to 5%, likely closer to the higher end of the range. We continue to manage variable and
discretionary spend very closely, which is typically higher in our fourth quarter, with currency and lower incentive also
driving lower expenses. Overall expense is expected to be a little less than half of the prior-year amounts and our net

27% to 28%, more in line with our third quarter effective tax rate.
From a free cash perspective, we continue to track to the lower end of our original guidance of $2 billion to $2.2
billion, as shown on slide 17. Our net income and working capital use remain consistent with our prior guidance, and
we have begun the execution of our plans to proactively manage our corn inventory for next year through the planning
of a smaller seed production plan this spring. This plan reduces long-term inventory risk and is an effective
management of our cash, but depending on the ultimate yield, it may translate into a one to two point margin penalty in
corn next year due to lower fixed cost absorption.
While planning for the next steps in building our Xtend platform with the potential meaningful capital investments of
our Luling plant for the production of dicamba, we remain very diligent in the management of our investing cash flows.
We expect the investment to exceed $1 billion over three to five years with a preliminary investment beginning now.
With our excellent conversion of earnings into cash, we continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times as a
standalone company. However, as of now, we have put our share repurchase program on hold as we continue to pursue
a Syngenta proposal. The successful combination with Syngenta at our proposed price and consideration mix would
translate into a higher leverage ratio for the near term. But to be clear, a solid investment grade credit rating and
continued access to the commercial paper market going forward is an important consideration for us. We expect
substantial cash proceeds from the proposed divestitures. And before finalizing the permanent financing of any
potential Syngenta transaction, we intend to consult with the rating agency.
Looking beyond the current year, as Brett mentioned, we are in the process of assembling our operational plan for
fiscal year 2016. And barring a significant shift in the U.S. growing season or the general macroeconomic environment,
we are planning for the continuation of several headwinds from this year. As we build the plan, we will prudently
consider currency, commodity prices, corn COGS, and generic glyphosate prices. This of course is expected to be
balanced against key growth drivers, including the annual corn germplasm refresh, Intacta expansion, Xtend launches,
continued licensing opportunities, and expected share growth in our seeds footprint globally.
Finally, the plans we are developing also consider the opportunity to potentially reduce and optimize our operating
expenses in the range of $300 million to $500 million over the course of the next two fiscal years. We are building in
options in these plans to allow us to adjust the level of savings with improved clarity on the potential cost synergies
from the proposed combination with Syngenta. The associated cost to implement these plans, timing of approvals and
execution will ultimately be contingent upon the outcome of our proposal to Syngenta. In the coming months and as we
get better clarity on the evolution of these macro factors and the critical northern hemisphere growing season, we will
provide more specifics on the outlook for fiscal year 2016.
Our five-year plan is a natural extension of the coming year's operational plan, and we remain confident in our
commitment to more than double our 2014 ongoing EPS by 2019, as shown on slide 18.
Our foundation and opportunity for gross profit growth remains strong, and the continuation of financial discipline both
in terms of estimated cost savings and capital structure backs our confidence in the long-term outlook. Continued share
repurchases, accretive acquisitions, and capital investment all have the potential to contribute to these commitments, in
addition to the power of innovation, the increasingly balanced portfolio, and the financial discipline that has led us to
our success to date. The delivery of key business milestones coupled with our financial discipline fuels our long-term
growth and provides a springboard for the vision Hugh outlined.
Our proposal to combine with Syngenta to create a new, even more innovative solution-oriented global Ag company
represents the forward thinking that has become our hallmark and looks beyond the near-term industry challenges to
see the opportunity. An opportunity we believe we are the best positioned to convert into value for our shareowners,
our customers, and broader society.
Thanks, and I'll turn the time back over to Laura for the Q&A.

Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you, Hugh, a question on your dicamba investment. It's a pretty sizable investment. You
talked about getting a reasonable return on investment. Is that return on investment based on just the chemistry itself, or
is that considering the roughly $6 fee you're going to get on Xtend? So I'm just wondering how big an opportunity
dicamba as a chemistry can be for you going forward.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the question, Don. I think it's going to be substantial. We said 200 million acres
plus. I wish we had it. Today, there's tremendous demand out there. As we run the math on this, we looked at both, we
looked at the return based on the plan alone and then also the platform opportunity when you enable 200 million-plus
acres. But, Pierre, maybe a few more quick words.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: And in both cases and exactly as Hugh mentioned, we've been looking at the picture
from both perspectives, so as a standalone chemical and as a system. And in both cases, we're delivering IRRs in the
double digits, so feeling pretty good. And obviously including the value of the traits, it's way higher. So we feel good
about the potential return from that project.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Good morning, thank you. Hugh, I think you made a comment that the window of
opportunity for a Syngenta deal will be measured in months, not years. Obviously, Syngenta has shown a reluctance to
engage to date. If you are unable to consummate a deal in coming months, can you speak to your capital allocation
thoughts in the wake of that scenario? In other words, would you resume repurchases or might there be other partners
of interest in crop protection? And also, have you considered a partnership with a crop protection producer as a means
to an end of achieving your integrated solution vision on digital Ag? Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Kevin, thanks for the question. So call me traditional, but I always think the business gets done
when people meet and they sit down across a table and try and work out a solution, and we've been singularly
unsuccessful in getting Syngenta to sit down and talk. We've seen the videos where they talk to themselves, but I'd love
to be able to engage in a conversation.
The months versus years, I've talked about this being a long game. We have a tremendous response from the Syngenta
shareowners and from combined shareowners between Monsanto and Syngenta, but I think the opportunity is
significant. And if unsuccessful, this isn't something we're going to turn into an epic struggle. We will look – we're
committed to bringing chemistry up onto those platforms, and we would look at other opportunities. Having said that –
either through partnerships or otherwise. Having said that, I get the feeling that we haven't really – we haven't been
around the first lap in this Syngenta discussion yet. But as I said in my prepared comments, there's mounting frustration

Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Good morning. I was hoping you could discuss the source of the incremental $300 million
to $500 million in cost cuts that you're targeting. And the follow-up question is if the environment for growers or FX
does improve, do you see a scenario where you would potentially pull back on some of those cost reduction targets?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for your questions. I'll maybe ask Brett to say a word on this. Our organization this
year has delivered in a tough environment with some significant cost controls. I hope to your point that the environment
improves, but as we look into 2016, our anticipation is 2016 in many ways looks similar to 2015. So the prudent thing
to do is plan accordingly and anticipate that we will be taking more disciplined actions. But, Brett, maybe a word on the
sources of those opportunities?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: As Hugh mentioned, the discipline that we demonstrated in 2015 has been a contributor to
our results in 2015. And with 2016 looking tough, we're planning the same way. And the areas that I mentioned that
we're looking at are process optimization, administrative cost, and I think you can bucket this together also say in
leveraging data science as we learn more about it to drive productivity of our operations in the labs and in the fields and
in the marketplace. And those process improvements and optimization all help us reduce cost and basically make us
more efficient at delivering products and services to our customers, and that's where we'll be focused.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with the question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi, good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Hi. Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: The Scotts Miracle Gro transaction seemed like a one-time benefit, so why are you including that
in your ongoing EPS guidance?
And then, secondly, Pierre, last quarter you explained that the fourth quarter EPS would be 15% to 20% of second half
earnings, and now fourth quarter is expected to be breakeven. So what changed in the last three months?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So, P.J., and this is actually both questions are related. And it's really looking into what
we said at the end of the second quarter was we are contemplating a number of licensing opportunities, in both Seeds
and Genomics and Ag Productivity actually and what we've seen is the first one to materialize actually quicker than
what we anticipated was the Scotts transaction, and that's really part of our business model. We've always been really
pursuing those opportunities, and we do believe there are further opportunities down the road that we're going to be

chasing. So based on where we are today and as I mentioned during the prepared remark, we don't see any of those
opportunities translating into the fourth quarter. However, as I said, we still see potential for some of those, happening
in 2016 and maybe beyond that. So this is the licensing part of the question.
Regarding – and obviously this has an impact on the quarter-to-quarter because you see a benefit in Q3, and as we
mentioned, we had a placeholder of more than $100 million in Q4 that now disappears. And we said as well that the
market condition, and especially the beginning of the season in South America, what we hear from Argentina right now
is that acres are going to be down. So we want to be realistic about how we think about the fourth quarter, and this is
really how we came to this revised guidance.

Our next question comes from line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thanks very much. Was there a revenue benefit to Ag Productivity from the Scotts deal?
And if there was, how much was it? And secondly, if you spend $1 billion to expand dicamba capacity, how many
gallons do you get for $1 billion?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So I'll take the first part of the question regarding the Scotts transaction. So, there was
definitely a benefit in terms of the revenue in Ag Productivity, and this is very close actually to the $274 million
recorded in terms of gross profit. I don't have the exact number, but these are fairly close to each other.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: And then, Jeff, the same question on dicamba, so we said it would be three to five year
investment stream, so the front end of this will be the thin end as we do engineering and early specking. The markets,
so 20% Brett? 30%?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: It will be in that range. And part of this is the investment in the basic infrastructure to
prepare for the development. So you could add additional capacity for far less cost after the initial installation is put in
place. You could add another train.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: But somewhere in the 20% to 30% range would be – of future market demand because the
market today is quite small. But in classic Monsanto fashion, we'll be creating that market and then supplying it. But
that would be a rough guideline.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Hugh, on corn gross profit, given the pressure on gross margins next year from lower acres
or production, can you still – is it possible to grow corn gross profit next year given the pressure on margin?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We are, and Pierre mentioned this in terms of production and we've seen acres skinny-ing
down in Latin America so the early read there is acres are going to be crimped. We're anticipating – you look at the
challenges this year in corn, so we're anticipating that next year will be a tighter market, and we are more blessed
within this that we've got a balanced portfolio. So what we're losing in corn, we're seeing a really nice uptick in beans.

But Brett, maybe a little bit on how you see margin and the growth opportunities next year.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think the really good news in this in corn is, as I mentioned, our portfolio is as strong as
it's ever been. We continue to see farmers migrating to our best hybrids, in other words, our newest hybrids, which
gives us the opportunity to continue to get portfolio mix lift from our germplasm. And we believe that that's going to
continue. We will continue to face the headwinds of acres, and when we face the headwinds of acres and the softness
that Pierre mentioned in South America, that translates into an impact in COGS because it lowers our production and
the absorption of our fixed costs. So, we feel really good about our position going into 2016, albeit it's going to be a
challenging market, not unlike what 2015 was. And that's going to have an impact on margins, and we'll be a lot more
clear on that as we start to finalize projections for 2016.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect, thank you. Regarding your Channel brand in seeds growth initiative, can
you update us on the potential margin improvement here and the best way to think about this geographically; i.e., are
there any U.S. regional limitations? And also, is the portfolio refresh here done at the same rate as DEKALB? Thank
you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So nice. So, Chris, from an operational point of view, we've seen some really good
improvements in the Channel piece. I'm not sure – we've signed service to growers and operationally we're better, I
don't know if that converts yet into a margin uptick, Brett.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think the primary focus with the change that we made in Channel was change in the
relationship and experience with the customer to provide better service and real-time management of inventories in
season. So and that's gone really well. We feel good about how we've made that transition. It really wasn't intended to
be a significant margin improvement. There could be a little bit as we continue to improve our overall service there. To
your other part of your question, do we refresh the Channel brand like we do DEKALB, each of those decisions are
made independently, but yes, we do refresh the Channel brand, and we do bring new products into that portfolio every
year, just like we do in DEKALB, and those metrics would be very similar between those two brands.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: And again, talking about how you are giving it months to try to have a Syngenta deal done,
what has to happen or is it a possibility that you could look at an unsolicited offer that you would take directly to
Syngenta shareholders? How long would have to wait to have it happen? And what would have to happen for that to be
a suitable outcome?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I think there are miles in the journey before we get to that. I think the first step in this, and I'm
very encouraged by the early progress, but the first step in this is direct engagement with their shareowners and
explaining, as I have done this morning, the vision that we see for this. There has been a lot of talk around these

integrated solutions. There's not been much success historically, and I think the more we talk about the difference
between talking and doing, the more interest there is in the vision and the strategy. So I think for us, the near term is the
continued outreach to their shareowners and the continued outreach to Syngenta to encourage them to sit down and do
this face-to-face rather than through YouTube and leaked documents. So I'm hoping that we get to a point where we're
actually sitting and talking. Your path is always a potential, but my preference would be a friendly deal with the two

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Thank you. When you talk about additional upfront licensing fees potentially in 2016, is this
more Xtend dicamba-related or are there other opportunities on Roundup equal to the size of the Scotts deal you just
did?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: John, thanks for the question. We've been doing this for years. We talked very early on about
market architecture and always expanding our licensing opportunity. The one that's front and center and it's in field
trials this year that I would – and Pierre kind of alluded to this in his comments, it's corn rootworm III. So it's
next-generation corn rootworm control, we have it in collaborator trials. They'll be doing root digs in the next few
weeks when we can get out of the rain and see ground drying out. So that's one that I'd probably put front and foremost.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thanks very much. On the dicamba investment, I am curious in the interim before your
own facility starts, how you would source that given I think you're going to use a new formulation to reduce the
volatilization. And will it be a branded product and managed in the same manner that you manage Roundup?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: The short answer would be yes. But, Brett, maybe just a little bit of flavor around the – we've
done a lot of work in formulations. We're encouraged there and also third-party supplies and collaborators.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, so the way we're looking at this, Bob, is we're, if you think about this in stages,
getting the products into the marketplace and there's enough dicamba out there that already supplies about 20% of the
market, and then – and we are sourcing some of that. You may recall some months ago we made the announcement of
an investment at our Muscatine facility in a formulation plant where, yes, we are making our own branded product that
we're going to sell in the marketplace, and it is an advanced formulation that brings benefit to the farmer. So we'll do
that from sourced material in the near term, and we'll continue to do that until we build our own capacity and bring that
online. But it'll – along the way, we'll continue to use some of those sources that are out there that already have
dicamba. So it'll be a combination of all of those.

Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks. I might have missed this because I had to hop off for a second, but did you
talk at all about any progress update on getting the Chinese approval for Xtend?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: We did not. We've seen nice progress in Europe. And China, as is traditionally the case, China
will be the last piece of this process to come through, but no new news. Our experience has been China is usually the
last piece of this, but China has generally been pretty predictable, and they need beans. So we feel pretty optimistic, but
no news, Vincent.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Is there a go or no-go date by which you need approval in order to be confident for
next year?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I wouldn't necessarily think of it as a go or no-go date. We're producing seed this year with
the anticipation that we will be in the market in 2016, so I guess I would call that already a go. As we get closer to 2016
with the anticipated approval out of China, we'll make those decisions on how we manage that next year. But that will
be decisions that will be made in conjunction with our grower customers and the rest of the industry sitting down
working together on this and decide what we do. But at this point, our focus is totally on the China approval. We've
provided them all the information necessary to make the decision, so we'll stay focused on driving that decision so that
we don't have to address the other side of it.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Good morning. So a couple of quarters back I asked you about your confidence broadly in
getting paid in Argentina. And since then most of the news flow is the same as always, just chaotic and negative. And
you mentioned the POD and that 70% of farmers are paying up front. My question is, do you think we're headed
towards a model where we pay up front across Brazil and Argentina? And are you thinking any differently about the
saved seed issue in soy in Argentina, given what the government has been saying?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Mark, thanks for the questions. I think your summary on the news flow looks the same as
always, it's chaotic. I think it's just life in Argentina. When you go down there and you talk to growers, there's
tremendous enthusiasm and a pent-up demand for these technologies and the other ones that are coming down the pike,
so you have to climb above the noise and look at the macro environment. And I think the evidence – and your point is
exactly right. The evidence is we're seeing growers morph more and more towards buying new bags, but the backstop
of POD continues to be important. Brett, you've been looking at this the last few weeks.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think I would just remind you to think about the early months and years when we put this
system in place in Brazil. It was pretty noisy there too.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, true.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: And I think we're hearing a lot of the same thing out of Argentina. But there's, as Hugh
mentioned, tremendous interest in the product. And what we've seen in Brazil, and I'm not suggesting it will be an exact
carbon copy in Argentina, but I think it'll be the right flavor. As POD got in place, farmers became more comfortable
buying new seed every year because they see the value. They see the value in high-quality planting seed. And when
they're getting better yields and they're buying better seed, they put better seed treatments on, et cetera, et cetera. So I
think we'll see the same thing over time in Argentina. The POD system is clearly an important backstop though that
makes sure we have that in place. And it will be noisy, but we're still confident that it will move in the right direction.

that, as you look at how that product offering ramps, how do you see the scale up in ramping current and pricing
coming back? Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So I'll ask Brett to give you a little bit of granular detail. Let me just start by saying we're
delighted with the progress. It isn't financially material yet, but it does prove out the system, and the link to my earlier
comments on Syngenta, what we're seeing this year with some the nitrogen, it's still early. But what we're seeing with
some of the nitrogen advisor work I think bridges beautifully into bringing chemistry up onto that acre. So what we do
in nitrogen, there's the opportunity of doing in the future with chemistry and given the farmer much better advice on
when and how he applies chemistry. So early days, Brett, but some great numbers on the board.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: We're really excited about it. If you look at the early days of the Climate Pro, which were
the paid acres this year, I'd say it was driven by the nitrogen model, which gave farmers lots of insights, particularly in
some areas this year that were difficult with the early planting season and lots of rain, et cetera, in some areas. So that
played very well. And then the shift which was just as exciting is how much interest there was in the field health
advisor this year, which was the other big app that we had available on that paid system this year. And that one really
gets at what Hugh was describing as thinking about field health in the field, helping farmers make the decisions and
raising the crop through the rest of the year. It's really impressive to see the interest from farmers. It confirms again that
farmers understand intuitively they have this variability in the field and they believe that it can be addressed, and
they're willing to work with us to figure out how to do that. So, it's an exciting start with that platform.

Our next question will come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Rory Blake>: Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. This is actually Rory Blake in for Frank Mitsch. I just
had a couple of quick ones. On the dicamba side, I thought that we were still waiting for regulatory approval on the
in-crop use. Is there any update there? And then also, just changing gears a little on the crop – on the Climate
Corporation side, obviously a nice number on the free offering, a nice number on the premium offering. How should
we think about the adoption rate? And is there any change in how we are thinking about pricing for it? Thanks again,
guys.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I'm sorry. On the second piece, adoption rate on what, sorry?
<Q - Rory Blake>: The adoption rate on the Pro side and also the pricing of it.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Okay.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think there are two pieces in there. On the dicamba side, I believe you're referring to the
chemistry over the top...
<Q - Rory Blake>: Right.

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: ...label, and that is work in process and we're optimistic on that one. We put cotton in the
marketplace this year because we had three herbicide tolerances there where the farmer could use two of them this year,
and that's what we used to set the tone on pricing, but we feel really good with our U.S. approach on the over the top
for dicamba.
The other piece on Climate Pro, there are two things. I think I'm still in the camp that says the most important thing is
to develop the robust platform for data science for farmers. And it's less about how much profitability we can get in the
early years and how much pricing there is in the early years. It's about getting farmers established on a platform that
helps them improve the decision-making both before planting, at planting, and throughout raising the crop. And that's
going to continue to be our focus. Obviously, farmers are demonstrating they see value in it and they are paying for
those services this year. And we'll continue to look at the value that we bring and price into that, but the primary focus
in the next couple years will be continuing to expand that platform.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I think that platform play data becomes the glue that holds the chemistry, the seed, and the
biotech together, and we are uniquely positioned in that. And it reminds me so much of the early days of skepticism in
biotech and then skepticism on linking biotech and breeding and even the skepticism when we changed platforms with
2s and with SmartStax. So we're going to have to demonstrate that. And I would expect that in demonstrating that we
can bring these technologies together, we get the opportunity one more time to license that to the rest of the chemical
industry.
<Q - Rory Blake>: Thanks again, guys.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the question.
<A - Laura J. Meyer>: Christine, this is Laura. To be mindful of the time, we'll take one more question before we pass
it to Hugh for the close.

Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Michael L. Piken>: Yeah, hi. I was just wondering if you could just give us a little more color on some of the
restructuring in terms of some of the buckets that you anticipate things coming from. And specifically, are you planning
to cut R&D as well or is it more OpEx spending? Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: It's much more focused, and Brett mentioned, went through some of this earlier, but it's much
more on driving efficiency and the use of new technologies, and then R&D this year, we quietly retooled a big piece of
breeding, and we think that our breeding programs will be faster, will yield more and cost less. So we actually use that
as a surrogate as we look at other opportunities across the company. But as the application of data science in a number
of fields that we think we can streamline and get better and faster.

Thank you. Mr. Grant, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
Hugh M. Grant
So thanks. Thank you very much and thanks, we've stayed a little bit long today. So thanks for your patience and your
support. I guess, in summary, I'd say our business and our pipeline are stronger than they have ever been and yet – and
this is classic Monsanto, we continue to challenge ourselves to advance new solutions and provide an even more robust
set of tools for farmers around the globe regardless of their size. So with the proposal that I started talking about today,

our proposal to combine with Syngenta, we are looking beyond the short-term macro challenges that face agriculture to
once again drive the next evolution.
Many in the industry have theorized, there has been a lot of talk about integrated strategies, but I think, as I said earlier,
there's a difference between talking and doing. And we believe we're best positioned for a strong seed footprint and our
leading digital Ag platform to make this a reality providing us with an opportunity to be even stronger partner to
growers. So we simply have a proven track record that demands consideration to be the partner of choice and leading
this evolution, and we appreciate the continued support of the respective owners in driving that dialogue and driving
that engagement. So I wanted to conclude by thanking you for joining us on the call today. Thanks very much.
