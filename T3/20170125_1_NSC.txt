Thank you, Devon, and good morning. Before we begin today's call, I would like to mention a few items. The slides of
the presenters are available on our website at norfolksouthern.com in the Investor section, along with our non-GAAP
reconciliations. Additionally, transcripts and downloads of today's call will be posted on our website.
During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements which are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties and may differ materially from our actual results. Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed
with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties we view as most important.
Now, it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.
James A. Squires
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are
NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial
Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results summarized on slide four, are a testament to the dedication of our employees.
In 2016 their efforts were instrumental in the achievement of a record operating ratio for Norfolk Southern, as well as
in meeting and exceeding our other financial and operational goals even in a tough economic climate.
We have stayed focused on our core mission of safety, service and productivity while also driving positive changes
throughout our organization. The significant progress we achieved in 2016 will power Norfolk Southern's success in
delivering shareholder value both in the near and the long-term.
For the fourth quarter, our disciplined cost focus and successful initiatives to enhance efficiency, drove a 69.4%
operating ratio, yielding a 510 basis point or 7% improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Even if you
exclude last year's restructuring costs, the operating ratio improved by 310 basis points.
Earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.42, up 18% compared to the prior year period, as operating expenses
came in 8% lower relative to a 1% decline in revenue.
For the full year, we achieved a record 68.9% operating ratio, which was 370 basis points or 5% better than 2015.
Earnings per share increased 10% to $5.62.
In recognition of these results as well as the confidence we have in our strategy, the board approved a $0.02 per share,
or 3% dividend increase effective with our first quarter 2017 dividend payment.
Slide five highlights important components of our success in 2016. Our measure of network performance, the
composite service metric increased to above 80% for the year versus 72% in 2015. We achieved this improved
performance while accomplishing strategic network and organizational changes, such as the line and yard
rationalizations that Mike described on our last call, as well as divisional and regional consolidations, the
reorganization of our Pocahontas Land Corporation subsidiary and proactive management of capital spending.
Asset utilization improved as we rationalized our locomotive fleet, improved the efficiency of our freight cars and
increased utilization of other roadway assets. Simultaneously, we reduced our average employee count for the year by
7%, exceeding the 3% decline in carloads. And we also reduced overtime by 38%.
In total, these initiatives generated $250 million of productivity savings for the year. We continue to invest in the health
of the railroad adapting to the economic environment by judiciously investing $1.9 billion in capital, well below our
initial $2.1 billion plan.
Over a year-ago, we anticipated that Norfolk Southern would achieve a sub 70% operating ratio for 2016 and our team
delivered, producing a record 68.9% OR. Likewise, we are committed to delivering on our longer-term targets and I'll
update you on our strategic plan after Alan, Mike and Marta fill you in on the fourth quarter results. Alan?

Alan H. Shaw
Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. On slide seven, I'll begin with an
overview of our fourth quarter. Revenue of $2.5 billion was down 1% versus fourth quarter 2015. Due to strong
intermodal growth, our year-over-year volume grew for the first time this year in the fourth quarter. Both intermodal
and coal revenue and volume increased sequentially over the third quarter.
The Triple Crown restructuring continued to impact year-over-year comparisons, though to a lesser extent in the fourth
quarter, an increase in export coal tonnage softens the decline in coal volume and revenue. So utility volumes were
negatively impacted by continued high stockpile levels.
Merchandise revenue was affected by the ongoing decline of crude oil volume. Overall revenue per unit declined 3% in
the fourth quarter as positive pricing was offset by mix associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal
volume. Revenue per unit, excluding fuel, increased for both merchandise and intermodal, excluding Triple Crown.
Our merchandise revenue, on slide eight, declined 1% to $1.5 billion as a result of a 3% decline in volume. Metals and
construction volume benefited from increased steel shipments. Agriculture shipments grew due to increased soybean
export and corn volumes. Declines in our chemicals market were driven by lower crude oil volume.
Automotive volume was negatively impacted by the previously announced market share loss and flat year-over-year
U.S. vehicle production in the fourth quarter. Paper and forest products volumes declined as a result of increased truck
competition. Merchandise revenue per unit increased 2%, excluding fuel, reflecting some pricing gains.
Intermodal revenue, as shown on slide nine, increased 4% versus last year to $583 million, with a 7% increase in
volume. Excluding the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring, intermodal volume and revenue were both up 10%.
Improved service and increased consumer spending resulted in a 10% increase in our domestic intermodal volume
versus a soft fourth quarter 2015. Market share gains and increase import and export shipments via East Coast ports
drove an 8% increase in international volume. Despite rate pressure from the trucking industry, intermodal revenue per
unit excluding Triple Crown and fuel increased 1% in the fourth quarter.
Coal revenue declined 7% to $403 million in the fourth quarter with an overall 4% volume decline versus last year.
Coal, revenue and volume increased sequentially for the second quarter in a row, primarily driven by fourth quarter
export gains. We handled 16.9 million utility tons in the fourth quarter in line with our recent guidance of slightly
below 17 million tons, but 10% below fourth quarter 2015 volumes, due to continued stockpile overhang from the mild
2015, 2016 winter. We handled 4.7 million export tons in the fourth quarter, as demand for U.S. coals improved amid
tightening international supply and greatly increased seaborne pricing.
Coal revenue per unit, excluding fuel, declined 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year with positive price
improvement offset by negative mix related to reduced volume to our longer haul southern utilities and increased
export volume via Baltimore. Revenue per unit was up sequentially versus the third quarter.
On slide 11, our full year 2016 revenue of $9.9 billion was down 6% versus the prior year with a 3% decline in volume
and a 3% decrease in revenue per unit. Utility coal volume and revenue decreased sharply due to the impacts of mild
winter weather in late 2015 and early 2016, and low natural gas prices which contributed to the buildup of stockpiles.
These factors, coupled with global oversupply and weak seaborne coal prices in the export market led to an 18%
decline in coal revenue.
Fuel surcharge losses of $241 million were driven by depressed oil prices. Quarterly declines lessened sequentially
throughout the year as we lapped higher oil prices in 2015. And we anticipate that the recent rise in oil and diesel prices
will lead to increased fuel surcharge revenue in 2017.
The mid-November 2015 restructuring of our Triple Crown subsidiary also reduced revenue while improving our
efficiency and productivity. Our 2016 pricing gains were offset by the negative mix impact of decreased coal volume
and increased international – intermodal volume producing a 1% decline in revenue per unit less fuel.

Overall, 2016 was challenging for many of the markets we serve with depressed energy prices, weaker than anticipated
economic growth, elevated inventory levels and increased truck capacity, all impacting our top-line performance.
Although we saw stabilization as the second half progressed leading to volume growth in the fourth quarter.
Recent improvements in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as overall expectations for a stronger 2017
economic environment provide upside potential for the year ahead. Within intermodal, a strong service product will
continue to enable highway conversions and drive organic growth. We expect intermodal volumes and RPU to benefit
from tightening capacity within the trucking market due to improved demand and increased regulation, particularly,
later in the year.
We expect weather related normalization within utility coal as well as the market share gain to generate between 17
million tons and 19 million tons of utility coal per quarter in 2017. Our guidance is contingent upon normal weather
conditions and natural gas prices consistent with the current forward curve.
Export coal tonnage growth will be driven by tightening international coal supply and improved seaborne pricing,
which should support incremental production.
We expect to handle 3.5 million to 4.5 million export tons on a quarterly basis with a significant amount of volatility as
evidenced by the benchmark price. Merchandise volume is predicted to be relatively flat in 2017.
Pipeline development will negatively impact crude oil and natural gas liquids shipments. Automotive volume will be
affected by extended retooling efforts at several NS served assembly plants and an expected 3% decline in U.S. vehicle
production in 2017. Improving construction activity will benefit lumber, steel, cement and other housing related
commodities.
As in 2016, we will focus intensely on our pricing efforts. The solid pricing improvement seen over the past year will
benefit our 2017 revenue. And we're confident in our ability to leverage the value of our service product to attain
pricing in excess of rail inflation.
We are well-positioned for growth and have the flexibility to align resources and service capabilities with demand. We
are steadfast in our commitment to meet evolving customer expectations which supports long-term growth and
shareholder value.
I will now turn the presentation over to Mike for a discussion of our operational performance.
Michael Joseph Wheeler
Thank you, Alan and good morning to our listeners. Our charge for 2016 was to provide a high level service product
and aggressively pursue cost-cutting initiatives to drive productivity and efficiency.
We accomplished this, as evidenced by 2016 being the first year on record that we had both a service composite above
80% and an operating ratio below 70%. And we believe we are well-positioned to leverage this momentum in 2017.
As shown on slide 14, there were significant milestones achieved in 2016 that were key drivers of our success. The
efforts towards driving fuel efficiency, train length and locomotive productivity all helped to drive a record operating
ratio. We accomplished this, thanks to the hard work of our employees in executing our strategic plan.
Moving to safety on slide 15, while our injury ratio slightly increased in 2016 as compared to last year, our train
accident rate improved 19%. And as previously noted, 2016 was our best year since the Conrail consolidation. Even
more encouraging, this improvement was across the board in transportation, engineering and mechanical.
Turning to service on slide 16. You see we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service
composite, train speed and terminal dwell. While dwell was higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period
last year, this was a result of an extended holiday shutdown due to the majority of our customers observing December
26 as a holiday. This allowed us to control costs without affecting customer service, which was a charge we

successfully executed on for the entire year.
Now on slide 17, our productivity initiatives coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level
continued to result in significant productivity savings. For the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period last year,
we achieved a reduction in crew starts even with an increase in volume, which was driven in part by leveraging the
capacity on our current trains.
We also continued to improve on our overtime and train length, although recrews were affected by an earlier start to
winter weather. Together this resulted in continued improvement in employee productivity. For the full year 2016, we
achieved our highest average train length on record, which also aided a record fuel efficiency. Even with this
continuous improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly as high as our record levels of 2012 and 2013.
In all, we had a very successful year and we are confident in our ability to continue this momentum in 2017.
I now will turn it over to Marta to cover the financials.
Marta R. Stewart
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued efforts on cost
control and execution of strategic initiatives. Let's take a look at the financial details, starting with operating results on
slide 19.
While revenues were down slightly, operating expenses declined by $147 million or 8%, resulting in a 69.4 operating
ratio for the quarter, a 510 basis point improvement over last year's fourth quarter. As you'll recall, the 2015 quarter
included $49 million of restructuring costs, which added 200 basis points to the OR.
Slide 20 shows the expense reductions by income statement line item, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of
year-over-year reductions in overall operating expenses.
Now let's take a closer look at the components. Slide 21 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $41
million, or 9% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $21 million in lower Triple Crown costs
associated with the curtailment of those operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Next were $12 million of lower transportation and engineering related purchased service costs. Finally, equipment rents
decreased by $3 million, notwithstanding the 2% increase in traffic volume.
Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefits, which overall declined by $40
million or 6%. Reduced employment levels, down over 2,300 employees versus 2015, along with lower overtime
resulted in $42 million of year-over-year savings.
In addition, we lapped the lump sum payment of $13 million and had $10 million of lower pension expense. These
items were partially offset by increases in bonus accruals of $21 million, wage inflation of $16 million and health and
welfare rate increases of $12 million.
The bonus variance was due to the fact that we had reversals of accruals in last year's fourth quarter. The wage and
health and welfare inflationary increases were similar to the run rates experienced in the third quarter.
As we look to 2017, we expect that total head count will remain steady despite the anticipated increases in volumes that
Alan described. However, higher health and welfare rates, particularly in our unionized programs, will result in
approximately $65 million of additional expense. And as a result, we expect all-in wage and medical cost inflation of
about 5% versus the 3.5% we guided to and experienced in 2016.
Slide 23 details our materials and other category, which decreased $38 million or 15%. Lower usage of locomotive and
engineering materials totaled $16 million and travel costs were down by $6 million.

Next is fuel expense, as shown on slide 24. Mike described how we improved fuel efficiency, and you can see that
consumption declined by 6% despite the 2% increase in traffic volume. The improvement in efficiency completely
offset the 8% increase in diesel fuel price versus the fourth quarter of 2015.
Moving on to income taxes on slide 25. The effective rate for the quarter was 35.1% versus the 31.1% in the fourth
quarter of 2015. The effective rate was slightly below the forecasted 36% due to the effects of stock-based
compensation. For 2017, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 37%.
Summarizing our fourth quarter earnings on slide 26, net income was $416 million, up 15% versus 2015, and diluted
earnings per share were $1.42, up 18%. Restructuring costs affected 2015's net income by $31 million and EPS by
$0.10.
Full year results are shown on slide 27. While revenues were 6% lower than 2015, our focus on cost control and
improving asset utilization allowed us to lower expenses by 11%. The resulting income from railway operations of $3.1
billion was a 7% improvement and, as Jim noted, led to a record full year operating ratio of 68.9. Earnings per share
were $5.62, an increase of 10% over the prior year.
Slide 28 depicts our full year cash flows. Cash from operations totaled $3 billion, amply covering capital spending and
generating $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Returns to shareholders in 2016 totaled $1.5 billion, through $700 million of
dividends and $800 million in share repurchases.
As Jim noted, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.61 a share, a 3% increase. On stock
repurchases, we plan currently to continue at about a $200 million per-quarter run rate in 2017.
Moving on to this year's capital budget on slide 29. We project total spending of $1.9 billion, roughly even with 2016.
This budget is supportive of the growth areas Alan described while continuing to invest in our core assets. We have
expansions planned at various terminals and infrastructure targeted at increasing capacity on our network to provide
high service levels to support long-term growth.
As you can see from the chart on the slide, the majority of our spending is on roadway. And while at a dollar amount
similar to the past few years, those dollars are stretching further in terms of units due to efficiency in our engineering
forces. Locomotive capital includes new units, as well as the conversion of locomotives from DC to AC power.
Thanks for your attention and I'll turn the program back to Jim.
James A. Squires
Now, as promised, an update on our five-year strategic plan, which I conveyed in detail on last January's earnings call.
You'll recognize slide 31, which is the summary page of financial targets that I shared with you at that time. The
employees of Norfolk Southern more than delivered on the 2016 targets. Additionally, we are on track to reach our
2020 targets, including pricing above rail inflation, a sub-65 operating ratio and double-digit compound annual growth
in earnings per share.
2016 demonstrated our flexibility as we adapted our approach to capital spending to the evolving business
environment. The same proactive approach will allow us to manage our capital spending to 17% of revenue, post the
2018 positive train control installation.
Throughout, we will return significant capital to our shareholders by targeting a 33% dividend payout ratio, and we'll
continue to employ share repurchases as a significant component of our capital allocation strategy.
Our management's adaptability illustrated by our capital program applies to all aspects of the railroad. Volumes for NS
and the industry did not develop for 2016 as expected, particularly in the energy markets. As a result, we were swift in
taking actions to streamline operations and enhance service, bolstering our productivity and supporting growth in
certain opportune markets. With this nimbleness and strong momentum, we are well-positioned to guide Norfolk
Southern into the future. So with that in mind, I'll update you on key aspects of our long-range plan.

Slide 33 highlights our expectations for each of our major revenue groups. Overall, merchandise is anticipated to track
the economy generally in line with GDP. The forecast for intermodal growth is about 4% on a compound annual basis
as our strong service product positions us for growth. Coal is projected to increase in 2017 from our 2016 base as
inventories and weather normalize, coupled with higher natural gas prices. It is then expected to decrease slightly from
2017 levels, resulting in a modest 1% increase on a compound annual basis over the combined period.
Slide 34 highlights some of the strategies that we have in place to support key resource flexibility as volumes develop.
We will continue to proactively manage our workforce to right-size our resources as demand evolves. We have
established minimum employee levels at certain core locations where it has been more difficult to recruit new hires in
the past. In addition, we have an active hiring model that we are continuing to enhance.
On the locomotive side, we continue to invest in the reliability of our fleet. We will take receipt of 50 new locomotives
beginning in late February with the majority of them coming online in March and April. In addition, our DC-AC
rebuild program significantly accelerates in 2017.
Now, moving on to slide 35 and expenses, we will build on 2016's productivity initiatives by, for example,
rationalizing our locomotive fleet by increasing our reliance on AC units; by increasing utilization and efficiency of our
freight cars through a more homogeneous and flexible fleet composition and utilizing technology to optimize
distribution of empties; by continuing our line rationalization initiatives; and by improving fuel efficiency.
Last year, we provided a framework for our overall $650 million five-year plan productivity target, as reflected on slide
36. With $250 million of productivity savings achieved in 2016 and $100 million targeted for 2017, I remain fully
confident in our ability to deliver on our longer term productivity objectives.
At the beginning of our journey, we designed an approach that would be dynamic and flexible and 2016 certainly put
that to the test. Our achievement of $250 million in productivity in 2016 clearly demonstrated that we would take the
measures necessary to achieve that goal, creating new paths to savings when needed. We'll apply that same flexibility
over the next four years in order to align resources with demand, achieve $650 million in productivity savings, provide
quality service and drive shareholder value.
Wrapping up on slide 37, at Norfolk Southern we know that the key to our success is world-class service that brings
value to our customers, thereby supporting profitable growth that leverages our improving cost structure, culminating
in exceptional returns to our shareholders.
Thank you for your attention, and with that we'll now open the line for Q&A.

from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi Investment Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey, great, thanks and good morning. Wanted to touch base a little bit on the operating ratio
as you look out for 2017, so Jim you just kind of ran through some of the productivity opportunities that you see going
forward and what you think that you can achieve in 2017. I just want to get a sense of maybe how that translates to an
OR. You made nice progress this year. Should we expect similar type of stair-step progress in 2017? Or any color
would be helpful.
<A - James A. Squires>: Good morning, Chris and thank you for your question. Before I answer it, I want to again
emphasize how much we appreciate the contributions of our employees in 2016 to our outstanding performance. We
are the efforts of our employees and we certainly recognize that.

Now, in 2016 we generated a record operating ratio. This morning, we outlined and reaffirmed our plan to achieve a
sub-65% operating ratio by 2020. We expect to make progress toward that goal each year between now and then. And
we expect to produce an operating ratio in 2017 below 2016's operating ratio.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. So improvement, but necessarily ready to quantify at this point?
<A - James A. Squires>: Correct.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up. Just when I think about, sort of, the competitive
environment in the Eastern half of the United States, we've heard over the course of the last couple of weeks of a
couple of sort of contracts moving back and forth, and I think there's some regular jockeying of market share between
railroads and also with the trucks, but wonder you get a sense of maybe how you view the competitive dynamic
entering 2017? We haven't had a lot of volume growth, but volume is coming back. Do you see this changing or is this
sort of normal or is it a little bit more hyped?
<A - James A. Squires>: Certainly, we operate in a competitive environment, we face modal competition across the
spectrum of our volumes. Let me turn it over to Alan for some more specific commentary on the environment today.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah, Chris, I would suggest that in kind of the any share shifts that you've seen recently are not
unusual. Ultimately, our firm goal is to provide a service product that allows us to compete for business and one that
our customer's value which will allow us to continue our efforts to move business from the highway to rail. As we saw
markets stabilize in the second half of the year, we saw growth in the fourth quarter. And we expect that to continue in
the 2017.

brewing in the Eastern rails over the last couple of weeks. I know you guys can't comment probably directly, but if you
look at what occurred at Canadian Pacific under the previous managed team, there were a number of significant
inefficiencies taken out of the system. Things like the number of crew changes on certain routes, reductions in the
number of pump yards and terminals. Just trying to understand how much of an opportunity that is for Norfolk today,
bearing in mind that you've already achieved so much in terms of productivity, and whether there is maybe some scope
to accelerate any of that to realize your OR targets even sooner? Thanks.
<A - James A. Squires>: Good morning. We don't comment on market rumors. We are single-mindedly focused on
driving shareholder value through successful execution of our strategic plan which, as you know, does include
significant additional productivity improvements. Having achieved $250 million in productivity in 2016, we've set a
goal of $100 million in productivity for 2017. We believe that number is achievable, realistic and sustainable and will
allow us to continue providing an excellent level of customer service. If we discover additional productivity
opportunities we will certainly go after them.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: Okay. Well, I thought I'd try to ask that question anyway, so I appreciate the answer. Let me
ask you one maybe, you can answer a little bit more directly is related to your comments about being more dynamic
and flexible, I maybe wrong, but I feel like you're really talking about maybe making the cost structure a little bit more
dynamic and flexible, so you can flex down and flex up as volumes change. First of all, is that correct? And second of
all, I guess would that imply that essentially your cost structure is in fact becoming more variable, which may impact
perspective incremental margins and where do you think those incremental margins could go under this maybe new
dynamic and flexible cost structure? Thank you.

<A - James A. Squires>: We certainly demonstrated our flexibility and adaptability in changing business conditions in
2016 by producing record results despite some headwinds from the economy. And we will continue to adhere to that
very flexible and adaptable approach going forward, particularly in our use of our resources. Let me turn it over to
Mike to talk about some of the resource strategies we have in place for 2017 and then maybe Marta can comment on
the incremental margin question.
<A - Michael Joseph Wheeler>: Sure, Jim. Well, we stay in close contact with marketing and they let us know what's
going on out in the marketplace and on our volumes. And we are quick to adapt to whether business is going up to
make sure we handle that or if we're seeing areas that are not coming online like we thought. We're going to take the
costs out. We're very flexible on that.
On the resource side, two big drivers are locomotives. We continue to look at rationalizing our locomotive fleet. We've
got a lot of good plans in place. We still have some surge units out there, so we're comfortable that we could handle any
upside as well, but we continue to look at what we can take out and reduce costs on the locomotive fleet.
On the resource side of manpower, we have committed to making sure we protect the T&E train crews to ensure that
we have the service product we need and, again, going back to our conversations with marketing, we're very flexible on
what's happening with what they're telling us. On the rest of the railroad, we continue to look at every opportunity
where we can take costs out, but still protect safety and service.
<A - James A. Squires>: Marta, would you address the question about incremental margin.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, Alan described how we expect some growth in 2017. We do expect to have very good
incremental margins on all of that business. As you may know, our incremental margins depend on which segment of
our business they come in. All of them, as I said, had good margin. The hierarchy, though, is we had the highest
incremental margins on merchandise because those travel largely on existing trains and don't have too many
incremental variable cost. Next is coal and then intermodal as it has the highest proportion of variable cost.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: But is it safe to say then on a blended basis at least incremental margin should at least be $0.50
of every incremental revenue dollars you drop to the bottom line. Is that a good number on the blended basis?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: We haven't guided to a specific number, but we do expect very good incremental margins on
all of our business.
<Q - Amit Mehrotra>: Okay. Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a good quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Danny C. Schuster>: Hi good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our
question this morning. So we wanted to dig in a little bit to coal. You're now guiding to kind of a coal growth CAGR of
1% over the next few years with a step-up this year and a deceleration thereafter. So we just wanted to get a sense.
Does this kind of imply that you're expecting something like a 4% or 5% step-up this year and kind of a decline from
there? And then from there we've got to dig in a little bit to see if we can get a little bit more color on what the split
across your different coal businesses are? Thank you.
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. Alan provided some specific guidance with respect to our coal volumes as projected in
2017. Alan, why don't you go back over that and then provide a little bit of additional commentary.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Danny. We talked about utility coal volumes of 17 million tons to 19 million tons per quarter for
the year dependent upon normalized weather patterns and natural gas prices following the forward curve. I'll note that

today natural gas prices are about $1 per million BTU above where they were this time last year. And as you're aware,
and from February to May of last year, natural gas was below $2 a million BTU. So that in and of itself will provide
more support for our coal-fired utility customers and would provide year-over-year growth in our coal markets.
We've also talked about export coal volumes between 3.5 million tons to 4.5 million tons quarterly resulting from
improved seaborne pricing and demand for U.S. coals. There's a lot of volatility in that. As you've seen, the benchmark
pricing for hard coking coal shift from $92.50 a metric ton in the third quarter up to $285 a metric ton in the first
quarter and then the latest spot price was about $185 a metric ton. So that's going to be one that we're watching closely
and we'll be sure to update our outlook for that on our next call.
<Q - Danny C. Schuster>: Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then within utility coal, how should we think about
the mix between your Southern utility customer base and Northern utility customer base and is there a length-of-haul
mix we should be thinking about associated with the growth within that line this year? Thank you.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: In the fourth quarter, we saw a somewhat slight mix shift from our Southern utility base to our
Northern utility base. We expect that to continue in 2017 as a result of stockpiles generally being lower in the North
right now than they are in the South.
<Q - Danny C. Schuster>: Okay. So would that infer a negative RPU mix just from that phenomenon?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Danny, generally, our Southern utility shipments have a longer life of haul.
<Q - Danny C. Schuster>: Great, great. That's very helpful. Well, thank you very much for my questions. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Thanks. Good morning. So you've said that you are expecting RPU of about 2.5% through 2020
versus CPI of 2.2%. That's kind of closed a little bit from your prior guidance. And also just wanted to check if that is
going to be a similar gap for 2017 just given some of Marta's comments on labor seemed like inflation could be a little
higher for 2017.
<A - James A. Squires>: Let's talk about the projected RPU trend in the five-year plan going forward first. Alan,
would you take that one?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah, absolutely. We're going to continue to price above rail inflation. We're committed to
doing that. We're confident in our ability to leverage the value of our service product, so you'll continue to hear us talk
about that. We had a lot of negative mix shifts in 2016 as we talked about the declines in utility coal and the declines in
crude oil and the declines in natural gas liquids and frac sand. So we have started to see stabilization on that front; it's
one of the reasons our volumes grew in the fourth quarter and we expect that stabilization and some improvement in
truck and energy markets to manifest itself into growth in RPU in 2017.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Got it. And as a follow-up, I apologize if I missed this, but did you give us your natural gas price
assumptions for 2017 and through 2020? I just wanted to see where that is and how much that will help move the
needle on coal for you?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah, we talked about paying very close attention to the forward curve; that's what we're looking
at now. Right now, that's about $1.20 above gas prices that we experienced in the first and second quarters of last year.
<Q - Ravi Shanker>: Got it. Is there a breakeven level that you would like to see before your coal volumes start to
really move?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Well, we saw coal dispatch mix improve relative to natural gas in the fourth quarter, particularly
in December as natural gas prices got up into like $3.50. We started to see support for some of our more efficient plants

at $3 natural gas and maybe even a little bit lower. It's dependent upon sourcing patterns. It depends on weather
patterns. Higher the better, obviously, but we're already seeing support for our coal franchise at $3.20 natural gas.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Yeah. Good morning. Can you update us on how much of your book of business is now
including fuel surcharge mechanisms that are still below that recovery threshold? And remind us how far those are
from being in the money where you start to get rising revenues as fuel prices rise.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Bascome, we're now at about 40% of our fuel surcharge revenue is tied to WTI. That is
generally out of the money. The rest of it is generally tied to on-highway diesel or is in a tariff that doesn't have a fuel
surcharge program and on-highway diesel has a strike price that is on average close to where we are now.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: Okay. So maybe one time – this to Marta, how much of a bottom line or margin drag from
diesel costs are you baking into your 2017 outlook, as we see higher fuel prices on this portion of your business but you
aren't seeing a revenue offset?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, as you saw in our 2016 results, we had – of course, they were going the other way, but
in our 2016 results, you saw both in the fourth quarter and in the year that our fuel revenues were down. For the full
year you could see that the reduction in fuel – the fuel expense line about equaled the reduction in the fuel surcharge
revenue. So looking forward to 2017, as Alan has already mentioned and you noted, the fuel curve is up, and indeed
through January where oil prices are quite a bit higher than they were in the first quarter of last year.
So as long as we stay below $64 a barrel and the curve, even though now it's projecting to be up, it's not expected to go
currently above that. So we will expect to see less of an increase in our fuel surcharge revenue than we have in fuel
expense. However, I would note that we do not expect it to have a significant effect on our operating income. Where
you will see it have more of an effect will be on the operating ratio, simply because of the math, because the numerator
and the denominator will be moving by similar numbers.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: I'll add that generally higher energy prices are going to lift many of the markets we serve and
expand the value proposition of rail relative to truck. So it's not just a fuel surcharge discussion, it will drive volume
growth and pricing ability for us.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yeah.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: I appreciate the comprehensive answer. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Hey great, good morning, and congrats on a record OR and good to see the progress
continue. But I want to focus on that, Jim, if we can because want to get your thoughts on the $100 million in savings
and perhaps define what's in there and understand kind of where you're focused on this year and see the ramp. Last year
you raised that target up to $250 million; see what the possibility of to improve on that. And is it as simple as taking
that $100 million and saying that's 60 basis points of improvement, so you're really targeting something like a 68% OR
this year, or would you suggest there's more to it?

<A - James A. Squires>: So as I went through Ken, we produced $250 million in productivity savings in 2016 and a
record operating ratio for the full year. That $250 million was above our original projection of productivity savings in
2016. In 2017, we're targeting $100 million in additional productivity savings. That number we view as realistic,
achievable, and sustainable, even while we run our network at a high service level.
Again, if we see additional opportunities for productivity savings, just as we did in 2016, we will go after them, and we
could see them in all of the areas in which we achieve productivity savings in 2016.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: I got that, but – I understand that's what you said before. I just want to try to understand
what's in there, right. I mean, last year you talked about the coal network shutting down some yards, integrating
divisions. Can you talk to us about what's in the target so we can understand where upside leverage can come from like
you saw last year?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. We're going to continue to push on all of those areas in which we achieved
productivity savings in 2016. Mike, why don't you comment?
<A - Michael Joseph Wheeler>: Yeah. It's across the board, like Jim notes. First of all, it's in our fleet rationalization,
both the locomotives that we talked about, continuing to make sure we're getting the most out of those assets and
looking at ways to take locomotives out of the fleet even though we're handling greater volumes.
On the freight car fleet, while we are bringing some new freight cars online, overall net, we're planning on reducing the
size of the fleet, that's a fleet rationalization, still being able to protect our customer service. Continue to look at ways
to take costs out of the branch lines without hurting service. Fuel efficiency, we've got a big push on fuel efficiency,
both from technology and the locomotive productivity that we talked about.
And the last thing is we continue to look at optimizing our train plan, whether it's to improve customer service or to get
productivity in the network. We do that every day and all of those things are baked into that $100 million.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Wonderful. And just a cleanup, Alan, you mentioned on coal inventory, it came off a bit.
Can you talk about where they are now, both North and South?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah, coal inventories are still elevated above target. They're at about 86 days at this point. I
would say target is probably closer to 60 days. Importantly, they've come down about 20 days since their high of last
year. The South is about at 82 days, North is about 90 days. The South has – or excuse me, the North has declined a
little bit more as of recent. And importantly PJM power pricing is up about 15%, or was up about 15% in December,
which has really supported coal burn and coal deliveries in that area.
<Q - Kenneth S. Hoexter>: Wonderful. Appreciate the time. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Alan, just going back to the mix
impact for a second, obviously it was negative for the year, if you just look at RPU less fuel, and you talked about some
of the reasons why, the mix within export coal, length of haul. Just wanted to circle back to confirm why you thought it
might be positive or at least improving into next year, if you look at intermodal being one of the only three big
segments to really grow. It sounds like you still have some more export coal to go? And maybe you can factor in how
you see auto into that as well. I think you mentioned it was going to kind of track production, which you thought was a
3% decline or so?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah, we do believe our automotive franchise will decline with U.S. automotive production
declining 3%, and then there are some specific plants that we serve that are taking some retooling. Importantly, we are
continuing to get price. We're pricing above real inflation; that will benefit 2017. We're going to see growth in our coal

network which, as you are aware, put pressure on our RPU in 2016. And we're going to continue to price in our
intermodal network reflecting the value of our service product. So we see growth in RPU.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Okay. Got it. So it sounds like some of the buckets are changing a bit mostly from price. I
guess, the other factor just to follow-up on overall volume and for next year the outlook. How do you see FX playing
into the strength of the dollar in some of your markets, you had some pretty good numbers in MetCon this quarter,
dollar is off a bit, but I was wondering how much you think that needs to move and be sustainably moving before you'd
see some relief in some of those areas that have been pressured for the last couple of years?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Well, our imports were up more than our exports and 2016 resulted in part from the foreign
exchange issues. You talked about our metals and construction. Our steel customers are feeling pretty positive, right
now. And they're looking for growth. Steel prices are up. Year-over-year capacity factors are up year-over-year. Our
exports, we think, are going to be supported at least in the near-term by export coal volumes. So we're going to closely
watch the dollar. It impacts trade and we're heavily tied to trade. There's some things going on that are going to support
international volumes for us, at least in the near-term.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wadewitz with UBS Securities. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you, Alan, a little bit about price. I think you had
some commentary on pricing, but what would you say the progression has been if you look at 2016 and say that – did
you see much change in pricing through the year? I think some market share wins in intermodal and coal beg the
question of whether you're being a little more aggressive on certain pieces of business? So – if you want to comment on
that, but also just kind of the market dynamic overall, whether you saw change in pricing and what you think on 2017,
whether you just need to see truck market tightening a bit and that will be a key driver or just how you look on pricing
overall? And then, in particularly related to some of the wins you've had in intermodal and coal? Thanks.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: We're committed to pricing above rail inflation. I'm completely confident in the ability of our
team to continue to deliver a strong service product and the ability of our team to price to the value of that service
product. If there's anywhere where we were aggressive in 2016, it was on our service product. Our pricing throughout
the year was consistently above rail inflation. We saw our trucking markets start to tighten in the fourth quarter, some
of our other markets stabilized and energy prices moved up which allowed us to grow in the fourth quarter. And we
expect that momentum to continue into 2017.
<A - James A. Squires>: Tom, I too would like to emphasize our commitment to pricing above rail inflation, based on
an excellent service product.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay, yeah, great. What about the thought in terms of just 2017, 2018, the kind of, I guess,
the path on pricing, is it reasonable to say that this is just at the end of the day, are primarily going to be driven by
capacity and demand in the market? So if we really see that truck spot market tightening and pricing rising, that that
will help you accelerate pricing and if you do see some better volume overall on rail through 2017 that is it reasonable
to see the pricing accelerate along with that?
<A - James A. Squires>: The key to higher prices in our view is excellent service. And we operate in a competitive
marketplace, we believe we provide an outstanding service and our goal is to obtain above rail inflation pricing going
forward.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Right. Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, Thanks. Morning everyone.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So I know you don't have earnings guidance for this year, but you've got multiyear guidance of
double-digit earnings growth. If coal is going to be up high-single low-double digits this year and then down in the
subsequent years. Is there a reason why we shouldn't have double-digit earnings growth this year? Is there something
that we need to consider? And then just along those lines, Marta, you gave us last year just very helpful kind of margin
commentary on the coming quarter, any thoughts on first quarter operating ratio just given the tough comp versus a
year ago?
<A - James A. Squires>: Let me go back over, Scott, first our overall outlook. We outlined and reaffirmed our plan to
get to a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020. And we expect to make progress each year toward that goal. And therefore,
we expect to post an operating ratio in 2017 that is below 2016's full year operating ratio, and we do not give quarterly
guidance.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: But is there anything that you would want us to consider in our models if this is a normal year
of productivity and it's the one year where you expect coal volume growth and you have a multiyear double-digit
earnings growth expectation. It would seem that this should be a year where you're at least double-digit, maybe even
above trend. Is there something you want us to contemplate and why it might not be that way?
<A - James A. Squires>: Certainly, coal volume above the range that we have projected would provide additional
upside to our plan.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then, Alan just on the coal yields, so CSX reported a pretty meaningful sequential
increase in coal yields in the fourth quarter and you guys have just a small increase. Can you just walk us through how
your export coal pricing works? Is there a reason why you're not going to see that bump or is it more that the way you
guys price will see that bump more so in the first quarter than what we saw in the fourth quarter?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah, Scott, we talked on the third quarter call about how we felt like our growth in export
volumes in the fourth quarter would come at the lower length of haul Baltimore business as opposed to Lambert's
Point, and in fact, that's exactly what happened. Our growth in the fourth quarter in export volumes was associated with
Baltimore, not Lambert's Point. And so as a result, we had a negative mix with our export coal RPUs. We looked at our
pricing on export in the fourth quarter as we said we would. We told you we would do it in the first quarter, which we
did and then we're closely monitoring the benchmark price and the demand going forward.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Maybe a better way to ask it, do you think you'll see coal revenue per car sequentially higher
or lower in the first quarter than the fourth?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: I think ultimately that's going to depend upon mix. I talked a little bit about how our volumes in
the North would probably increase at a higher rate than our volumes in the South, which will put pressure on our coal
RPU, but offsetting that is going to be some strong pricing in our export volumes.

<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Well, good morning, everyone and thanks for getting me in. So Jim, I just want to come
back to the structural opportunity on the cost structure because you guys have been running consistently with, let's call
it, a 27%, 28% OR on labor costs. A lot of the rest of the industry is now closer to 20% on a labor OR. And when I look
at your results for the past decade, you have run with head count between 28,000 and 30,000 folks and your
productivity – and sorry I'm getting nerdy here, but I do like to quantify this stuff – I think your productivity is about 13
million GTMs per head per year right now. CSX, which is a similar size network, arguably maybe a little bit bigger,
running 15 million GTMs per head.
So can you talk about – is there something structural on the network where you can let attrition take head count down
and grow volume and grow productivity on the labor line because, as we look at it and I think as a lot of investors look
at it, that's a big opportunity for you guys going forward?
<A - James A. Squires>: We certainly made progress on labor productivity in 2016. That was a key driver of our $250
million in productivity savings. In 2017, as we've been through, we're targeting an additional $100 million in
productivity savings, a number that we view as sustainable, and a component of that will be additional labor savings.
We have guided to basically flat head count for the full year 2017. We think that's a level of human resources that will
allow us to continue driving productivity and serve as a foundation for growth as well.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: But is there anything in the network, Jim, that you look at that you think going forward,
hey, we need to restructure the way we're looking at the world because we used to be more coal-focused and
commodity-focused and now we want to be a little bit more nimble around intermodal? I mean, is there something in
the terminal infrastructure where you could see attrition rates, not necessarily layoffs or reductions, but really reducing
the size of the employee base going forward relative to revenue?
<A - James A. Squires>: In 2016, we demonstrated our nimbleness and our agility in responding to business
conditions with respect to the labor resource, as well as otherwise and we have additional opportunities going forward
as well. Labor productivity, specifically, is the largest component of our overall $650 million by 2020 and we will
continue to work on that.
<Q - Brandon Oglenski>: Okay. Appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks. Good morning. And I wanted to ask about intermodal. First, could you give us some sense
for the level of intermodal volume growth you're expecting in 2017? And second, I know you guided for consolidated
pricing above inflation, but do you think above inflation pricing is achievable within intermodal this year?
<A - James A. Squires>: As we've been through our goal and our plan is to produce above rail inflation pricing for the
duration of the plan period based on excellent customer service. Now, let me ask Alan to comment specifically on the
dynamics within the intermodal sector.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Sure. Hey, Justin, truck capacity while it has tightened is still relatively loose, particularly
compared to where we were in 2014. So we think that as truck capacity tightens, particularly towards the second half of
the year, then we're going to start to see more and more intermodal growth. So Jim had talked about 4% CAGR on
intermodal growth over our next four years, and we think that's within the ballpark of where we'll be in 2017, and that's
going to support that tightening truck market and reduced inventory levels will support more pricing in 2017.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. That's helpful. But just to clarify, you do feel like intermodal pricing can be above rail
inflation this year?
<A - James A. Squires>: For the planned period going forward, we will certainly strive for above rail inflation pricing
based on our excellent service.

<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. And secondly, sticking on intermodal, I wanted to ask about the progression of intermodal
margins over the course of the longer term strategic plan. Does that longer term outlook assume that intermodal
margins improve to the point where they are in line with consolidated averages at some point before 2020? And if so,
what's a realistic timeframe to think about when this can occur?
<A - James A. Squires>: Marta, why don't you go back over the basic incremental margin characteristics of each of
the businesses and then address the question with regard to intermodal?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: All right. Justin, intermodal, although I mentioned earlier that it is third in the hierarchy of
incremental margins. It is still very good incremental margins. And to answer your specific question, we definitely
expect improving intermodal margins throughout the four-year plan period that Jim described.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. But you're not willing to say if those intermodal margins will be on par with consolidated
margins at some point over the plan?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: We've never split our incremental margin numbers between the three groups.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time today.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl was Cowen Securities. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you operator. Hey, Jim. Hey, team. Real quickly looking out at your expected CAGR on
the intermodal side, you said international growth above GDP. Is there anything built-in for a continued share shift of
the West Coast ports and some of the build-out to some the eastern ports?
<A - James A. Squires>: Alan, why don't you take that one?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Sure, Jason. That has been a support for our volumes over the last couple of years. It's been a
continuing trend. We look for it to continue moving forward. But we're looking at GDP plus growth within the
international space. There won't be a big hockey stick there. We're looking for sustainable organic growth.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. So there's a little bit built in there, but probably not too much that we've seen like see in
the past couple of years?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Correct.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. That's all I have. Guys, appreciate the time.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Thanks. Yeah. I guess I'll just build on that last point, Alan, on the intermodal side – the
international intermodal side specifically. You had mentioned – you had emphasized organic, so when we think about
some of the rhetoric around trade, exiting TPP, et cetera, perhaps if you could just expound upon the opportunity from
share shift in the context of perhaps trade – rising trade protectionism over that four-year period and to what degree do
you think that might present risk to your ability to grow international intermodal above GDP over the next four years.
Thanks.

<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah. If there were something that impacted international trade, that would certainly have an
impact on our business levels. Note that the impact or the headwinds that we faced in 2016 around inventory levels
seem to be normalizing. Trucking markets seem to be firming up, and as a result, we saw growth in the fourth quarter.
So there's going to be puts and takes, but clearly, we're watching anything that would impact international trade.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a – Marta, if you
could talk a little bit about what we should expect about the cadence for the inflation, the step-up in inflation for next
year. I think you guided to something closer to a 5% than the 3.5% we saw in the current year.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, and that's 5%, David, is specifically just to the comp and benefits line.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Yeah.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: For the remaining items in our income statement, those lines will increase inflationary, with
just general economic inflation, so at a lower rate than that 5%.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then as far as kind of the cadence of how that should be coming in, is there
anything we should be thinking about in terms of incentive comp or specific timing of payments or things like that?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes. Well, generally speaking, that's a good point for you to bring up. Generally speaking,
the comp line is weighted somewhat to the first quarter of the year and that is because of the incentive comp as you
mentioned. So if you look at the cadence last year of the comp, that should be a general guideline. With regard to the
health and welfare inflation, those new rates for the industry did start on January 1.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Thanks. And then Mike, maybe just a question for you. The fuel productivity got
like to an all-time high in the winter quarter, like a 5% jump. I'm just wondering like what is it that's driving that. Is it
some sort of change in locomotive fleet? I know you've done some things around line rationalization, and you
mentioned also something about maybe holiday timing kind of running a little lighter. Is this a new run rate from which
we should be building our expectations on fuel productivity? Can you talk a little bit about what's driving the
significant improvement in that particular metric in terms of fuel consumption?
<A - Michael Joseph Wheeler>: Sure. So the biggest driver is the fact that we continue to reduce the locomotive fleet,
that is a big push there. In addition, we've got a lot of technology, the fuel management technology that we put out
there and really leveraging that. And in addition, we really focused on fuel shutdown compliance, other rules that we
put on the operations to make sure that we're getting the best fuel efficiency. All those pieces go into our record fuel
efficiency and we see more opportunity going forward this year as well.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So it just sounds like it's a little bit of execution in some of the prior investments around
the fuel technology? There is nothing structural in terms of the change in mix of the fleet or anything like that?
<A - Michael Joseph Wheeler>: No, I don't think – well, structurally, yeah, the reduced fleet, we told you last year
about how much yard and local fleets we – yard and local engines that we pulled out of the fleet and still was able to
protect service, that was a big driver of that. We're continuing to look at that. So that's the structural piece, is reducing
our yard and local fleet and then being able to handle increasing gross ton miles with kind of the current fleet gives you
even more productivity. So that's the structural piece, in addition to all the technology and execution that we focus on.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Thanks.
<A - Michael Joseph Wheeler>: Welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning. So the dividend increase was a bit of a surprise, to
me anyway. Can you talk a little bit about your comfort level for being above your long-term target payout ratio for a
period of time and whether you think there might be room for that payout target to increase?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, let me begin by saying that shareholder distributions including dividends and regular
dividend increases are a major component of our capital allocation strategy. And I'll turn it over to Marta to discuss
your payout ratio question.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Absolutely. We definitely believe as Jim said that the shareholder should benefit as the
company's profitability improves, and the board did raise the dividend by that 3%. As you mentioned, we have a
long-term payout target of 33%. The board believes that we can provide modest dividend increases as we manage that
payout ratio to that one-third target. As you'll recall, last year had a 46% target. So even with this increase, we are
moderating the payout in total.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay. But 33% remains the long-term target?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: That's all for me. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to focus a little bit –
perhaps this is for Marta, on the comp and benefit line. I know, Jim you mentioned that there was $100 million and in a
normal year, you would have most of that productivity savings coming from the comp and benefit or the labor line.
With the 5% increase all-in that you're pointing to and yes on flat head count, I'm just wondering if the $100 million
this year is factoring in perhaps a much lower component of labor productivity than in the years over your forecast
period. Am I right in seeing that for this year?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Generally speaking, the ratios of reductions are similar to the full plan. So, Jim showed in
the $650 million, roughly 65% of that is comp and benefits and that percentage holds true for the $100 million. So we
do expect the lion's share of the $100 million of productivity improvement to come in the comp line.
And one of the things we mentioned, I think Mike and I both mentioned, with keeping the head count level but
managing extra volumes, there is some productivity there. In addition to just looking at the head count, we also have
productivity in that line, in overtime, in recrews, in extra boards, so there's other specific areas other than just the count
that also lead to productivity in the comp line.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So when we look at that line, we should offset the 5% increase with changes in other
components of that line item, being like you said overtime and so on, so it's not necessarily last year's labor times 5%
higher average comp, we should also reflect it in for overtime and other aspects. And do you have any sense of order of
magnitude? If that's the case, what impact that would be on the comp and benefit line in 2017, of everything excluding
the 5% and the flat labor count that you'd already mentioned?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: How you described it is just the right way to look at it. You're going to look at it in those
components. You look at the compensation benefits that we had last year. We do have the inflationary growth, which is
one component, and then separate from that, we have the productivity which will bend the curve the other way.

<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Order of magnitude – it's about the same percentage in the year as we guided to for the entire

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in and I'll just ask one. Could you please
elaborate on slide 33, the long-term outlook, the expected pipeline-related headwinds in crude oil and natural gas
liquids pertaining to the merchandise segment? And then if you could kind of hone in on your chemical segment view
for 2017, any additional color. Thanks.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Scott, that is directly related to the Dakota Access pipeline and the Mariner East 2 pipeline.
Dakota Access will impact Bakken crude to the East Coast, although we'll still participate in some heavy Canadian
crude. And the Mariner East will impact our NGO shipments out of Utica and Marcellus.
<Q - Scott Schneeberger>: Thanks very much.
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and congratulations. Most of my questions have been answered.
Marta, can I focus a little bit on the pension component of the labor cost increase? You mentioned pensions become a
tailwind versus a headwind. I know there was a sharp uptick in rates post-election. When was your pension expense
re-leveled and what does that look like in terms of a tailwind for 2017?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: So our pension expense, we think for 2017 – to answer your last question first, we think it's
going to be about flat with 2016. And you were correct that the interest rate change would push that up a little bit.
However, we also had asset gains in the plan. So net-net for 2017, we see pension expense staying relatively even.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. If I run the utility coal and export coal numbers that
you provided for 2017, it looks like we're going to be up double-digit in both of those areas. Number one, am I thinking
through that right in terms of 2017 volume? And number two, can I assume that's going to be more heavily weighted in
the first two quarters of the year?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: I'm not seeing the double-digit growth in export coal with the guidance that we provided.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. But the utility side?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: The utility side, you know what, we've given you the guidance, that's our best look right
now.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Paterson with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Rick Paterson>: Thank you. Good morning. Could you please update us on the number of furloughed train crews
and stored locomotives? And with regard to crews, when you recall furloughed employees, what percentage typically
come back? I'd imagine that percentage also erodes over time as we move further away from furlough dates. How
should we think about that?
<A - James A. Squires>: Yeah. So on the furlough, we still have right around 100 employees furloughed on the T&E
side, and it's primarily in the coalfields, though if there is continued upswing in coal, we could handle that, but it's
down to about 100. We started recalling them middle of last year across the network to handle the sequential volume
increase and protect service, so we did that.
And on the recalls, you're right. When we first started out, we get up into the high 90% recall rate. When we recall
furloughs and the longer it goes, it starts declining after that. Although with some of the things we've put in place with
our extra boards over the last year, overall, we got a higher return rate, which we're real pleased with. On the
locomotive side, we still have about 350 locomotives stored available to us.
<Q - Rick Paterson>: Perfect. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Brian Adam Konigsberg>: Thank you. Appreciate you fitting me in. It's been a long call. A lot of questions have
been answered. I have a couple of small ones. Marta, actually, you mentioned in response to the pension question –
asset gains. Is that asset gains within the pension plan, or are you expecting to have asset sales in 2017 elsewhere
within the network itself?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: That was within the pension plan that I was describing.
<Q - Brian Adam Konigsberg>: Okay. I mean with the productivity initiatives going on, you did have an asset sale in
2016. Would you anticipate some assets to break loose as you kind of work through rationalization of the network?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Our real estate department is always taking look where we have assets that we can sell. We
especially described in the third quarter where we had a large operating asset sale. In 2017, they will continue to look at
it. As you know, looking over the last three years, that number can be somewhat variable. But two years before that, it
was smaller, kind of varying $10 million to $20 million, and this year was a little bit higher, over $30 million. So that
will depend on the properties that they come up with. Alan, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - Alan H. Shaw>: Yeah. They're distinct transactions, and as we all know with real estate, closing date can move
forward or move back. So it's an initiative of ours. It's been an initiative for several years. It provided benefit in 2016,
and we expect that it's going to do even more so in 2017.
<Q - Brian Adam Konigsberg>: But it's not explicitly in the plan, is that right?
<A - James A. Squires>: We always do budget for a certain level of gain from sale of both operating and
non-operating properties, so that's a standard item in our budgets.
<Q - Brian Adam Konigsberg>: Okay. If I could just add one more quick one maybe for Mike. So you had a good – I
guess you did very well on lengthening or expanding the train lengths and actually keeping up the velocity. Maybe just
talk about what the opportunity is on lengthening more in 2017 and how do you balance that with the velocity and the
service metrics?

<A - Michael Joseph Wheeler>: Yeah, sure. It's something we focus on a lot. We feel like we've got – not feel – we
know we've got capacity on our trains, particularly on the intermodal and merchandise network, so we'll continue to see
it grow, a lot of work going on there to make that happen. But we are doing it very thoughtfully, so that, one, we keep
our terminals fluid and be able to keep the overall velocity of all the assets to the railroad flowing. And we also spend
time with our customers on working with them on how we can increase train lengths as well and we both benefit. So a
lot of initiative there and still opportunity going forward.
