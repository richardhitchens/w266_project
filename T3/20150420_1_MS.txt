MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Morgan Stanley First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
Kathleen McCabe
Good morning. This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimate or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also
include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a
reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for discussion of additional risks and
uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan
Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or
instrument. I will now turn the call to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Kathleen, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on what is the last earnings call from our
favorite CFO, Ruth Porat. I will now give you some highlights for the first quarter results and mark to market our
execution against the strategic plan that we provided an update of in January.

We began this year on a solid footing with all businesses contributing to our performance. Excluding DVA, this was
the strongest quarter in firm revenue and PBT in many years. In fact it was the second best quarter in revenue ex DVA
in the firm's 80-year history. Key highlights include the following. Equity showed continued leadership. We delivered
strong performance across products and regions, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Fixed Income delivered
a stronger quarter consistent with our strategy. Investment Banking performed solidly and the pipeline remains healthy.
Wealth Management achieved record revenue per financial advisor and delivered a pre-tax margin of 22%. Investment
Management results were steady, but there's more to be done as this business remains an important part of our growth
opportunity.
Most significantly, we took a meaningful step toward achieving our stated return on equity target, delivering in this
quarter an ROE of 10.1%. This ROE excludes the effect of the net discrete tax benefit and DVA. On a reported basis,
as you will have seen, the ROE for the quarter was actually 14.2%. This performance reflects our strategic plan and
demonstrates the business' flexibility to respond to increased client activity and market movements.
While the firm has clearly made progress, there remains work to be done in achieving the six-point plan we laid out in
January, an update of which I'll briefly provide today.
First, we continue to improve our Wealth Management margin which reached 22%for the quarter. The business is also
benefiting from additional factors described during our last call.
Secondly, we will continue to execute on our bank strategy through deploying our deposits and again delivering
prudent loan growth across Wealth Management and Institutional Securities.
Third, Fixed Income and Commodities saw its strongest revenue quarter in three years as volumes returned to the
market with increased volatility. This quarter was important evidence of the execution of our strategy to significantly
reduce the capital required to support the Fixed Income business, while maintaining the appropriately sized global
footprint to meet our clients' needs. Needless to say, we must see this play out for more than one quarter.
Fourth, we're just beginning to realize the benefit of lower funding costs as we refinance the debt we issued post-crisis.
This provides us with a tailwind across the businesses.
We maintained our focus on expense management discipline and showed strong progress in the first quarter, delivering
an overall expense ratio of 72% excluding DVA. This level reflects an Institutional Securities compensation ratio of
38%, and that ratio is consistent with our stated target of being at or below 39%.
Finally, with respect to steadily increasing capital return to shareholders, we were pleased to receive a non-objection
from the Federal Reserve on our 2015 capital plan to increase our dividend to $0.15 per quarter and a repurchase up to
$3.1 billion of common stock for the five quarters beginning in the second quarter of this year. We hope to maintain
this trend of increasing dividends and share repurchases in future cycles subject, of course, to regulatory approval. In
aggregate, we continued to execute against the benchmarks previously established and will remain focused on them for
the duration of 2015.
Before closing, I would like to note several organization changes we recently made. These changes, where we moved
executives across the firm, reflect our strong desire to build a very deep bench of senior management for the years
ahead.
And finally, I would like to thank our CFO, Ruth Porat, for her partnership, friendship and commitment to Morgan
Stanley and to me personally. She has been an extraordinarily highly valued part of my team for five years and a
tremendous asset to this firm since her arrival. We indeed have been lucky to have her. We're delighted to appoint as
CFO Jon Pruzan, a 20-year veteran of our Investment Banking division at the end of this month, and I wish Jon luck in
this new role. I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in detail.

Thank you, James, and good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We
have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.
Results for the first quarter include a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, primarily
associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a lower cost than originally estimated. In addition, the impact of
DVA in the quarter was a positive $125 million, with $100 million in Fixed Income sales and trading and $25 million
in Equity sales and trading.
Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $9.8 billion, up 30% versus the fourth quarter. Earnings from
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were $2.2 billion.
Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were $1.14 after preferred dividends. On a
GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $9.9 billion. Earnings from
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $2.3 billion. Reported earnings from
continuing operations per diluted share were $1.18 after preferred dividends. Reported return on equity from continuing
operations was 14.2% in the first quarter. Excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefit, ROE for the quarter
was 10.1%. Book value at the end of the quarter was $33.80 per share and tangible book value was $28.91 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $829 billion at March 31, up from $802 billion at the end of the fourth
quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $136 billion, up $2 billion versus Q4. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the
quarter was $195 billion compared with $193 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, our Common Equity Tier 1 transitional ratio will be
approximately 13.1%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 14.7%. Basel III transitional
risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $440 billion at March 31.
Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio using the
Basel III fully phased-in advanced approach was 11.6% at March 31, up from 10.7% in the fourth quarter. Our pro
forma standardized ratio was 11.6%, up from 10.9% in the fourth quarter. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced
RWAs are expected to be approximately $449 billion. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III standardized RWAs are
expected to be approximately $446 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S.
final rule to be approximately 5.1% at March 31, up from 4.7% at the end of 4Q. All of these estimates are preliminary
and are subject to revision.
Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $7.1 billion, down 34% versus the fourth quarter.
Compensation expense was $4.5 billion in the quarter, down 11%, driven primarily by the change in compensation
structure discussed in the fourth quarter, partly offset by increased compensation related to higher revenues.
Non-compensation expense was $2.5 billion for the quarter, down 55% quarter-over-quarter, driven by decreased legal
expense as well as continued expense discipline.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $5.3 billion, up
45% sequentially, after excluding the implementation charge for FVA in 4Q. Non-interest expense was $3.6 billion,
down 49% versus the fourth quarter, due to legal expenses and the compensation expense adjustment occurred in the
prior quarter. Compensation expense was $2 billion for the first quarter, down 17% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting
the impact of the change in compensation structure I just noted.
Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was 38%, down quarter-over-quarter, and down approximately 300 basis
points year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the change in compensation structure, and operating leverage in the
business. Non-compensation expense was $1.6 billion, down 65% versus the fourth quarter, driven by significantly
lower legal expense in the quarter. Including the impact of DVA, revenues were $5.5 billion.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.2 billion were down 9% from last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters,
Morgan Stanley ranked at number one in global IPOs and number three in global equity and global announced M&A at
the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included: in Advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as sole financial adviser
to AbbVie in its acquisition of Pharmacyclics for an aggregate value of $20 billion. AbbVie obtained financing from

Morgan Stanley and MUFG.
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as joint global coordinator lead left bookrunner and stabilization agent priced a
$3.7 billion follow-on offering for Citizens Financial Group. This was the largest financial institutions follow-on
offering since 2012.
In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as active bookrunner for Coca-Cola in its €8.5 billion senior unsecured
note, offering the largest euro transaction for a U.S. issuer on record and the second largest euro transaction of all time.
Advisory revenues of $471 million decreased 3% versus our fourth quarter results, driven by lower revenues in EMEA
and Asia.
Underwriting revenues of $702 million decreased 13% versus our fourth quarter results, driven by equity underwriting
revenues of $307 million, down 11% versus 4Q, reflecting fewer IPOs and lower revenues from EMEA and Asia.
Fixed income underwriting revenues of $395 million, down 15% versus the fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases
in non-investment grade loans and high yield bonds that more than offset increases in investment grade activity.
Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $2.3 billion, up 40% compared to last quarter. Results
reflected broad based gains across products and regions. Cash equities saw increased volume and share gains.
Derivatives revenues were higher across regions, prime brokerage revenues increased driven by an uptick in balances
and client activity.
Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.9 billion, up significantly versus
the fourth quarter. Commodities results were up meaningfully versus the fourth quarter benefiting from structured
transactions, improved client flow and extreme weather. Fixed Income revenues increased quarter-over-quarter, driven
by increased contribution across regions with particular strength in macro products and EMEA. Average trading VaR
for the first quarter was $47 million, flat to the fourth quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 1% sequentially. Asset management
revenues of $2.1 billion were relatively flat with the last quarter. Transaction revenues were down 3% compared to last
quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $526 million, down 8% to the prior quarter, driven in part by fewer
trading days as well as activity levels.
Investment banking related fees of $192 million, up 11% versus last quarter, primarily reflecting a revenue sharing
arrangement with Institutional Securities related to municipal securities. And trading revenues of $232 million, a slight
uptick versus the fourth quarter.
Net interest revenue increased 10% to $689 million, driven primarily by investment portfolio returns as well as
continued growth in lending products.
Non-interest expense was $3 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $754 million, down
3% from last quarter.
Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, down 3% versus the fourth quarter, in part due to the change in compensation
structure last quarter as well as a revenue mix change, with growth in non-compensable revenues this quarter.
The compensation ratio was 58%, down versus the fourth quarter. The PBT margin was 22%, profit before tax was
$855 million, total client assets were $2 trillion, global fee-based asset inflows were $13.3 billion, fee-based assets
under management increased to $803 billion at quarter end, representing 39% of client assets.
Global representatives were 15,915, down 1% to the fourth quarter. Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $135
billion, down $3 billion versus the fourth quarter. Approximately $130 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
Wealth Management lending balances continue to grow, reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy.
Investment Management revenues of $669 million were up 14% sequentially. In traditional asset management,
revenues of $439 million were up 2% versus the fourth quarter. In Merchant Banking and Real Estate Investing,
revenues of $230 million were up compared with fourth quarter, driven by higher investment gains.

Non-interest expenses were $482 million, down 19% from the fourth quarter, due to the change in compensation
structure discussed last quarter. Compensation expense was $273 million in the quarter, reflecting a compensation ratio
of 41%. Non-compensation expense was $209 million, down 2% from the fourth quarter.
Profit before tax was $187 million in the first quarter. NCI was $17 million versus $12 million last quarter. Total assets
under management increased to $406 billion, driven by market appreciation.
Turning now to our outlook. In the first quarter, the firm benefited from growing investor and corporate interest in
global opportunities, with higher activity levels in the U.S. complemented by a meaningful pick-up in activity in
Europe and Asia. In Investment Banking, the M&A backlog is higher than a year ago, supported by the trends we have
discussed previously: robust cross-border activity, activism and larger transactions across industries.
The underwriting pipeline similarly remains healthy, increasingly driven by acquisition activity. In sales and trading,
we continue to benefit from the breadth of our strong global franchise, with renewed client interest in European and
Asian markets, reflecting the varying stages of global recovery and the impact of central bank actions across products.
The obvious factors that affect these results going forward are global events and the nature of volatility. Our Wealth
Management clients remain well engaged with their financial advisors. The key catalyst for higher activity is the level
of U.S. new-issue activity with the pipeline up versus Q1.
Q1 levels also reflected client caution in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate moves, which should play out throughout
the year. We are pleased to have achieved the starting point of our 22% to 25% margin target in a lower transaction
environment, underscoring the great operating leverage in this business.
The outlook for our bank remains strong, given the lending pipeline in our Wealth Management and Institutional
Securities businesses. This enables us to continue to benefit from earnings upside even without the benefit of rising
rates. Our goal with the road map we introduced several years ago was to address your many questions and be
transparent through metrics and goal posts so that our progress could be measured.
We had early confidence that the transformation of Morgan Stanley's business and balance sheet would deliver returns
to all of our stakeholders, and I am proud that the levers we articulated are increasingly evident. Beyond the business
outlook, we expect to benefit from lower funding costs and the impact of capital returns to shareholders.
Although the path to a sustainable acceptable ROE is not a straight line from here, I am confident that the road is a
clear one. I will miss working with you and I'm grateful for the strong support and for the analysts on the call for your
very constructive guidance and analysis. Thank you. It was a privilege to be in this role at this moment in Morgan
Stanley's history. I thank my partner and boss, James Gorman, for the opportunity, but far more important for what our
great team has accomplished. We will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning, Ruth and James.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: First question I guess is if you could give us a little bit more color on Fixed Income and
Commodities, given that it seems like you had a pretty high hurdle to deal with Commodities, not only having done
well in the first quarter last year but also you having sold TransMontaigne. Can you give us a little bit more color on
how you managed to see revenue there actually up year-on-year?

<A - Ruth Porat>: Certainly. We had strong contribution from around the globe, strength in EMEA across products
with meaningfully higher client volumes. The bigger driver was strength in macro. Rates and FX were up nicely
year-over-year and importantly, that's not withstanding meaningfully lower balance sheet and RWAs in Fixed Income
were also lower, they were actually at $174 billion. So through our target, we're keeping our target at $108 billion, so
this really goes to what we've talked about over many quarters, our focus on centralized resource management, so nice
performance there.
Credit was up from a weak fourth quarter, although not at last year's levels. And then as you noted in Commodities, Q1
is seasonally strong and even with the sale of TMG, TransMontaigne, in last year's results, we were up. And the
performance, it was across the board. It was physical client flow structured transactions for clients, so we saw strength
across the board there.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And are you still looking to sell those storage and other physical businesses?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as you've heard us say many times, we're committed to selling oil merchanting and we'll let
you know when we have something to say.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, great. And maybe a little bit of color on the reduction in the RWA in FIC in the
quarter. Can you give us a sense for how much of that was from runoff of some of the legacy positions that you've
talked about in the past that don't generate revenue?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So it included both active and passive mitigation. There was some benefit from market moves as
well. So it was really all three.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's helpful. And then final question really on moves in the capital account. There's a
lot of moving parts it seems like this quarter. We know that, overall, capital was kind of flat, but we can see in the
average allocations that you provide that you moved or retained more capital in the Institutional Securities business,
and I was wondering if you could give us a little sense for, given the RWA movement, what's going on there.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So you actually answered it in your question. There were some ins and outs, but obviously given it
is an average calculation, there are timing implications that flowed through and you can see therefore more capital
moved up to ISG.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So we shouldn't necessarily expect that to remain in ISG as we move through the quarters of
the year, or is there something to do with continued regulatory changes that would drive those capital levels a little bit
higher?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, over time, it will. The required capital calculation is based on the capital regime in place at
any point in time, so that does continue to be on the transitional basis. So over time, you'll see a reduction in some of
the phase-in deductions. So it will change over time and more of that parent capital would be allocated – that we
allocate across the businesses but more of it going to ISG over time, but of course that's a couple year period on the
phase-in.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. Listen, thanks very much for A, taking the questions but B, obviously for your
service, and your tremendous clarity of vision and explanation of everything over the last several years. We've
appreciated working with you.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you very much.

Your next question from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. The first question for James. You have a 10% ROE target. You certainly achieved that in the
first quarter. What is your timeframe to achieve the 10% ROE for the year?

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, Mike, first of all, appreciate your noting the first quarter. We have, as you know,
resisted giving you a formal timeframe because it's – obviously, the ROE is an output and it's a function of returns, both
revenue and expense discipline as well as it is of capital accreted over time and what our capital plans are. So we have
resisted trying to put a formal date on it.
I can assure you everybody in this building would want it sooner rather than later, and the fact that we achieved it in a
good environment but not an extraordinary environment in the first quarter and before many of the tailwinds that we
have behind us are fully baked in was very comforting. We're not going to give you a formal date on this. We are intent
on achieving a 10% ROE year-over-year and beyond that in the outgoing years, so we're off to a good start here in 2015
and let's hope we keep it up.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: What is the 10.1% on a tangible basis?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: It's 11.9%. Is that right, Ruth?
<A - Ruth Porat>: That is. So if you – the various numbers, ROE reported 14.2% translates to 16.6% on tangible, and
so adjusting for DVA and discrete tax benefits, the equivalent ROTE rate of 11.9%.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then a separate question, your VaR stayed flat from the fourth quarter when your VaR
peers actually went up. What's your thought process there? Did you leave money on the table? Is a that a lower risk
profile? What's going on?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So our VaR is heavily weighted to changes in current market volatility and as you know, our VaR
was flat, but what we're focused on is our VaR was flat on stronger performance. We were very active with clients. We
were able to achieve VaR efficiency. We reduced balance sheet in certain areas that were less constructive. We
reallocated behind our client activity. We have capacity to take VaR up, but you can see in the results we had strong
performance with flat VaR.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And again, the key to this is we did not dial up risk to generate these earnings.
Whether we left money on the table, if things had turned out differently, some people might have said we left losses on
the table. So in this situation we didn't dial up the risk, we delivered the earnings, but obviously we have a very
successful trading business in parts of this firm and they'll react to the market volatility as they see it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, Ruth, you're yet one more banking executive to leave the industry. Any last
comment about the regulation in the banking industry?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, I think that fundamental regulatory change was needed post – with the backdrop of 2008 and
it was implemented, and I think there's been meaningful improvement in the stability and resiliency of the industry as a
result with all that's been done: higher capital levels, liquidity, stress testing, recovery plans, resolutions plans,
governance, all the changes in business activity.
I think if you look back over the last five years, some made those changes kicking and screaming. I think we were of
the view that it was clear where it was going and it was needed and are proud of the changes we've made. I think at this
point, given how much has been accomplished, it is time to pause, digest and assess. It would be good to have a timeout
and see the impacts on markets and see where there was an undershoot and an overshoot and hopefully, that's what we
see going forward.
But I think that the main point is the industry's substantially more resilient and that's a big accomplishment. It's a lot of
work to get here for all of us. It may mean lower returns, but it means a more resilient industry and that's a positive
place to be.

Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi, thanks. Ruth, you mentioned in your commentary on FIC about structured transactions
being a contributor. I'm curious if that is only in Commodities or if that was in other parts of the business and how big
of a driver. And more importantly, is that a sustainable appetite by clients? Because we've kind of all been waiting for
that for a while.
<A - Ruth Porat>: I'm glad you asked. That wasn't a comment specific to Commodities. So in Commodities, it was a
combination of structured activity, the physical, and trading activity, and the majority is client-facing flow and
structured business, it was in the backdrop of what's gone on in the oil markets. It was good to see the volume of
structured transactions, and I'm not going to do a forecast on it.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. And does that mean – I don't want to put words in your mouth, but was the
Commodities contribution of the quarter larger than normal times just because some of the things you mentioned plus
the weather?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, Commodities, as you know well, is stronger in the first quarter. And so it was up some versus
last quarter. But the bigger driver was the strength in macro, with rates in foreign exchange up nicely year-over-year.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay, cool. And then the RWA down 4% for the firm sequentially, I think you said 6% in
FIC. It's good, it's welcome. Is that not a number that we want to straight line, right?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I'm sorry, is that a number we don't want to [indiscernible]....
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Can it fall at that pace on an annualized basis?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, two parts to that question. Fixed Income, I noted that it's down to $174 billion and we're
retaining the target at $180 billion. We're very focused on RWA efficiency, and we've indicated there's another $25
billion that runs off post-2015. And we're going to be very clinical and flexible in the way we allocate that capital
across the franchise in a way that optimizes returns. But to your question, would we want you to straight line from
there? I think I've answered that.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Cool. Last one, easy one. Share count was flat year-on-year, but you got a higher
authorization. That's just math, right? We can count on maybe 2% shrinkage this year in the share count?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, well, the main thing is we got a higher authorization and that we start executing on the share
repurchase as we come out of the second quarter, and expect to execute that ratably over the time period.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay, thanks for everything, Ruth.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. A couple quick ones here. Cap markets, the equity strength, how
much of that – I know you highlighted across regions and you gave some great color, Ruth, on some of the various
components, how much of a tailwind was Europe this quarter, just given some of the strength and on the back of QE
there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as we've talked about on many quarters, we run the business with a nine box strategy,
products across the top: cash, derivatives and PB; and then regions: Americas, EMEA and Asia. And in the first

quarter, every box was strong and the big theme, as I said, was increased investor interest outside of the U.S., in
particular, U.S. investors in rest of world. And so, we clearly saw a pick-up in client engagement in EU on the back of
ECB actions, but we also saw cash share gains in Asia with a pickup in client activity on the Asia growth opportunity
and relative value there. So we had nice breadth to the business.
The key question is the ongoing macro backdrop, as I said, and the nature of volatility. This quarter was characterized
by healthy trending volatility and it worked well. It was the best quarter in a long time. So looking forward, we'd
anchor the outlook to what we've seen over the last few years, but there were a lot of good things going on around the
globe.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, thanks for that color. And then, thinking about Wealth Management here,
can you give maybe a little color, I know it's early, but on any potential impact from the Department of Labor proposal?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, with respect to the DOL proposal, it's still in the comment period. There are a number of open
items to address. Based on our best interpretation of the proposal at this point, we don't expect a meaningful impact on
our business. We do expect some changes in activity and we do expect more compliance related costs.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. And then I know the loan growth environment is sort of tough, but
sequential loan growth slowed somewhat and it looked like PLA slowed more than mortgage. Was there anything
driving that? And should we ratchet down expectations for loan growth? Or was that more sort of like a single quarter
type of a slow down there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah. Loan growth is still very much on plan consistent with what James went through on the
fourth quarter. We've talked a lot about prudent loan growth. There is some seasonality with PLA and mortgages in the
first quarter, but we have a healthy and diversified pipeline and expect to continue to deliver steady and prudent loan
growth. And the main point to talk about is two sizable franchises with diversified assets. So we have ample
opportunities for loan growth.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Terrific. Last one from me, any chance to quantify the legal charge in both overall
firm and in the Securities business?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, we commented that non-comp expense was up a bit here due in part to legal, but not breaking
that out.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for...
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: The main take away, Brennan, on that is that the big legal stuff relating to the crisis,
we feel, is behind us, and we are dealing with some of the one-off smaller events as we move forward here, and
reflecting that in the numbers.

<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks. Ruth, one more on equities, and not really focused on the quarter, but if I look
over the last like four quarters or six quarters, it seems like the traction or the progress has just been continuous and it's
been pretty consistent across products, across geographies. Just want to get a sense, like when you look at what's going
on in the equity business, and when you look at some of the pressures on the business and on the regulatory
environment with clients, are you seeing more market share in areas where you guys are differentiating versus the
customers – or versus the competitors? And then, is there any nuance between like the high touch, the low touch, or

anything else? It just seems like the consistency and the traction has been just very consistent across the past, like, two
years.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we do – we are of the view – and I've talked about this on prior calls – of the view that we're
benefiting from a lot of investments in the business over many years. Goes back to early technology investments in the
business that enable us to execute on behalf of clients in all market environments, and do so on a cost-efficient basis, so
we're driving returns for stakeholders as well. It goes to the quality and content of the team so that it very much is
high-tech, high-touch, and the breadth of the franchise.
Talk about the nine box strategy because it's so core to the way the team runs it, and with this real maniacal focus
within each box, but then as we've talked about over many years now, a focus on what are the adjacencies so that as we
go deeper with clients in certain areas, they go deeper with us. And it is a very tightly run business that's delivering
results.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'd just add to that, Mike, that remember, coming out of the financial crisis, our prime
brokerage business clearly took a hit. And that has been rebuilt, and I think over time has actually gained share, and the
strength of that business has been a real additive. And secondly, these businesses do well in a large part because of the
quality of the leadership team running them. And we've had a very stable and strong deep leadership team running our
Equities business now for several years, and I think that makes a difference.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, you guys have set out the ROE target and
you hit kind of around that area this quarter. And, James, it sounds like when you talked about dialing up the risk, it
wasn't one of those quarters where everything worked. I mean, there was obviously good progress, but it could've been
better.
I just want to get a sense of when you guys look at some of the things that can improve in terms of the Wealth
Management pre-tax margin, things that you have control of, it still seems a little surprising when I think about a 10%
ROE, and then I look at your business, 20% is Fixed Income, and then 80% is Equities, Banking and Wealth
Management and Investment Management, things that we generally think of a higher ROE.
So when I think about going over the next couple quarters, years, besides the things that you guys have control of, are
there other things on the capital side or balance sheet side that'll continue to boost that ROE? And I know the ROTE is
higher, I think it's around 12% versus the 10%. But I just want to get your sense on what will be the drivers to improve
that side of the margin in the Wealth Management business.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, let me take a cut at that and I'm sure Ruth will add on. Firstly, I think a lot of
folks really haven't given much attention to the E part of this equation. When we started as a team five years ago, our E
was around $40 billion, it's now around $68 billion, I think. So, if we were still operating with the same equity we had
five years ago, our ROE would actually be in the order of magnitude 15%. Our ROTE well above that.
So, we've been through a major repositioning in this firm and the regulatory environment, and the key has been to put
ourselves in a position where we had enough capital where we wouldn't be needing to go out and raise capital and
accrete excess capital and so on. And ultimately the test of that would be successful CCAR capital distributions. We've
now had three years where we've lifted our dividend from $0.20 to $0.40 to now $0.60 here. Lifted our buyback from
$500 to $1 billion to now $2.5 billion and we expect to increase capital actions in the years ahead. So the E part of this
equation I think deserves a little bit of attention.
On the R side, two things are going on. One, we have a very, very focused non-comp expense program we've had in
process for a few years, which has a huge team here led by Charlie Chasin here, and they are very focused on that.
We're not going to let go or let hold of the non-comp side. And on the comp side, it's pretty clear. We said the ISG
comp to revenue ratio would be below 40%, indeed it was, and we're bringing down the comp to revenue ratio for the
other businesses as we build scale.
So then you look at where the opportunities are, and there are many, frankly. We're not yet in a global economy, which
is by any means robust. The Wealth Management full transition to the managed product hasn't yet occurred. The bank

loan products still got tremendous capacity there. We haven't seen the interest rate hike which we're going to get at
some point in the future. The M&A and ECM businesses clearly will pick up as the global economies pick up, and I
could go on with a long list.
So it's a – I'm giving you a long answer because it's a complicated multifaceted thing, but I would look at all of those
from – starting with the move to non-comp – same comp to revenue commitments, capital plans and then follow with
the particular revenue drivers in each of the businesses that exist today and are likely to exist in the changing high-rate
environment going forward.

Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, James, good morning, Ruth.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Morning.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: On the regulatory environment, the SEC seems to be focused on the potential abuse of
fee-based accounts, so-called reverse churning. Given Morgan Stanley's fee-based accounts have more than doubled
since 2009, curious as to what kind of controls or checks you have in place to ensure the proper use of fee-based
accounts at Morgan Stanley.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, this is one of those questions which, depending on the environment, you could
ask it one way or the other, a lot of people spend their time complaining about the churning on transaction type
accounts, which is why the fee-based industry has really evolved where certain clients have wanted the certainty of
knowing they pay one fee and with that, they either do none or as much transaction activity as they want to do.
So it seems to me to be a very natural market segmentation. There'll be some clients, for example, people with
large,restricted stock positions for which that would probably not be something they'd want to do. But for many others
who want more an advice-driven relationship, it obviously is.
So whether it's transaction activity or fee-based activity, we have an enormous compliance operation in our Wealth
Management division driven down to the branch level, both at the personal touch level and also at the model driven
level where we look for exceptions, which looks at suitability, concentration risk and all the other things that you would
expect to make sure that clients are properly served for the pricing that they're getting.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. That's helpful. A question on just the tax strategy, I think tax benefit seems to be a
recurring theme quarter after quarter. Just at a very high level, could you explain the firm's tax strategy and how we
should conceptually think about maybe tax benefits going forward?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, this quarter was the result of legal entity simplification consistent with resolution. We would
still guide you to around 30% as the effective tax rate on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. So there's no wide tax strategy or anything in that kind of nature we should think about?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. As I said, this was legal entity simplification and I'd guide you to 30%.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. A couple of cleanup questions. On the M&A backlog, I believe you said it was up
year-over-year, how does it look on a linked quarter basis?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It is up year-over-year and that is the way we've been looking at it.

<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. And then on the funding cost benefits, how should we think about the allocation between
FIC and Equities?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So as we've talked about on a number of calls, we allocate funding balance sheet liquidity down to
the product level, and it's really based on the asset mix and so that's the real driver of it, we have broken that out. But
it's going to benefit across sales and trading and it's a nice tailwind that is increasingly building through 2016 year.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So certainly pleased to see the ISG comp leverage really show through in the quarter in light
of the revenue strength. And I was just wondering how we should think about the comp leverage versus the full year
target of 39%, assuming you can actually deliver revenue growth for the full year.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So when we set the comp ratio, it's with a full year outlook. So the 38% is the full year outlook,
again that's all things equal, but that's the way it's set. We remain very committed to rewarding those who drive returns
and we think with the steps we've taken on comp structure and the operating leverage in the business, this is a full-year
outlook, again all things equal.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then maybe switching over to the capital side for a moment. We're certainly
pleased to see the significant build in the leverage ratio in the quarter. When parsing the individual components of that
ratio, it looks like the improvement was really driven by a reduction in SLR add-ons more so than anything else. And I
was just wondering if you could speak to what the current level is of those SLR add-ons and maybe how we should be
thinking about sources of future mitigation potential.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the benefit this quarter was really both numerator and denominator, you're absolutely right. In
the denominator, we have work streams against all the various gross ups and we had reductions in net long CDS sold
and we're benefiting from compression activity, which I would say industry-wide has become more business as usual,
which we think is a real positive. We were early on that and it's good to see it's been broadly embraced. But the
numerator clearly benefited from earnings in our preferred issuance earlier in the quarter.
So we remain focused on all of the items that are possible and logical for mitigation; compression, as I said, but across
the board, remain focused on ensuring if we're using balance sheet – where we're using a balance sheet, it continues to
provide the kind of returns commensurate with the capital that's being required here. And so it's again, a deep focus, but
it's both a numerator and a denominator benefit.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, thanks, Ruth. And then just lastly, on the Wealth Management side and specifically
the new long-term deposit target of $200 billion which Greg spoke to at a recent investor conference. In the past,
you've highlighted some metrics where maybe you're under-penetrated relative to peers to help drive future growth, and
was hoping in the context of this specific target whether you could highlight any specific metrics which would support
that additional growth towards that $200 billion.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as we've talked about, I say it so often, I'm sure you're tired of hearing it, but we're focused
on prudent loan growth across both Wealth Management and Institutional Securities. We do believe we have

meaningful upside from here, given the scale of the client base and the relative penetration in particular in Wealth
Management, we've talked about that. And the $200 billion deposit target is really married to our expected loan
demand over the next several years.
And so the execution plan on deposit growth as we looked at what is the loan potential, given these two large
franchises, the expectation for deposit growth was two phases, the contractual on-boarding from Citi and as I think you
know, that ends this quarter, the second quarter of 2015, but we are in an excess deposit position. Our loan to deposit
ratio is at 51%, and even if we load in standby liquidity to support loans, the ratio is at 74%. So we do have a nice
runway before we need additional deposits to support loan growth.
And then as we've talked about on the fourth quarter call and as Greg commented on, we have substantial organic
deposit growth opportunity given our client base. We still have a large portion that's cash held away but it's really
calculated with a lens to what is the loan growth opportunity across Wealth Management and Institutional Securities.
And we see quite a bit of opportunity from here against which we will execute over time prudently, leading with credit
risk management.

future opportunity.

Your next question from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: You had mentioned earlier about long-term debt cost coming down and I think
implied you're still early on in that process. Maybe if you could just size how much benefit you've had so far from that
and try and shape how much opportunity is still in front of us.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as we indicated from peak financing cost to end of 2016, it's down about 25%. And the
benefit comes in as we refinance debt that was issued post-crisis, given our credit spreads are meaningfully tighter. And
so, as the more of that we refinance, the greater the benefit, and that's why it legs in over time.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And do you have what the blended rate of your long-term debt is, the $155 billion?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I don't have that with me. It's in the filings. I just don't have it with me.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. But just I mean conceptually, are we halfway through or still – I mean, your
spreads have been coming in quite a bit, market rates have been coming down even just the past year here, so I would
think there's still a decent opportunity to bring those rates down.
<A - Ruth Porat>: There is a decent opportunity. Some of the debt that we refinanced was put on pre-crisis. And so
we're only now – we've only recently begun to tap into that portion of it that was put on post-crisis. So that at a certain
point it was actually – it was more of a headwind. It's been turning recently to become a tailwind and that's why we
called it out when we did. We delayed to call it out to kind of at the point at which we were starting not to refinance the
early 2000 debt, but what was put on post-crisis. That's why it's a delayed benefit here, delayed post to the contraction
we've seen in our credit spreads.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. That makes sense. All right. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow-up on the capital question. You guys are
substantially above on your Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, but on the SLR you're just slightly above the minimum. So
you have – how do you think about the interplay of the leverage versus the common equity to a point where you can
start to return even more of the common equity to maximize returns? Is there a lot more to go on the denominator in the
leverage ratio? Or does it mean potentially more preferreds to maximize shareholder returns? How do you guys think
about that dynamic over time and what kind of a cushion do you think you need on the SLR?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So I've already answered in response – part of it in response to an earlier question, which is we've
talked frequently about the way to maximize return of capital over the longer term is to have steady increases, no
discontinuous moves in the request for return of capital. And we're very pleased to have the ability this year at the $3.1
billion share repurchase over the five quarter period and the dividends up 50%.
So when we look at – when we look at the requirements, there are clearly a number, it's risk-based capital, it's SLR, it's
the CCAR process itself, it's how do you think about the stress losses. SLR obviously was not in CCAR in the last
round, but we have a forward-looking lens as we think about the business where we consider all of those factors. And
as we look to optimize the opportunity across the franchise, both from a returns perspective and the ability to return of
capital, we look through each one of those lenses.
At this point though, as I said, SLR hasn't been included in the CCAR process that would govern how much we can
return. But that obviously hasn't stopped us implementing strong work streams to mitigate the gross up in the
denominator as we've already talked about on this call. So you have to look at it all. You can't just tip to one versus the
other, and again, it's with a lens that we want to ensure we're providing balance sheet capital behind client activity and
doing it in the most constructive way. So, it's complicated, there's no question, with the multiplicity of requirements,
but that's what we've been managing against.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: No, I hear you, but on the CCAR, your constraining factors were more the Tier 1 ratios,
right, the leverage, the total capital. So I'm just trying to get a sense, do you think there's a lot more to do on the
denominator side, or do you think it would make more sense to issue more preferred to kind of deal with that? Or do
you think you have enough time to make more efficiencies on the balance sheet side? That's what I'm just trying to get
at.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Okay, sorry. So on that, part of it is the CCAR process itself. We were pleased this year that on one
input to the overall calculation in PPNR, the estimate by the Federal Reserve increased. We believe that reflects the
greater consistency we have in earnings. We put a lot of effort behind trying to clarify that and we're pleased that it
ticked up.
And when you look at what were some of the things that took total capital, the total capital calculation lower, the
leverage lower, there were the difference between estimates, firm and Federal Reserve on balance sheet growth or
RWAs over the period. And our view is that the test is a learning process, even though there's not that much
transparency in it, and that it's really about addressing some of those elements of it, so that's one component or
extremes on trying to narrow the gap between the Federal Reserve's estimates and the firm's estimates on things like
balance sheet growth. As a fair value firm, we don't see that kind of balance sheet growth.
And then on the second part of it, is of course ensuring that we're being very clinical and strict on balance sheet use and
other elements of it. We looked at all preferred and sub debt as ways to optimize capital over time and will continue to
do so. We've been doing that for the last couple of years.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: But, just think about where we've come from. The SLR we're at about 4.2%; a year
ago, we're at 5.1%. With some of the actions we took which actually depleted our capital in the last several months,
including the charge relating to the Attorney General action, Department of Justice in the charge relating to our
deferrals. So, the good news is we're above 5% now. We have several years to stay above 5%. We have several years to
work the balance sheet, and as necessary, use preferred securities. So we have a long runway to keep this in motion and
we're pretty confident we can stay above 5% and do the things that Ruth talked about.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Just a couple quick follow-ups here. So just on the bank and the strong loan demand, is it
reasonable to think that you could skew more towards loans? And you've presented, I think, you've given kind of
roughly 60% loans, the percentage of assets by 2016 end. Is that the optimal mix? Or if the demand is there, can we see
that mix look more kind of lending heavy?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Just 13 weeks ago, James refreshed our outlook on the six point plan and provide that we added
another year on the bank outlook, to give you a sense of the asset mix. And the real point of doing that was so that you
could model when do you expect a rate increase. We're giving you our outlook on asset mix, and there's no updates to
what was reviewed last quarter.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. All right, great. And then just coming back to the strength in EMEA in the quarter, it
sounds like that was more trading heavy in the trading businesses. And so, were there any specific areas that really
experienced improvement? And does that tone of activity still feel good and do you see that spilling into other
businesses?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, I've indicated it was in both Equities and in Fixed Income, in macro product. But as I noted,
it was not just Europe. We saw a focus on the opportunity in Asia, as well, and it's an early start to the quarter here.
And as we typically say at this point, a couple weeks is not a quarter.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ruth, I wanted to focus one more
question on the debt opportunity, and specifically on the legacy trust preferreds that you have outstanding. I think your
plan previously was to potentially redeem most if not all of those this year. I'm wondering what the timing is on that
based on your CCAR results this past go-round.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, we did include the redemption of trust in CCAR because it's expensive relative to where we
finance today and the rules are complicated, but we do remain focused on eliminating the drag. Now I think you asked
about CCAR, that was the piece we withdrew. We did not change our requested return of capital, the $3.1 billion in
share repurchase and the dividend increase of 50% weren't altered and we're pleased to have passed again qualitatively.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, and then just in terms of the Investment Banking trends, obviously, very strong
quarter across the franchise in trading. But I guess to James' earlier point, you're not hitting on all cylinders and
banking within ISG was a little bit less strong. Can you give us some color as to sort of your outlook as to the potential
opportunities or strengths within EMEA and Asia, specifically within the banking business?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I think, firstly, just looking at the banking franchise, it's a terrific franchise. So
we actually had a strong quarter, some others had very strong quarters and all power to them. We have a good pipeline.
We – obviously you – it's a lumpier business in any 13-week period than some of the other businesses, so you're going
to expect a little more bouncing around, so no concerns there. We are seeing a pick-up in Europe. Asia has been slow.
Japan was a little slower earlier in the year but we're starting to see some cross-border activity there. Well positioned,

strong franchises in Japan and China. So, I think the outlook remains very firm.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
James Patrick Gorman
So I think that brings this call to an end, and I just wanted to take a moment to thank our dear friend, Ruth. Wish her
well. I'm also sorry to see all the analysts who are now moving to the West Coast following her. We'll have to pick up
some others over here. But on a more serious note, she's been a great partner, has sat in the office next to me five years
and done a terrific job in helping get this firm back from the depths of the financial crisis. And it takes a great team.
Ruth had a great team working with her.
She followed also a terrific CFO who helped us navigate the crisis during an extraordinarily stressful period, Colm
Kelleher, and she now precedes another new CFO, as I said, Jon Pruzan, who I think will also be terrific. And
throughout it all, we've had a Deputy CFO that many of you have not heard on these calls, but has been in many, many
of the meetings with you, Paul Wirth, who's been an extraordinarily able and steady hand now through the last three
CFOs we've had at this firm, so great team. Thank you, Ruth. We wish you well. And don't forget us. We're going to
leave Ruth with something to remind her of Morgan Stanley, not that she would ever forget us. But we wish her the
best. And thanks, everybody, for a good call.
Ruth Porat
Thanks to all of you.
