Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Ellen. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, we recently held our 2015 Analyst and
Investor Meeting in New York, where we launched our new three-year operating plan and provided details on our
long-term growth opportunities from our large, low-cost-to-supply resource base. We outlined our capital and
production plans for the next few years and how we would achieve cash flow neutrality in 2017 at a range of
commodity prices. We also reaffirmed our commitment to a compelling dividend.
In the first quarter results we will discuss this morning, we're going to describe a quarter with strong production growth
and good cost control, but one where weak commodity prices overshadowed strong operational performance. If you'll
turn to slide 4, I'll cover our key highlights for the first quarter. We produced 1.61 million BOE per day, which is
growth of 5% compared to the same period last year, adjusted for Libya, dispositions and downtime. We achieved first
production at Eldfisk II, Bayu Undan Phase III and the Brodgar H3 subsea tie-back. We also advanced five major
projects toward startup by the end of the year, and that includes our two megaprojects at Surmont 2 and APLNG.
Financially, our earnings were materially impacted by low prices. We had a $222 million loss, or $0.18 a share after
adjusting out special items. We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations excluding impacts from working capital,
and ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in cash.
Costs are a big focus this year. At our Analyst and Investor Meeting, we announced the goal to reduce operating costs
by $1 billion in 2016 versus 2014, and we're already moving the needle. We've made significant progress on capturing
deflationary capital benefits in our capital program, which we also outlined at our analyst meeting; strategically
announced our new three-year operating plan that provides predictable growth for about $11.5 billion of capital per
year. We are making good progress on implementing that plan this year as we ramp down activity across the portfolio.
We still grow high-margin volumes at this CapEx level and in 2015 we plan to deliver production growth from
continuing operations without Libya of 2% to 3% compared to 2014. Now I will turn to slide 5 for more of a discussion
on earnings.
Production came in at the high end of guidance. We also saw improvement in our operating costs which, as we
discussed at the analyst meeting, includes production and operating costs, SG&A, and exploration expenses, excluding
dry holes and leasehold impairment. Those costs improved 7% compared to the first quarter last year. When you adjust
out the restructuring charges, which were a special item for the quarter, you see a 12% improvement in our cost.
However, sharply lower prices overwhelmed that performance. Realized prices were down 30% compared to last
quarter and down 48% compared to the first quarter of 2014. That contributed to the first quarter adjusted loss of $222
million, or the $0.18 a share.
First quarter segment-adjusted earnings are shown in the lower right side of this chart. The financial details for each
segment can be found in the supplemental data on our website. And segment earnings are roughly in line with our
sensitivities except for the Lower 48 where adjusted earnings were differentially impacted by lower realizations both in
absolute terms and relative to markers.
This impact wasn't just from crude but also from NGLs and natural gas. Lower 48 earnings also reflected the
previously announced dry hole expense from Harrier. And the Other International segment adjusted earnings were
driven by the Omosi-1 dry hole in Angola.
If you will turn to slide 6, I will summarize our production results for the quarter. Our production slide follows our
usual convention of continuing operations excluding Libya. Our first quarter production averaged 1.61 million BOE per
day compared to 1.53 million BOE per day in the first quarter of 2014.
The waterfall shows downtime and dispositions were essentially flat year-over-year. That leaves net growth of 82,000
BOE per day, or 5% growth compared to last year. And of the 82,000 BOE, 61,000 BOE of the improvement comes
from liquids – that's mostly from oil sands in Canada – unconventionals in the Lower 48 and Gumusut in Malaysia. Gas
was up 21,000 BOE and some of that is from domestic gas sales at APLNG that will turn to LNG over time.

Now if you turn to the next slide, I will review our cash flow waterfall. We started the year with $5.1 billion in cash.
During the quarter we generated $2.1 billion from operating activities. This reflects an environment where Brent was at
$54 and WTI was at $48.50, and as you know current prices in the strip are higher than these numbers. Moving through
the chart, we saw a negative impact of about $300 million from working capital. For the quarter we spent $3.3 billion in
capital expenditures and investments. As you would expect, capital is front-end loaded and tapers off through the year
as we complete our major projects and ramp down our activity in unconventionals, so that number is not ratable.
After paying our dividend, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
Before I leave this slide let me mention an item that you'll notice on the cash flow statement in our supplemental
information regarding deferred taxes. In the quarter, we had a $555 million benefit to earnings as a result of a change in
tax laws in the U.K. This is a special item and not included in our adjusted earnings. This income benefit did not create
an immediate cash flow benefit, so on the cash flow statement the income benefit is reversed out on the deferred tax
line, which is why the deferred tax line on the cash flow statement shows a large negative this quarter. Without this tax
law change, deferred taxes would've been about an $85 million use of cash in the quarter.
I'll wrap up my comments on the next slide with some guidance for the rest of the year. We provided guidance at our
Analyst and Investor Meeting earlier this month. We're not making any changes to the guidance. But I do want to walk
through some of the trends and profiles as we go through the year, since most of our first quarter metrics aren't ratable.
We remain on track to achieve our 2% to 3% production growth this year. Our second quarter production guidance is
1.555 million BOE to 1.595 million BOE per day. This reduction from our first quarter mostly reflects the start of our
seasonal major turnaround activity.
As I just mentioned, we expect capital to decrease throughout the year and we remain on track for $11.5 billion of
capital this year.
Our operating cost guidance of $9.2 billion remains unchanged. We did better on a run rate basis in the first quarter and
as we continue to work on lowering costs. We could see further improvement in our cost guidance for the year,
especially if the U.S. dollar stays strong, but we're holding to the current guideline for now. We expect costs to be
higher in the second and third quarters as we go into heavy turnaround season. We'll also see some higher cost in the
fourth quarter associated with our major project startups.
There's no change to our exploration, dry hole and impairment guidance of $800 million for the year. We were at
higher than that rate in this quarter, and we'll keep you updated throughout the year. DD&A looked a little low on run
rate, but we expect to end the year at about $9 billion. This reflects mix shift changes in major projects coming online
through the year. Finally, our corporate segment is in line with guidance.
That concludes the review of our financial performance and guidance. The theme you should be hearing is that we're
focused on executing a prudent plan and we're delivering on our operational commitment.
Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations.
Matthew J. Fox
Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. To begin, I'll quickly look through our segment results for the quarter and then
conclude with a preview of some key activities to look out for in 2015. As Jeff mentioned, we had a strong quarter
operationally, achieving the high end of our production guidance, and we did that by reducing capital and operating
costs and maintaining our relentless focus on safety. So let's jump into a review of the segment performance starting
with the Lower 48 and Canada on slide 10.
In the Lower 48, first quarter production averaged 542,000 BOE per day. That's a 7% overall increase from the first
quarter of last year and represents a 16% increase in crude oil production. Production grew in the unconventionals, but
as we previously announced growth will begin to slow as we see the impact of reducing the number of rigs in
operation.

Overall in Lower 48 we had 15 operated rigs running at the end of April, which is more than a 50% reduction from the
end of 2014. As a result of fewer rigs, we expect production growth to slow in the second quarter and begin a slight
decline in the second half of the year.
At our recent Analyst and Investor Meeting we gave you a lot of detail on pilot tests, and we're continuing to run those
tests across the segment. In addition to our unconventional activities in the Lower 48, exploration and appraisal activity
continues in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We currently have appraisal wells drilling at Gila and Tiber; unfortunately
Harrier was a dry hole.
Next I'll cover Canada. We saw strong growth from our Canadian business segment during the quarter. We produced
318,000 BOE per day, a 14% year-over-year increase. This growth came primarily from our oil sands assets, with
bitumen production increasing 26% compared to the first quarter of 2014. In Western Canada, we successfully
completed our winter drilling program with activity focused primarily in the Clearwater, Clair and Montney areas. This
activity will reduce as we ramp down our rigs from a high of 10 in the quarter to two for the remainder of the year.
In the oil sands we're seeing strong performance from Christina Lake and Foster Creek, with production continuing to
ramp up at Foster Creek Phase F. In the Surmont 2, construction is more than 93% complete and final preparations are
underway in anticipation of first steam by the middle of the year.
Next I'll cover off our Alaska and Europe segments on slide 11. Alaska's average production was 186,000 BOE per
day, and activity this quarter was focused on several major projects. CD5, a new development on the west side of
Alpine, is more than 75% complete. Drilling has already commenced and we're moving ahead with pipeline and
module installation.
At Kuparuk, Drill Site 2S facility construction is on schedule and drilling will commence in the second quarter. Both
CD5 and 2S are on schedule for start-up in the fourth quarter of this year. And we sanctioned the first phase of the
Northeast West Sak development, the 1H NEWS project, in Kuparuk in March, and we expect to see first production in
2017. In addition to progress on these projects, we resumed operations of the Kenai LNG plant with exports expected
to recommence in May.
Moving on to Europe, first quarter production averaged 209,000 BOE per day. We saw two startups this quarter, at
Eldfisk II and Brodgar. Eldfisk II production will continue to ramp through the year as we bring additional wells
online, and the Brodgar H3 subsea tie-back well achieved first gas in March. Enochdhu is also progressing on schedule
and should start in the third quarter.
Now let's review our Asia Pacific and Middle East segments and Other International segment on slide 12. In APME,
we produced 351,000 thousand BOE per day in the first quarter. This is a 10% increase compared to the first quarter of
last year, primarily as a result of new production from major project startups at Gumusut and SNP in Malaysia. The
Gumusut floating production system is continuing to ramp up with full-field production currently exceeding 150,000
BOE per day on a gross basis. At HBB – at KBB, sorry, production remains constrained awaiting third-party pipeline
repairs. We achieved first gas from our Bayu Undan Phase III program in March and production is continuing to ramp
up. The APLNG project was more than 90% complete at the end of March. We achieved first fire from one of our gas
turbine generators in April, and we're progressing toward startup in the third quarter.
In our Other International segment, we're continuing to focus on our exploration and appraisal programs. In Angola we
spudded the Vali well this month, and we'll update you on our progress there next quarter. We announced a dry hole at
Omosi, where we encountered a gas column and subsequently plugged the well. In Senegal, planning continues for an
appraisal program in the fourth quarter. Finally, in Libya our production remains shut-in due to ongoing unrest and it
remains out of our production guidance for the year.
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks on slide 13 with some key activities to watch in 2015. As Jeff mentioned, we're on
track to deliver 2% to 3% production growth this year. For the second quarter, we expect to produce 1.555 million BOE
to 1.595 million BOE per day. The key driver is the typical turnaround activity that you see in the upper-right chart.
Our major turnaround activity for the year is scheduled in Alaska, Europe and APME in the second and third quarters.

These large turnarounds start in June, so we'll see an impact on production in the second quarter with the most
significant impact in the third quarter. In the Lower 48 we expect production to begin to decline in the second half of
the year, reflecting our reduced rig count. As I just mentioned, we ended April with 15 rigs and we expect to run 12 rigs
through the second half of the year.
Moving to major projects, we have five startups expected before the end of the year: at Surmont 2, APLNG, Enochdhu,
CD5 and Drill Site 2S. Production from these five projects were minimal in 2015 but will provide momentum going
into 2016. We also have exploration and appraisal activity underway. As I said earlier, we spudded the Vali well in
Angola this month. We plan to start drilling the Vernaccia and Melmar wells in the Gulf of Mexico in the second and
fourth quarters respectively, and we expect to spud the Cheshire well in Nova Scotia in the fourth quarter. In Senegal,
we plan to start appraisal work before the end of the year and we'll continue to appraise our existing discoveries in the
Gulf of Mexico.
So that's a quick review of the segments. We gave you a lot of information at the recent Analyst and Investor Meeting,
so there's not a lot new to add. We are paying close attention to the things we can control by safely executing our
operating plan, capturing capital and operating cost improvements and creating value for shareholders.
So this ends our prepared remarks, and now we'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have Douglas Terreson
from Evercore ISI online with a question. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Todd Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hello, Doug.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Hello, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Todd Terreson>: A key element of the path to cash flow neutrality that you guys talked about at the
analyst meeting for the next few years, there is the shift in spending away from the capital-intensive project in the oil
sands and also in LNG and towards unconventionals. And on this point, I wanted to see if we could get an update on
when you expect Surmont and APLNG to commence operations and therefore for spending to be significantly
curtailed. And second, is a $2 billion reduction in spending, which is about 20% of the budget, kind of a reasonable
order of magnitude-type reduction for these two projects or is that too high? So if we could just get some color on what
to expect on capital spending declines.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So, Doug, on Surmont 2 we expect to have first steam sometime relatively soon, certainly by
the middle of the year. APLNG we expect to start up there in the third quarter. So it's pretty much in line still with what
we discussed at analyst day and what we have been expecting for some time. As we move from 2015 into 2016, we will
see about a $2 billion reduction in capital associated with those projects. But that won't be seen from start-up
immediately, because we'll still have capital being spent on both of those projects through the end of the year. But
between 2015 and 2016, it's about a $2 billion reduction.
<Q - Douglas Todd Terreson>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Thank you, Doug.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Matt, one of the things that has changed since the analyst day is unfortunately you had a couple
dry holes with a sizable write-off. I guess I'm mindful that you had a lot of obligations on drilling this year and
exploration, but when you consider $1.5 billion on exploration relative to, let's say, M&A opportunities, whether it be
bolt-on working interest in the onshore or something like that, how does your exploration appetite look post-2015 once
those obligations have rolled off? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Clearly we're disappointed in the results we've had from Angola so far. We, and the whole
industry in fact, expected that that pre-salt play in the Kwanza Basin should have similar characteristics to the pre-salt
play in Brazil, but it's not panning out that way so far. On the other hand, we were really pleased with the results that
we had in Senegal, which on the face of it was a more risky play. And there, as we said, we've proven two different
play types in the basin. We're looking forward to getting back there. Of course, as you know, that's the nature of
exploration.
In terms of a sort of longer-term role for exploration, we see exploration's role to supplement the resource portfolio
with additional opportunities to sustain long-term growth. And we're exploring in plays where we think we can do that
at a competitive cost to supply.
And over the last five years or so exploration has delivered a lot of success. Remember the Eagle Ford was an
exploration success for us. And during that time, we've been building the deepwater portfolio focused initially in the
Gulf of Mexico, and we already have significant discoveries there, too; three discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico in
addition to Senegal. So we're continuing to test the portfolio, but clearly exploration has to compete for capital in what
is a very competitive investment portfolio, as we outlined when we described the resource base and the cost of supply
of that resource base a few weeks ago. We see that as good discipline to make sure that we're only committing to
exploration opportunities that we think can compete against our resource base.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I guess kind of a related question. I was going to have another follow-up but I don't want to take
up too much time, so maybe I'll stick with this one. But I'm thinking really more, Matt, about the scale of the
discretionary capital because $1.5 billion is still a decent chunk of your spending this year. So where would you expect
that to move toward, let's say, in a low oil price environment should this continue? I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Well, in the operating plan that we laid out a few weeks ago, we are
anticipating a level of about $1.5 billion this year, next year, and in 2017. We can revisit that to some extent but that's
our expectation as sort of an average over the next three years.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. Thanks very much.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hello, Paul.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: A couple of quickies. You mentioned on Libya that you're shut in. Is that for sure shut
in or could someone else be producing those volumes? And the follow-up, which is also fairly quick, I think, is, can
you talk a little bit more about the Kenai sales? I'm not sure who's buying that or how you're selling it. And then I have
a longer-term follow-up, please.

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So Libya, yeah, the production's shut in and we're confident that that's shut in in the Waha
concession. So nobody else is producing it. The Kenai, we started operations up this month. We'll sell their cargoes
starting next month. We're going to sell five cargoes or six cargoes and they are going to Japan.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Is that kind of spot sales, Matt?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Got it. Matt, one of the things that people have been talking since your analyst meeting
is your comments on the pilot that you ran and pilots that you continue to run in the Eagle Ford. Could you just expand
and talk about what could be next catalyst in terms of news flow on those pilots? Thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, thank you, Paul. So we are running several different pilots in the Eagle Ford. In
particular in the Upper Eagle Ford we're running I think it's seven different pilots across different parts of the Eagle
Ford to test the triple-stack concept that we talked about and just to understand what parts of our geographic extent of
the Eagle Ford is going to be amenable to the triple-stack development. So those pilots are going to be drilled as we go
through this year and we'll start to see results as we head into next year.
So I don't expect it to draw any definitive conclusions on just how much of an aerial extent will be developed that way
until maybe the later part of next year, frankly, because a lot of this is understanding do the wells begin to interfere with
each other. And you don't see that early in the well's life. And of course we're still running the stimulated rock volume
pilot that we talked about and we're going to get a lot of new information from that this year that'll be important from a
longer-term basis in terms of optimizing the Eagle Ford as a whole and other unconventional plays that we have in the
portfolio.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Yeah, Matt, just remind us what the uplift is in terms of performance that you I think
were anticipating, if I'm not wrong. I can't remember if you'd seen initial results or whether you were anticipating.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, the initial results from single-well pilots in the Upper Eagle Ford basically showed the
production was the same as the Lower Eagle Ford. But what we haven't tested yet is when those are drilled, in the
context of a pattern of wells, do we see interference. And that's what we're testing with these seven pilots that we're
running now.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: So there was actually a number I think that's associated with what you might get in
terms of improved performance.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No, I don't think we went into that yet, Paul, because we really need to understand the nature
of these pilots, how they perform when they're confined with other wells. We didn't actually make any real prediction
about what we expect to find. We'd rather do that after we've seen the pilot test results.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Okay. And you said this is something that's going to take a bit of time to really – maybe
by next analyst meeting, I guess.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, it's possible. But it may take even longer than that. We don't want to jump the gun on it.
We're definitely encouraged, as we said a few weeks ago, but we want to make sure that we're calibrating properly
before we make any claims about what the incremental reserves will be, for example.
<Q - Paul Benedict Sankey>: Got it. Thanks, Matt. Thank you, all.

<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Two quick questions. Matt, can you share what is APLNG, the cash operating costs and the tax
regime?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We're not in the operating phase yet for APLNG, so I don't have the operating cost number off
the top of my head. The tax regime is a tax on royalty regime with the royalties at the Queensland level and taxes at the
federal level.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So is it typical like 10% on the royalty and 30% PBT, or PIT?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes. It's actually not fully resolved yet. There's some discussions still underway with the
Queensland government on the nature of how the royalty will calculate. So I can't really give you a definitive answer
on that yet, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And most of the other...
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I'll add a little bit to what Matt said on the tax side. The taxes are actually paid down at the
APLNG kind of corporate level and there's going to be, as you can imagine with a big capital investment project like
that from a cash flow perspective, a fair bit of tax shield from depreciation on the investment, particularly in the early
years of the project.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So, Jeff, does that mean that during the first five years that we should assume there's not really
have the tax that APLNG need to pay?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I don't know that I could give you that precisely the number. That depends upon price levels as
well. But if we had current kind of prices, that's probably not a bad assumption.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And then, Matt, can you – maybe I missed it – can you tell me what is the Eagle Ford,
Bakken and Permian production in the first quarter? And if you have any number you could share in terms of the exit
rate for this year.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, the Eagle Ford was around 175,000 barrels a day in the first quarter and the Bakken was
around 55,000 barrels a day in the first quarter. And the Permian was less than 10,000 barrels on the unconventional
side. We also had significant conventional production, but in the shale side it was less than 10,000 barrels. So what we
expect to happen, Paul, is the aggregate production from the unconventionals is going to grow a little bit into the
second quarter. And then it's going to gradually decline as we exit the year. So the fourth quarter exit rate is going to be
quite similar to the first quarter rate in aggregate for the shale plays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And you start increasing the rig count next year again, I think that's the current plan. So
we should assume that there will be a resume to growth, or that the increasing rig count for next year will be only
sufficient that your whole year's flat?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: It depends a bit on the pace that we build the rigs back up. But you should really assume that
it's going to hold it flat because by the time we get the wells back and running again before drilling and completion and
hookup and bring them on to production, we're actually going to see the declining production from those plays continue
into the early part of 2016 and then start to increase towards the end of 2016. And based on our current assessment of
how we'll put rigs back to work there, we'll probably be relatively flat from the average of 15 to the average of 6.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul.

<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Hey, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Sorry. Can you hear me better?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Sorry. So a couple of questions. There have been several recent news stories around some of your
M&A efforts of potential assets you might consider selling. Any additional commentary that you might add regarding
potential M&A programs? Are these people approaching you? Are these assets that you're marketing? Are we still
looking at kind of smaller $500 million, $1 billion-size deals? Any thoughts around that?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, we're always, with a portfolio of our size, looking at what can we do in the way of
portfolio optimization. As we go forward we're not going to be pre-announcing that we're marketing particular assets.
You'll hear stories probably out in the marketplace that we're testing values on that, and that's what we'll always be
doing as part of a prudent optimization of the portfolio.
As we've said, I think it's prudent to think in terms of a company our size will do something with its asset portfolio
every year and we talked about it, whether that's $1 billion or so a year is probably a good go by. It really just depends
on whether we're getting full value for the assets. It's always about whether we can sell the assets for at least what we
think we could receive from them in value if we kept them in our portfolio, and we don't know what that number's
going to be. But there will be some level of asset sale.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks. And maybe shifting gears a little bit, in Alaska I know at the analyst meeting you
guys have given guidance on Alaska production and you have a couple of projects starting up later this year. I guess
can you talk a little bit about your production expectation in Alaska and maybe about if the industry, we're seeing
differentials kind of bounce around quite a bit? Maybe as you look out one year or two years, what's the direction that
you would expect in terms of kind of crude realizations and activity levels in general in Alaska?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we expect with the major projects that we're doing and the development drilling that we're
doing in Alaska that we're likely to hold production relatively flat for the next three years, and beyond that actually.
And we are a reasonably good representation of the overall Alaska production because we are in the [indiscernible]
(33:22) of the big production areas there of Prudhoe, Kuparuk and Alpine. So I think if you look at us, our macro view
of Alaska, that wouldn't be a bad basis to think about that.
In terms of realizations, I think current realizations are for EMS crude are about $2 or $3 below Brent. We have taken
one cargo this year to Asia and one last year and we're obvious of that option if that's what we choose to do.

And our next question is from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I know Conoco remains focused on your yield bridging to cash flow
neutrality, yet how would you respond to a commodity recovery? Meaning will you seek to increase cash cushion,
balance sheet repair to some level which might kind of dictate or delay any potential re-acceleration?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think our first reaction to an increase in prices is going to be to reduce the amount of cash we
use or the amount of debt we might borrow, particularly as we think about activity levels in 2015 and 2016.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Any idea in terms of kind of levels or pricing that you would need to see to re-accelerate?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think in the near term I'm not sure we see a price level that would cause us to re-accelerate. We
are going to want to see that if there is some acceleration in prices that it's got a more lasting effect as well. We are
taking – if you think about what's going on with our capital program, as Matt mentioned earlier we have a couple
billion dollars rolling off from Surmont and APLNG and we are in our plans already accelerating capital spending in

places like North American unconventionals as we go into 2016.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Right, right. No, I understood that. Maybe to the other side, I mean can you quantify or provide a
range of how much more you could borrow and still maintain your A rating?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That's a bit of a – I don't think I can actually quantify that because the rating agencies won't tell
you exactly what number that is. I think we would characterize it the same way we characterized it on our call last time
that we think the amount that we do borrow is going to be – it could be enough that would cause us to see a one-notch
downgrade from what's currently A1 at Moody's and the middle single A with Standard & Poor's and with Fitch. And
as you've seen all the agencies do have our credit rating outlook on a negative so they're anticipating that. But if that
were to happen that would move us into a range where we're comfortable that there's plenty of space there to meet
whatever borrowing needs we might have in 2015 and 2016 as we head towards cash flow neutrality in 2017.

And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yeah, I just wanted to dive a little bit into shale again. I've seen some very strong
performance from you guys this year, even stronger in the Bakken. I mean is there anything you're doing differently
this year?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I mean we're continuing to work through our optimizations, Ed, that we discussed a little bit a
few weeks ago, optimizing the completion design and the well end through well placement and so on. I wouldn't say
that there's anything fundamentally different going on there, but we are moving towards more pad drilling. 90% of our
wells will be from pad drilling, but there's not a fundamental change there. The guys are just executing well.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And then on the shale program and I'm seeing a massive cut in rigs, I mean and
obviously you do modeling on volumes probably to a far greater degree than we do from the outside. But are there any
risks that you undershoot on volumes or you feel pretty comfortable about the trajectory you just outlined?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I feel pretty comfortable about the answer I gave earlier on what we expect of our Eagle Ford
and Permian and Bakken production to do this year and into next year, assuming that we do increase our rigs the way
that we intend to next year.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And then coming back to Doug's question on some people are going to focus a lot
on cash flow margins and you've got these big projects coming up. When do you reckon that APLNG, Surmont will
sort of hit what you think is sort of peak operational cash flow? Obviously whatever the macro gives at that point is a
separate discussion.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so peak, on both of them really for different reasons peak operational cash flow is in
2017. So for Surmont 2, it's because it takes a while as you know to build the steam chambers and ramp up production
in the SAGD projects. And in the case of APLNG we will bring the first train on this year. It will be next year before
we bring the second train on, so the first year that we'll have both trains running will be 2017. So in both cases, it will
be 2017 before they're fully contributing at their planned-for rate. And of course that rate will continue on both projects
for decades.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yeah, very clear. Thanks very much.

And the next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, hi. Two quick ones. You cut your Lower 48 rigs by over half. How many frac spreads
are you running, Matt?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Let's see, I would say overall we are probably running three or four. It varies a little bit, but I
think three full-time and four occasionally. So that's our total spread to support those rigs.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Great. In Angola, you had a passing comment about you being disappointed with the
geology. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that? That's it for me.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Okay. We've had two dry holes there in the campaign. The first, the Kamoxi was basically the
reservoir wasn't developed there. As you know better than most, these carbonate reservoirs are quite difficult to predict
the porosity development. And in the case of Kamoxi, the porosity just wasn't developed there. For Omosi, the porosity
was developed. We did see good reservoir faces, but it was gas-filled. So the [ph] fat cherry (40:12) of it that was
feeding into Omosi was overcooked. So two different reasons for the failures in those wells. And that basin as a whole
is a bit less predictable than we had hoped going in.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thank you.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: The Vali well that we're drilling is actually testing a different play than the Omosi and Kamoxi
wells were. So we'll see how that goes.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks.

And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Hey, folks. Good morning. Jeff, back on the balance sheet discussion previously, I'm just
curious can you remind me if Libya had [audio gap] (40:51)?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, we have not impaired Libya. For us, we would have to see that there was some kind of view
that there was a permanent loss of that concession before we'd really need to do an impairment.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay. Offhand, do you remember what kind of capital employed or anything on that
asset?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I don't know that I'd know that number off the top of my head. It's on the order of a half a billion
dollars, but I'm not sure exactly what that number is.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: No worries. That's fine. The second question, there's been a lot of discussion with the
recent rise in commodity prices here with some of the E&Ps potentially layering in hedges. I know historically that's
not been something that Conoco has enacted, but I didn't know if there was any new internal debate as to the potential
benefits of doing that, specifically for your Lower 48 activity.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No. We take a portfolio approach to thinking about our cash flows. So we wouldn't really think
about doing it for one particular part of our portfolio. Generally our philosophy that we've talked about before hasn't
changed. But we feel like hedging is by definition a kind of zero-sum game in terms of value. And one of the reasons
we keep a strong balance sheet is to be able to handle the fluctuations in commodity prices.

And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Good morning. Good afternoon.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Neil.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Hey, Neil.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: So there's been a lot of talk, sticking with the Lower 48, at what price signal does U.S. shale
production start re-accelerating. And as a major U.S. player, not speaking specific to your portfolio, I just wanted to get
your perspective at what level that might occur, whether it's $60 WTI or $65 WTI or the range of outcomes? And how
quickly can the industry bring back that production, and what potential bottlenecks to bring that supply back online
are?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Neil, I can't speak for the industry as to what price signal they might be looking for. I assume
it would be cash flow will have a big impact on that as well. But in our plans, we are planning the increases beginning
2016 modestly, but we're going to increase as we move into 2016. And that's in anticipation that there will be some
continued recovery in prices. In terms of the capacity, clearly we've laid down quite a bit of rig and completion
capacity and that can be brought back relatively quickly. It's a flexible industry that we have in the Lower 48, so
exactly how quickly people bring these back on will be a function of the cash that we want to put back in and what they
see as being efficient and safe way to bring the rigs and the completion crews back to work. So I don't think I answered
your question very satisfactorily but that's the best I've got.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: No. You got me there philosophically. Matt, I should have asked you this question at the analyst
day, but the billion dollars of the cost-reduction program, that operating cost-reduction target, how sensitive is that to
the commodity price or do you think that is commodity-agnostic?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No. Our intention is to make that commodity-agnostic for the most part. We're looking to get
sustainable cost reductions through this effort. We're going to get some fluctuations associated with exchange rates and
with changes in the deflationary environment. But our focus is on getting structural cost reductions that we can sustain
through the cycles.

And your next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, or good afternoon, as the case may be. I guess I'd like to ask
about the price realization. It seemed a little bit, at least relative to our expectations, a little weak in the first quarter
both on oil and gas. And I was wondering how much of that may just be a function of timing, how much of that is
maybe some of the differentials we've seen for mix production, kind of oil, condensate, NGLs, et cetera, working its
way through. The final part of that question, as prices have been recovering, does that help on realizations as we think
about Q2 and Q3 potentially?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So what we saw in the first quarter was that realizations were probably weaker than what people
were expecting, primarily in the Lower 48. For example, I think our Lower 48 crude oil realization was closer to $40,

where WTI was like at $48.50 or so for the quarter. What we're seeing was just a tough quarter for realizations. A lot of
supply in the marketplace. The differentials that we're seeing are not that different – that we saw in the first quarter are
not that different when we were in a $50 price environment than they were when we were in a much higher-price
environment, but still kind of that same level of differentials. I think we would expect to see differentials improve in
terms of percent of marker-realized, and maybe some slight improvement in absolute levels of differentials as well.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: The differentials were tough because they were tough across all commodities for us in the
Lower 48, as well. It was tough on NGLs, oil and natural gas.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Yeah, I was just wondering is there any – I don't remember all the exact moving parts right
here, but I'm just saying was that a function of anymore – either a lighter crude that you were selling or a condensate
barrel or it just is what it is? I'm just trying to kind of...
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit that's just what the market was in the first quarter. There's nothing
really that fundamentally changed in our product mix or the quality of any of the products that we're selling that would
lead to that kind of differential.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thanks. And then unrelated follow-up, the change in taxes in the U.K. Can you give an
idea of maybe how you'd characterize that? Is it a – that really helped, it's a nice first step but we need to see more?
Does it change anything in terms of how you think about investing over the next, say, two years, which seems pretty
well locked-down in terms of expectations on the CapEx side but it could help in a post-2017 environment.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, Roger. It helps. The U.K. sector needs as much help as it can get. So the help on the tax
rates was welcomed. The simplification and broadening of the uplift on capital is going to help as well. It's about 12%
uplift now on capital when you go through the math. So we'll built it in our thinking as we're thinking about our overall
investment portfolio over the next few years, but it certainly was a move in the right direction by the U.K. government.

And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question. Your guidance for exploration and dry hole, $800 million
for the year. You said it's unchanged, but it looked like Q1 was well above your annual run rate. So does that imply that
there's going to be a significant reduction in that expense line item as the year progresses?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes, it does. By its nature, dry hole cost is going to be pretty lumpy and we happened to have
both the Harrier well and the Omosi well in Angola hit in the first quarter. You could have quarters where the number's
really low if no well actually gets to TD during that quarter, and it could be lumpy again later in the year. But as we
look at the overall balance of the year, we think the guidance that we gave at the analyst presentation still makes sense.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. And then you've talked about some of the areas where you were seeing cost savings
that look pretty encouraging. Are there any operating areas where, on the other hand, costs have been surprisingly
sticky, where you're not seeing the savings that perhaps you would have anticipated by this point?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Are you talking about operating costs, Pavel, or capital costs?

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so what we're seeing is a more rapid response in the Lower 48 than in other parts of the
company. And we expect to see some deflation kicking in. And we already are seeing some in our International
business, but it's coming more slowly, which is what we would anticipate. It's coming more slowly from the
International business. But it's come very rapidly in the Lower 48. But we've built that sort of trend as we anticipated
into our expectations of deflation, and we do expect to see those reductions coming in the International over the next
several months.

<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks. Good morning. Matt, just wanted to get your views on the recent industry debate on
refracking in the unconventional, and if I could ask two questions on that. First, from Conoco's vantage point, what is
new in the technology offering that you are seeing? And second, within your portfolio where do you see the most
relevance? And if you could frame that on a risk-reward context, please.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so we have been running some refracks in our portfolio, some using the diverter
technology, some just basically straight pumping new fracks on existing pairs and some with new pairs. So we've been
testing a few. The area that we're seeing the best uplift is, as you'd expect, are older wells where we pump smaller jobs
with wider spacing. So we see some potential there and it's particularly in wells that were drilled a few years ago, not
on more recently-drilled wells. So we're continuing to evaluate that, but there is certainly some upside potential.
