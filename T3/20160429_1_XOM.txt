MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings call. My
comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the investors section of our website. Before we
go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.
Turning now to slide three. Let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. Exxon Mobil
earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations
and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business
enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control, including effective cost management,
reliable performance and operational integrity. The highlight this quarter is our strong chemical results which
underscore significant gas and liquids cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across
the value chain.

Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter we benefited from
recent capacity additions while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to effectively manage
our spending while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand and importantly, grow
shareholder value.
Moving now to slide four, we'll provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global
economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the US, estimates indicate growth has slowed further since
late 2015. In China, growth continued to decelerate, however economies in Japan and Europe showed some modest
improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last quarter
while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distillate demand and continued
surplus inventory. However chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower feed and energy costs.
Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide five. As indicated, Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings were
$1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just
over $5 million, down $2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015, reflecting continued steady progress on our
investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled
$4.8 billion and debt was $43.1 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances increased from
$3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in
our ongoing asset management program yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion. Debt
and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion which included the impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. Exxon
Mobil will continue to limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and
programs but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding.
Earlier this week the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.75 per share, a 2.7% increase
from last quarter, marking our 34th consecutive year of per-share dividend growth.
Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings decreased $3.1
billion from a year ago quarter. Lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Chemical
results and lower corporate costs.
The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter, down from 33% a year ago, reflecting changes in our
segment earnings mix and one-time favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average,
corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years.
In a sequential quarter comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased by $970 million as stronger Chemical
results partly offset lower Upstream and Downstream earnings.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine, Upstream earnings decreased $2.9
billion from a year-ago quarter, resulting in a segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased
earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel and gas realizations fell more than $2.25 per
thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million. All other items decreased earnings
another $250 million where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced
operating expenses.
Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8% to more than 4.3 million barrels
per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Now liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5%
driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio.
However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was
more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts and lower entitlement
volumes.

Turning now to the sequential comparisons starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the
fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas
fell almost $0.75 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million
including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million,
reflecting lower operating expenses partly offset by lower favorable tax effects.
Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes were also up 77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids
production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day, up 2.3% from ramp-up of new project volumes. Natural gas
production was up 120 million cubic feet per day reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by
regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements.
Moving now to the Downstream results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million, a
decrease of $760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $860
million, partly offset by $100 million of all other items primarily favorable foreign exchange effects.
Turning to slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by
$470 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects mainly from increased European maintenance activities decreased
earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset adding $170 million mostly from lower
expenses.
Moving now to Chemical results starting on slide 15. First quarter earnings were $1.4 billion, up $370 million versus
the prior-year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by
$250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million while all other items added another $40 million,
again from lower expenses.
Moving to slide 16. Sequentially, Chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty
margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses.
Turning now to slide 17. As you may be aware, Standard & Poor's reduced its credit rating on Exxon Mobil by one
notch to AA+ with a stable outlook. Earlier this month, Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the corporation
with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the corporation's conservative
financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive
terms remains strong. Exxon Mobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to
create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. Exxon Mobil has a long history of prudently
managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles and we fully expect to
manage through this one under those same prudent financial principles.
Moving now to slide 18, and an update on Upstream projects and the exploration program. Four major project startups
year-to-date added 170,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January, the
Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is
a five well subsea development in 5,300 feet of water tied back to a central truss spar production facility with a peak
capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day.
In Australia, Train 1 of the Gorgon LNG project started up in March. As you know, LNG production has been
suspended due to mechanical issues which the operator is actively working to resolve.
In April, Exxon Mobil started up two more projects ahead of schedule and under budget, Julia in the Gulf of Mexico
and the Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's North Slope. Julia is a capital-efficient subsea tieback to
an existing production facility, another example of Exxon Mobil's capability to cost effectively develop new deepwater
resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Production will continue to ramp up in the coming months as two
additional wells are completed.
At the Point Thomson project, two injection wells will work in tandem with the production well, cycling up to 200
million cubic feet of gas per day through an on-site central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of
condensate. Notably, the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope, and further

demonstrates Exxon Mobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote
environments.
Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year, namely Kashagan and Barzan, closing out
the six major project startups planned for 2016.
Turning now to our exploration program where we continue to pursue and evaluate high value resource opportunities.
Offshore Guyana, we completed the largest proprietary 3-D seismic survey in our company's history and we are
currently drilling the Liza-2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3-D seismic will be used to evaluate
the block's potential and development concepts; new plan to drill additional exploration wells with the existing rig.
Offshore Uruguay, we are participating in the Raya-1 exploration well in Block 14 where we have a 35% interest. And
in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent high bidder on five new exploration blocks in Lease Sale 241. Final award
of these blocks is expected later this year and will further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. Plan to
utilize proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build a portfolio of attractive future drilling
opportunities.
So in conclusion, Exxon Mobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self-help
initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, improving reliability and capturing incremental margin across the
integrated portfolio. First quarter, the corporation earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business climate, benefiting from
structural advantages in our Downstream and Chemical operations. Integrated business generated $5 billion in cash
flow from operations and asset sales.
We continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing Upstream production volumes by 4.3 million oil
equivalent barrels per day while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as reliable operator. Exxon Mobil paid
$3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter, sharing the corporation's success directly with our shareholders, and we
remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore
ISI.
<Q - Douglas Terreson>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Terreson>: In the Downstream, volume for both gasoline and distillates seemed to be weaker than the
industry markers during the quarter and also over the past year. So my question is twofold. One, how much of the
weakness can be attributed to items such as divestitures, unscheduled downtime, weather, et cetera? Meaning, what is
the real apples-to-apples comparison for the company? And then two, with these results, I wanted to see if you had a
little bit more color or maybe a more specific read through into the key economies around the world. I mean you
touched on it at the outset but just wanted to see if you had a little bit more specifics in that area.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, I think on the first item, I'd tell you just stepping back a little bit on the
Downstream, our fuel margins were weaker with distillate margins being at five-year lows due to the, as you are much
aware, global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories. And obviously that was aggravated by a warm winter
and a low heating oil demand. And particularly in the US, less demand in the energy sector, although gasoline margins
remain strong and demand is growing above capacity growth. We saw, as I said in my prepared comments, that from a
volume perspective, we had increased maintenance activity, predominantly in Europe in the first quarter of this year. If
you compare it sequentially, first quarter to fourth quarter, we had a much higher load on planned maintenance.

Page 5 of 18
<Q - Douglas Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I will say broadly speaking, Doug, in 2016 our overall planned maintenance will be
lower than 2015. But we will have a fairly heavy first half.
<Q - Douglas Terreson>: And then maybe a read through, a little bit more specifically through into the global
economy. I mean these numbers were weak. I think you highlighted that. But do you have anything else to add to your
comments earlier?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, I think I would step back more so from a macro on supply and demand. And if you
look at the last decade, overall demand has increased about 1 million barrels a day, maybe a little less than that. And if
you look at demand growth here in the last two years plus this year, 2014, 2015 and into 2016 as to what we expect,
we're seeing demand growth in excess of the 10-year demand growth. So I think it's a good indication of a pretty
healthy demand increase, very consistent with our outlook for energy, with oil growing about 0.6% per year and gas
growing about 1.7% or 1.6% per year.
<Q - Douglas Terreson>: Okay. And then second, Jeff, but return on capital and valuation have declined versus the
previous cycle for most energy companies and I think that prompted one of your competitors to indicate that returns,
even at the expense of growth, would probably be their new path forward. And so while Rex made pretty clear that
returns were still important for Exxon Mobil, my question is whether there's been any specific movement towards
maybe changing the future balance between spending and shareholder distributions. Or do you guys think that as pretty
productive capital normalizes, that the situation will resolve by itself? So how do you guys think about that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah well from a macro perspective, as you know, we're constructive on oil and gas
demand. We have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach with a longer-term horizon. That hasn't
changed. We've been through these down cycles before. We've built this business to be very durable in a low-price
environment. And we've maintained the financial flexibility throughout in order to continue to take advantage of
opportunities whether we're in the top of the cycle or at the bottom.
The return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us. You've heard us talk in the past, Doug, about
a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major Upstream projects concurrently in order to
capture very unique value that probably no one else could capture like Exxon Mobil. And that had a draw, a burden on
the return on capital employed for a period of time. But rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our
average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value and we still view the return on capital
employed as a key metric in the end as to how effective our value choices are.
<Q - Douglas Terreson>: Okay. Great, Jeff. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Okay.
Operator
Our next question comes for Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hi. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: My first question is on unconventionals. You were running close to 96 rigs at the peak of the last
cycle, down to 16 today, four in the Bakken and the Permian given the environment. I know you presented a significant
potential growth for Exxon, but I just want to understand how you, and somewhat related to Terreson's question, how
are you thinking about increasing activity in a recovery? I mean you have a lot of options, a rigorous process. Is there
an oil price? Is it excess cash flow target or even a fundamental outlook in supply/demand that will drive your swing in
this shorter cycle resource? In a recovery that is.

Page 6 of 18
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Well let me ask you to think about it this way, Evan. For Exxon Mobil, it really
starts at the macro level with our view of supply and demand as I explained to Doug a moment ago. We've been very
constructive of the long-term energy demand. For our long cycle investments, it's really a function of project maturity
that actually maximizes value best, keeping in mind our prudent financial management to ensure that we're meeting our
commitments and maintaining financial flexibility.
Now for the shorter cycle investments that you're really asking about, by and large, it is the same but with a much
narrower focus on the near-term business climate. So it's not really a price trigger for us, it's really a combination of all
the relevant factors to ensure that we're maintaining our very prudent financial management, but at the same time
ensure that we have financial flexibility to continue to invest when opportunities come along. And as you know, I mean
we're spending $23 billion this year which represents a lot of investment activity.
<Q - Evan Calio>: I mean, I know there's a great consistency to your approach through the cycles and through time,
yet do you see the allocation changing in any way favoring a shorter cycle resource versus more conventional
allocation given some of the changes that could be evident through the cycle, a few forward cycles. And I'll leave it at
that. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah I think, Evan, it's a good question and probably worthy of a more deeper discussion
some time, but I'd tell you that the mix of shorter cycle and longer cycle has changed over time. Obviously as our
inventory base grew in the Lower 48 unconventional. But our fundamentals on how we manage the business hasn't
changed at all and the choices that we're making are really driven by how do we maximize shareholder value. All of
these investments compete, and as we've said previously, we are not opportunity constrained. We've got a very, very
deep inventory across the portfolio, not only in the Upstream, but also in our Downstream and Chemical business. And
then just making sure that when we progress a project, an investment decision, that we have identified the optimized
value proposition for it and it's competing for that capital across the portfolio.
So I wouldn't tell you that we ever set targets around segmenting the total investment program between long cycle and
short cycle. It's just the factors I talked about a moment ago, making sure the investments have matured, that we believe
we've maximized value and that we maintain prudent financial management, ensure that we can meet all of our
commitments and retain our financial flexibility. But we've got a very deep and diverse inventory of investment
opportunities.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Evan.
Operator
And our next question will come from Brad Heffern from Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Brad.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: I was wondering if you could put a finer point on the chemicals performance during the quarter.
It seemed like it was a little bit stronger than maybe the macro environment would have suggested. I think you cited
cost savings or operating cost savings in your prepared remarks, but is there any more detail you can provide around it?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well yeah there's been really good – I mean let's step back again here for a moment – to
also very constructive on Chemical demand growth growing about 1.5% above GDP. And that really sets up the
investment proposition going forward. If you look across the segment, commodities have been growing pretty strong,
very tight particularly in Europe and Asia. Demand growth has been growing much quicker. It really sets up a really
good investment proposition into the future. The margin benefit is primarily feed and energy dropping quicker than
product realizations. I would also say though that our gas crackers continue to be advantaged even though the liquid
crackers' margins have improved, the gas crackers here in North America continue to have a very advantaged feedstock

slate that allows us to compete very strongly in the demand market globally.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then looking at CapEx, I think the number for the quarter is pretty
well below in terms of a run rate basis the 2016 CapEx guidance. I'm curious if you're expecting seasonality in that
number, if there's a reason to expect that that's going to increase meaningfully going forward, or if you're actually truly
below the CapEx on a run rate basis.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Brad. So just to set the stage, as you'll all remember, our CapEx for 2016 is down
25%, set at about $23 billion. The organization has not taken their foot off the pedal. They continue to work towards
identifying capital efficiency opportunities. We're still capturing market savings and importantly, and I'll emphasize
this, is that we're delivering our major projects on schedule and on budget, in many cases ahead of schedule and below
budget. All of that is translating into capital savings that you're seeing in the first quarter of this year. We're not going
to change our capital guidance at this point, but I'll tell you that we're making great progress. I'll just say for a moment
that the organization has really responded to the low price environment in a very effective way. They keep very focused
throughout the cycle, but particularly in the bottom of the cycle. I mean really risen to the occasion and continue to
identify substantial opportunities for the corporation to save cash both cash and OpEx.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: All right.

And our next question will come from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, good morning everyone. Good morning Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I also have a couple of questions if I may. My first one is really about somewhat specific on the
oil sands business. It's been a fairly large part of the project growth and the shift towards liquids and so on. But
obviously in this environment at half the margin, it's a substantial drag on your cash margins. I'm just wondering if you
could, to the extent you can, just give us some idea of what the economics of Kearl and your oil sands business
generally, Cold Lake and so on, looks like in this environment. And what I'm really thinking about is the kind of free
cash pork that could generate in a recovery scenario. And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Well I mean generally speaking, the oil sands certainly no doubt profitability is
compressed in this price environment, but the organization once again keeps very focused on the fundamentals,
particularly our costs and reliability and they are making really good progress. They're finding structural enhancements
that create margin at the bottom line. If you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands, we've been
working the oil sands now for over three decades including technology development. And on the mining side, I think
Kearl is a great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment, our
operating costs and improve our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value.
The same is true for the in-situ operations. We've been optimizing our cyclic steam operations at Cold Lake for a long
time. We're identifying additional technology benefits like solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage technology
that will improve once again the recovery and lower our cost and improve our environmental footprint. I think it's a
testament to how Exxon Mobil manages its portfolio. We work the project management and execution very, very well
and then when it starts up, they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin, because we know we
can't count on price. What we got to count on is the things that we control, that being cost and reliability and our
integrity of the operations. But the last point I'd make is remember we also get value across the full value chain because
their Upstream is fully integrated with our Downstream and Chemical business.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Right. Jeff my follow up, I'm going to have a stab at this one and it may be a very short answer.
But on Guyana, I'll kind of frame my question like this, my understanding is that the appraisal well is something of a

two-stage effort, stage one being pre before the drill stand test. And I'm just curious to the extent you can share with us
whether that well has achieved its objectives and the additional plans perhaps to bring a second rig in and any
comments around additional prospects that are identified at this point. I realize it's early but just looking for any update
you can share on whether that well achieved its objective.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, Doug. And I understand the interest that you and others have about Guyana. I mean
we were certainly encouraged by the discovery well. The organization moved quickly to get a drill ship contracted and
get it on site to appraise the Liza discovery. The well spud in February. We do plan to drill multiple wells this year.
Liza-2 is progressing according to expectations. We will plan to test the well and we should complete that activity
mid-year.
As I said in my prepared comments, we did complete the 3-D seismic survey on the Stabroek Block and we began a
survey on the Canje Block which we picked up to the east of the Stabroek Block. The well and seismic data is being
assessed real time in order to provide insights into the discovery and the ultimate block potential. We do plan on
moving the rig from the Liza appraisal well over to a new prospect to the northwest after it is done at Liza.

And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: There's actually quite a bit of enthusiasm developing for NGLs in the US right now among the
investor community. I was wondering if you could offer sort of an outlook on how that might impact Exxon going
forward. And in the context of your sort of overall gas outlook, and you could even get more esoteric if you want
regarding heat content and the all the benefits that you might see in your unconventional gas business given the fact
that US earnings, US Upstream earnings have been dragging a little bit here for the past few quarters.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Well it's a good question because it really highlights once again the benefits of the
integrated business that we've got from the very large resource inventory and unconventionals in the US all the way
through to our Chemical business. What's important is that we have built the chemical business to have a very wide
flexible range of feedstock capability including ethane, propane, butane, all the way to gas oil, so we've got significant
flexibility within the Chemical business to modify the feedstock in order to maximize margins. I'd say the same is true
for Europe and Asia, particularly in Asia Pacific in our Singapore cracker that we have an unprecedented range of
feedstocks including the ability to crack crude oil which is an industry first.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And then secondly on M&A, I think Mr. Tillerson was pretty
clear at the Analyst Day that the organization is not interested in taking on encumbered assets. But Exxon Mobil has
pretty good currency here and I was wondering just in the context of whatever S&P's reasoning was in the revision, if
there's an opportunity to maybe equitize through M&A or asset additions or if that's even a factor considering that
Moody's still has the stable rating?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Sam, I'd tell you that nothing has really changed on how we manage our portfolio
and asset management includes the potential for accretive assets through acquisitions. As we've talked previously and
as you heard from Rex, that we keep very alert to where there are potential value propositions to high-grade our
existing portfolio. We're only going to pursue those acquisitions that we think have strategic value and are going to be
accretive to our long-term returns. And it's got to compete with the existing inventory of investment opportunities that
we've got. We got to be patient. We want to make sure that we keep a very wide aperture on what the opportunities
look like. I think we've got a good handle on where there are opportunities, but we need to make sure that it is value

And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Hey, Jeff. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Phil.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: First question on the quarter. You mentioned some color on the tax rate. It sounds like you
separated it into two pieces, one was mix and the other was some one-time effects in the corporate and financing
segment. And it sounds like the corporate and financing piece you expect to revert to the $500 million to $700 million a
quarter. I was just curious maybe on the mix side, what drove that, and if you think about the full-year tax rate, would
you expect that to still be similar to last year at current oil price levels?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, on the mix side I'd tell you, it always has to do with the relative contribution
between US, international, between Upstream, Downstream and our Chemical businesses, and you can just sense from
my comments that there's a lot of complexity in that. In terms of what to expect going forward, what I'd say is if we
were talking about 2015 commodity prices, our guidance would stay at an effective tax rate of between 35% to 40%.
Now if we're in a lower commodity price environment like we saw in the first quarter, we're probably looking at
something less than 30%.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Okay. That's helpful. Second question is just maybe a follow-up on the balance sheet.
Looking at it slightly differently, your absolute debt levels are now around $43 billion and just kind of wondering how
you feel about that comfort-wise as you look through the cycle. In a better environment with more cash flow, is debt
pay-down on an absolute basis in any way a priority or would you be thinking about other uses of cash?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, I mean obviously one of the considerations when we think about our capital
allocation is retirement of debt. So we'll keep mindful but remember we've got a very strong balance sheet. We will
look at the relative decisions around investments in the business, the pace of investments, our commitment to our
reliable and growing dividend and then appropriately, consideration on long-term debt levels. It's all about maintaining
prudent cash management, maintaining our financial flexibility. We're going to be continuing to be disciplined in our
investment approach. We're not going to forego attractive opportunities. But we'll continue to assess our cash and our
funding operations, options around a range of options and take a very balanced approach on how we go forward in our
capital deployment.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: If I were just to clarify, would debt pay-down be a priority over buybacks?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, I really – that's a decision that would be taken by the board. That will be a function
of a lot of factors, Phil. I wouldn't leave you with any impression that there's any prioritization that I'm conveying.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Yeah, okay. All right. Thanks.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Jeff, I have two questions. The first one may be a little bit more detailed and if it is just let me
know. If we're looking at the economics, have you talked to your Downstream people that whether we know it's
economic that to bring naphtha into the US gasoline pool or that you're better off to ship naphtha into your cracker for
the petrochemical in Europe or Asia?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Paul, are you asking about bringing naphtha...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: From US.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Importing it into the US?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: No, no. Exporting from US, either because I mean in others, Shell Oil and other, we still have
excess naphtha in this country. So the question that I have is that have you discussed it with your refining and Chemical
colleagues that whether it is more economic for them to take the naphtha directly bring it into the gasoline pool in the
US or that to export it into the overseas such as in your European or in your Asia petrochemical guys to use it as a
feedstock there?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, we maintain tremendous flexibility on our feedstock options and that's a real-time
optimization that we're managing. And we'll optimize those feeds based on the best available returns. That's including
moving feeds between continents.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Yeah but just curious that, I mean do you have any prior insight that you can share at this point
that – how's the economics? Is it more in favor of bringing it into the gasoline pool in this country or that is exporting?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah Paul, I really don't have anything else to share on it other than to say that it's a
dynamic issue that we continue to optimize, and I'd say that we are very well positioned to ensure that we're making the
best value choices with respect to our feedstock slate.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: The second question is that for the Point Thomson, you mentioned in your prepared remarks
that it also gives you a platform or a demonstration for potentially in the future a Alaska LNG project. Let's assume that
the Alaska LNG project won't go ahead and it's really not economic at all, if the Point Thomson is still a good
investment in here by itself without that purpose?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, I would tell you, Paul, that we look at these decisions on a long term and given the
constructive view of what we think gas is going to do over time, we are confident that the Alaska gas will be
commercialized. As to how that actually happens, it may vary from what we're currently considering. But we have been
very active with our partners in the state to identify the highest value opportunity in order to commercialize that gas,
and it's going to compete on a global perspective. What's going to be really critical is getting transparent, predictable
and stable fiscal structure in place in order to make sure that it underpins such a significant investment.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Paul.

And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Jeff, good morning. I was hoping you could share a little bit about the rationale of the
dividend increase. I know during your Analyst Day you kind of provided a cash flow breakeven potential in 2017. It
sounded like during your remarks today, you had kind of alluded to some capital efficiency and maybe potential for
capital to be moving down. So I didn't know if it would be fair to think that that cash flow breakeven number has
potential to potentially move down and maybe if that played into your thoughts around the dividend increase.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, I think when – you're referring to the cash flow neutrality slide that we shared with
you during the analyst presentation. And if you recall, it's a perspective of how we're managing our cash and how we
manage the business. And the organization is always trying to reduce that cost structure and improve the ultimate
margins. And you're correct. I mean we feel fairly confident that we can achieve cash flow neutrality into the future. I
mean what we shared with you during the analyst meeting was a very wide range on prices, but one that's reasonable,
with the low end being $40 flat real.
And you can see that we have good potential to reach that cash flow neutrality, particularly in 2017 forward. As I said
earlier, we continue to reduce our cash expenditures and making good gains. But I would tell you that when we make
the decisions around capital allocation, it's a consideration of a lot of factors. We're going to balance our long-term
investment with our shareholder distributions. Nothing has changed, but I'll tell you that we remain very committed to
that reliable and growing dividend.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. Great. The second one is just kind of project specific I know you mentioned Kashagan
coming online later this year. I think there have been some press reports suggesting that could get pushed out to 2017.
Can you remind me? I believe Exxon was slated to take over operatorship. Are you formally controlling the news flow
on that? Or are you relying on peers at this point?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No. The Kashagan is managed by the North Caspian Operating Company. And what you
may recall hearing is that, that was restructured in a more conventional manner and Exxon Mobil seconded the director
for NCOC. In terms of timing, what we're doing there is we're replacing the onshore/offshore gas and oil pipelines, or
NCOC is, and they're making good progress. They're progressing as per plan with the intention to complete that by the
end of this year and start up the facility.

And our next question comes from Asit Sen from CLSA Americas.
<Q - Asit Sen>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Asit.
<Q - Asit Sen>: So two Upstream questions, one on Upper Zakum and one on West Africa. On Upper Zakum in Abu
Dhabi, Jeff, there were talks to expand capacity to over 1 million barrels a day. Could you update us on the current
thought process on expansion and where production is currently? And secondly on West Africa, Exxon had decent
success last year in starting up new projects, Kizomba in Angola and Erha in Nigeria. How would you characterize the
current operating environment in some of the key countries given all the reported fiscal stress? I know it's probably a
generic comment, but any color would be helpful.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah okay, Asit. On Upper Zakum, current production is around 650,000 barrels a day.
The project itself is progressing well to increase capacity ultimately to 750,000 barrels a day. We are continuing to
evaluate the opportunity to expand to a 1 million barrel a day development, so really nothing more to share on that. On
West Africa.
<Q - Asit Sen>: And Jeff, on the timeframe for 750,000, is what, what timeframe?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Getting up to that full 750,000?

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On West Africa, like you said, we've made some really good progress but just a broad
comment about geo-globally, with country budgets feeling the strain of low energy prices, it is slowing down
investment globally, and that is a challenge to make sure that we progress those investments at a pace that is consistent
with the resource owner. I'll say that we have a very strong inventory of opportunities in West Africa, but we've got to
do it consistent with the confidence in the fiscal basis in which we make the investments

And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess if we could talk maybe a little bit about cost deflation, kind of where you're progressing
both on the CapEx and the OpEx side, and whether consistent with one of the questions asked earlier, if there was any
seasonal component to that that we should be thinking about.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah so just a recap for the results that we had last year, we were able to reduce our total
CapEx and cash OpEx by about $16 billion year on year, representing about a 16% decrease. In terms of going forward
in 2016, nothing's really changed. We continue to manage the cost side as we always have, focusing on structural
efficiencies, market savings, while maintaining operational integrity. I'll tell you, Roger, we still believe there is
significant opportunity in streamlining the business and reducing the cost structure. And I'd say while it's early in the
year, we're seeing a similar trend line as to last year. But we will maintain that relentless focus on cost regardless of
whether we're in a low price environment or in a high price environment. Just to give you a bit of a perspective, again
being very early in the year, our Upstream unit costs for OpEx are down about 9%.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay great, that's helpful. And along those same lines, at this point, oil prices have rebounded.
The market's starting to think about an ultimate recovery in drilling activity. Do you take advantage? I mean consistent
with your view on there's a lot more cost to get out, is this a point at which you'd want to sign contracts, kind of lock in
service capacity, service pricing, kind of anywhere around the world really?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, I mean I would say, Roger, that in the downturn we have been high-grading our
service providers and we've been locking in more favorable, more efficient service contracts, so it's not something that
we had stopped doing. I mean one of the advantages of Exxon Mobil is that we're able to invest to the cycle. That
means that in a down cycle, we'll continue to spend a significant amount of money to capture value opportunities
associated with that down cycle. So, of course the organization, and you've heard me talk previously, Roger, about the
global procurement business, but it's all focused around finding the lowest lifecycle cost and you are correct to say that
in a low price environment there are some unique opportunities that we want to walk into.

<Q - Neil Mehta>: So clearly, $48 Brent is not a great price, but it's a heck of a lot better than $30 a barrel Brent. And
so it feels like this market is moving in the right direction. Demand is growing and we're seeing signs non-OPEC
supply is coming offline. I just wanted to reconcile that with your view, or does Exxon believe that we are starting to
see signs of a sustained recovery in energy prices, particularly crude? And then because you get to see the world
through your portfolio, one of the big debates is, is a non-OPEC supply outside the US really rolling over because of
the decline rates. Are you seeing evidence that that supply outside the US is actually falling off?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. The first thing I'd say, Neil, and it's really a good thought around how the macro is
looking and how the sector will respond to it. I'd say first and foremost, is that remember we are price takers. We are
not counting on price growth. What we are focused on is really maintaining a focus on the things that we control in
order to create margin. So regardless of what it's going to do, it's going to do it, and we're going to keep focused on the
things that we control.
Second thing I'd say, and it's just a little more expansion of what I was sharing with Doug earlier, is that underlying
demand growth has been generally strong, and we expect this year will be in excess of the 10-year average. Now I
would say that in the first half of 2016, we're still oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels per day. We do expect to
see convergence in the second half with the seasonal demand growth, but that's going to widen again in the first half of
2017. And remember, during this period of oversupply, we've been building up commercial inventories since about
year-end 2013.
So thinking forward, we are seeing a convergence over supply and demand into the future, but we've got this overhead
of supply that's going to also have to work off over time. So we're headed in the right direction. In terms of how and
when that will happen will be anybody's guess. Remember there is still a fair bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply
trend and the economic growth near term, but clearly we're seeing, as you are all aware, we are seeing North America's
supply dropping off pretty significantly now.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: I appreciate that, Jeff. And then two questions, related questions here. First, is any update on
Torrance? And the second, what's the latest on Groningen?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah so on Torrance, we have completed the repairs of the electrostatic precipitator and
that we have received the approval from the regulator to go ahead and start operations. So there's a number of things
that we need to do to get it up and capacity demonstrated, but we do expect the formal change of control to happen mid
2016.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: And Groningen?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On Groningen, as you know, continue to have a pretty significant impact on volumes in
the quarter. It was close to 600 million cubic feet a day. We have made our – NAM has made the submission for the
new production forecast going forward. And my understanding is, is that the regulator will review that by September of
this year. Right now, the cap is at 27 billion cubic meters, but it has the potential to grow up depending on what
demand requirements are.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: Jeff, I was looking back at the interview that Rex Tillerson gave after the analyst meeting when he
was asked about the AAA rating. And what he said quite specifically is there's been periods where Exxon's financial
metrics have been worse than they are today, but you still retained a AAA rating. And obviously as you mentioned in
your remarks, you have been downgraded by S&P. Naturally I went to S&P, and what I saw there was the comment
that maintaining production and replacing reserves will require higher spending from Exxon. So it seems that given that
financial metrics are not the issue, that it seems there is an Upstream issue that S&P is concerned about. Can you talk
about your ability to maintain production and reserves at the current level of spending? And address whether or not
they are correct thinking that you are going to have to spend a lot more to maintain reserves and production.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, Paul. Well first off, I'd remind everybody that we've got a very large inventory of
investment opportunities, over 90 billion barrels of resource in our portfolio. And if you recall in the analyst
presentation, we provide a little bit more insight as to the type of projects and their potential capacity they can bring on
over the time horizon. Now of course what we need to do, is we need to make sure that as we mature the inventory of
projects, that we're doing it with the greatest value proposition, and I think we've made great strides in finding unique
opportunities in order to reduce the cost structure going forward.
I'd say though, Paul, that we've been through these cycles for a long time. We've been able to maintain a very strong
balance sheet. We've maintained our financial flexibility through the ups and downs, and our inventory looks very
attractive going forward. So we think all the elements are set right to continue to invest in an attractive way to maintain
our industry leading return on capital employed.
The other point I'd remind you is that as we showed in the analyst presentation, we have done very well in terms of
efficiency of deploying investment dollars. If you'll recall the Upstream capital efficiency chart that we used in an
analyst presentation showing our capital employed over proved reserves, clearly we're distinguishing ourselves relative
to the others.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay, Jeff, because of time constraints, I'll just jump onto the other one. You again mentioned
return on capital employed. I really struggle with you losing money in the Upstream on an earnings basis, particularly
in the US, and how you reconcile that with the measure return on capital employed. Typically we don't look at that. We
look at the cash flow measure. Can you help us with the DD&A Upstream, particularly in the US, so that we can get to
the cash returns that you're making as opposed to these losses Upstream? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, we've got a very strong portfolio in the Upstream. And remember that we invest
with a long-term view that's informed by our long-term energy demand outlook. All of our assets are managed to
maximize returns through their lifecycle with the objective of maintaining positive cash flow in low price
environments. We'll continue to focus on those things that we control, cost, reliability, operational integrity.
Importantly, we'll invest in attractive opportunities throughout the cycle that further enhance the asset profitability, and
we see significant value in our assets. So yes, there is a low price. We're in a low price period like we've been in the
past. As I've said, we really designed these assets to be very durable during a low price environment. They continue to
generate – our producing assets continue to generate cash flow, and over the long term we will continue to demonstrate
industry leading returns on capital employed.

And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Hi. I just had a question on your project execution. I think Exxon has clearly shown leadership
amongst your peers on project execution over the last few years. But Exxon doesn't seem to have sanctioned any major
Upstream projects of note over the last couple of years, and don't really see anything on the horizon to be sanctioned
for this year. So I'm just wondering, how do you intend to benefit from the quality of your project execution if you're

not progressing with projects at the moment?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, thanks for the question, Anish. I'd tell you that we will announce our FIDs after the
company has made that funding decision. So we really don't project it, but as I indicated just a moment ago, we gave
you an insight through our analyst presentation and the [ph] F&O (64:44) as to the type of projects that we're currently
working on. And we've really taken this down cycle as an opportunity to retest the value proposition for each one of
these investment opportunities. And there are some incremental benefits that we're able to capture through anywhere
from design changes to different ways to execute the project given the service market, to fiscal basis. So this is a good
opportunity to step back and make sure that we're really capturing the most value from these investments.
So we gave you some line of sight on the Upstream. And I'll just remind you that we've got 10 major projects still
underway in the Upstream that will start up between 2016 and 2017, as well as we maintain a very active high-value
work program. And we gave you some insight on that during the analyst presentation as well, with a very deep
inventory of opportunities.
So in summary, I'd tell you a large inventory of investment opportunities that are in various stages of planning and
execution. When we get to the point where we've made a investment decision, we'll share that publicly. But the pace
will be consistent upon project maturity to maximize value and our prudent financial management. And then of course
remember, Anish, that we've got a lot of – a number of very large investments underway in our Downstream and
Chemical business.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Okay. Thank you. And just one follow up, more specifically on Nigeria, because you've got a
number of projects that have been in your project queue for a number of years, the Satellite Field projects that you
gave, also Bosi fields. And I see you've added yet another project, Owowo West, into that project queue. I'm just
wondering what, I suppose what was kind of prevented you from sanctioning some of those projects that I suppose
have been around for a long time? And what needs to change in Nigeria for you to be able to go ahead with projects?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, I'd tell you that some of these projects are a function of optimizing the design all
the way through to getting alignment with partners and establishing the right fiscal basis to go ahead and make the
investment.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Anish.

And our next question will come from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Good morning, Jeff. Great call. So far very informative. Just gas, we've got
oversupplied markets in the US, in Europe and in Asia. Clearly the best cure for gas prices being low is low gas prices,
demand will probably pick up as a result over time. But can you give us some sense of the magnitude of potential gas
declines across the portfolio as you exercise capital discipline over the next four, five years?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, you're talking with respect to our portfolio, Ed?
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yes, I'm really thinking about base business. I mean obviously we know that you've
got some new projects coming onstream [indiscernible] (68:04) like Gorgon, et cetera.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, and you've seen in our volumes that our gas volumes have dropped off. In part,
and largely in the US, but in part that is due to a switch from gas drilling to higher value liquids drilling during this
down cycle. Gas, Ed, we continue to be very constructive, growing at about 1.6% per year, primarily driven by the
power sector. LNG, we expect to triple from current capacity between now and 2040. So I think we've got the
long-term value proposition well within our sight, and it's just pacing those investments consistent with that demand
growth to make sure that we capture full value for it.

But we've got a very deep inventory of gas, and if you look at our proved reserves, it's somewhere around 45% to 48%
of our total proved reserves, comparable part on our resource base. And then of course importantly, it adds significant
value to the value chain. It provides an advantaged feedstock for us for our steam cracking here in North America. You
may recall that we're in the progress of progressing the expansion over at Baytown for adding another 1.5 million tons
per annum of cracking capacity. And in conjunction with that, adding polyethylene lines over at Mont Belvieu. So it's
got a significant component of our future, very deep inventory, pace will be a function of demand.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Maybe a specific on Asia gas, you went I think from 4.1 million down to 3.8
million in the quarter. I think you mentioned PSC impacts in gas. Maybe just run through what's happening there. Is it
sort of customers are exercising low DCQs on the LNG contracts? Or is there something else there?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: There were three major drivers there. One was planned maintenance. The second one
being asset management, some divestments. And the third one being price impacts.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: So you're not seeing customers exercise low quantity tolerances?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, I really can't talk about specific contracts, but it's primarily driven by the three
items that I shared with you.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Okay. Thanks very much.

And our next question will come from Iain Reid from Macquarie.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Iain.
<Q - Iain Reid>: A couple of questions for you. You talked about the North American US Lower 48 liquids production
falling. But Exxon Mobil's production isn't falling. It's going up. Is this a deliberate decision to invest
counter-cyclically? You talked about your long-term vision, et cetera. Or is it something specific to your acreage where
you're getting more barrels out of your existing wells? Because you're contributing to the problem, rather than the
solution if you're growing your Lower 48 volumes. And I've got a follow-up after that.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I'd tell you, Iain, that as I said earlier, that we're able to continue to invest in the down
cycle and that provides an opportunity for us to capture lower cost structure in the investments that we're making. So
particularly in the Lower 48 unconventionals, it's allowed us to high-grade the rig activity. We're down quite
significantly in terms of our peak rigs were in excess of 60, now we're down to about 16. So we have reduced our
activity materially, but we continue to pursue the attractive unconventional opportunities that we have, predominantly
in the Permian and Bakken. And we're getting great value for it. So it just shows the value proposition that Exxon
Mobil is able to provide because we have the capability to invest through the cycle.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. And my follow-up question is on Chemical. Obviously very strong numbers in this quarter.
The environment is obviously pretty favorable out there in terms of natural gas prices as feedstock and also the fact that
there's a lot of maintenance activities out there. So lower production. But looking a little bit further forward, those
items are going to correct. There's actually more volumes coming onstream. In fact you're building capacity as well. So
do you see this chemical cycle at the peak now and going into a bit of a trough toward second half this year and into
next year? Or does Exxon have a more positive view of the market?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, I mean currently olefins and polyolefins have been pretty tight. And demand has
continued to grow and it's outpacing capacity additions, and I think that's an important investment opportunity.
Remember, this is all our investment decisions, Iain, are really founded on our view of long-term demand. And on the

chemical side, as I mentioned earlier, we expect demand to grow about 1.5% above GDP. Now, I'll tell you that
underlying demand growth across the olefins, polyolefins, the aromatics, our specialties, has been fairly robust. Now
sometimes the supply, the capacity additions are outpacing that and that's what you've seen for instance in paraxylene.
But broadly speaking, the demand is robust and it's going to continue to grow and we think it presents some investment
opportunities.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Even with the growth in ethylene supply that we're looking at in the US over the next year or so?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That's correct.
<Q - Iain Reid>: Okay. All right, Jeff. Very helpful. Thank you very much.

And we have time for one last question and that will come from John Herrlin from Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, thank you. Just a quick one for me Jeff on Guyana. You have multiple structures in your
lease area. In the event that you'd have multiple successes, should we consider Guyana to be an analog to what you did
in Kizomba a while back in terms of design one build many? And then my other question is, can you bring some of
these longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of excess E&C capacity today? I mean you did discuss how
you're optimizing things, but can you bring longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of a lower cost
environment?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, on Guyana, John, and good morning, John. I'd tell you that, as I indicated earlier, it
is really early days and we need to get a better handle of the full block potential. But the question around design one
build many, we're doing that across all of our businesses. And I'd tell you the real modifier in that is, design it once but
continue to get more and more efficient in that design and reduce the cost structure. So I would tell you to even expand
it globally in terms of how you look at concurrent developments in different parts of the world to make sure that you
are fully capturing the benefits of a robust design and execution.
To your point around the engineering and construction contractors, yeah, I mean their backlogs are certainly light and
we are very mindful about pacing the investments to make sure that we maximize value. But we want to do it with a
clear view on prudent financial management and maintaining our financial flexibility going forward. But I'd tell you
that one of the best opportunities that we have out there is the collaboration that we've been able to have with many of
our providers and really encouraging them to bring forward lower cost solutions to see if we can make investments
move quicker.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, John.

And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Woodbury, at this time I will turn the conference back to
you for any additional or closing remarks.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Well thank you. To conclude, I just want to thank you all again for your time and very good questions. It was a
insightful discussion I think for all of us. So we appreciate your time this morning and we very much appreciate your
interest in Exxon Mobil, and we look forward to talking with you in the future. Thank you.
