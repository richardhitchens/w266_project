Ruth M. Porat
Thanks.
We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the continuation of substantial currency headwinds.
Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business, particularly mobile, complemented
by significant growth in YouTube revenue. In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift toward
programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These strong top line results were complemented by
ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter, as reflected in 13% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating
income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income.
I will first go over a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details, and conclude with themes for the
near term. Omid will then cover the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your
questions.
Beginning with a summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $17.7 billion, up 11% year over year and up
3% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on
our revenues of $1.6 billion, or $1.1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior
periods, our total revenue grew 18% year over year and 4% sequentially.
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion, and the operating margin was 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, that is,
excluding stock-based compensation, operating profit was $6 billion and the operating margin was 34%. GAAP net
income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year over year and up 12% versus Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up
18% year over year and up 8% versus Q1.
GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and Class B shares were $4.93, and for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS
for Class C reflects the impact of the adjustment payment made in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were
$6.99. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion, up 29% year
over year and down 6% sequentially.
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with our primary revenue sources, Google Sites
revenue was $12.4 billion, up 13% year over year and up 4% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect continued strength in search, particularly mobile search. We
continued to close the gap between mobile and desktop search monetization. Specifically on mobile, we're pleased with
our ongoing progress resulting from our focus on user experience, ads quality, and online to offline commerce
initiatives. The combination of these efforts improves the effectiveness and value of mobile for users and marketers
alike.
Desktop search delivered solid revenue growth again this quarter. YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user
engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format. Growth
in watch time on YouTube has accelerated and is now up over 60% year over year, the fastest growth rate we've seen in
two years. Mobile watch time has more than doubled from a year ago.
Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year on year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the divergent
performance of programmatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other. Our programmatic

business, including Ad Exchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager, continued to deliver strong year-over-year and
sequential performance that more than offset lower results in AdSense for Search. We remain committed to policy
changes that improve the user experience notwithstanding the fact that these policies have a negative impact on
AdSense for Search revenue.
Other revenue was $1.7 billion, up 17% year over year and down 3% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our
Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year and sequential movements were driven by
substantial growth in Play, offset by a decline in hardware sales.
Next, revenues by geography; U.S. revenue was up 16% year over year to $8 billion and up 4% versus Q1. UK revenue
was up 4% year over year to $1.7 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 11% year over year and
was flat quarter over quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 8% versus last year to $8 billion and up 2% versus Q1. In
fixed FX terms, revenues were up 22% year over year and up 4% sequentially, highlighting both the strength of our
global business as well as the impact of FX.
Finally, revenue monetization; as a reminder, these metrics similarly reflect currency movements. Aggregate paid
clicks grew 18% year over year and 7% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year over year and 4%
sequentially.
In terms of the drivers, within Google Sites, paid clicks were up 30% year over year and up 10% sequentially, in
particular reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile. Google Sites CPCs were down 16% year over
year and down 5% sequentially. Mobile CPCs continue to strengthen and the gap to desktop continues to grow, as I
previously noted. The decline in CPCs reflects the impact of YouTube TrueView, which is a growing percentage of
overall Sites click mix and where CPCs remain lower than on our other platforms.
Network paid clicks were down 9% year over year and down 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of our ongoing
policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search, consistent with our focus on
improving user experience. Network CPCs were down 3% both year over year and sequentially.
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.4 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, which was
down slightly sequentially. Trends within Sites and network TAC remain flat due to mix shifts in partners, products,
and devices. As a reminder, the Sites TAC line includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for
distributing Google Search, as distinct from their own branded search.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3 billion in Q2, up 12% year over year and up 7% versus Q1. Year-on-year
and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, as well
as content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and Play.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year over year and down 1% versus Q1.
The increase in operating expense versus 2Q 2014 primarily reflects R&D expense attributable to increased hiring of
engineers and product managers. Headcount increased 18% versus last year and 3% versus 1Q 2015, with total head
count at quarter end of approximately 57,100. The deceleration in year-over-year growth and decline in
quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects in part discipline in expense management and in part lower legal
expenses than in comparable periods. A breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings
slides.
Other income and expense was $131 million, with interest income offset by higher expenses from our FX hedging
program.
The effective tax rate was 21% for the second quarter. As noted in our press release, in Q2 we identified an incorrect
classification of certain revenues between legal entities. We revised our income tax expense for the relevant periods
beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015, in the cumulative amount of $711 million. The income tax
adjustments were not material to the affected periods. More detail is available on our earnings slides.
Turning now to CapEx and cash, CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion, primarily for production equipment and data
center construction. CapEx spend was lower versus last year and last quarter, reflecting a bit of a digestion period after

an extended period of investment in both data centers and the requisite machine deployment. We continue to view our
computing infrastructure as one of our most strategic assets.
Operating cash flow was $7 billion, with free cash flow of $4.5 billion, resulting in a cash balance of approximately
$70 billion at the end of the quarter, of which approximately $40 billion or 58% is held overseas.
Let me close with five topics of focus for the near term. First, on revenue growth and drivers, our strong revenue
growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar, evidences the health of our
core search business, most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising. Our
earlier stage products such as Fiber, Google Life Sciences, and Nest serve as longer-term sources of revenue.
Regarding these areas, we are focused on tight governance to ensure that the resourcing for them is appropriate. And
we'll talk more about these products in greater detail as I get settled in.
Second, the sequential deceleration in expense growth achieved in the second quarter reflects in part the benefit of
expense discipline discussed in prior calls. A key focus is on the levers within our control to manage the pace of
expenses while still ensuring and supporting our growth. We will do this while we continue to invest in engineering
talent to keep us preeminent in innovation globally.
Third, the pace of growth in capital expenditures over the last several years has been significant. Although the vast
majority of CapEx to date has been to support our core business, growing requirements for newer products underscore
the increasing importance of optimization across the many opportunities ahead of us.
Fourth, our cash balance grew again this quarter, which of course gives us more strategic flexibility. We remain
focused on judiciously capitalizing on the strategic opportunities that we have, which are many. And a key issue is how
we prioritize our capital allocation given the breadth of opportunities.
Finally, as Larry has frequently noted, Google's goal is to develop great new services that significantly improve the
lives of as many people as possible. Solving problems for users at scale ultimately results in monetization
opportunities. How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities remains paramount, both for our employees who
remain inspired by the opportunity to work on the most cutting-edge developments with maximum global impact, and
for our shareholders.
I look forward to working with you. I will now turn the call over to Omid, who will cover the business details of the
quarter.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here to talk with everyone again.
Since we last spoke, Google has been very busy hosting our customers and developers from across the globe at events
ranging from I/O to the DoubleClick Leadership Summit to Brandcast. We're seeing great momentum in results across
the company.
As you all saw at I/O, we continue to invest in innovation across our core products. To call out just one, the new Photos
app is a great example of how we are combining the power of machine learning, search, and beautiful design,
something that Google is proud to bring together in such a great package for our users.
Our investments in machine learning have applications across the company and have real potential to improve our
business. For instance, machine learning helps us to improve and adds visual design to maximize its performance.
There's enormous opportunity here. I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more
time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two biggest focus areas and growth drivers, mobile and
video.
First, our core products continue to do well, and users love them. In fact, Google Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome,
and Google Maps each have over 1 billion users. We also continue to see great partner momentum across the Android

platform. The Android phone ecosystem started with one device, one carrier, and one OEM, the T-Mobile G1 in 2008,
and has grown now to over 400 OEMs and over 500 carriers who make over 4,000 distinct devices. This is a testament
to our great progress on both the tech and partnering fronts.
Google Play continues to grow at an impressive clip. Google Play Games has added more than 180 million new users
in the past six months and continues to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history.
In addition, we're seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud Platform, with a range of great new features, new
major customer announcements like HTC and JDA Software, and our collaboration with Broad Institute.
And on the advertising side, as the trend towards programmatic ad buying continues, we're helping clients succeed in
the multiscreen world with our DoubleClick platform. We recently expanded cross-device measurement to all of our
DoubleClick advertiser products, so marketers can measure these conversions for all of their campaigns. And to help
publishers, we recently announced full DoubleClick support for native ad formats.
Now I'll spend a few minutes diving more into the big areas of opportunity for us, the shift to mobile and the continued
growth of online video. I talked last quarter about the shifts we see in consumer behavior as people turn to their phones
throughout the day to decide what to buy or do. Google's role has always been to meet people's needs in the exact
moment they're looking, and those moments are increasingly happening on mobile devices.
More Google searches now take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries, including the U.S. and
Japan, two of our largest markets. And we know that when people search on their mobile phones, they're looking for
immediacy and action. In fact, 30% of mobile queries are related to location and our efforts around local search are
helping consumers find relevant information fast. We're investing in creating great mobile experiences for people
across Google products. As Sundar [Pichai] and his team showed at I/O this year, there's a lot to be excited about, from
Now On Tap to Android Pay and much more.
As I mentioned, one of my favorites is the new Photos app, where you can keep and organize all of your memories and
easily share and save what matters to you. If you're like me and have an overwhelming number of photos on your
phone, the Photos app makes taking, organizing, and finding pictures much more manageable and enjoyable, and it's
getting better every day.
In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through
indexing. We now have 50 billion links within apps indexed, and 25% of signed-in Google searches on Android now
return deep links, taking users right to content within an app or to a link so they can install it.
We also recently started showing such links in search results on iOS. Developers like Etsy are already seeing a boost in
traffic as a result of deep linking. We also added Now cards for more than 100 apps like OpenTable and Spotify, and
we have extended Google Voice actions to third-party developers so we can say things like, okay, Google, listen to
NPR.
Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, we're continuing to help marketers succeed in today's mobile
world. For instance, at I/O, we recently announced Universal Ad Campaigns, which will let developers easily reach
users across Google Search, the AdMob network, mobile sites, YouTube, and Google Play. Marketers just tell us what
their ad will say, the audience they want to reach, and how much they want to spend, and our ad systems will do the
rest to help them maximize performance.
We introduced new mobile ad formats like Automobile Ads, which take you directly to a carousel of vehicle images,
important details like estimated MPG, and links to nearby dealer listings. And just yesterday, we announced Purchases
on Google, which makes it easier for people searching on Google to buy things right from their mobile phones.
I want to turn now to YouTube, which is showing strong momentum with users and advertisers as we reinvent the
television experience for the digital age. On mobile alone, YouTube reaches more 18 to 49-year-olds in the U.S. than
any U.S. cable network. And the number of users coming to YouTube who start at the YouTube homepage, similar to
the way they might turn on their TV, is up over three times year on year. Plus, once users are on YouTube, they are
spending more time per session watching videos. On mobile, the average viewing session is now more than 40 minutes,

up more than 50% year over year.
As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are following, which
we're seeing in upfront buying through our Google Preferred model. Compared to the same period after Brandcast as
last year, Google Preferred commitments of the U.S. or three times higher.
We're also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats, like TrueView, and continue to help marketers and engage
and connect with consumers in new ways. The number of advertisers running video ads on YouTube is up more than
40% year over year. And for our top 100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60% year over year.
We recently introduced a new feature for TrueView that allows brands to automatically insert product information,
images, and pricing into their video ads. And as advertising increasingly shifts towards programmatic buying, brands
can now easily buy TrueView ads programmatically through DoubleClick Bid Manager.
All this is helping our content creators build the next generation of media companies doing what they love, making
great videos. The number of channels earning six figures per year on YouTube is up 50% year over year. One of the
key reasons for this success is our Content ID initiative, which is used by more than 8,000 partners who have claimed
over 400 million videos, helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos containing
copyrighted material.
So as you can see, it's been a very busy and successful quarter. We're super-focused on our key goals of delivering
amazing mobile video experiences. And there's a lot more coming in the next few months, including the Android M
release, Now On Tap, Android Pay, and YouTube Gaming.
Thank you to all the Googlers around the world for their great work every day, now back to Ruth.
Ruth M. Porat
Thank you. In my comments, I mentioned that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to narrow. And with that,
I'll turn it back to Ellen.
Ellen West
Great, thank you. Operator, I think we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. I guess given the focus on expenses, I'll ask a capacity question. Google over the last 18
months really has built up head count and data center capabilities. Just where are you on capacity, and really what was
the purpose of this big buildup? What kind of capability does that give Google today? Thank you.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Thank you for that question. First, I do want to clarify one thing. In my comments on CPCs, I
meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to narrow, obviously an important trend. I wanted to
clarify that.
So look, in terms of head count and data center capabilities and what that does for us, as I said, in our view, our
infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have. And as we talk about what happened in the second
quarter, it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend. And so while overall capital

intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, it's more an issue of how spend is phased during the year.
But the main point is we view computing capacity as a strategic asset. It provides us with the flexibility necessary for
growth. And as I tried to convey as well, obviously, it's a priority to achieve efficiencies where possible, in particular
given some of the newer opportunities that we have. And so we're just beginning the 2016 budgeting process. Core to
that is prioritization. But it really has been about strategic flexibility and the underlying strength of all that we do.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen West>: Great. Operator, we'll go to our next question, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Great, I just had two questions. Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated; it looked like from 12% to 16% in
the quarter. Can you just give us a little color of what drove that? Was it a more a function of core search and mobile
picking up or YouTube?
And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that a lot of the expense deceleration was put in place before
you got to Google. So now that you've been in the seat for a couple months, can you talk about what you've seen and
what potentially you could do in addition to what was in place in 2015 before you got there? Thank you.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Thank you, Ross. Our performance really reflects the fact that we have a diverse set of
products that are doing well. We have strength in core search, obviously. And in particular in mobile, YouTube, and
programmatic, we're seeing a lot of strength. We saw a nice pickup in a number of verticals in Q2 coming off
weather-related weakness in Q1. And this quarter we're seeing retail and travel being stronger verticals in search.
As to the second part of the question, I'll have Ruth address that.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: And so with respect to expense gains, obviously a lot has been done on expense discipline. It's
been discussed on calls for a number of quarters. And I think it's fair to say proper resource allocation stretches across
OpEx and CapEx, and it's about prioritizing our investments and ensuring that we're being efficient and effective with
our spend. To be clear, the priority is revenue growth, and we have a breadth of opportunity. But pursuing revenue
growth is obviously not inconsistent with expense management.
And so as I noted, we're just starting the 2016 budgeting process. In my experience, the best way to slow the rate of
growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders, really anchored in data, so together we can identify ways
to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that we've talked about. And given my early
conversations with our business leaders, I look forward to this exercise over the next couple of months, and we're very
engaged with it.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen West>: Great. Operator, we'll take our next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you, I have two questions. Ruth, can you help us understand Google's position
vis-à-vis debt? It's probably not controversial that your debt level is much below your capacity. Are there any reasons
why Google would not want to raise debt if it had to finance a large acquisition? And if yes, could you help us
understand what these reasons are? And secondly, how do you reconcile the strength in mobile search with the fact that
distribution TAC grew only 6% year on year? Thank you.

<A - Ruth M. Porat>: So starting with your question about cash and whether we would issue debt, I think the way I
look at that is you're talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet. And I've
slightly broadened the question more than what you did. But at the end of the day, our focus, my focus is maximizing
shareholder value over the medium to long term. And that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet,
where are we investing, and debt could theoretically be a part of that.
But if you step back, as I've looked at it, the key issue is what do we need for working capital, what do we need for
CapEx, what do we need for M&A, what do we need potentially for capital return? How does one think about financing
the various opportunities that we have? And I would say it's early days. It would be premature to be more specific than
that. But given this profitability of our business, we have many opportunities. Given the growing mix of our business,
we have opportunities. I'd say allocation decisions aren't mutually exclusive. Allocation can obviously change as
opportunities evolve. But as we look at it, we have a breadth of opportunities. And again, I think it's premature to be
more specific on debt at this point.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: How about the distribution TAC only growing 6% given the strength in mobile?
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: So as it relates to distribution TAC, Sites TAC dollars are up modestly year over year and
quarter over quarter, and that's what I would really focus you on; it's the dollar change. And obviously, [ph] it's a 12 but
(29:41) that's a good thing because with those TAC dollars comes revenue. As a reminder, TAC includes payments
made to search distribution partners as distinct from YouTube and Play content acquisition costs, which are in other
cost of revenue. So looking at this on a percentage of revenue basis, what you're seeing is the impact of YouTube
revenue growth. Sites revenue is up, but the associated content acquisition costs are reflected in higher other costs of
revenue, not in Sites TAC.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Okay, thanks. So, Omid, big picture, the outperformance of programmatic and YouTube is
interesting, and it seems to beg the next question. Your current list of advertising products now seems to touch all parts
of the consumer purchasing funnel. So I'm wondering where you are in uniting all of the different pieces so that you
can walk into a large advertiser and lay out the data and show that the 15-second TrueView spot that they ran turned
into a lift in sales of X%. Okay, thanks.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure, it's a good question. And in fact, that's one of the areas that I really focused on after I
came back. It is a suite of products that we're very proud of and working well for advertisers. What we like to say
internally is we like to have one Google represented to the customer so that in these conversations with them we really
understand their objectives. And really in the classic sense of the funnel, we can start from the brand journey from the
beginning to purchase across search, display, video.
And then, as you know, we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick, so the focus is really on all
aspects of this journey. Online to store, we're showing how mobile ads are driving actual store visits for our advertisers.
In Brand Lift studies, we're showing brands in real time, how their ads are performing. We've done over 10,000 Brand
Lift studies on YouTube campaigns alone. So we're really just excited about having this full suite now and being able
to have the full coverage of this customer acquisition journey from branding all the way to conclusion of a transaction.

And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great, thanks. Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in YouTube and stuff
that's accelerated. Could you spend a little bit more time on the why? Why has YouTube seen this kind of
reacceleration and resurgence in growth? Do you think it's part of a broader industry trend? With the weakness in the
upfronts, offline is now coming online. What else specifically, what specifically is YouTube doing to better capture
those dollars?
And then, Ruth, I know somebody asked you about debt. The logical follow-on question is are there cash returns and
share repurchases and dividends. I know it's early days, but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts on Google,
how you think about that over the next few years, when if ever it makes logical sense to do that. Thank you.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: I'll start and hand it to Ruth. So I think it's really a combination of all of the strength of
YouTube coming together. It starts with having over 1 billion users, really almost one-third of all people on the Internet
every day watching hundreds of millions of hours on the service, and that creates billions of views. And as Ruth
mentioned, the growth in watch time on YouTube accelerated and is now up over 60% year over year, the fastest we've
seen in a couple years.
And I think we're doing also a much better job with our products and our salesforce to not only deliver for the creators
on YouTube and do a better job of helping them monetize their content, and at the same time then highlighting that
success through programs like Brandcast, where advertisers, agencies see that dynamic audience and service, and then
with the advertising products be able to then show them the real benefits of advertising and the ways that they can
measure its effectiveness. So it's really all the pieces coming together for us. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do,
and we see still a lot of opportunity to enhance the service. So I think you'll see a lot of innovation coming for us both
on the service front as well as on the advertising products.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Hey, Mark. And as you noted, it is early days. But the way I view any assessment of a return on
capital, my prior answer regarding balance sheet efficiency is really in the context of maximizing stakeholder value
over the medium to long term. And with return on capital, it gets into the context of how do you prioritize and allocate
cash after an appropriate reserve for working capital amongst CapEx, M&A, and then potentially that capital return.
And as I said, the allocation decisions aren't mutually exclusive. The profitability of our business gives us many
opportunities.
But the main point is to date, the biggest return on investment here has been in our core search business, including
mobile search, as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. And through M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines you
know today. YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples. Again, this underscores the power of smart, targeted
acquisitions. We also have a strong track record of investment in new products, as you know well, and the
infrastructure to support explosive growth. Our tech infrastructure, as I've already commented on, is really unparalleled.
And we do view it as a great strategic asset, and we've invested in it substantially over many years. So trying to gauge
whether or how capital return fits in, it's premature to do that and it's really looking across these various potential uses.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Omid.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Thanks, Mark.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. Omid, you mentioned retail and travel as two of the stronger
verticals on the advertising front. And in the recent past, you guys have made a number of announcements around
products that align your interests more closely with suppliers, people who are striving to close the economic loop, and
you might be even moving down the funnel. How do you think about the opportunities for Google to move down
respective funnels and industries where you do already have a fair bit of expertise? Thanks.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure. Thanks, Eric, for the question. We're really focused on connecting retailers to
consumers across screens and also reducing this friction involved in finding and purchasing products, including local
products in stores. So that entire journey and all the aspects of commerce is a great area of focus for us. And as users
begin to – as they start their searches on mobile phones, we're continuously trying to find ways to improve the mobile
shopping experience.
And as the shopping experiences on these smartphones become easier and we focus on improving mobile conversions
for advertisers, we're seeing great benefits from that. We just announced Purchases on Google, for example. It's a
smartphone-only feature of the product listing ads as an example. And all of these are really for us the building blocks
to help in reduction of that friction and bring the expertise we have in understanding the immediacy, the local nature of
these searches, and understanding conversion and how to put it all together for our users and for our advertisers and
merchants.
<A - Ellen West>: Okay, operator. We'll take our next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great, thanks. Just to follow up a little bit on the last one, Omid, can you talk more
specifically about the cross-platform efforts and estimated conversions in particular and whether you're seeing that
prove more of the value across the platform? And then secondly, you commented several times that the gap is
tightening on pricing between mobile and desktop. Can you quantify that by any chance? And can you just talk about
what you think drives that to tighten further going forward? Thanks.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure, maybe I'll have Ruth take that second part. On the first part, on this online to offline
conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior, and we're very busy
investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores. We're seeing strong results from clients using
our tools to bridge this digital and physical world and great adoption of local inventory ads, which help advertisers
promote their store items to nearby shoppers. So that's how the whole cycle of usage of smartphones and the
immediacy come together. And then we have created a way for advertisers to measure the impact of these ads on store
visits.
So just to give you a couple of examples, Target, one of our advertisers, found that mobile search ads greatly
influenced in-store sales. And using our Store Visits data, they found that a third of their paid search ads resulted in a
user visiting a Target store during the 2014 holiday season. So we'd love to continue working with them and other
advertisers to show the results and then build on that. A Florida department store working with us found that 63% of
their mobile influenced sales take place offline. And so more and more, we're doing these studies. We're putting tools
together for the advertisers and our partners, the merchants, and finding ways for them to really quantify these benefits
and just scale these programs for everyone.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: And then as it relates to the second part of your question, there are really two good stories here
given the importance of search, mobile CPCs up and desktop CPCs not declining, so the gap is narrowing. On the
mobile side, as Larry said before with respect to desktop, it took time to fully develop the pricing model. And we

remain focused on building the mobile ecosystem to have the right ad formats and measurement tools to take advantage
of all the platform has to offer. Features like estimated store visits, app install, reengagement ads, cross-device
conversions are all part of this strategy.
And then on desktop, the business continues to grow. It remains a good contributor to overall results. As we announced
at the AdWords Performance Summit in May, ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all
screens, including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment. In other words, ad
formats that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop, and that's what's really narrowing this gap here.

Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Ruth, given your background, I just wanted to
ask if you thought the regulatory backdrop for Google is in any way analogous to the financial services industry. And
what is your outlook for a large player like Google in an environment of increasing regulatory pressure, particularly
outside the U.S.? And of course specifically for Google, with the EC demanding changes to the search results, I was
just wondering. Should we be concerned that these regulatory pressures can ultimately have an impact on your
business? Thanks.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Look, the industries are different. But as it comes to our business, Google operates in a very
competitive environment. There are many windows onto the web. Choice, competition, investment are all going up, not
down. And we do look forward to continuing to work constructively with the EC to address any concerns they may
have and regulators generally.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay, thank you very much.

<A - Ellen West>: Operator, we'll take our next question, please.

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: I have two. The first one, Ruth, going back to your comments on some of the earlier stage
projects, Fiber, Life Sciences, et cetera, and being focused on tight governance, is there any way you can help us think
about OpEx or CapEx related to those projects at this point, and how we should think about maintenance versus
investment OpEx and CapEx going forward?
And then the second one, just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth, it sounds like mobile and YouTube
are both doing pretty well. Can you just help us understand? Are you seeing both accelerate? Is U.S. search accelerating
at this point, or is it more so being driven by YouTube? Thanks.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Sure. So let me take your first question, first part of your question first. In terms of overall the
framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry
have referred to for many years, namely the 70:20:10, 70% resources on the core, 20% on adjacent areas. At one point,
that included Chrome and Android, and they are now in the core, but it would include things like cloud. And then 10%
in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like Fiber or what we're doing with Google Life

Sciences.
And so in discussing this with Larry, it's clear his objective has been to instill within the culture this mission to drive
not just important innovation associated with our core business but also to look for what he's calling revolutionary
ideas, big solutions that can meaningfully contribute both to making people's lives better and to the next big revenue
and earnings growth opportunity for Google. And my take is that Larry views this 70:20:10 as an instructive
framework. He's also noted how hard it is to reach that 10% on these big new revolutionary ideas because it's tough to
get people to tackle big difficult new problems instead of pursuing incremental change. So human nature provides a
limit on how big that final bucket would be, the new opportunities.
And I think the other point to consider is that Google's core business continues to deliver strong growth. So to achieve
10% in the big new areas means continually trying to reach 10% of an even larger number. And the framework keeps
us focused on big ambitions across the company. But given the success of the core business, I think it's fair to say that
10% is a stretch goal for now, and it's a way to think about resources, which hopefully helps you fill in a bit there. And
then the second part of your question, if you could repeat that.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Yes, it was just going back to the accelerating overall U.S. revenue. I'm just curious about a little
more color on the drivers there, where it sounds like both YouTube and mobile search are doing pretty well. Is it safe to
say that U.S. search and YouTube are both accelerating, or are you seeing YouTube drive it disproportionately? How
should we think about the drivers of the U.S. revenue acceleration?
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: You've covered a lot of it. The U.S. growth really reflects the fact we have a diverse set of
products that are doing well. We had strength in core search, particularly mobile. We had strength in YouTube and
programmatic, as Omid talked about. So it's really the breadth across a number of different products that delivered the
results that you're talking about; that we're talking about here today.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Thanks.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen West>: Operator, we'll take our next question, please.

Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great, thank you so much. I just had two quick questions. I was just wondering – you've
talked a lot about desktop and mobile CPCs. I was wondering if you could share with us if the narrowing of the gap
between the two is actually starting to accelerate.
And then the other thing I wanted to ask is just thinking about the CapEx spending waves that companies go through,
and clearly Google has been on one, on an accelerating spending wave for the last few years. Should we then suggest –
get from your comments that you're in a digestion period; that the digestion period could also be a multiyear trend as
well? If there are any thoughts you can share there. Thank you.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: I think with respect to the first part of your question, we thought it was important to be clear
that this gap is narrowing and to give you a sense of some of the mix issues within CPCs, so mobile CPCs
strengthening, desktop not declining. YouTube remains lower, but we're seeing real strong growth in TrueView. And
so it's just really to try and dimension it as you think about what's going on with the mix change.
And then as it relates to expenses, what I was trying to convey there is that we in the second quarter had a bit of a
digestion period here on the back of the substantial investment spend that we've had. And I would say in terms of – if
you think about the second quarter in that context, there can be some variability in the cadence of spend. And so part of
it as we're talking about the CapEx here is really how spend is phased during the year. I wouldn't suggest that we're
talking about, as the way you frame the question, [indiscernible] (48:02) multi-period given just the sheer scope of

opportunities that we have. So as I said, at the front end with respect to both CapEx and OpEx, we're just beginning the
2016 budgeting process. We're very focused on prioritization, but I was trying to give you some context for what was
going on in the second quarter.
And then as it relates to OpEx, in terms of the back half of the year, there are seasonal fluctuations that do typically
impact operating expense as well. For example, head count usually picks up in the third quarter with new grad hires
starting, and our marketing expense also tends to be weighted toward the second half of the year. So again, I was just
trying to give you a sense of what's the cadence as you're thinking about the year.

Our next question comes from Robert Peck from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert S. Peck>: Two questions, if you don't mind. The first is around the possibility of working more directly
with Yahoo! on search and search results. Could you tell us about any progress there or work you've done there?
And then number two, Ruth, could you talk about the future possibility of breaking out more information around your
businesses to a point where maybe we can break out YouTube or DoubleClick or some of these other businesses that
can give investors a little more clarity on the size and growth of them? Thank you.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: I'll take this part. So Yahoo! is currently testing search results and ads from a number of
partners, including Google as one of their options. And they have options to use search services and search ads across
their properties, and you may see our ads. This is a standard agreement, and many other publishers use our web search
and AdSense for Search. We look forward to working with them and hopefully having good performance with them.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: And then in terms of the second part of your question, I think it's important to help our
stakeholders understand how we think about key drivers for the business and how we manage the business, providing
what I call a framework for understanding the momentum in the business, our investment choices, our capital allocation
decision-making. I'm committed to being direct with you. I won't give you competitively sensitive information, but my
goal is to help you understand the business as well as possible.
My view it's our obligation to pursue activities that maximize value over the long term and doing it in a disciplined
fashion. And the point I'm really trying to drive here is I need to create a framework that helps you understand where
we're going. So you're asking would we think about breaking about any particular business. I'm trying to understand
how best to provide more insight into the drivers of the business and beyond what is currently provided, and it's really
too early to be more specific than that.

And our last question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead
<Q - Paul Vogel>: Great, thank you, two questions on YouTube. One, there has been a lot of speculation in the past
about the profitability of YouTube, so I'm just curious how you think about the revenue growth versus the forward
spend on forward demand. And is YouTube in a position where it's starting to see leverage on the upside with the
strong revenue growth?

And then on the revenue side in particular, you talked about how YouTube has been – it's one thing that drags the
optics of CPC down. When mobile was doing that, I think the company believed that over time mobile would be
additive, and we're starting to see it, but it took some time. How do you think about YouTube in the context of is there
a point in time where you think YouTube will actually be additive to the optics of the CPC versus where it is right
now? Thank you.
<A - Ruth M. Porat>: So I think there were three parts to that question. In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube,
Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there. And it really does reflect, as he said, the sheer
volume of users. We have over 1 billion users, and those users are spending more time watching. Watch time growth
continues to accelerate, now up over 60% year over year, the fastest rate we've seen in two years. And we do view
watch time as the most valuable measure of engagement. And it does reflect the ongoing improvement in ads quality,
with more users also choosing to watch more TrueView ads. Not only do we have a huge user base that's highly
engaged, but data points like the fact that there are more 18 to 49-year-olds on mobile YouTube than watching cable
TV today really underscores the opportunity here. And our focus is the opportunity to get larger budgets moved to
YouTube.
And then in terms of the profitability question, as you know, we don't break out profit by product, and we view our
technical infrastructure as a core strategic asset that supports products across the company. I've already said that on this
call that it's an important point. It's fair to say that much of the network expenses supporting YouTube, it's a large user
of capacity, and our ability to serve high-quality HD video on demand around the world is unparalleled.
From the user's perspective, YouTube is a great example of a multi-device platform with high usage on both desktop
and mobile. We have one ad team that works across our various products. And when we work with the largest ad
partners, globally we're selling a total package. Omid has commented on some of that. Not surprisingly, if you take our
top advertisers, they all advertise across all our products, not necessarily at the same rate, but we have a single team
working with them to close the differential. We do view that as a great opportunity. And the goal, to give just a bit
more color on how some of our assets, technical infrastructure and ad sales team benefit a number of our different
products across the company.
And then I think you slipped a third part in there on the status of CPC trends and YouTube TrueView pricing, so I'll
just close out on that. CPC pricing on YouTube for TrueView ads, ads that users choose not to skip is lower than CPC
pricing on desktop and mobile, but YouTube TrueView ads represented a larger percentage of our overall clicks, so had
a greater impact on CPCs. And this is really about the tremendous growth in YouTube views. Again, when we see the
real uptake here and the extent to which users are choosing to watch more ads given our effort around ad relevance and
quality, advertisers want to reach these audiences. And our focus is on the opportunity to get larger budgets moved to
YouTube.
<Q - Paul Vogel>: Okay, thank you.
