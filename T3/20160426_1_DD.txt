MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the DuPont First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call.
[Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being
recorded. Now – and I'll turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may
begin.
Gregory R. Friedman
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's first quarter
2016 performance. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and
CFO; and Jim Collins, Executive Vice President, responsible for our Agriculture segment.
The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website, along with
our news release. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you
to slide one for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are
forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of
future performance, but involve a number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a
discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. We request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements
provided with our earnings news release and today's slides, which are posted on our website.
Our agenda today will start with Ed providing his perspective on this morning's news. Then, Nick will review our first
quarter financial performance and 2016 guidance. Third, Jim will discuss our Agriculture business. We will then take

your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ed.
Edward D. Breen
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would like to share my perspective on the first quarter, then I'll update
you on our progress with our three critical initiatives, as well as our planned merger of equals with Dow.
Overall, I was pleased with how the business performed in the first quarter. Despite continued challenges in the
macroeconomic environment, we delivered operating earnings of $1.26 per share, even with last year's quarter.
Excluding $0.10 per share of negative currency, operating earnings rose 8%. Sales declined 2%, excluding currency,
reflecting the current environment. The weakening U.S. dollar gave us some relief.
I don't want to steal any thunder from Jim, but it's worth saying a couple things about Ag's first quarter. Much of the
quarter's strength was due to Ag. Solid execution in Ag, our largest segment, enabled strong start to the North
American corn season. I'm also very pleased with our results in the Safrinha season, as we delivered strong volume
growth. Nick and Jim will comment more on all that in a moment.
Looking beyond Ag, as I mentioned, most of our other segments performed well. One worth calling out is Nutrition &
Health, where we had broad-based volume growth and significant operating margin expansion. Let me give you a
couple examples of new products that contributed to our growth in N&H.
First, SUPRO, our new best-in-class isolated soy protein for dry powdered beverages; and second, our new long-life
Greek yogurts in China. Probiotics increased sales 30%, as our productivity efforts have freed up capacity to respond to
strong customer demand. I was pleased to see operating margins expand in four segments of our six segments,
including progress with our global cost savings and restructuring plan.
In sum, most of our businesses exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We had a good start to the year, yet planting
is just beginning in the northern hemisphere, and at this point, it's too early to call the year for Ag. There are still a
number of difficult macro variables, and we want to see how those factors play out.
Now, let me give you an update on our progress with three critical priorities I outlined when I became CEO. As a
reminder, we said we were committed to shrinking our cost structure, improving our working capital performance, and
reducing our capital expenditures. We strongly believe we need to improve our performance in all three areas, as we
want to benchmark against best-in-class companies in all of our businesses. The encouraging part is the quality of the
leadership team, including their desire to win, which has impressed me about DuPont from the start.
The point of our global cost savings and restructuring plan is to strengthen the competitiveness of our business, while
reducing our costs by $1 billion on a run rate basis by year-end. Consistent with this target, we plan to show you a net
year-over-year savings of $730 million for full year 2016. We made good progress with this objective in the first
quarter, in fact, we are exiting the quarter down about $135 million in operating costs, mainly, in SG&A.
One area where we've taken significant action is corporate costs. Already, year-over-year, we are down 44% on an
operating earnings basis. I applaud the teams for their hard work in getting us here. This quarter puts us well on our
way toward a $200 million year-over-year reduction in corporate costs.
Also, our global cost savings and restructuring plan is separate from, and incremental to, the cost synergies we expect
to capture in connection with our planned merger of equals with Dow. The actions we have taken to abolish the matrix
organizations have given our businesses full control of their P&Ls, enabling faster decision-making. The company is
visibly moving at a faster clip.
Turning to working capital, earlier we set goals for improvement by business for 2016. In the first quarter, we launched
a company-wide project to improve working capital. We see opportunity in inventory, first and foremost, but also in
payables and receivables. Our first quarter results reflect our focus on working capital and capital spending, resulting in

a $300 million improvement in free cash flow year-over-year, excluding Chemours. We continue to expect to deliver
improvements in working capital over the medium term. That said, this year's working capital performance will reflect
pressure from our cost-reduction programs, including severance payments, which are necessary to support our
long-term objectives.
Our capital spending in 2016 is expected to total $1.1 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year, excluding Chemours.
That's a decline of 21%. We spent about $360 million on CapEx in the first quarter, and we reviewed each and every
dollar before we spent it with a close eye on expected returns. Our first quarter CapEx spend is 14% below last year,
again excluding Chemours.
As we work toward our planned merger with Dow and the intended separation into three highly focused, independent
businesses, I am pleased with the progress the teams are making. We achieved a number of milestones toward closing
the merger in recent weeks. On March 1st, we filed our initial Form S-4 registration statement and recently filed the
First Amendment. That process is proceeding along smoothly. The Form S-4 will become effective after we complete
the review process with the SEC, which we currently anticipate will be no later than the end of the second quarter.
The special stockholder meetings for both companies' shareholders to vote on the merger will take place thereafter. We
also have submitted key regulatory filings related to the merger in the major jurisdictions where we operate. We always
expected a thorough review process, and we are working closely with regulators in all the relevant jurisdictions to
complete that process.
We continue to expect to complete the merger in the second half of 2016, subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals. Integration planning is well underway. We have formed a joint integration management office. Dow and
DuPont teams are working directly together on plans to execute the merger, capture synergies, and prepare for the
intended business separations.
The team is working diligently to develop execution-ready plans to ensure we can quickly integrate the merger, capture
our anticipated cost and revenue synergies, and begin to operate as independent business units as soon as possible after
the merger closes. In coordination with the joint integration management office, each of the three businesses is working
to identify and plan for the right operating structure for their specific needs.
Another important point I'd like to make is our synergy targets for the combined company remain on track. We have 27
teams focused on different categories of cost, and they are very clear about what the goal is. Our confidence in the
targets we established in December has done nothing but go up. After diving into the details, we continue to believe
there will be at least $3 billion in cost and $1 billion in growth synergies on a run rate basis. We have benchmarked
costs against industry peers, alongside McKinsey, and they have confirmed that the $3 billion is achievable.
We continue to expect to capture $1.3 billion in Ag, $1.5 billion in material science, and $300 million in specialty
products cost synergies.
Now, I'd like to ask Nick to take us through the financials and outlook in more detail.
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ed. Let's start with the details of the first quarter on slide three. Operating earnings of $1.26 per share were
even with prior year and up 8% year over year, when adjusted for currency. Solid execution in a tough macro
environment, particularly on cost savings, and a strong start to the North American corn season in Ag positively
impacted the quarter.
Excluding currency, consolidated net sales for the quarter declined 2%. Local pricing gains in Ag and Industrial
Biosciences and volume growth in Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in most of the remaining
segments. Currency continued to negatively impact sales by an additional 4 percentage points in the quarter.
I'd like to highlight where we're seeing some positives from a regional perspective, particularly in our developing
markets, which represented about 30% of our first quarter sales. In the quarter, sales in developing markets were up 5%

year-over-year, excluding currency. Volume growth was primarily driven by Agriculture, and Nutrition & Health in
Europe and Asia-Pacific, principally China. Local pricing gains in Latin America and Europe were a result of mix
enrichment and actions to offset currency, primarily within Agriculture.
Turning to slide four, consistent with prior quarters, currency was a significant headwind to segment results. Segment
results, when you exclude currency, were up $0.02 per share in the quarter on cost savings, local price, and product mix
gains in Agriculture and Industrial Biosciences, and volume growth in Nutrition & Health. Lower corporate expenses
and interest contributed $0.05 to earnings in the quarter. Corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis were 44%
lower than the prior year, as a result of our 2016 cost-savings program.
A lower share count benefited the quarter by $0.05. In 2015, we completed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase
program using proceeds from the Chemours separation, and we are seeing the full benefit of this program here. A
decrease in net after-tax exchange losses contributed $0.02 to earnings in the quarter. A higher tax rate reduced
operating EPS by $0.04 in the quarter due to our geographic mix of earnings.
Let's turn to the first quarter segment operating earnings analysis on slide five. Operating earnings growth in Nutrition
& Health, Industrial Biosciences, and Protection Solutions was more than offset by declines in the other segments.
Nutrition & Health increased on a broad-based volume growth and cost savings, which more than offset the negative
currency that they saw. Operating margins in this segment improved 240 basis points and have grown year over year
for 11 consecutive quarters.
Growth in Industrial Biosciences reflected pricing gains on new product introductions in bioactives, increased demand
for biomaterials, and the absence of prior-year one-time costs in clean technologies. Operating margins improved 250
basis points in the quarter for Industrial Biosciences.
Protection Solutions operating earnings increased $9 million, as lower costs and improved plant utilization at the
Chambers Works facility were partially offset by lower volumes and the negative currency impact. Operating margins
improved 300 basis points in the quarter here.
In Electronics & Communications, operating earnings decreased $20 million, as cost savings and increased demand for
Tedlar film were more than offset by competitive pressures in Solamet paste, lower demand in consumer electronics,
and a $16 million litigation expense. I'd like to highlight that while volumes in Solamet paste were down year over
year, we did see sequential volume growth from the fourth quarter of 2015, and we grew market share following the
launch of our PV19B late last year.
Agricultural operating earnings declined $37 million year over year, as local price and products mix gains and cost
savings were more than offset by an $83 million negative currency impact, lower volumes, and about $40 million
negative impact from La Porte shut down due to lost sales and inventory write-offs. Jim will provide further details on
the first quarter performance with Agriculture later in the call.
Performance Materials operating earnings declined $44 million, as lower costs and increased demand in Asia-Pacific
automotive markets were more than offset by lower demand for ethylene and ethylene-based products, lower local
price, and negative impact from currency. The price decline was driven by lower ethylene prices, as average spot prices
were down approximately 50% year over year, and we saw competitive pressure in commoditized products.
As a reminder, the slides with segment commentary are posted on the investor center website under Events &
Presentations. I'd encourage you to refer to those slides for further details on segment results, including our
expectations for the second quarter and for the full year 2016.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash on slide six, we maintained our strong balance sheet position during the quarter.
Negative free cash flow of $2.2 billion reflects Agriculture's typical seasonal cash outflow in the quarter. Our free cash
flow improved by about $500 million year-over-year, with about $200 million of the improvement due to the absence
of Chemours. The remainder of the improvement is due to lower working capital and CapEx in the first quarter.
Net debt has increased in the quarter over our ending 2015 balance, which reflects our nominal seasonal shifts, primary
uses of cash in the quarter related to funding our seasonal Agricultural working capital requirements, growth

investments and dividends.
Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. And today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has
approved a second quarter dividend of $0.38 per share. Our objective is to complete $2 billion in share repurchases in
2016. However, the planned merger of equals with Dow and the associated impact from SEC rules and regulations
affects our trading windows. After the shareholder vote, we will evaluate the opportunities to enter the market and plan
to make repurchases.
On slide 7, the company now expects full year 2016 operating earnings to be in the range of $3.05 per share to $3.20
per share from $2.95 per share to $3.10 per share previously announced. The estimated negative currency impact for
the full year 2016 is now expected to be $0.20 per share versus a previously communicated estimate of $0.30 per share.
The U.S. dollar has weakened against most currencies since the estimate we provided in January. For the full year, we
now expect our base tax rate to be about 24%, an increase from our prior estimate of 23% due to the geographic mix of
earnings. This results in a $0.10 headwind from higher base tax rate in the outlook versus our prior year. Our guidance
continues to reflect a $0.64 per share benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan.
While the businesses outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, about half of this was due to a stronger than
expected start to the season in Agriculture. The remainder was due to the underlying performance of the businesses,
and that is what we are reflecting in our revised outlook for the full year.
For the first half 2016, we expect operating earnings to be even with prior year, as the timing benefits, primarily within
Agriculture, from a stronger than expected start to North American corn season, are anticipated to largely be offset in
the second quarter. We continue to expect full year net sales to be down low single digits percent-wise versus prior year
due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in Agriculture.
Currency will continue to impact the top line as the dollar is stronger than last year against most currencies, primarily
the Brazilian real. Excluding currencies, sales are expected to be about even with prior year. We would expect
operating earnings per share growth of 17% to 23% when we take out currency, primarily driven by the full year
benefit of cost savings. We remain cautious on our outlook for 2016, as market conditions continue to remain
challenging.
In Agriculture, the fundamentals have not changed since the outlook we provided in January. Net farm income is
declining and seed and crop protection suppliers have abundance of inventories globally. Economists are currently
forecasting lower global industrial production in key markets, including the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and
China. China's economic slowdown continues, particularly with its industrial, real estate and financial sectors,
impacting the Asia-Pacific region.
Turning now to slide eight, I'd like to highlight where we stand on our 2016 global cost-savings and restructuring plan.
As we previously communicated, we expect this plan will generate $1 billion on a run rate basis, which translates into
approximately $730 million of savings in 2016 versus the prior year. We expect the plan to deliver about $0.64 per
share in cost reductions, which will be weighted towards the second half of 2016.
For the first quarter, our operating costs, which includes SG&A, R&D, and other operating charges, declined about
$135 million on an operating earnings basis. This represents a 7% decline in costs year over year. SG&A costs declined
about $110 million or 9% versus last year on cost savings and currency benefits.
Our corporate costs on an operating earnings basis decreased 44% year-over-year, and highlights that the actions we
outlined in December are truly generating results. We are on track to deliver our 2016 commitment of a $200 million
decrease in corporate expenses, improving to about a 1.3% as a percent of sales.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to provide an overview of the results in Agriculture.

Thanks, Nick. Overall, agricultural markets are playing out pretty much as we expected, with farmers facing
challenging economic conditions and seed and crop protection suppliers having plenty of inventory globally. So, we're
not seeing anything significantly different in market conditions from what we shared with you earlier this year. But
even in this difficult environment, we remain focused and are executing on the variables that are within our control.
And I think our first quarter performance clearly illustrates that.
Now, I'm focused on three very clear priorities. First, delivering on our 2016 cost savings and operating earnings
commitments. And our results for the quarter indicate we're firmly on track to do that. Secondly, I've been personally
spending significant time reviewing our R&D programs with our research teams to ensure we're delivering on our
exciting pipeline of new genetics, biotech traits, and crop protection products on schedule. Lastly, from our announced
merger with Dow, our teams are working with great urgency to create a world-leading production Ag business, and
we're developing detailed plans to capture the $1.3 billion of cost synergies.
Even though this is challenging work, you can feel the excitement of the teams. In addition to these three priorities, I
also spend my time minimizing distractions, ensuring our teams keep their focus on delivering results for our
stakeholders during this exciting time of change. And as I mentioned, our results in the first quarter demonstrated
strong execution in challenging market conditions. Results were better than we expected, primarily due to higher corn
area in North America, earlier timing of shipments to customers consistent with that strong start we had in the fourth
quarter of 2015, and stronger sunflower sales in Europe based on the performance of our newest products. Currency,
while still a significant headwind compared to last year, was also a little better than we anticipated.
What I'm proudest of is we were able to deliver 2% higher prices across the segment, even in this highly competitive
market environment. In Seeds, a stronger mix of Pioneer's newest corn hybrids resulted in higher net corn price
globally, and most importantly, in North America. In Crop Protection, we took decisive pricing actions to mitigate a
stronger U.S. dollar in Latin America and in Eastern Europe. And in fact, local pricing actions fully offset the impact of
currency in Latin America.
Now, in addition to local pricing gains, corn seed volumes were higher than the prior year from sales in North America,
consistent with the recent USDA reports indicating higher expected corn acres this year and in Brazil's Safrinha season.
Our increases in corn and sunflower volume were more than offset by the lower insecticide sales in Latin America and
in sales to other third parties. Additional offsets included the impact from the shutdown of the La Porte manufacturing
facility and from lower soybean volumes. Now, most of the decline in the insecticide volumes can be tied to Brazil's
low pest pressure, high industry inventories, and the impact of insect-protected soybean varieties.
Now, turning to our pipeline, as planned, we made our first sales of Zorvec fungicide for disease control in Korea,
Australia, and China in the first quarter. We expect Zorvec to be very competitive in the $2 billion market for blight
and downy mildew control, offering potato, grape and vegetable growers consistent long-lasting control with a
favorable environmental profile.
We successfully launched Leptra insect-protected corn hybrids in Brazil in the Safrinha season, and initial indications
of performance are good. Leptra's strong value proposition is also allowing us to recapture price in that market. Strong
customer interest and an aggressive seed production plan have us well-positioned to ramp up Leptra to as much as a
third of our volume in the upcoming summer season in one of the fastest technology introductions in Pioneer history.
In North America soybeans, we are currently introducing varieties with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology in a
very limited launch. While we didn't plan for large volumes, this will allow our sales reps and customers to test the
performance of these soybeans, as we prepare for our full launch in 2017 pending regulatory approvals.
In addition to all of that, we had a really exciting announcement this past week. We announced our intention to
commercialize our first corn hybrids developed through the application of CRISPR-Cas advanced breeding technology
within the next five years. While this is a first step, our initial CRISPR-Cas offering allows us to lay a solid foundation
for success for future products developed with this important innovation in plant breeding.
We now anticipate results for the full year to be a little stronger than what we shared with you in January, primarily due
to the recent weakening of the dollar against many global currencies, including the reais and from higher corn planted

acre. Now, this will partially be offset by the shift of a portion of our fourth quarter Seed sales to first quarter 2017.
This is a result of the enhancements we are making to our Pioneer business, as we transition to an agency-based
route-to-market approach in the southern U.S., similar to the advantaged approach we take in the Midwest.
Additionally, we'll have some unplanned costs as a result of our recent decision regarding the La Porte insecticide unit
from the write-off and disposal of in-process inventory and to dismantle the facility.
We had a good start to the year. We have a lot going on in Agriculture. And I'm very excited about the progress. I'm
confident the team is focused on delivering on our commitments, preparing for the merger, and advancing our pipeline.
Now, I'll turn it back to Greg.
Gregory R. Friedman
Thanks, Jim. We'll now open the line for questions. John, if you could please provide the instructions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from
David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Good morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Jim, there's been some talk about aggressive seed price discounting in the U.S. this season.
Can you address those concerns and how you're addressing that issue?
<A - James C. Collins>: Yeah. Great. Thanks for that question. We know those comments are out there. As we said
back in January, we just weren't seeing much change in the conditions in the marketplace from where we launched
back in August or September. So, we've had our pricing cards out there for a number of months. So, when I look at
pricing, and I think of – or in that area, I think of it in three specific ways. First is card price, and that's that
year-over-year same technology, same market card pricing. And as we said back in January, our card pricing is
generally flat year-over-year.
The second impact in our numbers then would be due to mix. And we're seeing strong demand in our order book for
our newest technology. About 50% of our lineup in North America is from genetics that we put in the market in the last
two years. So, as growers have a chance to look at that, two consecutive years in our yield trials, they really jumped on
that. So, we're seeing a nice lift in overall mix.
And then, last would be in the discounting area. And so, these discounts come in a number of different areas, whether
it's early buy discounts or cash discounts. And overall, I would say we're seeing maybe a slightly elevated level of
discounts, but nothing really out of the ordinary that you might expect. Folks took a good advantage of some of the
programs that we had out there.
I would also remind you that our direct sales model in North America gives us great visibility of our products and our
pricing, especially at that net price level. So we see, almost in a real-time basis, purchases and what's going there. So, I
think, overall, what this speaks to is a strong focus by our organization and an execution intensity in really driving the
plan that we put out there back in August and September.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Very good. And just – Ed and Nick, just on Performance Materials, can you look at the
business ex-ethylene, the underlying business due this quarter?

<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah. When you look at the Performance Materials business, ethylene, obviously, did
have a impact, because spot prices are so much lower, David, as you know, on a year-over-year basis, like 50% down.
But if you were to take that out, the automotive segment was up slightly in Asia, almost 1% point; Europe up 1.7%;
North America was kind of flattish, auto builds. But we did see a fairly good demand outside of the ethylene impact
that you saw within that segment.

<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Ed, it sounded like you were optimistic about working capital for the year, and
Agriculture is coming in pretty much the way that you thought it was. So, do you have a working capital target, how
much you think things will be better year-over-year, either inclusive of the titanium dioxide separation or without it?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah, look, the way – we just introduced our working capital programs in the first quarter.
So we just got those launched. We were studying in detail in the fourth quarter what we thought the opportunity was.
And over the medium term, I think we said last time, the opportunity looks like it's a good $1 billion to $1.3 billion,
somewhere in that range; what I call more best-in-class performance. So we have a big opportunity there, mostly the
biggest piece in inventory. So we're very, very focused there.
And we are going to have some headwind this year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of severance costs
and all that, so – but again, that's for the benefit of the company going forward. But this won't happen just this year, but
we clearly will have traction this year. And I think as you saw in the first quarter, we had slight improvement already in
working capital and generated an additional $300 million of free cash flow this year over last year. Also, because
CapEx, by the way, was lower by 14% year-over-year, so – and we're starting to get really good focus. Nick and I had
operating reviews with every business over the last week, and working capital is a big part of the conversation with the
team; so, I'm feeling confident we'll build momentum as the year goes.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: The CapEx for the year is supposed to be $1.1 billion, but you spent $360 million in the
first quarter; so you're annualizing at $1.4 billion. Why was CapEx so high in the first quarter? What did you spend on?
And then, do you really expect it to sharply drop in the second?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah. No, if you look back at last year, that – our first quarter is always our high quarter the
way we account for it, so – and by the way, even having said that, with us at the higher – this number this quarter, we're
still – we're 14% below last year, so we're trending properly. We said we'll be down 21% for the year at CapEx. So
when you look at our second quarter, there's a major drop-off in CapEx spending in the plan. We're more front-end
loaded because of maintenance work that happens end of year, beginning the year, and it's just the seasonality of it. So
we will definitely nail the $1.1 billion.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yep. Thank you.

<Q - Don Carson>: Thank you. A follow-up for Jim on Ag. Jim, Crop Protection was down 18% sales in
year-over-year in Q1. How do you expect that to unfold over the year? And as you look at the year as a whole, are you
expecting corn seed share to be up in North America, or are you just being up in line with the increased market
acreage?
<A - James C. Collins>: Yeah. Let's talk about Crop Protection, first. You're right. You did see some pretty significant
declines in volume in the first quarter. That was mostly tied to the insecticide business, and a bulk of that in Brazil. And
we're still chasing two consecutive years of low pest pressure there. We're feeling the impact of insect-protected
varieties of soybeans that are in that market. And overall, I'd say, channel inventories there are still pretty elevated
based on the two years.
In our insecticide business, as well, in Crop Protection, we're feeling the impact of the La Porte shutdown that we had.
Most of that is related to Vydate. We've essentially replaced all of the methanol that we had been selling in previous
years, now, through third parties, but it's just been really tough to find good quality sources of oxamyl; so you're seeing
some of that year-over-year.
As we get into the second half of the year, we continue to drive the launches of Cyazypyr around the world. If I
separate Brazil, Rynaxypyr sales growth has grown volumes every year since its launch, and we'll expect to see good
inroads. And I would say our Crop Protection business in North America started off pretty strong here this year.
Looking at the on-the-ground sales versus our out-the-door business, we feel really good about our penetration there.
It's still early in the season to talk about full year. We still have a lot to go. And when I think about corn share now.
Again, a little early to call share. Agree with you, no doubt we're seeing volume increases in North America consistent
with that USDA report on the 94 million acres, essentially. We're seeing volume growth based on our new technology.
And our teams are going to stay really focused. But like I said, it's way too early to talk about Seed share.
As of today, we're about 30% planted in North America. That is elevated. Normally, we'd be about 16% for this time of
the year. And again, you saw some of that volume increase flow through in our first quarter, but, yeah, we'll see. We'll
see how things shake out around share for the full year.
<Q - Don Carson>: Jim, just to clarify, so you think Crop Protection will still be down for the year, like double digits?
So, all your gain and more in Ag operating income is coming from the Seed side?
<A - James C. Collins>: A little early to size the Crop Protection, overall, full year, but I would expect it to be down
year-over-year. Again, primarily, we're still working to replace the oxamyl volumes, and we're still struggling in that
Brazil market around insecticides.

management teams made those decisions as we went. But we also kept in mind, with the impending merger coming
down the road, we really looked at programs. We also thought we were going to be double counting, double working
on things like that to get there.
Interesting, I've made this point before, our R&D had ramped up the last two-and-a-half years, and I'd say, fairly
significantly in such a short period of time. The reductions we made, which we're mostly done within R&D, really
caught us at about the run rate this company has historically run at on R&D, which I'm very comfortable with it. Kind
of like our 10-year average run rate on a percentage of sales basis is about right where we've always been. So, that's
kind of where we're ending up.
<Q - Jonas Oxgaard>: Very good. Any particular programs you discontinued, or is it just across the board?
<A - James C. Collins>: It was programs in each of the businesses that we were concerned with the payback on. And
that's really how we looked at it on returns and looked at each business, all major programs. And that's how we got
there.

Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - James C. Collins>: Good morning.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. Given the nice results, Nick, I'm guessing that takes the sting out of the Brady ruling for
you.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: That's only rumor, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. As I think about the commentary regarding the tough macro environment and the global
IB slowing, taking a look at your volumes, down materially in Q3, down just 1% in Q4 and here down 2%, it's looking
like you have a little bit easier comps in Q2 and certainly Q3 stepping up in front of us. So, how should we be thinking
about DuPont's ability to maintain volumes or perhaps even grow volumes, but – or is it just too tough of an
environment out there? And how would you answer that question?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Well, look, a bunch of angles on it, because it depends by business. Some of the
businesses looks like growth is going to be very nice here and some product introductions in the second half of the
year. But let me just start by overall saying to you, we're still counting on the year being relatively flat from a volume
price or an organic standpoint, as we move forward. So, if we had a minus 2% in the first quarter, just some slight
improvement kind of in the second half of the year.
And then it really depends by business, as you look out what it's going to be. Nutrition & Health, obviously, good.
We're seeing really broad-based growth there. And by the way, the probiotics area is really hot, like, 30% growth. And
we're actually getting more product out the door with more efficiency in our facilities. So, that's a good sign and should
continue, not just this year but into the future.
And then on the IB side, we're still counting on growth for the year in that business. And then we have launches in a
bunch of our businesses like Leptra and other products. So, we're feeling good as we look out at the pipeline that we'll
actually pick up a little bit more here and be running more flat on a revenue line basis. And I'm not planning or looking
at anything past that. I want the company to plan around that. I don't think it's overly conservative. But if we plan
around it, we'll make some smart decisions if we see upside later in the year, more the better.

<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Okay. So, the viewpoint is it's not overly conservative, but it will -- you have a lot of things
moving up, and I guess a little bit down.
Hey, Ed, in describing the Dow transaction and the shareholder vote coming in Q3, which I think may have been a little
bit later than what I had originally thought, and certainly closing before the end of the year, does this give you enough –
I'm curious, what would be the lag between when the shareholder vote takes place and when you actually close the
transaction?
And are you looking to complete a $2 billion share buyback within that window? Or is that just something that can be
executed until December 31, regardless of if it's Dow DuPont or just DuPont alone?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah, I'll take the first part and let Nick handle the share repurchase part. We are – just to
clarify the dates, we're looking at a shareholder vote at the end of the second quarter, somewhere in that timeframe.
Looks like the timeline, along with the S-4 filings and all that. We just made our comments back. So, that looks like it's
around that timeframe. And then, I hate to put an exact date on it, but I would say, we're shooting for October,
November kind of close of the transaction.
So, both – end of second quarter shareholder votes by both Dow and DuPont shareholders, October, November close.
We're in great shape on all our filings in the key jurisdictions around the world. The big ones: China, Europe, Brazil,
and obviously, the U.S. All that's in motion. And so from a timeline, where we needed to be to try to hit those dates,
we're in good shape.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: And for the amount, Frank, like Ed said, we're going to have the vote, and then we'll
evaluate the opportunities to enter the market. And our plan, obviously, is to make those repurchases. We are going to
be limited by trading windows, even after the vote, from normal blackout periods relating to earnings. So, the end state
of when that merger takes place will influence the amount of time we have available to us to make those purchases. We
can make the purchases as long as we're DuPont company. And then once it forms DowDuPont, well, then obviously
that would be a decision would have to be made by the board of that company.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Okay. All right, thank you.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Jim, I'm just wondering, the 93 million acres
or 94 million acres of corn in the U.S., I mean, obviously, it's going to be helpful volume metrically this year. But how
do you sort of assess the potential hangover from that if we have decent weather over the summer? Are you at all
worried about having lower commodity prices in the fall and into next spring? And given that's already a pretty
competitive operating environment, I guess, I'm just curious what your thoughts are there.
<A - James C. Collins>: Yeah. I think it's a really great question. There's no doubt that our order book and our
volumes in first quarter indicated stronger increases in corn area in the U.S., and that's consistent with that USDA
report. Now, our original guidance for the year assumed a slight increase, so I would agree with you. We're feeling
some of that lift. However, the weather is always a big element here, and we've seen a wet period here in the Midwest.
Last couple of days have been great. We've seen planting jump. I think we're about 30% planted as of today. And that
would be consistent again with what we're hearing that we're probably slightly earlier this season than the historical
average, which would be more about 16%.
Historically, though, the planted acres doesn't always equate to yield. We could still see some issues this summer,
especially during pollination, where we know we can really take the top off of yield on any of those crops. So, kind of
like you, we're in a wait-and-see mode. If weather is perfect and we get 94 million acres, you're right, we'll continue to

see commodity prices at that low end of, I would say, what I'm calling the new normal range of that $3.20 to $4.20 kind
of operating range. And that'll continue to put stress on net farm income and keep farmers really focused on how do
they get the most productivity off of every one of their acres.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Okay. And then, if I could just follow up on Solamet. I heard that volume was up in
the quarter, but it seems like pricing is still weak from a competitive perspective. If I remember back to 4Q, I think you
said there was sort of a dual track of innovation coming this year, where some came, I think, in the first quarter and
more was coming later on. So, how do you assess your performance so far, and what should the slope of the line be for
the balance of the year?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah. The Solamet, if you look at it year-over-year, it's still down very significantly from a
share standpoint. So, that compare is a big part of the performance difference you see in Electronics &
Communications over the year. But on a sequential basis, we did have market share improvement. We thought we
bottomed out in the fourth quarter, and we did bottom out in the fourth quarter. We did have a product introduction at
the end of the year, and that's where we're picking up share on. We're expecting the next introduction by mid-year. And
we think that will put us in the lead here from a technology standpoint and continue to gain share. So, again, very off
from a year ago but now picking up and starting to pick up share.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thank you very much.
<A - James C. Collins>: Yep.

Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: Yes, thank you. Our corn belt channel checks have indicated that Pioneer has gained some traction
this year, tying the financing on Seed sales to Crop Protection chemical sales. Can you comment on how much of a
benefit that's been for you, given our channel check's indicate pricing is broadly down, and yet you're reporting some
corn seed pricing to be modestly up.
<A - James C. Collins>: Yeah. Steve, so you're right, we're always looking for opportunities to collaborate between
our Pioneer and our Crop Protection organizations. If you'll remember, back from the Bank of America Ag conference,
I talked a little bit about that collaboration. This is about looking at our Crop Protection share on – with our key Pioneer
customers and being able to offer a broad portfolio of solutions. So, collaborating with them upfront to think about how
do we tie – how do we connect the best technology that we can to that acre opportunity for grower productivity?
If you do look at North America, you're right; our price is up in the market. And as we said to you, we're attributing that
to a couple of areas. Mostly, we think it's on new technology. About half of our lineup in North America is brand new
in the last two years. And you'll know that we do impact trialing, and even on-farm trialing for a couple of years ahead
of time, so growers get a chance to take a good look at new genetics before they commit fully. And so, a big part of our
lift in North America is that they went all in on a lot of that new technology this season.
<Q - Steve Byrne>: And would you say that lift could be accelerated post the merger with Dow, where your Crop
Protection chemical platform would be broader at that point?
<A - James C. Collins>: There's no doubt that we're excited about a broader portfolio of offerings. We'll be able to
offer much more choices to growers out there in the marketplace. And it's a little too early for us to begin to speculate
on how we might execute against that; but yes, no doubt that there will be more choices out there.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah. Hi, good morning.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Morning.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: In Electronics, you saw 9% volume drop and you talked a little bit about Solamet paste. How
much of the decline was in solar versus how much of it was in Consumer Electronics? And then, in Consumer
Electronics, what are the products where you're seeing these declines?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So, if you look at the pieces in PV, P.J., there's an element of the photovoltaic that
was very strong. Our Tedlar film – volume grew in the Tedlar film side of the house. Now, there's no doubt, as Ed
already mentioned, that from the Solamet paste side, on a year-over-year basis, a significant change in volume on that
product line.
Consumer Electronics was weaker. We did see weaker demand, and we actually anticipate that to continue in quarter
two and start to turn in the second half of the year. The exact breakdown of how much is Electronics versus how much
is PV, I don't have that at my fingertips right now.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Okay. Thank you. And then, jumping to your free cash flow, if you look back, free cash flow
defined as operating cash flow minus CapEx, it has declined materially in the last three years compared to prior levels.
And so given that, and given your significant new cost-cutting, do you have any specific goals for free cash flow this
year? Thank you.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Specific targets, is that what you said, P.J.?
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, specific targets for this year.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yes. Well, what we have is a very active plan in place, now, around working capital
improvements, which is going to be a key element to generating additional cash flow from operations as we look at
that. And as you already heard, we have reductions in our CapEx. So all of those programs that are in place are going to
be generating improvements around the free cash flow line. We haven't quantified the total impact in the current year,
yet. We've talked about it more in the medium time period of the impact those programs are going to have.

overhead of the three separate entities would not be higher than that of the parent. I'm wondering if that's still your
expectation.
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Yeah, we're definitely planning the – Sandy, the 18-month to 24-month period. We're really
– we have a lot of teams going that are already doing some of the work to help us out on that timeline. As I think we've
mentioned before, we've already started the financial carve-out work, so we'll get way ahead on that part of the
schedule. So, yeah, the timing in the 18 months to 24 months, we're very comfortable with. And obviously, we'd all like

to pull that in if we can, but that's the timeline we're on now and we'll keep working that as we go forward.
And you had a second part?
<A - Gregory R. Friedman>: Corporate overhead.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Is it corporate overhead?
<A - Edward D. Breen>: Oh, corporate – yeah. No, our plan is – with the reductions we've done here, our plan would
be – and by the way, I did this in my prior life. We're going to keep the overhead percent of sales down, where we're
getting them to with the reductions that both companies are making as we speak. So, to me, a more of a world-class
percent for corporate overhead is approaching 1% of sales, and we're – as I think Nick mentioned, we're down to 1.3%
of sales with the actions we've taken. So, we're kind of getting in that zip code, and that's where we plan to be with each
of the companies.
<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Okay, great, thank you. And then a follow-up on Ag. You mentioned losing out on some
insecticide sales in Latin America due to the presence of traded corn. Outside of Latin America, are you seeing the crop
chemical category lose out to seed demand, just given how tight grower margins are? Are you seeing that dynamic
anywhere outside of Latin America?
<A - James C. Collins>: Outside of Latin America. Not that I'm – not that would be remarkable here, because as I
think about how the season is unfolding, we're excited about the start to North America. We're seeing, as I mentioned,
good flow-through to on-the-ground sales versus out-the-door. And our business in Europe, especially in Eastern
Europe, had a strong start to the year. So, a little early for Asia, a little more seasonal effect on Asia, as we get further
into the year. But right now, it's all about Brazil.
