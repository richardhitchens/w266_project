I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson.
Please go ahead.
Craig M. Rossman
Thank you, Alicia. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank
Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results.
The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay

I will start with the first quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter
decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult
economic conditions that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a
global industrial recession and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened
during the course of the fourth calendar quarter.
In the energy sector, lower, but equally as important uncertain oil prices continue to impact both operational and capital
spending by our end customers. Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted
earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50.
These separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spinoff of Network Power
and the potential divestitures of the motors and drives and power generation businesses.
Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations and the company remains well-positioned for
a challenging 2016.
Turning to slide three, gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume
deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transactions of $27 million and
portfolio repositioning separation costs of $24 million.
Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on
profitability. During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still
plans for fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately $1.2 billion.
Turning to slide four, underlying sales were down in all regions except Europe, where our euro-based businesses are
becoming more globally competitive.
Turning to slide five, business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage
and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions.
Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. Similar to many industrial manufacturers,
capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%.
Turning to slide six, Process Management, underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending
remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressure spending, particularly in
upstream market.
Upstream projects underway will continue to completion, but new projects are facing potentially further delays.
Downstream markets remain favorable in the U.S., Europe, and Middle East, mainly in small to medium-sized projects
in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business
activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets.
Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued
weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These
conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvements expected in the second half of the fiscal
year.
Turning to slide eight, Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and
telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed.
From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India, and Southeast Asia while Latin America reflected
favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico.
Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefiting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have
reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment.
Turning to slide nine, Climate Technologies' underlying sales declined 10% as global air-conditioning sales decreased,
driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration

markets grew modestly as growth in the United States and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in
the air-conditioning and refrigeration markets remains favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in
2016.
Turning to slide 10, underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable
activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet-dry vacuums and food waste disposers
businesses.
Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7% from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro
business.
The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels
of growth in this segment.
Turning to slide 11, as we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year.
But we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on
our operational plans, while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were
announced last June.
Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends; we are reaffirming our fiscal-year 2016 guidance.
Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation and a
deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each.
We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25, excluding estimated separation costs of
approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous
expectations.
For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6%, excluding negative
currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75
million, or approximately 11% – or $0.11 per share.
Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in
2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion.
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Mr. David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Craig. Thank you very much for everyone joining us today. I appreciate that. We are looking
forward to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week, and we'll talk a little bit more about that in a second,
but looking really forward to seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group.
I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first
quarter, and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our
profitability, our earnings and cash flow for the remaining part of this year.
And as I look at the plans we started back from restructuring back in February and I look at announcement of
repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress, but it is clearly all about executing
around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from a standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of
repositioning this company, and looking forward to how as we go through a very challenging global economy, very
challenging industrial recession that we see today, and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue
to add assets once we reposition to a new Emerson platform.

Looking forward to giving you insights of how we see the 26 (sic) [2016] (9:47) unfolding from an economic
standpoint, how we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may
see from a risk standpoint and what we're going to have to do about those if we see additional risks. Those are all things
that we'll be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week.
Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steve Sonnenberg talk about the two key business segments,
business platforms that we're moving into, the Commercial & Residential Solutions and then also the Automation
Solutions; those two individuals will give you insights to what we see the strength of these platforms, what we can do
with those platforms, and where we're going to invest going forward.
Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas industrial marketplace right now, but it's nothing new. We've been here
before. We know what to do to deal with this issue. It's why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. As we
talked amongst the business leaders, the OC, the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to
do additional restructuring. We'll continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive and
that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us. That is what we're all about
right now, executing around that and getting things forward.
As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at
Emerson. I've never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the
interest rates, the – I guess the attitudes. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global
CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. But we are now basically in our fourth
quarter of the recession. I see – as we'll talk about next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter,
but sequentially, our game plan is to improve the business, cycle the business back up and start improving the
profitability, and that's what we're all about here.
So with that, I'll open the floor. I'm glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want to again thank the organization. They
did a great job executing around the plans we put out there. They're making great progress, and clearly, it's only one
quarter. We know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve the sales, the profitability, the earnings and the cash
flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves.
With that, I open the floor.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jonny Wright of Nomura.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good morning, Jonny.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: I am eating a [ph] Twix (13:00) bar because I didn't have anything because the board meeting
just ended, so I had to get something in my body here, being an undernourished CEO.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Sure. So, back in August I think on the earnings call Dave you talked about Process
orders stabilizing, but if oil moved below kind of $30, or backed off, or words to that effect. So here we are; oil is
around $30. I'm just wondering how you see that playing out for Process if oil stays at these levels, both this year and
then into FY 2017?
<A - David N. Farr>: Let me see. Chevron reported a loss; BP reported a loss; so I would say the market's stressed. So
from my perspective right now, I would say the capital market in oil and gas is going to be lower. Our expectations for
our Process business will be lower and we'll have to do additional restructuring. We're looking at a situation, in my

opinion, in oil and gas marketplaces that will not recover until well past the middle of 2017, maybe late 2017.
Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn't serve the oil and gas marketplace. So even though we'll talk
about this next week, oil and gas spending is down; it's not going to zero. It will be a tougher marketplace and we'll
have to work harder at it, and clearly there is a lot of uncertainty around this. But the game is, we're going to have to
figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business and get our costs down and it will clearly be a tougher year in
2016 than we thought. That's the game; pretty straightforward.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay. Great. And in the call I guess in January you guys announced a big project with
Korea petro chem, I think $150 million. So just interested to see you guys taking a preferred equity investment in that
customer. I was wondering, is that reflective of the competitive environment where alongside price you're now having
to think of other ways to win business? Or how do you think about that and how should we think about it going forward
on other kind of big large projects?
<A - David N. Farr>: We've done similar things in the past; this is unique. This is very strategic for the country of
Egypt and we felt that, as did other people – we're not the only one that did this. We're probably the only one that went
public with it, but I think that you'll see this happening from time to time. It's a huge opportunity for us and it really is
all about forming a relationship because I think once this project's done and is successful, there'll be future projects.
And it will happen, but it's not for every customer, it's not for every marketplace. But this one, we worked on it a long
time, and I met with the CEO and we had long conversations and I feel that this makes a lot of sense for us relative to
the strategic relationship going forward. So, I don't think it's – it's just our commitment to making sure that these guys
are successful, and we're going to have a lot of business with them for many years to come.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Dave. See you next week.

We'll go next to Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: So, Dave, just looking at the order trends here and Process in December, obviously the
month-to-month can be volatile with different project activity and what stays and goes around the comp walks, but
maybe just comment on how that month looked and any kind of body language you've gotten just with the last $10
move? Obviously, projects don't go forward on a day, a week or even a month of oil prices, but maybe what the
psychology has been with this last move down?
<A - David N. Farr>: To be honest, I think the psychology is very nervous and tense within the big oil and gas
investors at this point in time. I think that we see from our perspective, what we're looking at is that – we'll talk to you
next week. We'll try to encompass what we think the downside will be relative to oil and gas and the Process
businesses, but I would say the December quarter for orders for Process were not that bad. We pretty well had that
factored in what's going on. I would say that my concern is the psyche of Chevron or psyche of a ExxonMobil, psyche
of these Shell's and the BPs and things like are going to, again, freeze up some of that spending level. They can't go to
zero, but I think it's going to make it tougher.
So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term, and our oil and gas – I mean our old Process
order pace will be a drag on this and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that's where we are at this point
in time. We'll give you an update on what I think the Process segment's going to do, but it'll be more negative based on
– someone, the first question, I did say that when the price of oil got down to that level it'd be an impact. And I think
right now our underlying sales will be more negative in the Process than we thought originally. And hence, we're going
to have to go after more costs there so.

But the psyche's not good in that space right now. Fortunately there's more investments going on in the other parts of
the marketplace and it's a big part of the marketplace, but the oil and gas investment area's not very good right now.
And I think it's going to hurt us for the second half of this year.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: And obviously you'll touch more on this next week, but I think, maybe looking to last
quarter, the expectation on being able to hold the line on price somewhat and being able to hold the line on margins this
year, assuming all that plays out, what we're seeing today, I would imagine those two items are also part of that
discussion that maybe goes out the window as well?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's not going out the window. From the standpoint of, the pricing right now is, when we make a
forecast, we look at ranges. We have ranges. There's a reason why we go two to five or other ranges in underlying
sales. We look at also price environment changing, too. So the pricing environment today is still within the range that
we laid out when we put our plan together back in August and September and talked to you all in November. And that
material inflation is continuing to drop down. So we're going to give you a forecast, we'll give you range of what it
looks like right now.
But it's well within our range; I'd say the one negative will be the sales, underlying sales of Process will be more
negative, and the profitability will still be very good, and we're going to have to take some additional restructuring both
for the 2016 and 2017 in that space because the recovery will be longer. And we are going to see what our customer
base does right now, as you said. They don't move that fast, but I know the psyche is not good. I mean you just have to
look at the reports that came out in the last three days or four days relative to two major oil and gas providers.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Got you. Understood. I guess we will learn more next week. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. Good, thanks.
Operator
We'll go next Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Dave, so on the last quarter's call you talked about the expectation that we might see one
more quarter where inventory in the channel could be worked down and then by 2Q destocking could be behind
Emerson. Did you see – I assume you saw continued destocking in the quarter. Do you think inventories in the channel
are low enough where the destocking for the whole company should end as we go through fiscal 2Q and then second
half of 2016?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say to what my knowledge is right now, inventory levels within the channel including
ourselves, are levels that they're pretty good levels, low. And so, the pace of the business right now in the run rate's
where I see, I would say the inventory levels are pretty good for us. I don't see much of a downward draft on that. Now
I think it's pretty well over with, probably very minor downward draft. I think it's pretty well there around the world.
I've been in Asia, I've been around the world and I don't see the inventories being a big issue for us right now. So, that's
a good thing.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Got it. And then just asking about China. You talked about China in 2016 maybe being
down mid-single digits on your last call and maybe down 15% in 1Q, but you actually did down 13%, so do you think
China has stabilized a little bit for you in terms of the decline? And are you still expecting mid-single digits for 2016 to
hold down mid-single digits?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, first of all, I called down 15% and down 13%, I would say that's a pretty good forecast
call right there without knowing what was going to happen. So, I know, if I could do that, maybe I should go into
investment mode. But, just joking, clearly.

I think that China in my opinion today, the forecast, when we put that out there, I still think it's going to be that
mid-single plus digits. I think it's going to be in that 5%, 6%, 7% range, negative. I don't see it changing.
I would say my China organization is more optimistic than that. They are less negative, but I think that looking at what
I see going on in China and the marketplace around the world I think that that's going to be a tough one for them to do.
Though they are working through the inventory that was built up in the first part of 2015, but my gut tells me that I
would not be surprised if we don't finish at minus 7% or 8% in China when it's all said and done.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Thanks.

We'll go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: And, Dave, I'll welcome you over as an analyst any time you want to come.
<A - David N. Farr>: I didn't say an analyst I said investor.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Oh, investor, got it.
<A - David N. Farr>: You know I am not that good of an analyst. You know that. I would fail. I would be fired within
one week. Investor, that's a whole other story.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: All right. Well, why don't you just keep your day job.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah. You're right.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: So maybe focusing a little bit on your commentary about the last 30 days never being so
volatile and just taking a look at the order trends. It's interesting, as you look at the trends you think about the last 30
days, it's interesting that you haven't really updated your guidance for the underlying growth rate for the year.
Recognize that comps are going to get easier as we get through the year, but why not maybe be a little bit more, I
guess, conservative with the underlying order trends or with the underlying organic growth trends for 2016?
<A - David N. Farr>: Because I think that when we put our plan together, we had certain assumptions relative to the
volatility of the marketplace and what the market was going to look like. And as I look at all analysis and I look at the
upsides, the downsides, I think right now we're still well within that boundary. And to come out and to widen that
boundary right now is not what I find acceptable.
I think our organization at this point in time, we're well within that, even with the 30 day risk. I mean, that risk in the 30
days is more around one piece of the company and the standpoint – I mean Europe's not that case, it's primarily around
the oil and gas, the price of oil and gas investments. So, it's not the whole economy, but we encompass what we
thought could possibly happen to us. Now it could get worse and I'll talk a little bit about that in Austin; but right now,
I think we're well with inside the boundaries of what we put out there.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: All right. Okay. Fair enough. And maybe...

<A - David N. Farr>: By the way, it helped that. We got ahead a little bit in the first quarter, so it did help a little bit
there. We made progress better than I thought, so clearly it helped me a little bit. But it's obviously our easiest quarter. I
mean, I'm not a fool. I know that.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Sure. That makes sense. Maybe talking about the cost actions then for a second. I just
want to make sure I've got my numbers straight. You spent a little over $220 million in restructuring in 2015. I think
there was another $13 million in 1Q.
<A - David N. Farr>: Correct.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Can you talk a little bit about the benefits that came through this quarter? Clearly,
they're helping the margins a little bit, and maybe your expectations on cadence as we progress through the year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah. I think what we see right now, around $80 million improvement came through in the first
quarter.
<Q - Joseph Alfred Ritchie>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: From the standpoint of restructuring, there's still a big number in the second quarter. My gut
tells me that we'll probably be around restructuring around $20 million in the second quarter, and then we're going to be
increasing this.
The question is, can I get it done in the third quarter or fourth quarter? Is it going to be more in the early part of next
year? But clearly, I think you're going to be looking at the 20 pace for each quarter now as we start pushing anticipation
of concerns that we may have in the marketplace out there.
Savings wise, you're going to be building for this 80 and incrementally be coming up towards – I would say – the 90
level by the time you get into that fourth quarter. And that's basically how we see that happening per quarter.

We'll go next to Mike Wood of Macquarie Securities Group.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Hi. Good job executing in a very tough back drop.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, I appreciate that.
<Q - Mike Wood>: In earlier question on the price, have you actually began to see the increased price competition in
Process and has that been rational, and just given the fact there's very little project activity out there, I'm just curious
how you actually measure that price change?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, we measure price change obviously on the contracts. We obviously measure the price
change that we have to give on short-term actions from the standpoint of a day-to-day business. So, it's very measurable
because we can see the average pricing within the structure of the business. But you're right, there's not been a lot of
big bids around what I would say the oil and gas or the other big projects, so the pricing has been rational.
The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, we're also major player in the Process out of Europe, and
so we get the benefit of that, too. So, what I think is going to happen is we're going to be seeing sales shift to our
European operation, because we've been working for this last 12 months. The dollar really started appreciating last year
– a little over a year ago – so we've been working to get a rebalanced cost structure, which we'll continue to do.
So, our European organization right now is seeing the benefit of a lower cost structure, so they're winning. And I would
say, you're going to see other regions of the world lose. So, we're pushing it around the world just like our European

competitors. That's one of the benefits we do have relative to having a broad manufacturing basis in all these
businesses.
So, I feel reasonably comfortable right now on the forecast we're going to give you for price. I mean, we tracked this
extremely hard. I don't know how long you've been following us, but I'll be the first one to admit in the early
2002-2003 timeframe – I can't remember exactly when that was – we got sideswiped on how fast this thing moved. But
now we've created a lot tougher tracking Process, and so I can tell what's going on across this company. And it's
tracking, it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year but well within what I thought we were going to
see and well within the net material inflation level. So, people are acting rational. It's going to be an interesting year to
see. A lot of people are trying to improve their profitability on down volume. And dropping price, the down volume to
try to improve your profitability does not work. Economics 101; it does not work.
<Q - Mike Wood>: Understood. And given the recent volatility you mentioned in crude, how does that impact the
downstream businesses and MRO and your investments that you're making?
<A - David N. Farr>: Two things. I am concerned. That's why I think we're talking about, we need to get our action
together and think about it, if it takes longer to recover as we go into late 2016, early 2017 in the Process side. Because
I personally think what will happen is, there will be a freeze, a little bit right now relative to a lot of our cash customers,
as they say, okay, we're reallocating capital, we're cutting capital again 10%, where that number is going to be, we'll
see here in the next 30 days to 60 days. And that will create a pressure on I know, our base relative to smaller projects
and the MRO projects.
So, the initial reaction is, I think we're going to see a slowdown, and then hopefully as we get into the year, we'll start
seeing that capital free back up again. You can't go to zero; it's not going to go to zero. But they're clearly going to
reallocate, and they're doing that really fast right now from our customer base.
So, my concern right now is, we're looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales, underlying Process. We
need to take capacity offline, so from my perspective right now, we, initial phases the last 12 months is very much
focused on people, on restructuring the overall overhead cost and now what I want to look at, we're going look at a
longer recovery here in this particular part of the Process world. We got to look at taking fixed assets offline.
And so now, that's Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders at their upcoming reviews, which start, I think a week
or two from now. Look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently, if we're looking at a different
environment and where should that capacity be and not be. So, I think that will lead to higher levels of restructuring
later this year, early 2017.

related to that, any color you can give on orders in January?

<A - David N. Farr>: I don't have orders for January yet. This is February 2, so I don't have that yet; it's a little bit
quick for me and the company. But relative to IA, I think IA got hit harder, sooner relative to the space they're in. And
so, yeah, there might be a little downside risk in IA, but not that much. I think these guys are sitting really down pretty
far right now. And things can always go down further, but my gut tells me they are pretty close to that cycle right now.
The Process guys, because of the type of business they have, they are still coming off some of the wins and things
they've won the last couple of years. So, I think they will continue to slide a little bit here. And that's my biggest
concern right now; if I look at the 2016 forecast, I always have a little IA concern, but my biggest concern would be the
Process guys at this point in time.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks. And then Network Power, orders look a little less bad than a few months ago. Margins
are up. You have a big project in Europe you're working on, but outside and beyond that, do you think that you've
succeeded now in sort of stabilizing the earnings in Network Power and the rest of the year we should see that stable
margin play out?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. Yes. I think if you look at the underlying order pace of our Network Power business, is
actually – nose is up. And as of right now, even when I was talking to Scott Barbour today, and his team is doing a
great job out there, the nose is up, continues to move the right way, profitability continues to move the right way. These
guys took some serious actions, hard actions in the last 12 months, 18 months, and right now I feel good about – it's a
broad base and I feel good that these guys are heading the right way.
As of right today, that's how I feel. So, I feel good about that. I think they had a very good first quarter. I mean, it's a
long way to go, but if the nose is up right now, that's a good place to be in any business, as you know.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

We'll go next to Steven Winoker of Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Dave, given all of the commentary and sort of how obvious the volatility is right now,
what's going on with the process, the capital – deployment process, or I should say sales process, for Industrial
Automation, some of those assets and the separation activities for Network Power. How is – is that delayed in any way?
<A - David N. Farr>: The Network Power, there's no delay going on. We have a dual path looking at strategic buyers
within that business. We also have the dual path of moving right down towards the spin. So that path is well underway.
On the Industrial Automation assets, I would say that basically what we see right now, we're probably two months to
three months behind where I want to be relative to the discussions with strategic buyers. So, I would say Network
Power heading okay, Industrial Automation, given potential customer base – a lot of my potential customers – the
buyers I think clearly are seeing some tough times too. So, I would say that one is a little bit delayed by a couple
months, but that's as of right now today as I reported to the board. So...
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, Dave. And then also, the combination of Process in Industrial, in other words the
future structure of the business, the future Emerson here, are you taking actions already to combine overhead or other
elements of these two businesses yet or is it just standalone frankly until you get that other process done and then you'll
go down this one?
<A - David N. Farr>: We are – I'm being very careful here. Relative to this business, we are taking some actions early
on. The combination – not totally across the board, but in certain select areas in preparation of it. So, that will be – by

We'll go to Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Securities.
<Q - Eli Lustgarten>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Eli Lustgarten>: One quick question on the Process side. You talk about the upstream projects, some on
completion, new projects. What portion of the business at this point still relates to the upstream projects that are being
completed and how much does that disappear? What percentage of that go to as you look through the year? Does that
basically go to a very minor part, or how do we handle that?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't have those exact numbers. I can't give you that. I mean, I can't break it out that way. I
know what our oil and gas percentage will be this year in upstream. I mean, I know it's still going to be a significant
percentage of our total business, and it will be next year, too, because it's not going to zero. People just don't stop it.
We'll give you our best feel for it on next week. I have some ideas on where we think the segments are going to go, but
they don't move that fast. So, it's really hard to say, because what we talk about and what you think about are not
necessarily how everyone looks at this business in the day-to-day business standpoint. So, I can't give you that
information, to be honest.
<Q - Eli Lustgarten>: I'm just trying to sense is that the part that's disappearing? Just trying to see are we close to the
bottom of that impacting or you sort of indicating that by middle of the year [indiscernible] (37:36)
<A - David N. Farr>: No, I don't think it is.
<Q - Eli Lustgarten>: You talk about having to do more restructuring in Process because of market; that's quite easily
understood. But can you talk about whether you're starting to look at Industrial Automation in the same way? It's a very
weak market, weak conditions are so that there's more – or a second level of restructuring there to try to hold
profitability better because that profitability can be under a lot of pressure if the demands stays in the current way.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, we've laid out the restructuring that we have – intend to do this year relative to the
Industrial Automation business, and that's well underway. I'm also in the Process of selling that business.
So from my perspective, I mean, I believe – if there's more [indiscernible] (38:19) from the potential buyer of the
company. I have a plan laid out which is being worked on right now. I don't see anything at this point in time. Now, if
we make the decision we're not going to sell this Industrial Automation asset, then [indiscernible] (38:29) But right
now, we're down a path that we're going to sell that asset.
<Q - Eli Lustgarten>: All right. Thank you. See you next week.

We'll go next to John Inch of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - John G. Inch>: So last quarter you called out in general incremental concerns possibly about Middle East. Has
your thought Process changed, because there's obviously been some conjecture around possible efforts to curtail
production and you called it volatile. I'm just curious, has anything changed in the last few months with respect to your
perspective on Middle East?
<A - David N. Farr>: No. My perspective on the Middle East hasn't changed. I think that the risk I see today in the
world for spending, and you're talking about say the oil and gas, the type of spending that goes on in additional Process
spending, North America, China, and Latin America. Those are the three concerned areas I have relative to the
spending around that industry. I was just came back from the Middle East. I mean, the national economies have to
spend a certain level of money. And they have been cutting back, and I think we could have had that built in.
So, I feel okay there right now as of right now. Obviously, some major crisis could erupt in the Middle East and things
blowing up and stuff like that, but right now I feel reasonably good about that. But my concerns are North America
investments and the concerns we're going to have on companies that may not make it or get consolidating. And then
China, clearly, I think, concerns – my forecast for China is worse than probably most people say out there. So, I'm a
little concerned about that one.
<Q - John G. Inch>: That makes sense. Dave, a year ago at the Analyst Meeting, you made comments that you
thought Canada's petroleum industry was probably going to be better than people expected because there were a lot of
obviously reasons for it, efforts to support domestic businesses, that sort of thing. Do you think that's changed? The
dollar has collapsed a lot and I guess debateably it makes that country a little more export competitive or what not. I'm
just wondering if you think because it's such an important trading partner with the United States if you think the
outlook for Canada is kind of sort of where you thought it was before? It's sort of a similar question on the Middle East,
only for Canada.
<A - David N. Farr>: I'd say it's worse. One, they have a new type of government there that doesn't necessarily care
for this industry. And secondly, the price where it is right now, it's not good. So I would say from our perspective, what
we've been doing is we've been restructuring and downsizing in Canada. So, I mean, it's an important market, but
strategically it's going to be a tough market for the next two years.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Just lastly, Dave. You obviously touch an awful lot of verticals, right, lots of different things, so
kind of ex-petroleum do you think that – are you guys tracking maybe some end markets or verticals or other things
within Emerson that actually could be contributively positive or surprise kind of to the upside let's call it in the next six
months to 12 months?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we're going to give you a different view of the verticals and the growth rates next week.
And I think the act answer is yes. I think there's several verticals that are going to be doing better than people think.
And that's where – you know, we started talking about this last summer. We've been reallocating our resources, really
pushing hard to reallocate our resources. We had a very, very good run in the oil and gas upstream, and we gained a lot
of growth, gained a lot of market share. And now what we're doing is refocusing those resources. And so we'll talk a
little bit about that next week, because what you just said is exactly right. And there are markets out there, and the
whole organization within Process management is focused on how they can go after those markets and re-energize the
work force and go after that.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. See you next week. Thanks, guys.

We'll go next to Robert McCarthy of Stifel.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Hey. Yeah, maybe if we can just go back to, I think, kind of a question I asked on the last
call, but just given what you see within the Process and obviously your commentary throughout the last 30 days, I think
implicit in your guidance for fiscal 2016 was some firming in order trends in terms of kind of the March/April
timeframe. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but I think it was to that effect. And then...
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, that's what I said.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, that's not exactly what I said. You're not putting words. And I'll tell you again today that
I'll show you a chart next week that I'm saying – I'm saying right now, the call is April 1, our orders go positive. Total
orders.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Okay. And...
<A - David N. Farr>: I said that last time on the call, I'm still saying that.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Okay. So...
<A - David N. Farr>: Whatever, you know what, but I'm making that call. And I'll stand by that call.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: All right. And you don't want to move the call to April 2 maybe? [indiscernible] (43:22)
<A - David N. Farr>: What? Because it's April Fools' Day, so I can get it. I am not playing that game.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: I made that call back then, and I'm standing by that call.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Okay. Fair enough. I guess the only other question I have is, I mean, you did mention, and
this dovetails with the question I just asked, but I think you did mention like we've come through four quarters of what
looks like an industrial recession. You think there's about one to two left. Are you seeing anything in the GFI or just the
order patterns, the trajectory absent kind of Process management vertical where it's obviously dynamic and tied to the
commodity price, where you can kind of point to an upward trajectory or reason for recovery there in terms of the
macro?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. The answer is yes. And the call is April 1, and I'm talking about the April orders, you know
that.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Yeah.
<A - David N. Farr>: You know that. And then, we're right now Frank and I will sit here, we'll tell you we believe that
our underlying sales will go positive in the third quarter. Based on the...
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: All right.
<A - David N. Farr>: ...what we see – I felt that all year long, and Frank has crossed his fingers over there, he is a
great CFO, he really stays right behind us. He is right behind with a gun to my back. But, no, I still believe that.
And the key issue, now keep in mind, if you are paying attention, we said that first quarter underlying sales will be
down, probably 9% to 10%. We finished a little bit under 9%. Last time I talked on the phone I said underlying sales
will be down 5% to 7% in the second quarter. I am – now, Frank and I believe that our underlying sales will be down

4% to 6% in the second quarter.
So the key issue for us is, as we map out and we get together, we'll give you the insight on orders when we're together
next week. We're trying to get orders, somebody asked me a question about January, so we'll try to get those so we can
at least have a sense on where to go the next week.
If [indiscernible] (45:24) would stop going to play basketball so much and watching LeBron James maybe we could get
them. So, I think right now I'm standing behind that. I mean the chart is going to say, April, orders go above positive
and third quarter sales will have a plus in front of them, underlying sales.
<Q - Robert McCarthy>: Well...
<A - David N. Farr>: And we will not be standing there talking to me.

We'll go next to Scott Davis of Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I'm trying to reconcile I think like everybody else. You're bearish, but you're still calling
things getting better in April. And I think the angle I want to take is that – and there's a good and bad here, and the
good is that you mentioned the comment fixed assets offline and we've been writing and we think the entire industry
needs to do this. But, you guys are the only ones that are really doing it. So, how do we get out of this mess, if you're
one of the only companies that's willing to admit that it's a, for lack of a better word, a bit of a shit-show out there, how
do we get out of this mess to where even if your orders turn call it slightly positive, I mean it's probably more flattish
than positive to be more realistic, but how do we get out of this?
<A - David N. Farr>: It'll be above the line, though. It'll be above the line. I've actually got my nose above the water if
it counts, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Well, what's it going to take to get us out of this mess is my question really, Dave, because
again unless everybody capitulates, which we saw in 2002, we saw it in 2009, doesn't it just start to bleed into different
components of the economy and different businesses that you sell into that aren't being impacted right now start to see
impacted as we get later on in the call it, cycle?
<A - David N. Farr>: I can't speak to other people. I mean, they've got to be looking at the same issues from the
standpoint of too much cost, too much capital, fixed investments invested, they've got to be looking at that. And so,
eventually they're going to have to say, look, we've got to take action.
If they don't take action, I think there will be some other people coming in work on that issue. But from our standpoint,
I feel quite strongly, as you know, we're trying to deal with this issue. We make calls, I make calls, you know me for a
long time. I make a call. Sometimes I call it right, sometimes I call it wrong. But you have to make calls and say, we
got too much capacity, things are going to be down longer, you've got to deal with it.
And we started seeing this happen last year, and I think other people are now maybe just starting to see it and they're
starting to deal with it. But if you don't have the capability of dealing with it, sometimes you just sit there and tread
water and watch your profitability get hit. I think there are several companies out there, in my opinion, in the industry
right now that are doing a good job in dealing with this issue. There are several companies that are not, and you know

that. You can see it.
And I don't have that magic call. I just know I can tell you what we can do. And so I know right now that certain things
are going the right way, I have a feel for what things are. But I do know that given right now, given where the price of
oil and gas is and potentially where it could go, we fundamentally will have a capacity issue on that industry, which we
didn't have, say 12 months ago. And so, we've got to think about how we deal with that issue, and that, as you know,
also takes time. And so – but that's on the table right now, and no one wants to deal with that because that's a really
hard thing to deal with it. You got a deal with it, period.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah. Understood, and I'm encouraged by your comment on price being relatively rational. It
was in the last cycle as well, but there's always little tidbits out there. Caterpillar has been talking about the alternator
contract they have with you guys and trying to drive price down. Do you view that as more of a one-off or do you have
multiple situations going on like that, but you've been able to hold on price because the competing bids haven't been
any better?
<A - David N. Farr>: From the standpoint, I think most people are being rational on this thing. Our contract with
Caterpillar is a contract, and your contract is set, they have the right to go do what they want to do, but the contract is
set.
And so from the standpoint of the overall industry, I would say, the biggest issue right now is because volumes are
dropping for people and they have excess capacity, trying to fill a plan off the lower price is not a very smart thing to
do, because it doesn't work for you. So, that's why I think it's been more rational here.
And so far, I think we've mapped it out and Frank and Ed Purvis and all the business leaders laid out a plan, what they
thought last summer, early fall, and they'll look at it again right now on the pricing, and it's pretty well in line, and I feel
good about it. But like I said, 10 years ago, I think it was 12 years ago, I got really sideswiped, and so that's why we
spent more time on it than probably the average company.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Yeah. Understood. Good luck, guys. I'll see you next week.
<A - David N. Farr>: See you next week, Scott.

We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Dave, just within the Process spending that you are seeing, we went through this
period which seems like in a lot of cases we're still in, where seemingly everything was getting cut upstream,
midstream, downstream, maintenance spending. The spending that you are seeing happening, whether it's some of the
downstream stuff or the chemical, what are the projects exactly? What are people willing to spend on right now?
<A - David N. Farr>: On the big projects that are, say, upstream is that, the projects to a certain point in time that they
see that spending – I'll make a number up – $1 billion more to get cash flow, the customer is going to move forward
with that. Because if you're stuck 75% into a project and you stop it, you got a problem because the project won't be
that good by the time you come back to it in five years or whatever. So most people you're seeing, those monies will
get spent.
Now every time they go through a process of having to cut capital within that industry, that will fine tune that, but most
people are taking advantage of the environment right now to go out and improve their – I'd say the efficiency in the
facilities, sort of spending on small capital projects, upgrades that will help get more out of the facility, higher quality,
higher yield. So that's what they're spending right now, to get more out of each facility.

I mean, I see them still spending money, it's just an interesting process. They're going through the process of being very
selective where when they had – things were going their way they threw a lot of money at everything. So, the money is
still being spent, but it's definitely going to be a lot more selective and it's going to be much more on how can I improve
the investments we've made over the last 10 years to get me more money out of that, given the fact that my oil prices
are down or my inputs are down? What can I do?
So, they're being a lot more selective along those lines, which is a good business for us, but clearly you don't have the
big projects which give you a lot of topline growth with a big bang. But there's money being spent out there.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then on Network Power, nice margin result there in the quarter. It's been a
while since Network Power margins beat by expectations. Is that a function of having kind of cleared any major part of
the restructuring or just a lag of getting this stuff to kind of show up in what you're shipping in terms of the numbers, or
is there a reason why it sort of finally came through now?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think that there's – across Network Power, from the standpoint of the actions they started
undertaking last summer and started flowing through and they've systematically been working them, it's really starting
to come through in the final P&L. So it started actually around the last month of the last year – of the fiscal year,
September – and it's proceeded each month.
I mean, our expectation is that this will continue to take hold based on what we see happening in that market. So, we
should see a sequential type of margin improvement in that business, which will be good. Because Scott and his team
have really attacked this; they're getting out of certain businesses, they're investing in other businesses. I think they've
done a great job evaluating where they want to be in the cost structure they have, and now they're executing around that
stability. And my hat is off to that team in a very dynamic marketplace. So, I think they're heading the right way and I
feel good about that. They did a great job executing in the first quarter.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you.

We'll go next to Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Richard Kwas>: Hey. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Rich.
<Q - Richard Kwas>: So, Dave, just broadly speaking, given what's going on in oil and gas here in North America,
are you seeing any signs in your other businesses of meaningful contagion in CR&S or Climate; anything that you
would point out here? You talked about the last 30 days being volatile. Just any thoughts there because obviously
there's a lot more concern in the market in the last 60 days or so?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I would say we have not seen it yet, Rich, from the order pattern that we saw in
December. I don't know – even the forecast for January, I didn't see anything. But, it could take a little while, but we
don't see it yet. I think the marketplace has definitely been very volatile. I think the marketplace is starting to see
numbers that we've been seeing.
If you look at the fourth calendar quarter, the third calendar quarter, they were pretty tough quarters for companies like
Emerson. And so the market's now digesting that news as they saw come out in the earnings reporting and the
comments people are making right now. And let's say a little bit more negative about 2016. So, I would say that we've
been trying to get ahead of that, and at this point in time I feel that we've got that size.
I don't see the knock-on effect of what we saw – the volatility, both in the marketplace and then also the commodity
place in January. We'll have to watch it very carefully, unfold, but if I look at the construction – residential

construction, the residential spending, the consumer spending – in the areas that we are, they're still holding up pretty
well right now. So, we'll see. I mean, 30 days is pretty short. You've got to give us a few more days here.
<Q - Richard Kwas>: Understood.
<A - David N. Farr>: I know you're very quick compared to me, but man.
<Q - Richard Kwas>: On Process in terms of M&A, you talked about deploying some capital there for this year. With
what's happened here, incrementally more interested or less interested? How should we gauge that over the course of
2016 in terms of the opportunities you're seeing right now?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm interested. Higher interest. I mean, you can never call what time to buy, and from my
perspective right now I think that there are unique assets out there that I would like to buy. And our cash is going to –
Frank's over here working on how we're going to get cash back to the United States with the spin and the divestitures,
and we're going to talk a little bit about that next week.
So from my fundamental standpoint, I look at this as a buying opportunity. And talking to my board today, the board's
right there. What they're on me on, is to make sure we execute and we execute as hard as possible around this
repositioning, the restructuring, and then spend that money to make Emerson a better company long-term. And we've
got an opportunity here; let's figure out how to play with it. So that's what we're all about.
<Q - Richard Kwas>: Okay, thanks. By the way I thought Rossman was up for the [indiscernible] (57:38) coaching
job. I guess that didn't play out.
<A - Craig M. Rossman>: Just missed it.
<A - David N. Farr>: He just missed it. They called me on it, they called me and I said he was questionable with his
leadership capabilities. And I also felt that he would have a hard time coaching a guy about seven foot tall.
<Q - Richard Kwas>: See you next week.
<A - David N. Farr>: See you next week.

And we'll go next to Deane Dray of RBC.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Hey, just thought it was interesting how in a period of significant volatility and we've all been
questioning you about what you're seeing here, but you're also giving quarterly guidance. That's not really what –
Emerson didn't used to be in the quarterly guidance business but where is the additional confidence, where's the
additional visibility? It's certainly welcome, but it's a change.
<A - David N. Farr>: It's a change, I may go back. You know me, I've been around a few years. It's all about right
now, that we are on a detailed plan that we started executing last June. And I want to make sure you guys understand
where we are relative to that transition. And I want to make sure there's clarity around what I see sequentially
happening each quarter. And the management team has been working this very aggressively right now. We've been
discussing with the board, and I think it's very important for you all to understand what I see happening each quarter
and we see happening each quarter and that clarity.
Now once we come back to normality in the marketplace, we may go right back to it. I'm not saying I don't believe in
quarterly guidance, but we might just go right back to the old way. But right now I think we're in through this transition
period, I think it's very, very important you understand what's on our mind and where we see standings relative to this
whole repositioning each quarter. And so, we're going to actually give you clarity on things next week on our second

quarter, which you probably would never get from us.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Yeah, I certainly...
<A - David N. Farr>: I just think it's important that we stay joined in the hip here. Some of you are right there with
me, some of you don't necessarily agree with us. It's all about execution. Can we execute and I'm telling you what the
roadmap looks like, what the band looks like each quarter and I'll get through this quarter and I'll tell you the third
quarter.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Yeah. It's a great perspective and it is a change and in a period of this uncertainty to have your line
of sight on this is appreciated. And then just have a nit follow-up on Commercial & Resi. It was interesting for
professional tools you wanted to blame that also on upstream spending and I just never thought professional tools was
as tied to that but maybe I'm wrong.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, now you're talking to one of the former presidents of Ridge Tool.
<Q - Deane Dray>: I know.
<A - David N. Farr>: And the former president of Ridge Tool that went through our last recession, a really tough
recession we had down there. We have a significant part of that business that sells specialty tools and equipment to the
oil and gas producers and users, upstream and downstream. And if this whole industry stops spending. And the first
thing they do is that just dries right up around the world. And that is a big chunk of our business there, and it's
significant enough from the standpoint it's big and it's also profitable. And all I can tell you was, I thought I was going
to be fired as division presidents within my first 12 months when I came in here. And the oil and gas sent me back in
early 1990, 1991. I thought for sure I was gone. It's tough. That's what it is. It's not made up. Trust me, it's there.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Understood. We'll see you next week.
<A - David N. Farr>: Look forward to it, guys.
David N. Farr
I have to get going, I apologize. I know we had a lot of questions. I got to cut some people off. I don't have any idea
who I cut off, I didn't look at the list. There was no selective here. I want to appreciate everyone calling, and I
appreciate the questions. And I'm going to try to be open and honest as possible in this situation and give you an idea
where we're trying to go. But clearly, I'm giving the clarity that I see with my management team right now. And it's our
call, and that's the way we're going to do it here for this year to make sure we're all on the same journey together as we
come out of 2016. Thank you very much. Bye.
