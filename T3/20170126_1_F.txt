With that, Mark?
Mark Fields
Okay. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everybody. At our Investor Day in September, and again at the Deutsche Bank
conference two weeks ago, we said we were confident that we would achieve our second best full-year company
adjusted pre-tax profit, and we have.
2016 was a very strong year. In addition to our second best full-year company profit of $10.4 billion, we had a near
record operating margin of 6.7% and our second strongest cash flow of $6.4 billion. The fourth quarter was also strong
with company pre-tax profit of $2.1 billion.
So, in total, we delivered our seventh year in a row of strong results with 2016 only exceeded by our record
performance in 2015. And of course, we'll dig into the details in a minute, but first, I'd like to turn to how we're creating
value on our business.
So, turning to slide 4, we're continuing to focus on the four drives of shareholder value: growth, risk, returns and
rewards. So looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles this year, helping to strengthen our core business
including the all-new Super Duty, which further solidified our long-time U.S. leadership in a full-size pickup trucks.
We also took a step forward in the transformation of Lincoln with the launch of the Continental and strong sales growth
globally including nearly tripling our sales in China.
In terms of risk, we had strong performance in North America and combined profit for our operations outside of North
America. And thanks to our de-risking strategy, our global funded pension plans held up well, and as a result, our
global funded pension plans now are nearly fully funded, and our improved risk profile was recognized with a ratings
upgrade from each of the four major rating agencies.
Now, in terms of returns, a number of key metrics set records or near records including a record profit in Europe of
$1.2 billion and our second best profit in Asia Pacific. And our disciplined and focused approach to capital allocation
continues to pay off as we continued generating a healthy return on invested capital that's well in excess of our cost of
capital.
And then finally, in terms of rewards, shareholders benefited from our continued success and our strong cash
generation as we distributed $3.5 billion, including our first supplemental dividend that totaled $1 billion.
Now, slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the full year, and these include a couple of things. First, the
Ford brand was the best-selling brand in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row. F-Series marked its 40th year as the
top-selling truck in the U.S. and 35 years as the best-selling vehicle. Our Transit is doing extremely well as the
best-selling cargo van in the world and helping us to be the best-selling commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the
second consecutive year.
And when it comes to our emerging opportunities, we've expanded Chariot to two cities, San Francisco and Austin,
Texas and we have plans to expand to eight cities by the end of this year, including one outside the United States. We
had the most U.S. patents of any auto maker during 2016 and I think this is a very good indicator in terms of how we're
amping up our innovation efforts inside the company. And we made progress towards our intent to have a high volume,
fully autonomous Level 4 vehicle in ride-sharing or ride-hailing services starting in 2021 with this month's introduction
of our next-generation Fusion Hybrid autonomous development vehicle.
So now, let me turn it over to Bob and he'll take us through the details of our business performance.

Okay. Thanks, Mark. And let's start on slide 7 with the key financial summary, and I'll just go down our fourth quarter
and full year and cover some of the key metrics. So, let's start in the first column with the top line wholesales and
revenue. You can see that we were down just a bit, it was 4% in both wholesales and revenue, and that was more than
explained by unfavorable stock adjustments in North America.
Go down further, you can see our company adjusted pre-tax results in the quarter. It came in at $2.1 billion, which was
down $478 million. And you can see above that that each of the segments that we report, Automotive, Financial
Services and all other, which is primarily our treasury operations, or net interest expense, so you can see that they were
all down.
Going further down, let's look at special items on a pre-tax basis, $3.2 billion and that was driven primarily by the
announcement that we made on January 20 of losses associated with the remeasurement of our global pension and
OPEB plans, and that was driven by lower discount rate, and just to remind you, that's non-cash.
And we also picked up a charge of $200 million associated with our decision to cancel our new plant in Mexico that
was primarily for costs associated with returning the site to its natural state and also compensating the state government
for costs that are incurred in terms of putting infrastructure into the site. We also picked up a little bit of charges
associated with the announcement that we made earlier in the year, around our withdrawal from the Japanese and the
Indonesian markets.
If you go down further, you can see the net income or loss attributable to Ford in the quarter driven by the specials was
a negative $783 million. And then, further down, our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.30, which was in line
with First Call and Bloomberg. You can see the liquidity metrics, we'll go through those later but all have been very,
very strong.
Let's go down the same column, the same metrics, if you will, on a full year column. So, we'll start with wholesale and
revenue, pretty flat, just up a touch. Go down further to our company adjusted pre-tax results, Mark's $10.4 billion,
which was the second best that we've ever had. Special items on a pre-tax basis, $3.2 billion in addition to net, came in
at $3.6 billion. That's related to separation that we had earlier in the year both in North America and Europe.
On a net income basis, we came in at $4.6 billion, that was down, that was driven by the special items and adjusted
earnings per share of $1.76.
All right, now let's go through the – the balance of the presentation. The first three slides are going to be on the full
year. Those are the only slides we're going to talk to that are full year. We have in the appendix, incremental slides that
show the bridge between last year and this year's profits for the business units. We are not going to go through them but
if you have questions when we get to the Q&A session, obviously, Mark and I would be happy to answer them.
So, looking on slide 8, looking at absolutes, you can see, at its far left, the $10.4 billion. At the top, automotive which
was also the second best result at $9.4 billion, within that, you can see the very strong results in North America at $9
billion. South America a loss. Europe a record result of $1.2 billion. We ended up at negative $300 million for Middle
East and Africa. And the second best result that we've seen in Asia Pacific at $627 million. We have a solid results in
financial services driven by Ford Credit at $1.8 million. All other is primarily interest expense and share market value
adjustments to our investment portfolio.
All right. The other thing I just want to mention on this slide is that if you were to take the operations outside of North
America on a combined basis, we generated a profit of $421 million that was nearly double what we did last year and it
was the best result on a combined basis for that part of our business in five years.
Okay, let's turn now to slide 9. We are going to drill down now from total company to automotive. This is again full
year, so the first thing you see when you step back and look at the slide is how similar it was to last year. So, it just
shows how close we were to meeting, if not achieving another record, so it was a really strong result right across the
board. When you go across – if you look at the market share, the market share came in a 10th lower and that was driven
by declines in North America and South America. The operating margin we touched on, the pre-tax results we touched
on, and we'll go into detail in the next slide in terms of the change. Let's go to slide 10.

Mark Fields
But, Bob, before you go on...
Robert L. Shanks
Okay.
Mark Fields
Let me just make a comment. It's worth noting that our – sorry, why don't you go on. It's really in the next slide I want
to talk about.
Robert L. Shanks
Yeah. You want to talk about the next slide. So, I'll turn to slide 10. And what Mark is talking about, if you look at the
slide, you can see we were done $146 million. The thing that really drove this was higher warranty costs. So, there's a
lot of ups and down. But the reason we call out warranty cost because obviously they are not something that was
expected. If you look at the callout box for contribution cost, you can see a negative $880 million. That was driven by
recalls and the largest one that we've had in many, many years really drove that. That was the door latch recall that we
had in the third quarter. It was nearly $600 million.
Another couple of other things to highlight, if you look at the callout box for volume and mix, we had a very strong
headwind during the year from stocks. That's adverse stock changes. So, we had a stock build last year, stock reduction
this year and that was basically in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. But if you go just below that, and this is
what Mark may want to talk about, we had very, very strong performance on mix which has been a deliberate strategy
of ours. It's both positive mix performance in terms of the type of products that we sell. It was also positive
performance in terms of higher series derivatives that we sell, and that was across North America, Europe and Asia
Pacific.
The last thing I would just mention, if you go to the far right, you can see some good news there, that is the non-repeat
of the ratification bonus that we paid a year ago to the UAW following the conclusion of our UAW contract.
Mark Fields
And just picking up Bob's comments around mix, I think it's really worth pointing out that the mix
performance that we achieved last year, which is really impressive compared with the prior year, and it really resulted
in a year-over-year profit improvement for the Automotive segment, just about $2.4 billion, and that's been mainly in
North America, and Europe, and Asia Pacific.
As Bob was starting to mention, this really reflects a very deliberate and successful strategy to strengthen our brands
and reach the mix of our vehicles by essentially focusing on the higher-margin segments where consumer interest is
particularly strong. And we've also achieved greater sales of higher series derivatives like Titanium, STRs and Raptor
within our individual vehicle lines. And I can assure you that this will continue to be an area of focus for us and an
opportunity for us as we go forward.

Okay. Thanks, Mark. So, now, we're going to flip to our quarterly slides. So, from this point forward, the color and
texture that I'll provide will be primarily on the fourth quarter. Again, in the Q&A, if you have questions on full year,
please go ahead and ask.
So, this is looking at absolutes for the quarter. So, you can see the $2.1 billion pre-tax result to the far left. That
reflected a $2 billion Automotive profit. Within that, a $2 billion profit coming from North America, profits in Europe
and then Asia Pacific; declines in South America, Middle East and Africa. A solid result in Financial Services and,
again, in All Other, that's primarily net interest expense.
Let's move to slide 12 and, here, we'll look at the key metrics for the Automotive segment in the quarter. So, stepping
back and looking at it, you can see that wholesales and revenue were down. That was driven primarily by unfavorable
stock adjustments again in North America. If you look at – well, it's not on the slide, but if you look at the far right, in
terms of the global SAAR, it actually came in 2% higher than a year ago, and that was driven by gains in Asia Pacific,
Europe and North America.
Looking at market share, we were down at 10th. As I mentioned earlier, that is North America, but actually that was
full year. So, this is the quarter, North America and Europe operating margin of 5.7% and then the results on the
pre-tax basis which was down.
If we go to the next slide, slide 13, we'll go through what drove that decline of $280 million. It was basically driven by
unfavorable stock changes as well as higher cost. So, if you look at the callout box on volume and mix, you can see the
$1 billion adverse change related to stock changes that was 125,000 units. Most of that was in North America and again
related to stock builds we had a year ago, a lot of that around F-Series but also products that we are going to be
launching in 2016. And this year, we've had stock depletion in the quarter, making sure that our production remains in
line with our demand. If you look to the far right, you can see again the impact of the ratification bonus.
Okay. Let's turn now to the business units. And we'll start, as always, with North America in the fourth quarter.
Looking at the far left, wholesale is down 105,000 units. 98,000 of that was the unfavorable stock change. But I
referenced earlier, the revenue down 7%, that again was driven by that volume change.
The SAAR in the region was 22.5 million units. That was up 400,000 units. That was actually driven by Mexico,
300,000 units. We did see an improvement in the U.S. that was up 100,000 to 18.4 million SAAR.
Our market share was down three-tenths of a point, that was driven by unfavorable fleet performance and that was
driven by rental. You remember we had a pull ahead of our rental sales in the first part of the year. So, this is, if you
will, the payback in terms of share effect in the fourth quarter. It was partially offset by stronger performance on a
regional basis and that was driven by F-Series.
Operating margin was a record for the quarter at 8.5%, and then the $2 billion pre-tax result to the far right. If you go
below the page, I will note the $9 billion profit in North America, very strong, it was just down a touch from the $9.3
billion last year. And the operating margin, very, very strong once again at 9.7%. If we were to exclude the door latch
recall, we would have come in at 10.3%. So, that gives you a sense of the underlying run rate of the business, very
consistent with the performance of 2015.
All right. Let's go to the next slide. And this is the explanation of the change in North America's results on a
year-over-year basis, down $73 million. You can see that that was driven primarily by stock changes and also by higher
product cost. If you look at the callout box for contribution cost, you can see material excluding commodities, that is
more than explained by higher product cost related to the products that we launched including Super Duty, and earlier
in the year, the Fusion, the Escape and also the Continental in the latter part of the year. And to the far right, of course,
it's the ratification bonus.
For 2017, in terms of guidance, we're continuing to expect that North America's operating margin and its profit is going
to be strong. But as we've said previously, it will be lower than 2016, and this was mainly due to unfavorable volume
and mix, and also to the increased investments that we're making in the areas of emerging opportunities.

Mark Fields
And I just want to make a comment on F-Series. Obviously, we get a lot of questions on F-Series, but as you all recall,
two years ago, we added strength and capability to the F-150, increasing the payload, the towing, the torque while
taking out weight with the addition of the high-strength aluminum alloy body. And this past year, we repeated that
success with the first all-new Super Duty that we've had in 18 years. And some people call these innovations are risks,
but I think with the response that we see from customers, they are clear successes in the marketplace.
And just a couple of proof points for that. Our F-Series total sales last year were over 820,000 units, and that's the first
time sales have topped 800,000 units in a decade. And if you look at the fourth quarter, our sales are up 4% with retail
up 9%. And for the full year, we gained almost one full point of market share in the segment. If you also look at the
fourth quarter, our average transaction price was up over $1,300 versus last year, and that's significantly outpacing the
segment.
And then, finally, we outsold our nearest truck competitor by 246,000 units and essentially increasing our lead by about
36% year-on-year. So, we are really pleased with the market's reception to our F-Series, and we plan to build on that
momentum going forward.
Robert L. Shanks
Okay. Let's turn South now on slide 16, and we'll look at South America. So, the first thing you would note looking at
the slide, which is just encouraging, is that all the metrics are up even though, on a pre-tax result basis, you can see
only a change of $2 million. But, nonetheless, it is the first time since the third quarter of 2013 that we've seen metrics
turning in a positive direction, which is enforcing our view that the cyclical downturn that we've seen for the last
several years is probably bottoming out, coming to an end. And our expectation for next year is that the loss will
improve as we see the economic cycle start to turn.
If you look at the quarter, the improvement in wholesales was basically around stocks. That also drove the
improvement in revenue along with some pricing. In terms of the SAAR, the SAAR was still down for the region,
200,000 units to 3.8 million units. And, within that, Brazil was down even more at 400,000. But it was the slowest
decline on a quarterly basis that we've seen throughout the year. We've seen that decline kind of improved on a
quarter-to-quarter basis as we've gone throughout the year. So, again, another sign of things starting to turn.
Within that environment, the market share was better, that was due to strong sales of Ka and Ranger, and that was in
Brazil and in all other markets other than in Argentina. And again, the full year came in at $1.1-billion decline, that was
down about a third from where we were a year earlier, and again driven by the economic environment that we're
oscillating in.
And to underscore that, if you go to the next slide on slide 17, this is the pattern that we've shared with you through
much of the past number of quarters. You can see a lot of ups and downs for a change of only $2 million. But if you
look at the second column there, you can see that while we're continuing to price and price quite aggressively, it is not
enough to offset the effect of the high local inflation and the adverse exchange, in this case both Argentina and Brazil.
And as I mentioned earlier, we do expect in 2017 the loss to improve for South America as the economic cycle begins
to turn.
All right. Let's move to a very successful story on slide 18, Europe. This is our seventh consecutive quarterly profit.
You can see that the wholesales were actually flat in the quarter. Revenue, also essentially flat. That decline is more
than explained by exchange. In terms of SAAR, it came in at 20.7 million units which was up 1.2 million units, so a
strong industry result. Within that, our share was down a touch, two-tenths of a point, and that was explained by lower
passenger car sales that was basically Mondeo, Focus and C-MAX.
But also within that, and Mark touched on it earlier, we had very strong performance for commercial vehicles. Our
share was over 14%. It was up four-tenths of a point. And not only were we the number one brand in the year, we were

the number one brand also in the fourth quarter, operating margin at 2.3% and $166 million profit. And if you go down
and look at the full year, that was a record at $1.2 billion. It was also a record margin at 4.2%.
Then let's look at the change on a year-over-year basis, again lots of ups and downs, up $35 million and it was driven
primarily by a continuous favorable cost performance. To the point that Mark made earlier around mix, if you look at
the callout box on mix, that $39 million within that is about $100 million, so good news on mix, both mix among
products as well as during the mix and options.
The last point I want to make on this slide is, as I've said throughout the year, the business has benefited from
continued improvement in the result in Russia. That was also the case in the fourth quarter.
So for 2017, we do expect Europe to remain profitable, but it will probably be lower than in 2017, and that's driven by
the effect of Brexit on the Sterling along with higher cost that we expect associated with the launch of the Fiesta and
the EcoSport along with continued investment that we plan to make in the business moving forward.
Mark Fields
And just overall in the business in Europe, as you know, we made tough choices and strategic decisions including
restructuring in Russia when others retreated, and they're paying off as you heard from record profit and operating
margin in the region.
And as Bob mentioned, it's being driven by an aggressive focus on cost with nearly $400 million in cost improvement
in 2016 alone. But we've also had an equally strong focus on our product strategy or the revenue side of it adding lot of
new vehicles and derivatives and segments with the highest growth and profit potential.
So an example of that is we saw a profit improvement over $400 million in 2016, probably more favorable mix up
progress, our products when you compared to 2015 driven by products like the Edge.
But in addition to that, more than half of our passenger car sales in 2016 were high-series vehicles, the Titaniums, the
Vignales, the ST, the RS. And this helped push series mix up more than $300 million compared with last year. So,
bottom line is, we've taken the tough actions, we've invested in the product and the brand, and we're seeing the results
in the bottom line.
Robert L. Shanks
Yeah. I didn't mention, Mark, but as we do see a cycle change, not only in South America, but in 2017 Russia also is
expected to improve and contribute to better results at least in that part of Europe in 2017 compared to 2016.
Let's move to another market that's actually been very much affected by commodities, oil, geopolitical conditions, this
is the Middle East and Africa. So basically, for the quarter, and you can see the metrics here on slide 20 as well as for
the full year which is shown below, it's essentially the same factor. It's all what I just mentioned. And when you look at
the SAAR in the quarter, it came in down 22%. It's the worst decline on a quarterly basis throughout the year that we've
seen, and it really is driven by everything that I just mentioned. Within that environment, we were able to generate
higher share both in the quarter and in the full year, and that was due to stronger sales of Ranger, Fiesta and Focus in
Africa.
But whether you're looking at the quarter or whether you're looking at the full year, basically, you're seeing the impacts
of lower industry volume and you're also seeing the effect of adverse exchange, primarily the South African rand, and
remember we've got manufacturing operations in South Africa, that's why that's an important currency for us there.
As we look at 2017, a very similar story to what I said about Russia, to what I said about Brazil. We are starting to see
the commodity cycle change, and so as a result, we do expect to see Middle East and Africa improved compared with
the results that we're showing here for the full year and that's based not only on favorable external conditions but lower
costs and higher net pricing.

All right. Let's move to Asia Pacific on slide 21. Strong story here both for the quarter and for the year. You can see
wholesales up and revenue flat. Remember, revenue does not include the China JVs. In terms of the wholesale
improvement, that's driven both by stronger industry as well as share improvement.
In terms of SAAR, 44.4 million SAAR for the quarter. That was up 5% from a year ago, and that was driven by very
strong performance in China. In terms of market share, we were up three-tenths of a point. Again, that's China. That's
very strong sales at Escort and then the Taurus, the Edge and the Lincoln, all contributing towards a favorable mix that
Mark talked about for Asia Pacific.
In terms of margin, strong but down at 8.4%. Pre-tax results strong but also lower.
If you look at the far right there, as usual, we'll just comment on the China JVs. They came in at $380 million. That's
our equity after tax. Our share of the profit there and the margin was 12.8%. So, it was down, but still double digits.
We're still getting a very good overall margin coming out of our JVs in China.
If you go down to the very bottom, you can see the strong result, the second best at $627 million. That was down. And
whether you're looking at the quarter or you're looking at the full year, it was driven by lower pricing in China on an
industry basis, as well as adverse exchange in network of renminbi.
And if you go to the next slide, on slide 22, you can see exactly what I just mentioned. You can see the impact of net
pricing and the impact on exchange. Cost about flat and some favorable volume and mix, including – well, actually, in
the quarter, we didn't actually have favorable mix on a year-over-year basis. We had launched last year in the quarter
Edge and Taurus, and so the comps were a little bit different than the other parts of the year.
In terms of 2017, we do expect Asia Pacific's profit to improve. We don't expect that to come from China. We think the
China JV profits will be relatively flat. Margin will still be double digit but probably down a bit again because of
continued negative pricing although moderating from what we saw this year. And in favorable exchange, what we're
going to see is improved results across the rest of Asia Pacific, which we also saw in 2016, but at a pace that's even
greater.
Mark Fields
And just to add little bit of color on China, if you look at sales in 2016, it was our best sales here ever in China. We
sold about 1.27 million vehicles and that's up 14% over 2015. And importantly, this was driven not only by Lincoln,
which is – as Bob pointed that earlier, but also are now five vehicle SUV line up. It really has been a key driver for
sales growth including Edge and Explorer. But also at the same time via performance vehicles, we've introduce
Mustang, Focus RS, Focus ST. And as Bob mentioned, we have strong sales of the Taurus in China after we launched
it.
So, I think our efforts, and we've talked to you about this in the past, to fill out our product line up over the past few
years has really started to payoff in terms of growth in what is the world's largest vehicle market.
Robert L. Shanks
And we have talked a lot about focusing on the rest of Asia Pacific and so that improved results that we saw in 2016
and the quarter, and then what we're expecting in 2017 is really encouraging as well, a better balance of profitability
across the region.
Let's turn to Ford Credit right now. I've got three slides here as usual. So, if you look at the far left, it grew. You can see
that in the first two sets of data, our pre-tax results were down in Australia. What was behind that was down both for
the quarter and for the full year coming in, still strong at $1.9 billion for the full year. And in terms of U.S. retail and
lease metrics, the portfolio performance continues to be robust. All of our origination and service and collection
practices continue to be consistent.

So, we are seeing delinquency start to increase – or they've been increasing and approaching historical levels, but not
there. And the same is true for loss receivables. Although there, we are starting to get closer to the historical
performance of the past.
Let's go to the next slide and look at year-over-year. There are two things to comment here. We're down $158 million.
So, if you first go to the far right, we had a pension settlement that occurred between Ford Credit and Ford of Europe.
There is actually a positive offset to this to the dollar and the European results, and this is basically just simply, we
have a Ford plan. In the past, we've had – we've kind of split, if you will, the expense and all the results of that plan
between Ford Credit and Europe, we've done that in other regions as well.
But what we've done is we've chosen to have Ford Credit settled its share of the deficit at this point in time. It will
continue to report ongoing service cost, but we're going to put all of the balance now of – the risks and rewards on the
portfolio to Automotive. We'll manage it going forward. And we've already done that in other parts of the business over
the last number of years.
And then, if you look at the middle factor, around lease residuals, you can see there are the same thing that we've seen
all quarters of this year, the impact of lower auction value on the business.
And if you go to the next slide, slide 25, at the upper left, let's focus on the 36-month line, which is the one that's
below. You can see that we had pretty stable performance, actually up from the fourth quarter and the first, second and
third quarters. We had a 6% decline, about $1,060 in the fourth quarter. That was largely in September and October.
Knock on wood, in November, December, and so far, we've actually seen a much more stable performance in auction
values, although we are projecting auction values to be down in 2017, and that's contained in our guidance. But it was
encouraging to see it start to stabilize at least over that period of time.
And then, on the upper right, I just want to highlight, you can see that the industry continued to perform or to lease at a
pretty healthy rate, if you will. We actually have had a strategy to take down our lease penetration as Ford Credit. This
is in response to higher incentives, which is making leasing very expensive as well as lower auction values or
recognition of all the units coming back to market.
So, you can see that we're starting to separate a bit from the overall industry. And, in fact, on a full year basis, which
you don't see here, we leased at 22% which is actually unchanged from 2015. The industry was at 30%. That was
actually up 2 points from 2015.
And if you look at the metrics at the bottom, you can see pretty consistent from where we've been in the past, whether
it's resale contract placement terms or FICO and Higher Risk Mix. For the full year, no change to our guidance. We
expect Ford Credit's results to be lower, probably about $1.5 billion. And, again, it's around our expectation for lower
residual values.
If you go to the next slide, this is cash flow. So, in terms of our cash flow performance, very strong. You can see
operating came in at $1.5 billion in the quarter, $6.4 billion for the full year. That was driven by Automotive segment
pre-tax results. I just want to highlight our capital spending came in at $6.9 billion in the year. That compares with $7.1
billion last year. We're guiding to $7 billion in 2017. So, pretty flat over that three-year period.
If you go down further and look at changes in debt, you can see it's positive. That's the $2.8 billion debt issuance that
we had early in December of last year. And then, you can see pension contributions of $1.2 billion. That's consistent
with what we had guided to. We are expecting in 2017, pension contributions to be about $1 billion, and we're also
expecting about $1 billion in 2018 and 2019. That's up from the $500 million to $700 million that we've previously
guided, and that's simply a reflection of the higher discount rates. And then dividends, share repurchases $3.5 million
which includes $1 billion supplemental dividend that we announced and paid in the first quarter of 2016.
Okay. Let's go to the annual update on pensions, a few things to call out here. You can see that the underfunded status
actually didn't move much given the very sharp decline that we saw in discount rates which is just below there in the
second section of data.

The U.S. in fact hardly moved at all which really just shows the success of the de-risking strategy that we've had in
place for the last six, seven years. We saw a bigger movement in the non-U.S. plans, and if you look below there, you
can see that's because the discount rates were actually three times lower than what the declines were in the U.S.
We had very strong asset performance. We talked about pension plan contributions. We had positive pension plan
expense in 2016. We expect to have positive expense in 2017, and then of course, the remeasurement losses that were
announced on the 20th.
And let's go to my last slide on slide 28. So, here is the balance sheet summary. So, in sum, cash liquidity balance is
very strong. Ford Credit's balance sheet, very strong with good liquidity and we've talked about the pensions.
The only thing I want to comment on incrementally here is around the cash balance at $27.5 billion, obviously above
our target of $20 billion. And just to share with you how we're thinking about that, $2.8 billion of that obviously is the
debt that we took on in December.
And to remind you, we took on that debt because we believe it was opportunistic to do so. The market was very
favorable. We know that interest rates are going to be going up. So, it was a great time to go in and get that debt.
Our balance sheet was so strong that we're able to take it on and still not affect our leverage metrics that we're working
towards. And, again, as we look ahead at what we want to do in terms of transforming the business, our core, as well as
the emerging opportunities where we want to grow that, we wanted to take advantage of favorable market conditions
and make sure that we have that cash available for those uses. We will be very, very prudent, disciplined in terms of
how we use that. But we thought it was great to take advantage of the market and get that cash when it was available.
The other thing that, I guess, I would mention to you is while there's a lot of enthusiasm and we're all very optimistic
about what may come out of the new administration in terms of growth policies, there's also more uncertainty, there's
more volatility potentially around that. And, also, we're probably closer towards the end of the cycle whenever that
might be than we are to the beginning. So, we're not uncomfortable with having a little bit of extra cash at this point in
time.
So, with that, let me turn it back to Mark, and he'll take us through the balance of the presentation.
Mark Fields
Okay. Thanks, Bob. So, slide 29 shows our view of GDP growth rates and industry volumes. And all in all, we expect
growth in GDP globally in all the major markets that are shown on the slide there. Similarly, we expect growth in the
industry volume and in the volume for all major markets, except the U.S. which is going to remain strong.
If you move to slide 30, that just shows that we delivered strong results in 2016, again, in line with our expectations.
And then, looking ahead, 2017 is going to be a good year for Ford. We expect our key financial metrics for the
company, as I said, in 2017 to be good, yet lower or about the same as 2016. At a company level, this is driven mainly
by investments that we're making in the areas of emerging opportunities. And it's the same guidance that we reiterated
at the Deutsche Bank conference two weeks ago.
Now, turning to our business units on slide 32, give you a little flavor for kind of what's going on in the business units.
We do expect profits in North America and Europe to be lower than last year while we expect to see improvements in
results in South America, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. And for reasons that were already mentioned by
Bob, results in Ford Credit and All Other will be lower than 2016.
In addition, you can see in the slide the various kind of puts and takes for each region, so you get an understanding of
kind of what's going on one level down in each region in term of the factors driving the business.
So, let me just wrap this all up before we go to the Q&A. We delivered a very strong 2016. In fact, as we mentioned,
our second best adjusted full year pre-tax profit. We also delivered a full year operating margin in North America of
9.7%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 10% target range, which we've talked about in the past.

We set a number of records for the year, including a record adjusted pre-tax profit in Europe and record sales in China.
And we expect to deliver another good year this year, again, in line with the expectations that we set initially at our
Investor Day last September.
So, we're making substantial progress on expanding our business, and that's really going from a strong, healthy
automotive company to one that will be even stronger and bigger as we expand to an auto and a mobility company in
the future, which brings me to slide 34.
And, importantly, we now have a very clear vision and strategy for our business going forward. And our plan is simple.
We want to achieve top quartile returns by expanding our scope from vehicles to mobility through business model
innovation. I can tell you, we're more focused than ever before on fortifying our strengths, by transforming the
underperforming parts of our business and investing in the emerging opportunities that will provide even more
profitable growth in the future for us.
And as usual, we'll look forward to sharing with you our progress as we go through the year. So, with that, why don't
we open it up and start taking your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, we will take calls from the investment community first, followed by questions
from news media. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of
John Murphy with Bank of America.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Mark Fields>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just a first question on one of the big swing factors in 2016 being the $1 billion to your stock
adjustment. Obviously, that's a real thing. It's not one time. But it does indicate maybe you earn a little bit more in 2015
than you would have otherwise and that you took that hit in 2016.
So, the trajectory of earnings between 2015 and 2016 actually should be a bit better than what you're kind a showing
here. And as we look forward to 2017, your start position, your inventories are relatively mean, I think very disciplined
and good but it does seem like there's a potential for you to, particularly as we get through the second half of the year,
to maybe build a little of the inventory of the industry comes through. I'm just curious how you're thinking about this
and if that logic makes sense to you?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, I think you're right in the first part but that was driven by the launch of schedule and
cadence that we had, so as you remember, going back to 2015, we were coming out of Dearborn in Kansas City for
F-150, so we were really building stock. We also then had that pull ahead of rental into the early 2016 periods, so again
we had to build stock for that. We then through this year, in the second half of the year, we're taking the adjustments on
that through the year, we've been taking the adjustments.
And so, you're right but it was driven by large cadence and rental timing or cadence as opposed to anything else. When
we move into 2017, John, I think you're right. When you look at every single region, the way we look at it, our stock
levels are in very, very good shape, and then, North America, particularly, where there have been a lot of concern
expressed by a number of people throughout the year, we kept telling you that it was driven by the cadence of launches
last year, this year and what was going on with rental and that we would be in good shape by the end of the year. We're
actually in very good shape. So, we delivered on that. Every other region looks fine.
As we look ahead to next year or this year rather in 2017, I think we're just kind of hold that level. I don't see any big
plus or minus on this particular factor in terms of impact on the company. It might be a little bit different by business

unit, but likely not because I think everyone is in pretty good shape.
I will highlight that we will have the launch of Expedition Navigator in the third quarter, so that will have an impact.
It's not as high volume, obviously, it's some of the other launches we've had on that type of platform in the past, but it is
a very high margin vehicle. So, it will have some effect. It's probably more in mix than anything else.
<A - Mark Fields>: The only thing I'll add, John, all these things are linked, right? As you mentioned, in any given
year, we're going to have launches and things of that nature. But when you look as Bob said, we're going to continue
our strategy of matching productions and demand, but if you look at our incentives in the fourth quarter, the industry in
the U.S. was up 16%, we were 11%. That really follows our strategy of being competitive with discipline and that
allowed us to have average transaction prices in the quarter that we're up over 4% and better than the industry.
So, we're really trying to manage and maximize profitability. Listen, if there's opportunity and there's more business out
there, we'll build more. If we're short in any given month, we'll take adjustments. We want to keep those stocks really
in shape and be able to react appropriately.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second question. I mean, I know there's a lot of puts and
takes, and things that are going on that you're discussing with Trump as far as new policies here. But just specifically
around the potential for expensing CapEx and R&D, obviously, in 2017 and 2018, you guys are talking about $2 billion
to $3 billion of incremental expenses for EVs and Smart Mobility. And if we see expensing across like that, could that
give you sort of a higher deductibility, which means that you might increase your deferred tax asset and not pay taxes
for a longer period? I'm just trying to understand, if we look at that $2 billion to $3 billion, how much would have got
expensed otherwise previously and would there be more that could get expensed now that would give you a big benefit
going forward?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, the only thing I would say on the – I'll call the blueprint tax proposal, that's the only
thing that's really on the table at the moment. There's a lot of different factors there. So, a lot of people focus on the
border adjustable tax, focusing on the expensing of CapEx. I mean, there's all sorts of ins and outs, and ups and downs.
It's just a completely different tax code.
We've been modeling that, which is what I mentioned at the Deutsche Bank conference. It looks attractive to us and
favorable, but it also depends on the detail. And we don't know that yet, John. I will say that we are booking taxes at a
healthy rate. We came in at, so I said, 32% for – 31.9% for the quarter. I think it was about 30% for the year, if I
remember correctly.
So, we're booking at a healthy rate given the tax code we have, but our cash taxes are quite low and they're expected to
remain low over the next number of years. And the modeling we've done, again, it depends on what the details are, but
it doesn't suggest that that's going to change to any degree, whatsoever.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay, and then just one last quick housekeeping one on the accounting for leases. I mean,
obviously, you guys are accelerating depreciation where you need to on auction values that might be lower. Just curious
if you think about what we see in the P&L versus the timing of the cash impact to those when those vehicles come back
for you and the industry. I mean, is there a cash impact at the end of lease that we might see that's being reflected in the
P&L right now on an accrual basis?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: No. I don't think there is anything material to mention in that regard, no. Everyone here is
shaking their heads, so I think I'm right.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Mark Fields>: Thanks, John.

Page 13 of 23
<Q - David Tamberrino>: The first question is really for you, Mark. You've had a couple of breakfast this week with
President Trump and really wanted to get a sense of your thoughts coming out of there on the policies, how we're
shaping the potential changes in the tax code, we've got the house plan that's out there. You clearly mentioned the
prospects of an import tariff. Most clients that I speak to are either in one camp or the other that there's a 100%
probability of a border tax adjustment. And if that doesn't happen, then we're just going to see import tariff. So, really
curious as to – since you spent the most time with the new President this week, I believe. What's your thinking coming
out of both of those meetings and what you've been hearing?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, I think, first off, it's a very positive sign from my perspective that literally his first two days
in the office is – he had first morning meetings with manufacturing companies including automotive companies. And I
think he's going to be very focused on driving policies that drive investment and job creation in American
manufacturing and in automotive manufacturing. And so, I think that's going to be a big priority. I think obviously, as
Bob was mentioning earlier, a tax reform is going to be a big priority.
And I know obviously, whether it's a border tax or border adjustment, as Bob mentioned, this is a multifaceted
blueprint that's out there. And as Bob said, we've got to look at the statutory tax rates, we've got to look at the territorial
tax system that they're talking about the expense in media expensing of CapEx and then whatever currency impacts are
there.
Our approach, as a company, is just going to state very close to it and also provide input. So, I think tax reform is going
to be high on the list. We did talk about – he asked very clearly. What are the things that are inhibitors in terms of
growing jobs and your business? We talked about regulations and particularly, we talked about rulemaking, the
finalized rulemaking that was pushed through at the end of the year on the fuel economy, one national standard which
really was a decision that we felt was premature and inconsistent with the promise data-driven approach.
And we think it's really important to get a balanced outcome, balance between making sure that we reconcile interest in
reducing carbon into the atmosphere which we're all for but also good jobs and also affordability for customers. So, we
may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business. But my impression walking away, is this is a
president who's going to be focused on a number of important priorities and make sure that he makes progress on those.
And we want to be helpful in the process in terms of whether it's trade or tax or regulatory reform, be it a trusted source
for input.
<Q - David Tamberrino>: Understood. It's very helpful. Maybe following up underneath to that, in the event that we
don't see a border tax, when we do see a potential import tariff and you start thinking about your supply chain, in
particular, versus other of your competitor supply chains, it looks like the cost of being able to produce the vehicle,
specifically within the U.S. would have to go up with the amount of local content and some of the imports come in.
In that environment, do you see passing on price increases to consumers? Do you see pushing that through the supply
chain or you see that more impacting your margin? Just trying to get a feel for how you would manage the business for
any potential change or rising cost environment as a result of a very targeted or potentially targeted import tariff.
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, as Bob mentioned earlier, first off, we have to see what the policies are going to be, and as
you mentioned, we're doing a lot of different scenario planning. The blueprint – every company is going to be like a
snowflake. They're all going to be different, right, in terms of what their net imports or exports are, their supply chain.
And we're going to just continue to advocate for comprehensive tax reform.
And as Bob mentioned, the border adjustment piece of this is very intriguing for us. And the reason for that is we are
the largest producer of vehicles here in the U.S. We're a top exporter. Obviously, we're doing the analysis on our supply
chain, because that's going to play into it. And we'll see how it comes out. It's going to be a, I think, a pretty – getting
back to your question earlier, I think the president is going to look for an accelerated rate of getting some level of tax
reform in this year, and we want to be part of the process in terms of giving them the input on that.
<Q - David Tamberrino>: Thank you. The one last one for me is just in North America. So, I think about one of your
competitors is going through a bit of a changeover throughout this year. Is there a potential possibility for you to see

better market share gains as a result of that or is that an opportunity for you to be more price-disciplined as some of the
competition volume might be pulling back and they might not be as aggressive on their incentives?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: I just keep coming back to our strategy. We run this business to optimize profitability for our
shareholders. So, we're going to continue our strategy of keeping our inventories in line. We're going to be very
disciplined on pricing and continue our approach on making sure that our transaction prices are healthy. We're not
going to chase bad share. That's not what we do.

Your next question comes from the line George Galliers with Evercore ISI.
<Q - George Galliers>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. My first question was just on raw materials. Clearly, we've
seen a move in the spot price for a lot of commodities versus a full year average for 2016. What kind of assumptions do
you have for raw material headwinds this year?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. So, that's a really good question, George. What we saw in 2016 is an advantage in
improvement, if you will, from commodities of about $900 million. Our planning for 2017 and our guidance for 2017
basically assumes that almost all reverses.
<Q - George Galliers>: Okay, great. And then, secondly, just with respect to China, and this isn't necessarily
Ford-specific, we're also seeing it at some of your peers. I mean volumes are growing both kind of when we look at Q4
and on a full year basis, but when we look at profitability, clearly, we're not in similar progress. Do you think that – I
mean, what's got to change, I guess, for absolute earnings from Chinese JVs to step up going forward? Is it more stable
pricing environment, is it continued work on the cost front from yourselves or is it just – it's a sum-up effect?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, let's just talk about the JVs first because I just wanted to remind everybody that JVs
are not the total China picture for us because we've got imports of Lincoln, we've got imports of Ford. We also incur
engineering here at Ford for products that will be built years ahead in the JVs. We get compensated on that through
royalties, so there's a little bit of a disconnect there, particularly as we're in growth mode.
But just on the JVs, if you look at the JVs this year, performance was good. We actually had good cost performance in
the joint ventures. You've got two things that are happening to the JVs. One is this continued negative trend that we've
seen of negative pricing across the industry. And as I said, it did moderate in 2016 versus 2015. And our assumptions
for 2017 is that it further moderates, although it will still be negative.
And then, the second impact is on exchange. Now, the exchange sheet clearly affected our imports – Ford imports of
Lincoln imports. But while we have very high local content in the joint ventures, they still import. And so, that also had
a negative impact.
It's really those two things that affected the overall business in China, but also specifically, the joint ventures are going
forward. One of the things that has been helping us has been the mix. And that's been sort of a part of our recipe for
success in North America. It has been in Europe. And I think that's probably further opportunity for us in China moving
ahead into the future.
<A - Mark Fields>: To put that in perspective, as you look at 2016, 40% of our sales in China came from more
profitable segments, the large cars, SUVs, performance vehicles and premium. And that was up about a little less than
1.5 points versus a year ago, so the team is really focusing on that.
And then, to your point earlier on the industry, as you know, we've guided the industry to be higher next year in China,
but we do expect the end of the tax incentives or the reduction of the tax incentives that happened at the end of last

year, that's going to be a drag on industry sales and volumes probably through the first quarter.
We've reflected that in our assumptions, and we anticipate that the impact from the pull ahead is going to ease from the
second quarter going forward and it supports our outlook of about a little over 27 million units. But we are seeing in
January a payback, and the industry is seeing a payback. So, we'll have to get through, Chinese New Year is early this
year, so let's get through January and February. And then, I think we'll have a better idea of the run rate as we get into

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Everybody.
<A - Mark Fields>: Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod Lache>: I wanted to just add two things. One is, again, on border adjustments. We came up with an estimate
that, just for the overall industry, not Ford specifically, this is something that could potentially increase the cost of a
vehicle sold in the U.S. by $2,300. And, at the same time, it looked to us like the effect would be really small for Ford.
And I'm wondering if you've done a similar competitive analysis? Should we be watching this as one of the more
potentially significant changes to the competitive landscape?
And post your meetings, if you have any thoughts on timing of implementation, whether there could be a phase-in? In
other words, is this something that we should be thinking about as maybe a factor or even in the intermediate term, like
2018, 2019?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, let me comment, first, Rod, and then Mark can add comments that he might have. So,
we have been modeling, and as I said, the one thing – so your assumption in terms of how we stand versus competition
is how we see it. We are in a pretty good place in terms of import/export position as we look at vehicles, as we look at
our parts. So, we see that as being something that's attractive. Now, when you combine it with some of the other
aspects of the blueprint like the lower tax rate and some of the other aspects, plus an assumption that we've made
through discussions with the staffs that are working on this, that some of the things are important to us like tax
attributes will continue into the future. That's what gives us at least, for now, a positive point of view on that particular
proposal.
When we look at our competition, we can't see, if you will, the data around parts. We just can't find a source for that
anywhere, but we clearly can understand imports and exports of vehicles. And when we look at that, again, you're right,
relative to our peers, that we're in very good shape, versus some of them extremely good shape.
So, it could have an adverse impact in terms of them, if what we see now as a proposal passes through. And for us, it
looks pretty attractive, and actually not having too much impact at all over the next several years in terms of our cash
taxes.
<A - Mark Fields>: And just to Bob's point on when you look at our profile, you know the facts, Rod. We're the
number one manufacturer in the U.S. and also Ford's not one of the top manufacturers in Mexico, so that adds to our
profile. When you look at some of the nuances on how this will be laid out, whether there'll be phase-ins or things of
that nature, I think that's work in front of the administration and Congress going forward. There'll be lots of discussion.
There'll be a lot of sausage-making around this to see ultimately what happens.
My view is, as I go back earlier, I think they're going to want to make significant progress this year and get something
passed through congress this year. And I think Paul Ryan last night laid out getting something done by August. Now,

whether they'll be able to do that, I don't know but clearly that's their intent.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Great, thank you. And just secondly, obviously the market expectations vis-à-vis U.S. growth,
inflation and monetary policy have changed a lot here in the past couple of months. But you're guidance didn't really
change since the Investor Day. I was hoping you might be able to just give us some color on how this could affect
North America and also the credit business, whether you see some implications or rates that could be more significant
in terms of retail rates for example. And then in credit, how should we be thinking about the financing margin and
broadly just as the markets transitioning from looser monetary to tighter monetary policy?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Let me take a shot at it first and then again if there's some broader perspective that Mark can
share. So, I think what we've seen so far is the market is excited and interested, intrigued and optimistic about what
might happen. But we don't have any policies yet. So, we don't know. So, we are hopeful. We're also optimistic and
encouraged about what might be but nothing really has changed yet other than maybe sentiment. I think that's – it's fair
to say sentiment has changed. So, until we see something more definitive, we're not changing our point of view in
terms of what our operating assumptions are. And, in fact, I think so far this month in January, I think the rate of sales
that we've seen for the industry suggests that there's nothing would tell us that anything is any different than what we've
been assuming.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Right...
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: And we have built in increasing interest rates both for this year and going forward. So, we're
kind of already assuming what you've talked about. The question is, if we do get very positive pro-growth strategies
that are much more inflationary than what has been assumed then, obviously, there's an impact there and it would affect
many parts of the business, both pro and con, and something that we would manage and deal with as we always do. But
there's nothing specific to respond to yet, Rod.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Right. Well, the market rates, Bob, like five-year swaps are up like 75 basis points since November.
So, the market is starting to reflect a different paradigm and I would imagine that that's very meaningful, just broadly,
on a number of different fronts. So, that's more or less what I was asking about.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, so far, what we've seen has been consistent with what our planning assumptions had
been. We did build in increasing interest rates, so I think we've gone to markets a couple of times and everything is
consistent with what we had expected in terms of – actually, we're seeing good spreads. And I think the rates have been
consistent with what we had planned. So, I understand your point, but it hasn't materialized yet into anything physical
that would be different than our planning assumptions.
<Q - Rod Lache>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

<A - Mark Fields>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: A couple of questions, housekeeping and then a more strategic one, again, related here, is it
– to the White House. Housekeeping, anything you could comment around quarterly cadence, particularly in North
America, particularly getting through some of the destock?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, as I mentioned earlier, I think the destock is behind us. On a company basis, usually
it's 60-40 in terms of profits first half, second half. I would expect something like that this year. I always hesitate to get
into specific quarters because I'm inevitably wrong. But last year was very unusual. The year before was very unusual.

The flip side of that, because of the launches, I would say, I think the third quarter in North America will be the
weakest, and that's going to be driven by the impact of the launch of the Expedition Navigator. But other than that, I
would call it a more normal year in terms of cadence.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Okay. When I said destock, I meant overstock, if you will, in 1Q of last year. On a strategic
question, in addition to what the NHTSA and EPA control directly around fuel economy and environmental regulations
of EPA. EPA has historically, or at least in the eight years, granted California a waiver to pursue its own greenhouse
gas policy. Was there any discussion at the White House around the theme of harmonization of fuel economy and
environmental regulation and sort of the debate, it may be too philosophical around is the states' rights versus
federalism in terms of getting to a harmonized system once again?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, we didn't get any sort of discussion around states' rights versus federalism in the meeting.
But what we did talk about, and I get back to earlier where we said we weren't advocating for elimination of the
standards, I made the point that one of the reasons we were very supportive of the one national standard is because it
was one national standard. You had CARB, the California Air Resources Board, together with NHTSA, together with
EPA, and we emphasized that was important going forward.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Well, what if CARB decides to continue to stick to its aggressive goals, perhaps even more
aggressive. What do you think the new administration will do through the EPA waiver process?
<A - Mark Fields>: I think you'd have to ask the administration that question.

Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark Fields>: Hi, Itay.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Hi. Just shifting maybe away from North America for a minute, on South America, just given the
flattish losses in the fourth quarter, can you just talk a little bit about what some of the drivers for improvement 2017
might be, perhaps the magnitude roughly if you can share, and then also a similar question around the non-China Asia
Pacific improvement that you're expecting for 2017?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, as you go back to slide 32, Itay, if you want to go back there, I think this slide shows
what the ups and downs are, if you will, on a year-over-year basis. So, in South America, we do expect to see positive
net pricing. We do expect to see favorable volume. Even though it doesn't look like the industries are moving much,
when you look at the industry slide, that's really do the rounding.
We still see exchange as a bit of a headwind and also cost including commodity. So, it's really around favorable volume
and mix and especially pricing. So, that's what we see happening. And it does require the external environment to sort
of move forward in a positive direction.
And then if you go back to the slide, it has our assumptions on GDP. We've got a very modest projection of 0.5% GDP
improvement which is consistent I think with the Brazilian banks we've talked to and a few others. So, I think it's in the
range of what most people are expecting. But I also, let's say, at least based on the data we've been looking at on a
month-to-month basis, it could be more of a second half recovery than a first half, at least in terms of the strength of
that driving that full year result.
Not going to get into quantification of magnitude on any of the business units, but I think it will be – we're expecting it
to be a reasonably good improvement on a year-over-year basis, but we'll still be in a loss.

And then, you asked me on Asia-Pacific, I think you're asking me around the specific, the non-China?
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Correct, yes.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. So, I got to tell you, I mean, we're so excited about that because we've been talking
about this for a long, long time. Australia was really having a tough time particularly prior to going into the
restructuring of the manufacturing. And then after we announced it, ASEAN was struggling. India, of course, the big
investments and in growth mode there. And we're so excited because we're now seeing a big turnaround in –
particularly in ASEAN and Australia. We see strong profits in those parts of the business in 2017, and that's really
what's driving the improvement. But even India, while India will be a loss, again, in 2017, we see less of a loss.
So, overall, that part of the business in Asia Pacific is really moving forward in a very positive direction and something
we've been working very, very hard at.
<A - Mark Fields>: And importantly on Australia, we actually completed the closure of the manufacturing facility last
year in the October-November timeframe. So, the team is really focused now on not only building our business but we
made announcements late last year around building our engineering capability in Australia. So, right direction in terms
of momentum.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: That's very, very helpful. Just a quick follow-up back in North America on slide 15. The positive
other driver, I think, about $250 million, was that mostly parts and accessories? And if so, kind of what's the outlook
for that business globally in 2017?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: That was part of it. You're looking at – what, slide 15, you just say?
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Yes, slide 15. The two...
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah, it was a purchased service. We also had lower legal costs with some favorable
performance from some of the subsidiaries within North America and then we – other, just a whole slew of smaller
things that added up. But, yes, that included good performance by parts and service which overall for the business in
2016 did very well across the globe.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
<Q - Ryan Brinkman>: Thanks. Some more questions to try to probe this border adjusted tax issue. I just wanted to
confirm that your comment at the Detroit show that a boarder adjusted tax could be potentially positive not just in the
relative but on an absolute basis. Does that analysis take into account not just the vehicle figure importing and
exporting but also the parts that you purchased from suppliers that might be imported?
And then as part of your answer, it'd be great too if you could remind us of your export strategy because going back to
that year of turnaround call and October of 2012, I think it was – you mentioned then your plan to ramp exports from
the U.S. and since then, now you're exporting to China too. So, maybe your exports are greater than the market
appreciates. Any color or data you could share would be helpful.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Let make take that first part and then Mark can respond on the second. So, to be specific,
yes, in an absolute sense. More outside of our business metric is we're actually modeling this out many, many years
because of – you have to do that with taxes. So, it actually can be quite favorable in absolute sense sort of all calls
beyond our five-year business planning period. Through our business planning period, it's probably more neutral and
that's both in terms of an absolute tax but, in particular, the cash tax status that I mentioned earlier. The bigger

opportunity in terms of a big change versus where we are today is more sort of post-2021 in terms of the assessment
that we've made.
<A - Mark Fields>: Yeah. In terms of, Ryan, your question on export strategy from, let's say, here from North
America, as you know, what we've talked about in the past is utilizing our manufacturing operations globally and be
better exporters, if you will, and balancing and basically using our manufacturing assets around the world. And that's
why in New York, for example, coming out of the U.S., we added the Edge, which is doing very well in the
marketplace. We're getting the new KA+ out of India.
And in terms of other exports out of the U.S., as I said, we're a top exporter and part of it is when you look at China, for
example, we're exporting Explorers, Lincoln. We talked about the growth there. Actually, we have a – when you take
into account imports of parts, we actually – we have a – from the U.S., we're actually – we're a net surplus in terms of
our trade with China with the exports that we do out of here in the U.S.
So, we're going to continue to utilize our manufacturing assets very efficiently around the globe, and this is all around
our strategy of taking advantage of our scale and making sure we're taking advantage of the assets that we have in
different parts of the world.
<Q - Ryan Brinkman>: Okay. Thanks. And then, just my last question is, really, what was better than you thought in
4Q because you did $10.4 billion of full year pre-tax versus $10.2 billion than you reiterated there at the time of 3Q.
So, versus our own expectations, it was North America automotive, I know you don't guide granularly quarterly by
region, but was it the Super Duty? Was it some of these profit improvement initiatives that you talked about on the 2Q
call? Did those track better or whatnot? And is there any way to say that maybe the stronger profits in 4Q bode well as
we entered 2017 relative to guidance or anything like that?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: So, Ryan. You're asking specifically about North America?
<Q - Ryan Brinkman>: Or just what contributed to the implied – the $200 million implied beat versus your implied
guidance for 4Q basically on pre-tax.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Cost.
<Q - Ryan Brinkman>: And do those costs continue – do you – was that like one-time period benefit or is there now a
stronger base of earnings that you carry into 2017?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, it's interesting. When we look at the year-over-year cost change for the total company,
I went back and looked a number of years, this is the lowest cost increase that we've had on a year-over-year basis since
I think going back to 2009 or something like that. So, actually we've seen – we've put a lot of control on cost. North
America was a big contributor to that and that's certainly helped us in our performance throughout the course of the
year.
As we move into 2017, we've talked about the investments that we're making and the emerging opportunities. If I kind
of put that to the side, the commodity increase that I talked about, I think everything else actually should be cost save in
2017.
And we have to work hard to do that. But it does show the focus that we put on cost and continues to. And again I
would highlight what we showed at the Deutsche Bank conference. Within all of that, we've got about $3 billion worth
of efficiencies that we're generating right across the business. That's helping us to continue the investments we're
making for growth.
<Q - Ryan Brinkman>: Very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Adam Michael Jonas>: Hi. Just a quick one here. Alphabet and Limo seem to have kind of gone around to all the
OEMs globally, and I suspect yourselves included, to try to look for a way to work with you on sharing data, creating
HD maps and kind of helping your efforts in kind of the autonomous driving revolution. I was just curious if you could
reiterate your stance on data sharing with suppliers like Waymo or Mobileye that ostensibly want to help develop a
common crowd sourced 3D map, for example, amongst other things kind of – how do you kind of view the opportunity
to do that versus do-it-yourself because you obviously have huge scale globally on miles travelled to maybe do that
yourself. How do you weight that, and again, of course, versus the value of the data and the sanctity of the data?
<A - Mark Fields>: Yeah. Thanks, Adam. And the key is that last part of your statement. We have to look at what the
value of the data is. But certainly, there's a different, there's a broad spectrum here and very simply put, we continue to
be opened to work with partners where we could crowdsource data that, let's say, helps the system as opposed to just an
individual manufacturers. So, we're going to continue to go to that process and really understand the value of the data,
and when the value of the data as it points very clearly in working with others, we'll do so.
And it all comes down, as you look at that value of the data, I keep going back to what I mentioned a long time ago, we
don't want to be relegated to a contract manufacturer status and that's always a top of our mind.
<Q - Adam Michael Jonas>: Okay, because there seem to be different views there. I mean, Toyota for example seems
to kind of have this, we're big enough and we can do it ourselves in its early days and we don't want to make a decision
on sharing too early and regret it later. Perhaps for Chrysler maybe in the opposite side of the spectrum of we'll cross
the line early and work early. I reckon maybe you're somewhere in between. I'm just curious in terms of timing. Do you
think that this year would be too soon for you to make a decision or is it – is there even one avenue to go and there may
not – there's no such thing as exclusivity, whether you do it yourself or with a partner. I'm just curious...
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, yeah. I can't answer your question in terms of the timing of it, but clearly, you know what
our objectives are, is to have a Level 4 vehicle out in the marketplace in 2021. So clearly, we have a lot of work to do
in front of us, but also at the same time, we made a lot of progress. And as we said, we'll go through that process. So,
what's the data that we feel – crowdsource is fine, it doesn't have a lot of value, but has a lot of value to the system
versus what's the ones that will have value to us as we look at new business models to grow our business.

Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.
<Q - Colin Michael Langan>: Thanks for taking my question. It's just a follow-up on the border tax question – border
adjustment questions. One of the key elements there is the impact of all these costs and what it might do to actual
industry volume. So, any color on the price sensitivity that you would see if we see all these border tax pushing costs
up, how much auto sales may fall?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: No, I don't think we have a handle on that. That was a part of Rod's concern or question as
well. There's another aspect to that we're going to have to look at, which is what impact does this have on exchange
rates. That's something else that's been mentioned on the strength of the dollar.
So, I think it's really kind of interesting but also very complex about this whole thing. It's so radically different that it
goes way beyond just what's the tax effect. It could grow the economy, so that's a positive. It could strengthen the
dollar, that's got positives and negatives. The point that you mentioned around pricing and affordability, that one also
could be interesting because, again, based on a relative position that individual companies can have, there's probably an
industry effect that could be quite different by individual companies.

that we're aware of and we will be looking at as we get more specifics around the proposal itself as it works its way
through Congress.
<Q - Colin Michael Langan>: And Trump has talked about a focus on job, I think, you even mentioned – I think
you've tweeted about it and having a plant opened in the U.S. What would actually – would you consider particularly at
this point in the cycle actually putting a whole new physical brick-and-mortar plant in the U.S. and what was the
criteria for you to go forward and do something like that and what is the objective there is?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, getting to the first part of your question. Obviously, we canceled the plant down in Mexico
because the bottom line is we saw what's happening with the segment. We didn't need the capacity anymore and it
didn't make any sense to add it particularly now also where we are in the cycle.
And going forward, the criteria for – if we'd ever build any capacity anywhere is the growth of our business. And we're
comfortable with where we are right now, but we have made announcements. We're expanding our Flat Rock facility to
build a new autonomous vehicle and a new battery electric vehicle SUV that's coming down the pipe.
As you know, Colin, the thing – we look at a lot of different factors both the capacity and where we put it, everything
from logistics to labor costs to business environment to tax treatment, et cetera. And we'll continue to look at those
things going forward. But nothing on the plate right now in terms of brand new facility somewhere, but we are
expanding some.
<Q - Colin Michael Langan>: And one question I get a lot from investors is you're guiding earnings down but a lot of
your peers particularly tracked U.S. peers are guiding earning up. I imagine a big chunk of the investment in EV and
mobility. I mean, do you think you have some catching up to do at that way? Is there a big outlier there or is there
another reason that you're a bit more cautious than your tracked competitors? Any thoughts on that? I'd love to get your
perspective since some investors continuously ask.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, I'll give you mine first. I mean, first of all, we've been running at a very strong rate for
seven years. Some are catching up to the level of performance that we've been at. But when we look at going into 2017,
again, I can't talk to others and what's happening in their business, launches or anything else, but we're going to
continue to operate in terms of the core Automotive business at a very, very strong level. It will change in terms of the
construct of various factors and probably among the business units because things are different year-by-year. But we
think, overall, the bottom line results for core Automotive will continue to run at a strong rate.
Credit will come down for the reasons that we've talked about, the higher net interest expense. But, really, the
difference is around the investments and the emerging opportunities. And we think that those are – it's sort of like we're
plowing a field, we're planting a seed, and we know that we're going to harvest the results, probably more towards the
next decade, but this is going to transform the business. And so, it's something that we're really looking forward to
doing, and it's the right thing to do for the business.
So, we'll have to see where we all end up when the year is out, but we believe that the color we're making for the
business is the right one for us and it's still going to generate a strong result. And, as you know, from what we set
around the distributions, we're still going to provide shareholders with strong distributions in the year, $2.8 billion.
<Q - Colin Michael Langan>: And what about the notion that you're catching up to your peers, do you disagree with
that, particularly on EVs or do you think maybe you are having to catch up a little bit on a relative basis?
<A - Mark Fields>: Well, Colin, I absolutely disagree with that in terms of you look at electrification. I mean, we've
sold over $0.5 million electrified vehicles since 2004 and when you look at the breadth of ATVs, PHEVs and also
battery electric vehicle that we have, it's one of the broadest. And we've made a commitment now, as you know, to
expand that even further, that $4.5 billion and the 13 products, and we've talked about a number of them.
So, we strongly believe that we have led in this area from a development of the market standpoint. We're working now,
as was mentioned earlier, on infrastructure in various parts of the world for EVs. So, we're going to continue keep
plowing ahead on this. I don't know, I don't believe that we are behind.

We will now take questions from the media. We have a question from the line of Patti Waldmeir with Financial Times.
<Q - Patti Waldmeir>: Yes. This is Patti Waldmeir. One question please for Mr. Fields. You were obviously one of
the first to stress the positive side of a Trump presidency for corporate America. But could you say something about
how it feels never to know when you're going to have to deal with, at the very least, a significant market fallout from a
Presidential tweet? What word you use to describe your mood in this new normal?
And a question for Mr. Shanks, you said that there was a $200-million charge related to the Mexico cancelation. But
I've also seen a $500 million figure of savings for consolidating small car production related to the cancellation of that
factory, and I'm not sure where that figure comes from. Could you say something about that?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Why don't I do that first.
<Q - Patti Waldmeir>: Okay.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: And then, Mark can respond on how he feels. One is much more straight forward. So yeah,
the $200 million is a charge that we're taking in the fourth quarter because we made a decision towards the latter part of
the year. So, we'll book that in the fourth quarter.
In terms of the $500 million, that was the net save, if you will, in terms of capital spending, and we talked about that at
the time that we announced the cancellation. So, we will save $500 million in capital related to the cancellation of this
factory.
<A - Mark Fields>: Great. Getting back – how do I feel? I feel good. And the reason I feel good, Patti, is because you
talked about – you're basically talking about the external environment and how are you ready for things. And it's been
the way that we've been running this business for years now. We're always looking at the external environment literally
every day. We're doing the right things for the business. We're being proactive. We act decisively.
So, whether it's a tweet from somebody or a market disruption in another or a natural disaster in some part of the world,
we're going to be ready because we are just watching that external environment every day and it keeps us riveted on the
business.
<Q - Patti Waldmeir>: Thanks.
<A - Mark Fields>: Thank you, Patti.
