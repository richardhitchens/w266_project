you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on
the quarter.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures
regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2013.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Phil. I'll begin with comments on our fourth quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 25% to $6.84 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased to $1.95 billion. In the supplemental
financial information and business metrics portion of our earnings release we include a few additional free cash flow
measures. We believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment
with capital and finance leases.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.89 billion. Capital expenditures does not include the impact of property
and equipment acquired under capital and finance lease obligations. Return on invested capital is 9%, down from 13%.
ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by the average total assets minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion
of long-term debt over five quarter ends.
A combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 483 million shares compared with 476
million one year ago.
I'll turn the call over to Brian for additional financial highlights.
Brian T. Olsavsky
Thanks, Tom. Worldwide revenue increased 15% to $29.33 billion, or 18% excluding the $895 million unfavorable
impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange. Media revenue decreased to $6.95 billion, down 4%.
Excluding FX, media revenue was flat year-over-year. EGM revenue increased to $20.64 billion, up 21%, or 24%
excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 70% of worldwide sales, up from 67%. Worldwide paid unit growth was
20%. Worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 270 million. Worldwide paid Prime members increased
53% year-over-year. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 43% of paid
units. Fulfillment by Amazon or FBA units represented more than 40% of seller units. Worldwide active Amazon Web
Services customers exceeded 1 million.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $20.67 billion or 70.5% of
revenue, compared with 73.5%. Fulfillment marketing, technology and content and G&A combined with $7.62 billion
or 25.9% of sales, up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $3.33 billion or 11.3% of
revenue, compared with 11.1%. Tech and content was $2.41 billion or 8.2% of revenue, compared with 6.6%.
Marketing was $1.49 billion or 5.1% of revenue, compared with 4.3%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our
stock-based compensation or the other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 22%
to $18.75 billion. Media revenue grew 1% to $3.54 billion. EGM revenue grew 27% to $13.53 billion, representing
72% of North America revenues, up from 69%. Other revenue grew 43% to $1.67 billion. North America segment
operating income increased 40% to $1.02 billion, a 5.4% operating margin.

In the International segment, revenue grew 3% to $10.58 billion. Excluding the $872 million year-over-year
unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 12%. Media revenue decreased 8% to $3.41 billion or a
decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 10% to $7.11 billion or 19% excluding foreign
exchange.
EGM now represents 67% of International revenues, up from 63%. International segment operating income was $20
million, down from $151 million in the prior year. Consolidated segment operating income increased 18% to $1.04
billion or 3.5% of revenue, up approximately 10 basis points year-over-year. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating
income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income was $591
million compared to operating income of $510 million in the prior year.
Our income tax expense was $205 million. GAAP net income was $214 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared
with a net income of $239 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
Now I'll discuss the full-year results. Revenue increased 20% to $88.99 billion or 20% excluding year-over-year
changes in foreign exchange. North America revenue grew 25% to $55.47 billion and International revenue grew 12%
to $33.52 billion or 14% excluding year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income decreased 9% to $1.81 billion or 10% excluding the favorable year-over-year
impact from foreign exchange, and operating margin was 2% compared to 2.7% in the prior year. GAAP operating
income decreased 76% to $178 million.
Turning to the balance sheet; cash and marketable securities increased $4.97 billion year-over-year to $17.42 billion.
Inventory increased 12% to $8.30 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.9 turns a year ago as we expanded
selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 9% to $16.46
billion and accounts payable days decreased to 73 from 74 in the prior year.
And now back to Tom with guidance.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Brian. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to
be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by
many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange-rate fluctuations as well as the global
economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could
differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign
currencies among social subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rate can
all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business
acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation
estimates and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q1 2015, we expect net sales of between $20.9 billion and $22.9 billion, a growth of between 6% and 16%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP
operating income or loss to be between a $450 million loss and $50 million in income compared to $146 million in
income in the first quarter of 2014. This includes approximately $450 million for stock-based compensation and
amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based
compensation and other operating expense to be between $0 and $500 million in income compared to $502 million
income in the first quarter of 2014.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with an update on our reportable segments. We expect to change our reportable
segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services beginning with first quarter 2015. We
remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We

Thanks. And with that, Phil, let's move to questions.
Phil Hardin
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question?
Q&A
Operator
Yes. At this time, we will open the call for questions. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one
question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed
with your question. Your line is live.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Hello. Can you hear me? Hey, guys.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Just a quick question. You had a strong holiday season, 100 million more items shipped for free
this holiday, while FBA units was up 50%, and fulfillment expense remained relatively flat. How did you manage that?
Are the new sortation centers essentially the key to controlling shipping costs? And what percent of units sold are
FBA? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the last part of your question, the percentage of FBA units of third-party
paid physical units are over 40%. And in terms of the fulfillment discussion, certainly Q4 is our most seasonal quarter.
You can see that we get a little bit better leverage, I should say, than we've gotten in other quarters. Again most
seasonal quarter, not a lot to add to that, but we continue to ship on behalf of obviously our retail offerings as well as
FBA, that's included in that.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes. Thanks. There's a headline on the tape referencing improving productivity in
2015. So I just wonder if you could clarify what areas of the business you are focused on in terms of productivity. And
then what are some of the projects or areas that we should be prepared to see a large uptick in investment in 2015?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes, I think what you're referring to is I mentioned on the earlier call that we do an annual
planning process. We actually started in the late summer/early fall, we go through that process. We take a break for the
seasonal holidays and then we get back to it. So we're in the process of finalizing it right now and the teams are putting
even more energy and attention on driving what we would call fixed expense and variable expense productivity, as well
as other efficiency projects. So there's many, many different pieces that go into that, but certainly we've added a lot of
people and structure over the last several years, and so we have been putting focus on that, but we're just putting even
more focus on it as we finalize our plans for 2015.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: And what areas should we expect big upticks in, in investment in 2015?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: You'll have to, in terms of investment, certainly we're going to continue to support the
growth of the business. You should expect that we'll be spending more in terms of CapEx to support our Web Services

businesses, which is growing very fast. You should expect us to add fulfillment capacity. As we've done in prior years,
we've kind of updated you a bit as we've gone along and so we'll do that from time-to-time during the year as well in
2015. So stay tuned on that.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on fulfillment costs, it looks like overall
costs accelerated quite a bit to around 17% growth in 4Q from 30% in 3Q. I'm wondering if anything specific led to
that improved overall growth from – is it may be the key of a rollout? And then, quickly, I think there was mentioning
around breaking out AWS results. Wondering if any reason now? Perhaps it's getting to a level that you have to do it?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes, in terms of the fulfillment piece, there's not a lot of callouts on that. We had unit
growth of 20% year-over-year. Certainly our FBAs are growing at a faster rate. It's the sellers were up 65% over year.
It's greater than 40% of our units. And again, the teams continues to work on getting productivity there. In terms of
AWS, we just think it's an appropriate way to look at our business for 2015 and so our plan is to start breaking it out as
of Q1 of this year.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Kaizad K. Gotla>: Thanks. This is Kaizad Gotla in for Doug. I think you noted Prime is growing faster
internationally than it is in North America. So can you help us reconcile that with the difference between your North
America and International EGM growth rates?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: If you take a look – yes, what I had mentioned was Prime worldwide is up 53%
year-over-year. So it's growing very fast globally. It's 50% growth in the U.S. and even higher in International. And so
what I was – the reason – both are contributing to the growth rates that you're seeing. But we're certainly at an earlier
stage in International. So it's an opportunity for us, but in terms of the number of Prime members relative to the U.S. is
smaller, so it's an earlier phase. So again, as we continue to grow that, it's an opportunity for us and certainly something
that we're focused on.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Hi. Can you – I have two questions. Can you comment on your view of the relative value
proposition of Prime in European markets and Japan? Is it similar to the U.S., two-day shipping and all the other
benefits, or is it different because – we think, for example, that penetration of Prime in the European markets is much
lower. And you have told us that the number of Prime SKUs is much lower in the UK, for example. So, what's the
fundamental cause of that? Why is it that Prime in the UK is not as developed as in the U.S.? Is it timing or is it the
proposition?
The second question is about AWS. You have a leadership position now, and it's a very large market. And it's easy to
see from the outside that you are hiring aggressively, both in engineering and sales. Given the size of the opportunity
and your position, what specifically prevents you from hiring faster, developing more products, investing more? How
do you balance – what prevents you from doing that? Why wouldn't you invest twice or three times as much in AWS?

Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of – I'll take the AWS one first. We are expanding very rapidly. We have been
hiring a lot of great people over the past few years and several years. We do think it's a big opportunity. We're making
sure we keep the hiring bar really high to make sure we bring in great resources like we do across all of Amazon and
we're super excited about the opportunity. So we are investing very heavily. You see that certainly in our CapEx
numbers and the assets we're acquiring with some of our capital leases, you see that represented. So again, we are
investing very heavily both in terms of people as well as capital for that business and we share your excitement about
the business.
In terms of the Prime piece, the proposition is a bit different by geography and we continue to make it better and all of
the geographies that we have Prime, that's something that we're focused on. The shipping speed is different by
geography a bit. And so – but the focus is all about how we make sure that we get a great experience for customers in
those geographies. But the one thing is different is you mentioned is that the proposition or the timing, so the
proposition is a little bit different, but we'll continue to work on making it better for all the geographies we have it in,
but the timing is different. We did launch in the U.S. first, and we launched in other geographies following that. So, as
a result, it's just earlier in these other geographies. So we still think it's a very good opportunity and something that
we're focused on.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my question. One on – I am sorry if I missed this. What's your thought or
outlook for pricing in the AWS cloud business for this year? It was obviously quite fierce last year. Do you think it will
be quite as competitive in 2015? And then in the media business, we've been hearing data points about a slowdown in
the e-book space. Are you seeing that? And sort of what's your outlook? Do you see any hope for the media segment to
improve as a result of that? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the first question, we have continued to lower prices for customers in Web
Services. Certainly that's something that we've been focused on since early launch. It's something that we continue to
focus on. It's hard to predict what will happen going forward. So really can't comment on what we might or might not
do there, but certainly it's something that we've had since launch. We've had many, many. It's in the high 40s I think in
terms of pricing actions there. So we're very excited to make sure we have great prices for customers.
In terms of the media, you are seeing an overall media growth globally. You're seeing some softness in the growth rate
there. I just want to point out certainly one of the larger factors – or largest factor that's in that number is, keep in mind
that we have video game consoles that are part of the media growth numbers or the media absolute numbers. And last
year was a very strong year for new console launches. And so what happens is when you have those launches, you also
have video games that are – the video game sales themselves are also strong. So, for example, if you look at North
American media growth rate in Q4 of this past year, you're seeing that impact. So that's what you're seeing there. So...
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great. Thanks. Hey, Tom, can ask you a high-level question?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. Go for it, Mark.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Okay. Amazon has always pitched itself in terms of price, selection, and convenience to
customers. And I saw this great survey work that was done by Morgan Stanley in the last couple of weeks about this
global survey that kind of indicated a little bit of the shift in consumers' interest in online commerce, more towards

convenience. You must have a pretty good feel at Amazon for whether that broad value proposition to consumers is
shifting; if it's shifting to be slightly less sensitive to price over the last couple of years, and more towards convenience.
Are you seeing that kind of shift? There's a lot of implications if that is, in fact, what's happening.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I would say it this way. In terms of customer reaction, you see it really across the
fundamental inputs that we've talked about for a long time. So in other words, in terms of speed of delivery and
convenience, we so that Prime members, Prime members are buying more, it's more convenient, they're getting their
product, physical product to them faster when they're versus being not a Prime member. So we certainly see that, so
that certainly speed of delivery helps. We also see, we need to make sure and it's something that we're always focused
on is making sure we have great prices and that's every single item across categories, across geographies. So it's
something we've focused on. We do think that's important for customers.
And we need to have the selection be in stock when a customer comes to our detail page. It matters. And so, I don't
view it as a shift. I view it as there's certainly a lot of visibility and transparency around all of these. That's what
shopping and operating a business online does. There's just a tremendous amount of transparency. We think we like
that world and that's something that we continue to focus on those inputs so that we can be successful in that world, and
that's not something new. That's something we've been focused on for a long time.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Hey. Thanks. Two questions. One, just if you can clarify any impact of the Fire phone in the
quarter. And then secondly, can you talk about how fuel prices impact your model. And kind of I know the shippers,
they use a kind of a trailing index to calculate fuel, how those savings would show up, or if you would pass those on to
third parties, et cetera. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes, there's not. I don't have really any callout for the Fire phone. We continue to sell. I
had mentioned we had a little bit over $80 million of inventory at the end of Q3 and it will continue to sell through that
in Q4. In terms of fuel prices, not a lot to call out there in terms of impact on the quarter. Certainly, over a long period
of time, if it's sustainable, we should see some benefits there.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Good afternoon. Over the past couple of years, it's just been a little bit of a roller
coaster with margins for investors. There's points of optimism followed by points of frustration. And there's really some
optimism here in this report. Is there anything that you can help investors with to understand just how you think about
different cycles of investing, to try to smooth out some of this roller coaster mentality that happens with the stock?
Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Well, in terms of – I would describe it this way, Gene. We have a lot of opportunities in
front of us that we've talked about, and we're also being selective with those opportunities. We have added a lot of
resources over the past few years. We certainly have been in a heavy investment cycle. I mentioned earlier, we're in the
process of finalizing our plan for 2015. We always put energy into various productivity measures. But we're putting
even, the team is putting even more focus on those efforts as we finalize our 2015 plans. We'll have to see where that
ends up. But putting more energy and focus around our various fixed productivity, variable expense productivity,
efficiency projects, and again a wide range of different activities. And so, that's what we're doing and you'll have to
stay tuned to see how that progresses as we go.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Hi. Thanks, Tom. I had two questions. First on India, can you talk about the India opportunity
broadly, and maybe some advantages you may have versus some of the local peers in terms of leveraging your scale?
That market appears to be just on fire right now, so just a little bit of color on India.
And then on Prime, can you talk about the Prime member behavior in terms of purchasing frequency, how it looks
today versus maybe a Prime member that joined two years ago? I know it looks a lot different from those very early
Prime adopters from six, seven years ago. But just more recently, over the last couple of years, is the behavior
consistent as you grow the base? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of India, we think it's very, very early. We are investing certainly in India,
and we think it's a very interesting opportunity. We have a very good team there and we're excited to participate. Again,
we think it is very early, and so we like the opportunity there. In terms of Prime, there's not a lot I can help you with on
that, but what I would say is this. Certainly as you think about customers who are not Prime that become Prime, we see
a very sizeable step up in their purchasing patterns.
And so the customers are certainly buying a lot more from us. And one of the things that we're seeing, another thing
that we're seeing is certainly, as Jeff references in the quote, Prime has evolved. It is both a physical and digital
offering. It's unique that way. We see for example – although it's still very early and we're learning and investing in this
area, but I take video content, for example. What we see is customers that come in, who come in through our Prime
pipeline for video for a free trial, those customers are converting at higher rates than other channels.
We see that customers that are streamers, video streamers, even though we have high renewal rates, they're renewing at
even higher rates than others. We see those people who are customers who are streaming, have very similar purchase
patterns on the physical product side as those who don't. And so we view that as a positive. So it's very integrated from
a customer experience standpoint, which we think is great. And so those are the things that we're seeing in Prime right
now, and with Prime being almost 10 years old, growing at 53% year-over-year on a sizeable base, tens of millions, we
think is very interesting. It's something that we're very focused on as we continue forward.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS Investment Research.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. On the topic of China, wanted to know if you could help us
either qualitatively or quantitatively understand sort of what that trajectory or the size of the business is in China. And
then maybe the trajectory around investments needed to compete in China, and how you think about the opportunity
there long-term, looking through the lens of the competitive landscape, and maybe Amazon's particular skill set on
going to market in China. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. We haven't broken out the size of the business. I can't help you much there, but we
continue to work on the customer experience there. The team has some interesting ideas that you'll have to stay tuned
on but – of how to make that experience better. And we continue to work on it. So there's not a lot more that I can add
to that.

Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great, thanks. Just a couple questions. In North American media, aside from the video
game impact, just wondering if there are any other factors driving the kind of low or flattish growth year-over-year.

And then, CapEx was up about 40% in 2014. It's kind of bounced around over the years. Just wondering if you can give
us a sense of the level of growth in 2015. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the North American media, a number of different – certainly puts and
takes there, but certainly by far the biggest one is the one I called out which is the video game console. So if you look
at the growth rate in Q4 last year of meaning 2013 and Q4 2014, you see a big difference and the biggest, the most
sizeable difference there is certainly the video game consoles portion and the video games associated with those. So,
another way to say it is the video game consoles and the video games portion of that is down year-over-year. And
obviously years ago we put the video game consoles as part of North American media to keep it with video games, and
their kind of larger ASP items as well that go in there. So certainly having an impact on that when you look at the
growth rate and you compare 2013 growth – Q4 2013 growth to Q4 2014 growth there.
In terms of CapEx, we're not giving guidance on the 2015 spend, but given the high usage rates that we've had in Web
Services, you should expect that we'll be spending CapEx to support that growth and we'll certainly be adding new
fulfillment centers as we go. Also keep in mind that we do also finance capital; so if you look at our capital lease
activity, point to that. That's also increased in activity over the last few years. Certainly a number of different
investments that are – a number for different types of CapEx that go into that financing, but the biggest piece is
certainly infrastructure to support our business primarily on the AWS side. So again, that's also included in that
number.

Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. Tom, I was hoping you could give us some kind of sense of the impact on
delivery times and conversion rates that you saw during this holiday season from the investments that you made in
fulfillment, particularly the sortation centers that were added before the holidays.
And then also, to what degree you've seen some leverage, or some of the slower growth in fulfillment costs from
moving more of the fulfillment obligation to sort of first-party-owned infrastructure?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the sort centers and I would say just in – I would say in addition to sort
centers, what's happened over the course of the last several years is with all the fulfillment centers that we've added,
we've actually gotten selection closer to customers. And so that's helped us from a delivery speed standpoint, it's helped
us from a cost standpoint in terms of transportation costs being closer to customers and so it's a natural result of the
footprint that we've added.
In terms of sortation centers, there are a lot of different benefits to that. But certainly one of them is as you get closer
and closer – certainly throughout the year it's helped us with holiday deliveries, it's helped us with Sunday deliveries,
and as we get closer to, in this case, December to the holiday – end of the holidays, it certainly helped us from a
deliveries-to-customer standpoint. So very pleased with the performance of those sortation centers and really the global
team, fulfillment team around the world, I think they did a terrific job during the holiday season as they did throughout
the year.

Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair & Company.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good afternoon. There's quite a disparate performance between North America and
International, in terms of the profit change year-on-year, up nearly $300 million; North America down over $100
million. So could you just help us understand why the International performance is so much weaker? Perhaps give us
some color on the established markets in Europe, relative to emerging markets. And in the past, you've also discussed
Japan. And then is there an inflection point where International profits we could expect to head up again?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. First one is certainly the growth rates, the real growth rates, are slower in
International versus North America, certainly would have an impact. The second is we continue to invest in
International in terms of adding capacity for infrastructure, for fulfillment capacity as – if we look at our International
growth rates, the unit growth rates are actually growing at a higher rate than revenue. And then emerging geographies,
we talked about India earlier, very excited about India. We are investing in India. We're also investing in China, so
those are certainly impacting the results as well.

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about gross margins. They were up quite a bit year-over-year,
and it looks like, in our numbers, EGM beat and media missed. So, any thoughts on the mix shift there helping or
hurting gross margins? What are the key drivers for that line, and what are your – can AWS continue to drive that in
2015? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Certainly AWS, mix of business is having an impact. AWS is certainly part of that and
impacting that. Also just to keep in mind, our third-party growth is growing at a faster rate than retail, and so certainly
that's having an impact. And then obviously, continuing to lower prices for customers as well as working with our
partners on the vendor side to support those activities from a pricing standpoint. So those are the dynamics.
And in terms of 2015 beyond the guidance that we're giving, there's not a lot of call-out there, but we've had a great
success of being able to grow our retail offerings. Our marketplace side has grown very nicely over the years including
2014. The team's done a great job there, Fulfilled by Amazon, in terms of number of sellers continue to grow there. The
percentage of paid physical units are approximately 40%, are a little over 40% of the total there, so that's become much
more meaningful over the past several years. So, very happy about that. So all those contribute to the numbers that you
just talked about.

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Good afternoon. One question as a follow-up on AWS, and specifically some of the
announcements related to WorkMail and WorkSpaces. This would signal that Amazon is moving up the stack towards
more of a SaaS offering. Is that the right interpretation? And if so, should we expect a broadening of those SaaS
product initiatives? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Very happy to have the launch, make the launch that you mentioned. We think it's exciting.
It's certainly, we're excited about, overall about Web Services offerings. The team's done an incredible job in terms of
innovation as well as operating these large services at scale. So, they're doing a terrific job. In terms of what we might
or might not do in the future, we're not talking about what that road map is. So you'll have to stay tuned.

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie Equities Research.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Tom, just give any color on how you are evaluating the opportunities to show video advertising
against the ever-increasing video content? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes, we really aren't using advertising too much in that area. You've seen it a little bit on
some of our original content, but beyond that we really can't comment. We think the experience we have is great for
customers. We get a lot of positive feedback on the content that we have there and the uninterrupted content, if you
