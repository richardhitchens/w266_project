To begin with our 12-week second quarter fiscal 2015 operating results, as you saw this morning for the quarter
reported earnings per share came in at $1.35 up 29% from last year's $1.05. As noted in this morning's release, this
year's net income was positively impacted by a $57 million or $0.13 a share income tax benefit. This was in connection
with a portion of the $5 per share special cash dividend paid by the company last month to Company 401(k) plan
participants.
Partially offsetting this reduction to the income tax line was a $14 million or $0.03 a share income tax charge related to
an ongoing overseas income tax matter. The net impact of these two discrete tax items to our reported second quarter
earnings, $1.35 earnings per share, was $43 million or $0.10 a share to the positive. So, excluding these two items, EPS
for the second quarter would have been $1.25 or up 19%. Other factors that impacted our second quarter when you're
comparing year-over-year results; gasoline operations, as was also the case in Q1 2015, we benefited from strong
margins and profits in our gas business. I'll speak to this a little bit more when I discuss our gross margin.
FX, as compared to a year ago in Q2 this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S.
dollar; in all countries but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Japan, this resulted in our foreign earnings in Q2 when
converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million pre-tax or $0.05 a share than those earnings would have
been had FX exchange rates been flat year over year. So, again, another relative weakening of these foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar.
Third, IT modernization costs; as discussed in each of the past eight fiscal quarters or 10 fiscal quarters or so, our major
IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expenses through this year and into next year
and possibly a little beyond. Especially, as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In Q2, on an
incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or about $0.03 a share.
Fourth, stock compensation expense; this was higher year-over-year in the quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share.
While this charge was about a four-basis point hit to SG&A, it was much smaller year-over-year impact to SG&A this
quarter than it was in Q1 when the year-over-year delta was $38 million or $0.06 a share to the negative.
Lastly, interest income and other; this number was lower year-over-year in Q2 by $10 million in pre-tax or $0.02 a
share. The decrease primarily related to the revaluation and settlement of U.S. dollar payables primarily in our Mexico
operations. As you know, this line item, if you will, goes back and forth sometimes it helps us a little, sometimes, it
hurts us a little. Under GAAP, these adjustments are recorded to the interest income and other line.
Now, in terms of sales for the quarter, reported sales were up 4.3% and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was up
2%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by significant year-over-year gas price deflation and this had about
a 323-basis point impact to the number, to the negative. And by weakening FX, foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar, this was just under 250 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas, our reported 4% U.S. comp sales increase
in Q2 would have been plus 8%. Our reported minus 2% international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates,
would have been plus 8% as well. As I've said, total comps, again reported 2% for the quarter, plus 2%, excluding gas
and FX, were plus 8% for the quarter on a more normalized basis.
For our four-week month of February, which included the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter, reported comps
came in at plus 1%, consisting of a plus 2% comp in the U.S., flat international. Sales again were negatively impacted
by gas price deflation, almost 400 basis points for the month to the negative, and weakening FX, just under 300 basis
points to the negative. So excluding gas, the plus 2% reported comp for February would have been a plus 7%. The
reported flat international comp would have actually been a plus 12%. And there's a little benefit in there from the
switch in the Lunar New Year, I believe, that impacted a couple of the Asia countries for us, such that total company
comps, the reported plus 1% for the month would have been a plus 8%, excluding gas deflation and FX.
In terms of new openings, after opening nine new locations in Q1, including one relo, we opened no new locations in
Q2. All told, that puts our fiscal 2015 openings through the second quarter still as eight net new locations, and we now
operate 671 locations around the world. Between now and the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to open an additional 20
new locations, just a couple in Q3, which will end in early to mid-May and then 18 planned for Q4. Of these 20
additional openings before our August 30 fiscal year-end, 10 are in in the U.S. and 10 will be international, so we'll

most likely end the fiscal year with 691 total locations. Now a few of those near the very end of the fiscal year could
slip into Q1 of 2016. So my guess is that, that additional 20, may be 17, 18, who knows?
Also this morning, I'll review to you our eCommerce activities, our membership trends and renewal rates. A little bit
more discussion on margins and SG&A in the quarter. Our recent $5 a share special cash dividend and the related $1
billion debt offering and our recent announcement related to the planned changes for our U.S. co-branded credit card
offering.
For our second quarter results, sales for the quarter for the 12 weeks ended February 15 were $26.87 billion, up 4%
from last year's $25.76 billion. On a reported comp basis, as I mentioned, Q2 comps were up 2%, but up 8% excluding
gas and FX. Now, for the quarter, that reported plus 2% was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little
over minus 3%. But again, taking gas out of that number, the average transaction increase would have been plus –
taking gas and FX out of that number, the average normalized transaction increase would have been a little over 2% to
the positive. And average frequency increased a little over 5.5%. So year-to-date shopping frequency is up a little over
5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, for the quarter in terms of geography, our Midwest, Southeast and
Northeast regions were the strongest. Internationally, in local currencies, Japan was the weakest. Still impacted by
cannibalization of two units we opened in the last 12 months on a total base of only 20 over there, and with Taiwan,
Korea and Mexico being strongest in local currency comps. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the
second quarter, within food and sundries, overall in the mid-single digits, candy, meat deli, beer and wine were the
relative standouts. Within hardlines, overall in the low single digits. Departments that were the strongest were tires and
electronics. Consumer electronics was up in the mid-single digits. Within mid-single digit softlines comps, domestics
and apparel were standouts, and in fresh foods, where comps were in the high singles, meat showed the best results,
although impacted by inflation there.
For February, traffic was up again 5%, while average transaction on a reported basis was down 3.5%, but again, getting
really impacted by FX and even weaker gas year over year. Gas prices during the four-week month of February year
over year, the average price of gasoline is almost down 31.5%. In terms of geography, Midwest, Southeast and Bay
Area regions were the strongest during February. And internationally, in local currencies, Taiwan and Korea were the
strongest. As I mentioned previously, the shift in the Lunar New Year holiday from January to February negatively
impact January comps and positively impact February comps for the company probably about 50 basis points each
way.
From a merchandise category standpoint, ex-FX, food and sundries overall for the month was in the mid-single digit
range; hardlines overall came in to the mid to low single digits, which was consistent with what electronics did during
February. Softlines was up in the mid-single digit range, and finally fresh foods up nicely in the low teens overall, with
meat being the strongest, and again as I mentioned, seeing quite a bit of inflation in that area.
Moving on to line items down the income statement; membership fees were up 4 basis points and up 6% from $550
million a year ago in the quarter to $582 million, or up $32 million. Take out FX, the up 6% in dollars would have been
up 9%. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates. Our U.S. and Canada renewal rates still is
at 91%, I think just a shade under that, averaging up to 91%. And for the first time, our fully captured worldwide rate is
rounding up to 88% instead of down to 87%. Continued increasing penetration of Executive Member, of course, helps
us as well, as those members tend to be the most loyal. New membership signups in Q2, company-wide, were up 9%.
In terms of members at Q2 end, in terms of Gold Star, we ended Q2 with 32.7 million members, up from 32.0 million,
up about – a little under 700,000 from the end of the first quarter 12 weeks earlier. Primary Business inched up from
6.9 million to 7.0 million. Add-on remained at 3.5 million. So total member households, 42.5 million at the end of Q1
and 43.2 million at the end of Q2, and representing total cardholders going from 77.5 million to 78.7 million over the
12-week fiscal quarter. At Q2 end on February 15, paid Executive Memberships were a shade over 15.4 million, which
is an increase of 188,000 during the quarter or about 15,000 a week, and that's both new member signups as well as
conversions. Executive Members, as I mentioned before, about one-third of our membership base and about two-thirds
of our sales.

In terms of renewal rates, they continued strong. Again, from Business Member renewal rates at Q1-end was 94.5%. It
tweaked up to 94.6% at the end of Q2. Gold Star was 89.8%, inched up to 89.9%, and total remained at a 90.7%. And
worldwide, the 87.3% went to an 87.9%. You'll see a little bit bigger increase there because when you start at a lower
base, that tends to improve a little bit faster in those first few years.
Now I'll comment on this past Monday's press release regarding Costco entering into long-term co-brand credit card
agreement with Citi and our acceptance and co-brand agreement with Visa. As the press release stated, we've entered
into a new co-brand credit card agreement with Citi, and an acceptance and co-brand incentive agreement with Visa.
These agreements are subject to the purchase from American Express of the existing co-brand credit card portfolio by
Citi and wouldn't be implemented until next April 1, 2016, at the end of our current co-brand arrangement. While
there's not a lot of specifics I can give you at this point, I can tell you the following.
Once issued, the new co-brand Costco Visa credit card will be accepted throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.
The new Rewards based card will be fee free. The new card will, needless to say, provide generous rewards to Costco
members utilizing the new card. And again I can't tell you a lot of specifics about that, but we certainly look forward to
telling you and our members more about it. But it probably is not going to be until several months down the road this
calendar year. The new card of course will also serve as the members' Costco membership card. Again there's not a lot
of detail we can give you at this point. Needless to say, what we do is ultimately for the long-term benefit of our
company and our members, and in this case the co-branded credit card holders as well.
Going down to gross margin line; gross margins were up 54 basis points on a reported basis from 10.53% to 11.07%.
As I always ask you to do, I'll ask you to jot down four columns and six line items. The columns of course would be Q1
2015 both reported and without gas deflation, and then the column three and column four would be Q2 2015 reported
and without gas deflation. Going across those line items, the first one is core merchandise.
Reported in Q1 was minus six basis points year-over-year. Without gas deflation, it was minus 13 basis points. And Q2
reported was plus 10 basis points. Without gas deflation it was minus 20 basis points. Ancillary, plus 22 basis points
and plus 20 basis points in Q1, and plus 46 basis points and plus 49 basis points in Q2. 2% Reward, minus one basis
point and minus one basis point, and then minus five basis points and minus two basis points. LIFO, plus one basis
point and plus one basis point, and then in Q2, plus three basis points and plus three basis points. And then other, plus
six basis points and plus seven basis points in Q1, and 0 basis points and 0 basis points in Q2. All told, in Q1 last – Q1
2015 year-over-year to Q1 2014 we had a reported gross margin improvement of 22 basis points, which is the sum of
those line items in column 1. On a gas neutral basis, it was plus 14 basis points. Again reported for this quarter, it was
plus 54 basis points and on a gas neutral basis, excluding gas deflation, it was a plus 20 basis points.
Now, as you can see, again, our overall gross margin was outsized at plus 54 basis points and even a plus 20 basis
points without gas deflation. Again, a lot of this has to do with gas sales penetration, which were way up as well, even
though with the lower price per gallon. Our core merchandise gross margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year. But
again excluding gas that you see in this chart, it was down 20 basis points. Again, this is a function of both increased
sales penetration and strong gross margins with our gas business.
If you look at the core gross margins as a percent of the various departments of their own sales and then when I talk
about core, I'm talking about food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods which account for about 80%-plus
of our total sales. On their own sales, they were down year-over-year by three basis points in the second quarter, with
food and sundries and hardlines being up year-over-year a little and softlines and fresh foods being down a little.
Frankly, margins are fine. We're driving sales and certainly gas prices give us probably room to continue to be
aggressive. Although, with gas prices going up the other way right now we don't expect to see those kind of outsized
gas profits in the next quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 46 basis points on a reported basis, 39
basis points without gas deflation. Again our gas business accounted for nearly 2/3 of this Q2 year-over-year increase,
but we also showed higher year-over-year margins in Optical, Hearing Aids and Pharmacy.
The impact of the increasing Executive Membership was good. It hit margins by five basis points, or two basis points
without gas deflation. And again that's that 2% Reward feature. This just generally reflects continued increased sales

penetration from the Executive Members, which again, as I mentioned, buy more and are more loyal and shop more
frequently.
LIFO in the second quarter, we recorded a $4 million credit pre-tax compared to a $5 million pre-tax charge last year,
so about $0.01 a share or three basis points benefit year-over-year for $9 million to the gross margin.
Moving onto SG&A; our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was higher or worse by 11 basis points coming in at 9.94%
this year versus a 9.83% last year. Again, we'll do the same four columns, reported and without gas impact Q1 2015.
Then column three and column four, Q2 2015 both reported and without gas. Five line items; first one is core
operations or just operations. Plus eight basis points was reported in Q1, that means – and plus year is a positive, mean
lower year-over-year; plus 16 basis points without gas deflation. In Q2 it was a plus three basis points and a plus 29
basis points. Central, minus one basis point and minus one basis point, and in Q2 minus 10 and minus 7, so higher
year-over-year in [indiscernible] (18:16). Stock compensation, minus 11 basis points and minus 11 basis points, and
then minus four basis points and minus three basis points. There are no quarterly adjustments, so the last line item
would be total. And again we reported a minus four basis points, year-over-year SG&A higher by four basis points in
Q1 both on a reported basis, plus four basis points, or lower by four basis points in Q1 without gas deflation. Again, in
Q2, higher or minus 11 basis points, and then better or lower by 19 basis points, so a plus 19 basis points without gas
deflation.
Now, a little editorial on SG&A here; again, the operations component of SG&A was better by three basis points in Q2
on a reported basis and better by 29 basis points year-over-year excluding gas deflation. Again, gasoline sales
penetration and very low SG&A in the gas business certainly helps that number. Within operations, excluding gas and
other warehouse businesses, so taking all that out, payroll and benefits represented an improvement of 16 basis points
of this 29-basis point improvement. So, again, strong sales overall certainly helped us improve payroll and benefits as
well, and get some leverage there.
Central expense was higher year-over-year by 10 basis points, or seven basis points without gas inflation (sic)
[deflation]. As I mentioned earlier, increased IT spending for modernization, this was seven basis points on a reported
basis, five basis points without deflation and FX. And lastly in both years we had a few discrete items to the tune of
about minus five basis points, but that is what it is. Finally, within SG&A, our stock compensation expense, as I
mentioned, was higher or worse by four basis points on a reported basis, three basis points without gas deflation.
Next on the income statement line, preopening expense, $8 million last year and $9 million this year. Last year we had
three openings. This year we had no openings but we've got plenty of openings coming up so you've got quite a bit of
preopening expense already started and there's lots of other little things that go into that number. No real surprises. All
told, operating income for Q2 came in at $877 million, 21% higher year-over-year, or higher by $153 million compared
to last year's $724 million in the quarter. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was essentially the
same year-over-year coming in at $26 million last year and $27 million this year. As I mentioned earlier, interest
income and other was lower by $10 million coming in last year in the quarter of $30 million to the positive, this year
only $20 million to the positive.
Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by $3 million. The other swing was a minus $13 million, and again
most of that relates to year-over-year swings and various FX things. In this case I think the biggest piece was the
revaluation settlement of dollar payables, U.S. dollar payables primarily in our Mexico operation. So I think that was a
small positive last quarter. Overall pre-tax income was higher by 20% or up $142 million from $728 million last year in
the quarter to $870 million this year. In terms of income taxes, our company tax rate this quarter came in at a – needless
to say, on a reported basis at a very low 30.2% versus 35.0% last year. Again, the income tax line benefited primarily
from a $57 million tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend. Dividends paid on Costco shares held by
our employees in our 401(k) plan, which totaled about 29 million shares, are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes,
and we recognized a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $57 million related to that.
As I mentioned, there was an offset to that benefit of about $14 million after-tax charge to the income tax line related to
an ongoing income tax matter. Excluding these two items, our Q2 tax rate this year was actually up – would have been
up 0.1% to 35.1%, just slightly higher compared to last year's 35.0% on a normal basis. Overall, reported net income

was $463 million last year compared to a reported $598 million of net income this year. Again this year's net income on
a reported basis was up 28%, 29%, taking out those two tax items of about 19%.
For a quick rundown of other topics, well, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of
balance sheet information items; depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $260 million in the quarter and $514
million year-to-date. Accounts payable ratio, accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis, it showed
improvement year-over-year from the 93% figure to 97%. There's a lot of construction payables in that. It's showed a
comparable improvement from an 83%, if you just do merchandise – accounts payable as a percent of merchandise
inventories – merchandise accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories, 83% last year up to 87% this year
in the quarter.
Average inventory per warehouse was darn near flat, coming in at $12.8 million this year on average per warehouse up
about $20,000 compared to a year ago, so pretty much flat. Ex-FX, year-over-year inventory levels would have been up
about $350,000 or about 2.7% of sales on again an 8% sales increase. So I think there's control of our inventories, and
inventories are in good shape. Mid-year fiscals came in just fine, physical inventories.
I'll respond at this point to questions received in the past few months about the work slowdowns. As you know, on the
West Coast ports, a week and a half ago I guess, there was a new agreement. So things are getting back to order.
Although, the view is it will take four weeks to eight weeks, if not a little longer, to get through the backup there. We,
like I'm sure every other importer of containers, are trying to identify which ones have priority where we can. And
really pretty much the impact of that's over. When we talked to our heads of merchandising in different areas, the view
is in Q2 we probably got hit by $100 million, $200 million, nothing to really speak of, in terms of sales, and that's
probably a little worse for some others out there.
In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $555 million on CapEx. In Q2 we spent $619 million, so quarter-to-date just under
$1.2 billion. For the year, we still expect to be somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range which is up from
$2.0 billion last year. In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate it in the four countries, U.S., Canada, UK and
Mexico. We're also doing things, not really online, but through Alibaba T-Mo in Asia. But in terms of the four
countries online, there's Costco.com. Sales and profits, needless to say, were up during the quarter. Sales were up 23%
in the quarter. Comp sales in the U.S. were similarly up right around 23%. Foreign sales in the other three countries
were up on a local currency basis, 20% and more as well, but again with currencies being down, there's some impact
there. But overall continued good results and sales strength in our .com efforts.
In terms of expansion as I mentioned we planned in Q3 to open three units, including one relocation, so net of two new
units, and have current plans for 19 units, which includes one relo, so net of 18 new units in Q4. Assuming we opened
those, we'd be at 28 net new units for the year or about 4.5 square footage growth. And by country, assuming we get to
28 new units, it would be 17 new units in the U.S., so a little under 2/3 there; one new unit in Canada, one new unit in
the U.K. Five new units in Asia, one new unit in Korea, one new unit in Taiwan and three new units in Japan, as well as
one new unit in Australia and three new units in Mexico. As of Q2 end, total square footage stood at 96.4 million
square feet.
In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1, as you know, we started the process and bought a little bit, we bought $18 million
worth or 139,000 shares at an average price of a little over $126 a share. In Q2, we expended $92 million to buy
642,000 at an average price of $143.21. Now, a bunch of that was done before the dividend date, the $5 ex-dividend
date. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at 35.5 cents a share or $1.42 per share annualized.
That represents a total cost to the company of about $630 million. This regular dividend of course was in addition to the
$5 per share dividend, which amounted to $2.2 billion that we paid out last on February 27. And in fact both dividends
were paid to shareholders on February 27. As I mentioned, we also completed a one – to pay in part for the $2.2 billion
special dividend, we did a $1 billion debt offering a few weeks back, $500 million of a 5-year fixed and $500 million of
7-year fixed at attractive market rates.
Lastly, just a couple of other items of note; the March comp sales reporting period for this year will include 34 selling
days versus, which is a day less than the 35 days last year reflecting the calendar shift of the Easter holiday. And in
addition beginning next month we'll start reporting comp sales one day earlier than we have historically done. So

March comp sales will be announced on Wednesday, April 8 after the market close around 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time and
9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Hopefully, that will help our East Coast friends. And, similarly, our Q3 scheduled earnings
release date will be Wednesday, May 27, for the 12-week third quarter ending May 10. Again, the release will occur at
6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time that Wednesday, with the earnings conference call still occurring the
following morning.
Before I turn the call back to Brandy for Q&A, hopefully I've helped everyone understand some of the factors
impacting the number. Overall, I think we had – certainly the outsized gas profits helped, but there were lots of other
little things that went the other way. So, overall, still we felt pretty good quarter and certainly strong sales, membership
renewal rates and the like.
With that, I'll turn it back to Brandy for any Q&A. Thank you. Hello?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Thanks. Good morning, Richard, and thanks a lot for moving past the 3 O'clock in the morning
wake-up call. I guess my first question is when you look at your gas business today, clearly it's a bucket for you guys to
pull from to invest back in pricing for you guys to kind of be like Costco, if you will. Is there a way to quantify that this
quarter? Clearly the core margins within 80% of the business being down three basis points, was there some impact
from you guys being a more aggressive on price, or if you could maybe just speak to it thematically?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think qualitatively, it allowed us to be a little more aggressive. We didn't just say, hey,
take this extra money and put it all there. We didn't. We certainly benefited from it in the quarter. And again, it's not
like we looked at this as that'll be an offset to FX, as an example, because we know that FX has still got – even if FX
rates continue to stay where they are right now and don't get any relatively weaker, it's still on a relative basis and Q3
and Q4 are going to be relatively weaker. So yes, we recognize that Q3 and Q4 will be a little more challenged in that
regard. But certainly could margins have been up a few instead of down a few, probably, but who knows.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Fair enough. And then when you look to March of next year and then change in tenders,
it's my understanding there's roughly 750 million U.S. Visa cardholders today and there's roughly 50 million Amex
holders today in the U.S. How big an opportunity this could be for you guys to expand your membership base when
you move into next year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, look, we'll see. There's a lot of unknowns. First order of business is for Citi to work
with American Express and figure out the account portfolio. And a lot hinges on that. We expect that to happen but
there's no guarantees. And there will be – and again, there's a lot I'd like to tell you. There's a lot we'll figure it out now.
We know the bucket of dollars, if you will, in our mind of what we can use to, to drive usage of that kind of card to
recognizing there will be some cannibalization. Somebody that has a Visa Mileage Card in their wallet, and they want
to use that instead. Just like there's cannibalization now, there's people that use a non-co-branded Amex card.
Similarly there'll be other places where there's outside spend increase because at your neighborhood dry cleaner, one
card is accepted and another card's not. So I think there's lots of opportunities. We got to get there first. And first order
of business is the transition itself. And there'll be a lot more to say once we get there.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. And then just last question on eCommerce, up 23% in the quarter. Can you just remind
us number of SKUs online today relative to a year ago, and where you think that can go? How much is crossing
through your depots versus not, and then just margins on eCommerce relative to the clubs? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That's probably approaching 8,000 regular SKUs. I am excluding from that, that we have a
lot of tire SKUs, based on all the sizes. We've got a lot of office products SKUs through a third-party. But core SKUs

on our side is 8,000 SKUs, probably 1,500-plus SKUs more than a year ago. And I'm guessing there, but that's probably
a good number. And then where those increases are a lot of sundries items, some apparel items, things like that. Trying
to get you to come back on a more frequent basis and – smaller ticket items. A lot of the items we've added are items
like I'd mentioned versus $300 to $2,000 televisions and furniture sets.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Any color on profitability?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Excuse me?
<Q - Charles Grom>: Just margins in the eCommerce business?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Margins overall are probably a shade lower – are a shade lower. SG&A is a lot lower. So
profitability-wise, eCommerce is a very profitable operation relative to the company as a whole.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: So, Richard, two-part question to get to kind of the same thing. You've got some
very busy clubs and you keep increasing traffic mid-single digit every year. Do you guys spend a lot of time looking at
quality of experience in the club and maybe different parts of the club like Fresh? And with that in mind is there an
opportunity to open more clubs in the U.S. than you might have thought before? Maybe cannibalize yourselves, gain
share, improve the experience if some of them are too crowded. Have you guys done much work on that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, yes. In a lot of different ways, but not in terms of let's sit down and do that today at
one time. First of all, quality and experience as you, I think, know, I'm sure you know, our operators and our merchants
are in the warehouses a lot. Craig and a random set of merchandising and operating victims just spent two days
schlumping around part of the country, visiting warehouses, both us and competition and other things and looking at
new sites. So I think certainly the member responses that we get every day, the types of throughput per hour at the front
end register, all those things go into that. And I got to tell you, when a member writes a little complaint, it doesn't have
to be nasty, just a complaint, it gets heard. And recognizing we're always going to have some challenges. So we're
constantly looking for that experience. We're constantly looking for that – to get you out of there faster and make it a
better experience.
I got to tell you we still get probably more positives than negatives in terms of emails that are sent in to senior
management about positive experiences with a member with a particular employee who – they were helped in the
warehouse or somebody went above and beyond. So we have no illusion that we do everything right, but we're pretty
steadfast of looking at all those things. In terms of willing to open more units; absolutely. If you had asked me five
years ago when we were opening about 20 units a year and probably – I don't have the numbers in front of me, but
probably it was 70%/30% U.S.
And you said, Richard, five years hence, where are you going to be? And I'd say well we're going to be about 30% and
we actually got there, pretty close. And if it's 70%/30% U.S. back then, it's probably 50%/50%, heading to 30%/70%
over the next five years. And here we are almost 60%/40% still in the U.S. I think that's a reflection of we're finding
probably more opportunities than we thought possible. Some of it's what you mentioned, opening up in busy – that
quality of experience, the units that are 250 and 300 and even a few that are 300-plus trying to get those in; trying to
balance that because cannibalization does cause a little heartburn for a year.
But a lot of it also is I think surprising how many units we can put in some of the newer markets. And that "newer" is a
relative term, newer markets over the last – in markets that we've been in for the last five or 10 years. And so I think it's
a combination of all that. Again, last year I think of the 20 – in fact I have it here. Hold on. Of the – here it is. Last year
of the 29 net openings we had, I think 16 were in the U.S. And this year of the 28 openings – or 16 or 17 were in the
U.S., so a little over half. And this year it's – what did I say? 17 openings out of 28 openings, so almost two-thirds. And

so I think you'll – probably five years from now as we go from let's say 30 to 35, probably still half are in the U.S. and
we're finding more opportunities.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Do you think you can get to 1,000 there ultimately? Or have you not gone out that
far?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we haven't gone out that far. If you add – yes. If you mean, if you added even 30 a
year for 10 years -
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Right.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: – you're essentially there. So, yeah, I think so. That's certainly not out of the realm.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: All right. And then secondly, what's the thought – at least it seems like anecdotally,
maybe in certain items or categories, there may be a Kirkland introduced, maybe the brand, or a brand is no longer
carried. I don't think there's a conscious effort to – although the quality and value of Kirkland certainly outstrips a lot of
the brands – a conscious effort to get more Kirkland items in the store, more space to them. Is there a conscious effort,
or that's just – kind of it happens? You put it in, it's where the demand is, and so maybe it squeezes out some brands
along the way?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think there's an ongoing conscious effort to – there are people that are in charge of
coming up with new Kirkland stuff in each merchandise category. And their job is to try to find new things. Just like
any buyer's job is to find good, exciting branded items. And ultimately they – an item – it is our cousin, it has Kirkland
name on it, but it has to live and die like any other item. I think if we've added 30 or 40 items in the past 12 or 18
months, I bet you we've subtracted 20 or 30 that ultimately didn't work out. And then we bring back some a few years
later that work better. I remember years ago we had an organic peanut butter, Kirkland Signature, that didn't set the
world on fire. I think we're now testing it again and it's a pretty good item. But we'll see how long pretty good means.
So we're – it has to – we recognize the strength of our concept as both KS and brand. And I don't think we – if you said,
Richard, you're in the mid-$20 millions now in terms of KS, do you ever see it going to $50 million? That's a stretch. I
mean, even our own numbers internally would say, how can we get it from $25 million to $30 million? There's no
formal game plan how many years is that going to take. It's what items work. And certainly there's not a lot of
low-hanging fruit. There's lots of $20 million and $30 million and $50 million items over time, not a lot of $300 million
and $400 million items, like paper goods or water or things like that, or K-Cups.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And last comment before getting to the next question out there. In terms of cannibalization,
even as that's ramped up a little bit. I was just looking over the last few years. If you go back to fiscal 2013, what we
call cannibalization, that's not just here, that's opening three units in Japan. And that affects three or five other Japanese
units. Total cannibalization in fiscal 2013 was 65 basis points, in 2014, 58 and for the first half of this year, it looks like
it's about something in the low-40s. So it's going to fluctuate between 35 and 75, depending on what we do and where
we do it. But my guess is something in the 40 to 50 range, as kind of – we're not going to be able to move that number
overall a lot.
Okay, next question.

Your next question is from Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. It's Dan Binder. My first question is related to the gas business. Can you just give us an
update on where the comp gallons were in the quarter? Where gas is as a percentage of the total sales? And then you
mentioned that the gas margin would start to be a little bit less favorable, given what prices are doing. Can you help us
just to understand kind of what the excess margin may have been to EPS this quarter?

Page 10 of 21
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, look, just on that line item, it was two-thirds of the margin improvement of all
ancillary businesses. It could be 200-plus basis points of extra margin. I mean, our margins in gas on a daily basis over
the years could be anywhere from a 0% to a 5% or 6%. And it's all over the board, might even be a little higher
sometimes. But it really ranges. And, frankly, when it's a little higher we're saving the customer more money. In terms
of gallonage comps, I remember for a couple years when the U.S. overall, not Costco, but all U.S. vehicle gallonage
consumption was in the low single digits and maybe when the bad economy hit it went to the low negative single digits,
and we went from – we remained at 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%. Right now we're in the mid-teens. So we're getting a lot of
people coming into Costco to buy gas. And that certainly drives them into the warehouse as well.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then on the IT spend, you mentioned, I think you said it was $0.02 this quarter. As you
look at Q3 and Q4, what do you expect that impact to look like?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's hard to guess completely. I know we've had a couple of some of the original modules
and modules makes it sound like it's a small number. These are big numbers. But you have projects that are $50
million, $60 million projects that the day they're put into service, they then over the next, in our case, 65 four-week
periods, over the next five years generally, you take a little under $1 million a month hit, and so there's some of those
starting to hit. So my guess is it – is it that much? Is it a little less or a little more? It's hard to say. But still over a
several-year period incrementally, recognizing your denominator, sales, keep getting bigger too. But even with that
bigger sales we had indicated something in the low to mid-teens of basis points. I could be off by a couple of basis
points, but it ain't cheap.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then my last question was related to organics. Can you just give us an update on how
many SKUs there are in the club at this point? What the mix is of sales and how that performed in the quarter? Kind of
what you're thinking about that business going forward?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, it's still a small percentage of Costco. It's a rising – but it's a fast-growing area, as it
is with a lot of other retailers as well. You're going to see more and more of it. Part of that's availability. We and
everybody else could sell a lot more if there was more out there. I think we're doing a pretty good job of lining up our
sourcing. And I think I mentioned last quarter that for all of 2014, organic was like approaching $3 billion, which was
more than twice what it was two years earlier or a year and a half earlier. It's growing fast. I don't know if it's 50% a
year but it's certainly growing at a mid – a low-mid or mid-double digit number. And it's great for us because we show
even a better value on that stuff than some of the things that it replaces. When we can do organic ground beef where
everybody footballs regular ground beef and everybody makes a lower than average margin. This is the item that
everybody tries to make more on, and so we can make a little more, not a lot more and show a greater value to our
member. So, it will keep growing.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay.

<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Just a follow-up on a couple of Chuck's questions actually. So it doesn't look like you're getting
into too much specifics about the change in the credit card, Amex et cetera. Just curious what has been the response
that you've seen from our friends up North? I know that sort of changed over in January maybe what the reception has
been there.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it's been good so far. We're getting a lot of people to switch, recognizing it's people's
membership card as well. And if anything, our view of the U.S. should be – I guess I can't get into a lot of it right now.
We wouldn't have done this if we thought there was a lot of risk associated with it. We think it's a big positive over a
long period of time. But recognize big positive to us means giving most of it back to the customer. In this case, most of
it back to the co-branded user of a credit card and that's going happen. We're really not going be able to tell you a lot
about it for a number of months.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Okay. I guess I'll switch back to the gas prices then. Historically, the adage has been you guys
benefit when prices go up. But it looks like just based on gallonages and miles driven which has only been up a couple
of percent, you guys are actually capturing a lot more share now than in history period. Is that something you would
agree with?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, no, there's two points to that just so everybody understands. When prices go up, we
make less and save the customer; we still save them but save them less. When prices go down, we save them more and
we make more. Certainly prices going down, we save the customer more and that's positive and we make a little more –
or a lot more, right? That's changed in the last few weeks but we've made a lot more in the last few quarters. If you go –
the other thing, and the thing I think you're talking about is, is when – it was in the press every day as prices went from
$3 a gallon to $4 a gallon to $4-plus a gallon. It was on the news every night in every city. That helped us I think. The
offset to that would be, as prices are less important, how can that help you? I don't know other than it is and it is a lot
because our gallonage is quite a bit up.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Did you see what the volume in gallonage was? I think it was, call it up 11% last quarter.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It was in the mid-teens, I think we mentioned.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Okay. Yes. So, pretty big acceleration there.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: And then just finally on geography...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And by the way...
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Go ahead, sorry.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, and by the way, just getting back to that comment, I think people will ask us why? I
think it's because we do a good job of being the most competitive priced. And there's that third-party, there's a
GasBuddy.com, that 40 million-whatever people and put their price on what they bought gas for, for two years in a row
since they started announcing best overall low price out there by $0.14 a gallon or $0.16 a gallon across the country.
That's not every station, every day, everywhere. But on average with all those data points, we're it. And I think that
kind of publicity helps us as well.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: No, that makes perfect sense. And then just the last question on sort of geographical
differences, it looks like you called out the Midwest and the South areas as the strongest. Obviously a lot of moving
pieces there with the Chinese New Year is a help, but then the port shutdowns, which on our math, comes out to 60
basis points roughly. Maybe just what you're seeing, elaborate a little bit geography, and then maybe the Northeast. I
know we've seen some pretty severe weather here as of late. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, look, I think you summed up what we summed up on the port strike and the Lunar
New Year switch. Yes, I think the big deal is, weather has played a role. Although we – it did last year as well. But, if I
look at to New York, the Northeast as an example; the four weeks that comprised February, the first two weeks were
mid-positive single digit, and the last two weeks were mid-negative single digit. That's a huge swing. But other areas
did just fine. The Texas region got hammered the last week with weather. But overall, we've done okay.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Great. Best of luck.

Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks, Richard. Couple of quick ones. On the credit card, I
know you're not going to share a lot of details. Is there, besides probably some savings just from some lower
interchange fees or credit card fees, is there any elevators such that if there's certain volumes met you could see
benefits, further benefits down the road? Or is this you know the lower fees you'll see a benefit up front and then from
there just how much business you do?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: As you're asking, I'm looking at my wall behind me and there's a handwritten note from
many years ago when our Securities Counsel was sitting here. And quickly, if someone was asking a question, he
wrote, we have no comment beyond the release. The reality is there's lots of buttons that you push on, on these
agreements. There's all aspects of it. At the end of the day, whatever our current arrangement – as we looked at it,
whatever our current arrangement is with our current provider, both what we pay, what we receive to offset some of
that, what our member using that co-branded cardholder is rewarded with a premise of, how much is that to start with?
Where we think it could go to? At the end of the day, whatever that bucket of money is, it can go towards lowering
merchant fees, raising rewards, or using some other place in our company. We'll figure it out.
We think it's an exciting bucket and we'll do a lot with it. But just like I've told people in the past, if we can save a
dollar on buying a product better whether it's detergent or coffee or anything, due to packaging or raw materials cost, or
energy cost, we're going to give $0.80, $0.90 back to the customer. And rest assured, whatever benefit X is, a little bit
of it will accrue to our P&L and a lot of it will accrue to the member in some way, shape or form. But none of that can
really be...
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We can't really tell you until next year.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: That's fine. That makes sense. On membership, I know you don't say a lot international
versus U.S. but can you speak directionally to whatever growth rate you're seeing in membership? Whatever trend line
has been occurring? How is that – has it changed much? Is it the same in the U.S. versus international?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's higher in international because we're newer. And I think I've shared in the past, if you
take the total number of members divided by our total number of warehouses, you've got roughly 59,000 member
households per warehouse, 60,000 member households per warehouse. In Japan, you've got a number that has a – it's a
three digit number. It's in the low hundreds. You also have a lower renewal rate in those first few years. So it tends to
balance out over time. But we operate overall in other countries on a membership fee as a higher percent of sales,
particularly in Asia.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: But whatever prevailing growth rate there has been in membership in the U.S. up until
second quarter, or up until the first quarter, meaning has that run rate stayed the same in the U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, again, a lot of it is dictated by new openings. And again it is going to be dictated more
– like when I said new member signups in the quarter were up 9%. There have been times when it's been almost flat, or
down a little bit because a year earlier in that quarter you opened three units in Asia where you might have – and again
I talk about an average of roughly 60,000 member households per location. We've had locations that will have new
member signups as of opening day. And that as of opening day means during the 8 weeks or 10 weeks or 12 weeks
prior to opening, when the parking lot is kind of set and we have the flags and the tabling activities out front side, you
could have anywhere from 25,000 members to 40,000 members signed up. Now, 40% of them aren't going to renew a
year later but in terms of new members coming in and buying a membership, and that really distorts that number. So I
don't know how much meaning – that plus 9% is a function of that as well. But we always point that out.

<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then just very quickly, can you just remind us, the eCommerce business, is
there other member-only items, or meaning – or is there items someone can just – who's not a member, can come on
the website and purchase as well?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In this crazy world, there's some items that we have online where we've agreed not to show
the price unless you're a member.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Not to show the price, but the only person who's buying on your website is a
member?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.

And your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Good morning, fellas. I wanted to just touch on membership as well; certainly with consistent
and strong traffic. And you certainly are saving people money at the pump. How are you thinking about the value
proposition of your membership currently in the U.S. and international? What may be the timeline in terms of you kind
of reassessing what you think the value of the membership should be?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think in a roundabout way you're asking about when do we see any possibility of a
fee change. Historically, that's really – we think about last. We drive prices and value every day in everything we do.
And I mean it. You come to our budget meetings every four weeks and you've got a day and a half, and half of that
time or 1/3 of that time is merchants. And we'll figure out how to improve the value and lower the price and raise the
quality. And historically, using U.S. and Canada as a – 80% of our business, first of all, and probably 80%-ish – a little
different than that number, but pretty close in terms of percent of members, we've done a fee increase about every five
years or six years. The last one we did was in very late 2011, very early 2012. So during most of the calendar year of
2012, those renewers for the first time in five years or six years saw a fee increase from $50 to $55 and from $100 to
$110 on the Executive in the U.S. and Canada. If history repeats itself, five years to six years from January of 2012
would be January of 2017 into January of 2018.
So that's – again, based on history, doesn't mean we're going to do it or not going to do it. We've chosen generally to
hold membership fees at whatever their prices are in most of the other countries, in part because it's so darn strong to
start with, and why not continue to drive the business? And so again, I think it's generally the last thing we look at, but
something we've looked at regularly over 30 years and I'm sure we'll look at it again when the time is right.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Sounds good. And then just circling back to gas profitability; I know you've addressed this a
few times on the call, but given the spread between the Street's forecast and the actual for 2Q, I just wanted to touch
back on your comments around the third quarter. You mentioned that gas prices have started to trickle back up. But
frankly, can you help us just kind of think about our expectations for the back half of the year? Should it be closer to a
more normalized cadence around gasoline profitability? Or do you continue to see a little bit of tailwind given the
favorable mix?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, if you look at history, when we, each quarter for the last several years will share with
people that gas helped us a little, hurt us a little, helped us a lot, hurt us a lot, it's virtually all – it's pretty much in
proportion with the trend of gas prices per gallon. And so as you know, the constant drive down has stopped and it's
actually been up a little bit. So a lot of that party is now behind us for right now. But I can't really tell you what it's
going to be other than historically that's what it's been.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Understood. Thank you.

Your next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: It's Matt Fassler. Good morning. First question relates to the special dividend, I guess this
is our first conference call since you announced the last one with prior special dividend, that was around the time of tax
policy change and many companies pursued that tack. As you take a bigger picture, look now at capital allocation,
understanding that you did accelerate the stock buyback a bit. How are you thinking about special dividends perhaps as
a recurring element of capital allocation and any other light you want to shed on your decision to issue that one last
week?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I mean, we now have two data points instead of one. We did it, and you're right, the
motivation or one of the motivations for doing it when we did it was reading about it in The Wall Street Journal every
day, and just before people expected dividend tax rates to go up dramatically. So, it made sense to be not only
shareholder friendly, but shareholder friendly in a way that might help people as well if tax rates were going to change
and be proactive about that. I think we appreciated the fact that it was perceived as being shareholder friendly.
As you might expect, both management and the board wants to continue to do things in that regard. And it's not like we
sat down and did this giant study exactly when, how much, and what should we do? I think we liked it the first time.
And it seems like our shareholders liked it the second time. I'm not trying to be cute or coy about it. They're a little
independent of each other. I think when we did the first one, which was a little over $3 billion worth, it was quite
sizable. It was the time when, I guess, in retrospect we could have bought some more stock back, it would have been a
smart thing to do given where it's at right now. But we tend to do both. We tend to look at all things, first and foremost
CapEx. How can we ramp up CapEx, and we've done that. Second would be our regular dividend. What are we going
to do with that every year? Again, there's no guarantees. But in each of the last spring periods over the last nine years I
think we've raised it on average around 13.5%.
We looked, as you know, from your models and our models, we are generating more cash than we can use in CapEx.
And so we'll continue to look at ways to be shareholder friendly. But there's no reason to think it will be two years
hence we'll do another one. There's no reason to think we won't. We'll see.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: It's interesting. Even though you're running with several billion dollars of cash on the
balance sheet, you have gone to the debt markets, which I understand is opportunistic. Should we think about the cash
balance that you have today is something that you feel you need to be comfortable with? Or is that a number that you
can whittle down over time?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's a number we can whittle down. Mind you, I'm looking at quarter end and this
number might be a shade different than the balance sheet number. But I think we had cash and short-term investments
of – what was in the [indiscernible] (61:27) number there? Hold on a second. We had cash and short-term investments
at the end of the quarter of $7.4 billion roughly. And add a number that wasn't completely consolidated of like $7.2
billion. But if you look at that roughly $7.4 billion number, about $2.5 billion is real cash in the U.S. Another $2.5
billion, $3 billion is real cash outside the U.S. where we're spending it frankly. In addition, we announced last year that
we brought back some of the cash in Canada.
So I think we can whittle the number down, but some of it's cash equivalents. If you think about from the time banks
close on Friday night to the time they open on Monday morning, all those debit card and credit card receivables which
could be upwards of $1 billion, $1.5 billion, $1 billion-plus, that is a cash equivalent, but it's not cash.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up; we are seeing the LIFO
creep up. I know it's only a couple of basis points, but you know it's a nice change from a year ago, when I guess you
peaked at it around an eight-basis point hit. Could you just talk about what the moving pieces are in driving that? I
know you feel like you're fully marked at the end of any given quarter, but if you had to place bets on which direction it
would go for the rest of the year it would be very helpful.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, I don't know. Gas has come up a little bit, although it's still below where it was in the
beginning of the year. So that's still probably – as of today it's LIFO creditable. I don't think it's going to be a big giant
number either way, but it's a little bit of a crap shoot at this point.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. Thank you so much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, by the way, Matt, a part of that is, some proteins are inflationary right now for not
all reasons related and then some other things we're just starting to see the beginnings of some deflationary pressure on
items manufactured with oil, plastic bags and the like, so some of that is starting to finally flow through. So there will
be some things that are inflationary and some that are deflationary.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks for that color.

Your next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Not sure if it's too early to ask this, but just
curious about the members that you brought in via the LivingSocial promotion several months ago. Just curious if
you're tracking them, are they following that typical spending pattern of a new member in terms of spending and
frequency?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm going to punt, because I don't know the answer to that, but if you hold that question for
next quarter I promise we'll have some numbers. I know that we are tracking it; I just don't have the detail on it. I know
that on average they're a little younger. I don't know spend habits.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Okay. Then just another one, you mentioned the Bay Area as I think a strong region either in
the quarter or for the month. Just – I know that's an area where you have more robust offering in organics, and I was
just curious if that's part of it and maybe how plans are to bring that more robust organic offering to some more clubs in
the rest of the country.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, and that's probably a little piece of it, I think weather overall has helped. The West
Coast – as bad as it's been in Texas and the Midwest and the East Coast, it's been offsettingly good over on our side of
the country, and I'm sure that's helped some. Clearly, I think some of the merchandising efforts we've done on organics
has helped. Part of that, we are doing it more in other parts of the country, part of it is supply issues, and it will still take
time for that to grow.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Great. Thank you.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: On an annualized basis I think last year it was like $2.9 billion something. $3 billion and
growing at 20%.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: $3 billion, growing 20%, 25%. And then from a gross margin perspective, how do we think
about SG&A associated with that business? Is there much of it? Is it like fractional, a couple percent? I mean, how do
we think of SG&A when you look – I mean a lot of stuff just goes directly to the consumer, about 60% of it. Is there
really a lot of SG&A associated?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. Margins are a – let me just look here. Margins are a shade lower, not a lot, and SG&A
is a lot lower.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. Okay so – and then from a philosophical perspective, everyone's always ragged on –
or not ragged on, that's a bad way to say it. Everyone has always – some people have criticized Costco because they
don't let enough flow through to shareholders. How do we think about that? I think the gross margins are, what you're
saying, a little bit lower, SG&A is a lot lower, so net-net we got much better operating profit in the eCommerce
business. Is that okay with the company? Or is that something that you would try to make look like the rest of the
business?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. Look, yeah, I mean, in retail there's different parts of it. No, we're happy to make a
little more there. We're still making – first and foremost are we as competitive as we can be relative to others? And we
feel that we are very competitive. We're also recognizing that eCommerce is supported by the buying strength of the
warehouses. As we brought in line electronics and furniture and some of those bigger-ticket categories, that buying
strength how do you compensate – how does eCommerce, if you will, compensate for that? So it's all part of the same
thing.
The fact that its margins overall are a little lower than the warehouses, I think is indicative of – is a function of that.
And we'll continue to do that. Yes, we work on strong profits and some of the other ancillary businesses, but they also
have different either costs associated with it or purchasing powers. Pharmacies, of course you've got pharmacists and
pharmacy techs that make more than your average hourly employee. So you've got a higher cost structure there as well
as all the regulatory and billing stuff going on in that business. So we work on a higher margin to offset some of that,
but we also work on a profitability number that's good. So it's all part of the equation, if you will.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So then just one last one. So I think you said you're up to 8,000 SKUs. One of the things we
think benefits Costco hugely on the eCommerce is that you're basically letting me use your people to do the shopping
for me. In other words, like the fact that there isn't 2 million SKUs like there is on Walmart's site, I think is a great
attribute. So what's your thought about where the SKU count goes, kind of balancing Costco being your personal
shopper versus wanting more, maybe more SKUs? Where do you think it goes?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: So I think it probably goes up a little bit, but not a lot. The fact that it went from 4,000 to
8,000 SKUs or something in the last few years is a lot. But part of that was is trying to drive business, adding some
categories to get people – for people to think of it as top of mind or near top of mind instead of not at all. If I had to
think about a comment from a very loyal shareholder and somebody who loves Costco with three kids at home, three
teenagers, and said, look, I love Costco and I know when I go into a warehouse I know I'm going to get the 10 items I
planned to get in the food and sundries area and the other 10 that I didn't plan to get, but I know I'm going to come out
with 20, and I'm going to be sated, and I know I'm going to have great food samples, I know I'm going to get three
other things in non-food area that I had no plans to get, and I'm excited about that. But I knew going in I was going to
get three or four items that I didn't plan on getting. But when I go to Costco – I don't know why – when do I go to
Costco.com?
So part of our challenge in the last year on Costco.com is not only driving sales of those bigger physical ticket – bigger
dollar ticket and physical ticket items, that not everybody wants to shop home like furniture and big-screen TVs and
have a great price and a great, in many cases, white glove service delivery. And we're driving that business, but also
how do we get you there more regularly, and whether it's K-Cups and other items for your office or home or some
apparel items, as you know, the 5.5 million KS dress shirts that we sell every year, which is a great value, I always

Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Hi, and congrats on such solid results. I just had a bigger-picture question. About holiday, would
you prioritize any major learnings from holiday in terms of where you might look to do things differently next year?
And then on the core merchandising margins number, what should we look at as helpful drivers for that positively
going forward? Or what kind of run rate might we expect there? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry, what were you saying? What was the second part of that question?
<Q - Oliver Chen>: The core merchandise margins? What are some of the positive drivers we should look for in terms
of optimism on the core merchandise margins? Whether the inventory control – or is the run rate at a slight negative
kind of realistic for us to model?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, let me say we don't provide – on the latter part we don't provide specific direction in
that area. I remember several years ago when our margins were just down year-over-year every quarter for a couple
years. And every quarter we'd say margins are fine. We can tweak them a little bit if we want to and where we want to.
I think that sentence and that response is still there. I think we continue to get excited by strong sales and strong loyalty
and strong conversion to Executive Member. And all those things will continue to take front seat to a little margin
improvement. But if we want to get a little bit, we think we can while still being very competitive. In terms of whether
we learned or not learned during the holiday, I think when we look back we think we did a pretty good job of planning
for the port slowdowns.
And arguably, it's probably easier to do a better job when you're managing fewer items. And so while we felt that we
got hurt by a little bit, I think we probably mitigated that hurt. Beyond that, again, I think we are comfortable when raw
materials prices and bakery and food court and the like go up, that we're not going to change our prices. And if it hurts
our margin a little bit, it hurts it. We can get it elsewhere. So I don't think – this was not – given our strength, there
weren't a lot of things to necessarily learn as it relates to – did sales soften and we drive more sales by more markdowns
or something. I think we probably came out of this season pretty good. And if anything, continue to be aggressive in
terms of the types of products, the price points of products that – our member wants great value on great items. And
we'll continue to drive the value proposition in upscale items.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Yes, that sounds encouraging. And inventories were nicely growing versus sales, like
underpinning sales. Is that a trend we should also model going forward in terms of the spread being neutral?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Probably a little bit. Again, I wouldn't read too much into one quarter. For a number of
years here we've generally again, taking FX and gas out of it, with just the four walls of warehouse inventories on a
non-FX dilutive or increased basis. Generally speaking, we've had sales greater than inventory per warehouse
increases. If sales were up 8% or 9%, inventories were up 5% or 6%. I think – my guess is Q2 was a little better than
we thought. But luck of the draw a little bit, but still trending in a positive ratio there.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay. And our last question, you gave a lot of great details on eCommerce and the evolution
there. What about flexible store fulfillment and reserve and pickup and ship from store? Is that on the horizon? Is it
something your customer appreciates? And will that be a material driver of traffic? At some competitors, eComm
contributes 100 basis points or more to comp.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, well, 23% of growth on $3 billion is like $60 million or whatever – or no, $500
million. So that's like a little under a half a percent of comp to the company. First of all, we don't do it right now. With
the exception of the eight or nine Costco Business Centers that we have that we both deliver and order for pickup, some
of the things we're testing with like Google and [ph] the cart (76:27) are something enhanced but it's not like – you can't
call Costco or go online at Costco and say I want to order this stuff and I'll come and pick it up. So I don't know if our
member appreciates it. I know there's a lot of effort out there doing it. Our first order of business is get – we just are
installing the membership module, which includes a lot of hooks to things. But I don't see us doing that certainly in the
next year.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Two, actually; one, do you see any evidence
that gas prices correlates either to customers' willingness to spend more on food, sundries and hardline in your stores or
your ability to sign up more members at your clubs when gas prices are either moving up or moving down?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it used to be when prices were moving up and it was the topic du jour every night
from the consumer product end, the consumer activists on the local news stations, when prices were skyrocketing is
when we saw some real signups related to it in that market. Conversely, you see less of that right now. Certainly we're
seeing – the answer is I don't know completely, but certainly we're seeing more traffic to the gas stations, more and
continued strong shopping frequency in the four walls of the warehouse. And some of that's got to be related to that but
I couldn't tell you how much.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And my second question is on the credit card. Can you give us a sense what the
private label credit card penetration is in your clubs?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think we disclosed that. Total credit card in the U.S., total credit card is about 40%,
debit's about 40%. Cash, check and other is about 20%.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Presumably a big portion is private label?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Probably, certainly more than half. But there are people that choose even – usually our
current thing; there are people that choose to get Starwood points or Delta points on a different Amex card than the
Costco one. Our goal though is to certainly drive more of it and we have successfully historically, and hopefully we can
do that in the future to drive more of it to this top of wallet card.

pricing back quickly to reflect the movement in gas, as you were opportunistic this quarter with gas prices going up?
Will you change things as we go into the next few weeks given the rise in prices?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The answer to the last one is no. And again I can't tell you all exactly what, when and
where and how. But did it give us a little bit of cover to be aggressive? Yes. Did it give us a lot? No. It gave us a lot of
cover but we chose not to use it. So, it's not like we will say hey let's take all of this and go use it. So, yes, as gas profits
come down, that was part of our improvement. It so happens this quarter, one of the reasons I pointed out all those
other things, some of which we'll continue to hit. You guys can figure out FX based on where the currencies of each
country are. If it weakens a little bit relative to the dollar from a year ago, it's a little more impactful. If it weakens a
little less, it's a little less impactful but still with a negative in front of it. Yes, interest income and others, a little bit of a
crapshoot, it goes both ways. Gas we know is going to be less outsized profitable in the coming quarters.
There's no reason to – hopefully that sales will continue to drive in the right direction. I think overall I look at Q2 and
taking all the good of gas out and the negatives and sort of those other things, some of that will go away in Q3. But if
we can drive sales and frequency, we'll be fine.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay, great. Thanks, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm going to take two more calls.

Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi, thanks, Richard. Two questions; one is I realize there's a lot of moving pieces, but if you
were to look at gas and how much that helps EPS this quarter, could you give a range, or if it was $0.10 and then think
about it going forward, if gas was steady, is that something you have to cycle, it comes back? Or is it something that's a
new plan. And then my other question was on gross margin. I think I heard you say that an ancillary there was
Pharmacy and maybe something else or there was some margin expansion. Could you help explain that if I heard that
right? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. We're not going to give specifics on gas. It was very profitable. A little bit – can be
an offset to other margins. A lot of it is just outsized. Then we also had a few other things that went the other way. So
that outsizedness was a little less outsizedness. In terms of gross margin, Optical and Hearing Aids, again, just looking,
just like I said in the quarter, gas was the big one, but several other key ancillary businesses also had slightly improving
margins year-over-year; Pharmacy, Optical, and Hearing Aid.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And that – what drove that. Was there a mix issue or...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think some of it – I think it's driving sales. A big chunk of it is driving sales. I think in
Hearing Aids and I'm guessing here because I don't know, our success of our Kirkland Signature, which is of incredible
value and quality. I'm told that the penetration of that is huge. Generally, we make more margin and save the customer
more money on our private label. But I'm guessing at that one.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And I guess just because it's linked a little bit, where are we now with inflation for the whole
store if you were to roll it together [indiscernible] (83:57) electronics and all that kind of stuff.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Year-to-date, we're about a half a percent deflationary. And that's a LIFO index for U.S.
inventory. So what were all like items, cost us on day one in this fiscal year and what are the same items cost us on day
180-ish or whatever of this year. And if on day one it was 100.00, at the end of 24 weeks it was 0.995. So literally a
half a percent. You had a little bit of inflation in sundries and apparel and domestics. You had deflation as you expect
in majors. You have deflation in gas. And you had deflation in food and sundries a little bit – in food a little bit,
sundries were up a little, food was down a little. So...

And your final question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Made it in. Wanted to just ask about
international for a moment; I think you've been in Spain now for about a year, just was curious for a little update there.
Update on what you're thinking about new countries. I believe France was going to be next. And also just more
generally, just store productivity, when you're opening internationally, are you still kind of achieving and exceeding the
targets that you've set out?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, in Asia and Australia historically we've achieved and exceeded, recognizing
whenever you are in a new country and I'll go back, I used Japan as an example, 15 years ago, 18 years ago, 15 years
ago, our original plan there was to open a unit a year for five years and just to achieve breakeven at the end of year five.
I think we ended up opening six units in five years and we achieved breakeven at the end of year four roughly. And a
lot of that has to do with you've got a $5 million-plus a year net on central expense; buyers, accounting department,
small IT department, you name it. And then, of course all the inefficiencies are starting up. Membership-wise we're
doing great in Spain. We have one unit, mind you. Sales wise we're a little under our plan. But it's starting to finally
grow nicely. I think now that we're there to stay we've got two openings planned for the remaining part of this calendar
year, both of them in the Madrid area, and what dates are those?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: One's in September and one is later that year?
<A>: Yes, in the fall.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think they're both in the fall. And again what we find even if it's in different cities, once
we're there you start getting more local vendors willing to sell you because we're going to be around. And you get a
little more play in the press. So we'll see. But we feel good about going so far. France, we're still at least a year away
from opening. I think when we first sat down four years ago or so, the view was is that Spain would take three years to
five years, and France would take three years to eight years and it is. So it's just a long drawn out process of permitting
and the whole appeals process over there by third parties.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Got it. Got it. Thanks, guys. A lot of the other questions we had were answered. So,
thanks and good luck with this quarter.
