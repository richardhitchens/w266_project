MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for
today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.
Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Senior Vice
President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Holscott, you may now begin.
Jessica L. Holscott
Thanks, Rob, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's second quarter earnings conference call. This
morning we issued three press releases; one detailing our results for the second quarter, one updating our 2016 full year
business outlook, and the third announcing Time Warner's agreements with Hulu, including making an equity
investment.
Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on
our website at timewarner.com. Reconciliations of expected future financial performance are also included in the
business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent Annual Report on

Time Warner is under no obligation and is in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its
forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill,
Time Warner's CFO. After the prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin
Tsujihara will join us for our Q&A session.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Jessica. Thanks everybody for listing in this morning. We're about halfway through the year and we're well on
our way to exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the
very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving
industry-leading growth over the long term. In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating
income of $1.8 billion. And adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to
shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence
across our divisions.
Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company,
with HBO's 94 again setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the two highest
graded cable networks in primetime. With TNT airing cables most viewed NBA telecast of all time and Warners once
again came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast network. We expect that momentum to continue
this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movies.
Our results also reflect the consistent execution of a strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part
of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of
platforms and devices and in all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it. With
state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on-demand functionality. Now in many cases, we'll simply extend
our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties, but we are also investing in new
services, both wholly-owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're
positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands.
Among our initiatives is to-date, HBO NOW is the most significant and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But
even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the
Nordic region and in parts of Latin America with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in
the process of launching an arthouse film SVOD service called FilmStruck which follows the recent launches of SVOD
services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil. And those join short form digital content initiatives
like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with
Tencent video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities
with acquisitions like iStreamPlanet and DramaFever.
This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This
investment fits our strategy like a glove. It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth in over-the-top
services, and it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition
and innovation amongst both SVOD services and among MVPD services. We also announced that the virtual MVPD
service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner
networks. Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces. They want more robust on-demand capabilities, and they
expect a greater variety of content packages. And we want to support services that do just that.
So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu leaves us free to continue to support fully, as we always have,
other traditional and broadband delivered distribution platforms. We look forward to working closely with our existing

MVPD partners and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access
our best-in-class shows and networks. We expect there will be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over
the coming year, and we think that the increase in choices available as a result of these new services will be great both
for consumers and for our industry-leading brands.
Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how our investments in Turner's
core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional
and new platforms. Here in the US, Turner had three of the top five ad-supported cable networks in prime time among
adults 18 to 49. That's TNT, TBS, and Adult Swim. And Adult Swim, which continues to be far and away the most
watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more.
Now we've talked before about the bold programming refresh underway at both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be
happier with the initial results. We've launched five marquee originals across TBS and TNT in this year, and we've
already renewed all of them. Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and
Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands, and they've all surpassed our
expectations for our initial slate of new shows.
We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their
launches, and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the
launch of ELEAGUE. That's our eSports initiative.
The strong demand we saw in the upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have in the direction we're moving
in and in the value of our brands, and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment
networks. We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation in advertising products, with our targeting analytics
capability setting the pace for the industry.
Demand in the upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the
past few years. To date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history and as the US presidential election draws
closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. CNN was the number one news – let me say
this very clearly, CNN was the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive
quarter, and CNN Digital becomes the number one news service in multi-platform and mobile uniques.
During the conventions of the past two weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike, in
viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next
generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products.
We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which once again proved it's without peer when it comes to premium
content. It's 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year and included nominations for Game of
Thrones for outstanding drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for outstanding comedy, as well as John Oliver and
Bill Maher for outstanding variety talk show.
HBO's status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of
Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode. That's more than 25% higher than last year's
record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO's sub base. Much of that growth was driven by its
digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to
double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs.
We've been thrilled with the overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series The Knight Of,
which will be followed up this fall by the much-anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return
of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce.
So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content lineup. The strength of the HBO content and brand have been evident in
the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our
digital and on-demand platforms. That started with the debut of Bill Simmons' Any Given Wednesday that happened in
June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and John Stewart's highly original and

much-anticipated new project later this year.
Now let me turn to Warner Bros., which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its
iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film, and games. The strength of our great IP at Warners
was evident this quarter in the performance of Warners television, which is once again leading the industry.
For the 2016 to 2017 season, Warner TV is set to be the number one producer of broadcast shows for the thirteenth
time in the last 14 seasons. With 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the
company's history.
Across all networks and services, Warner Bros. will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows
originating in the DC Comics universe, underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business, but
DC is also critical component for video games business, which coming off a record performance last year just had its
being biggest LEGO launch ever.
We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher at Telltale Games.
Batman is also the star of Batman Arkham VR. That's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the
launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you have never seen him before because you basically are him.
It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences, and it underscores the
strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge.
On the Theatrical side, we are starting to build some real momentum with the recent string of highly profitable
performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. Conjuring 2 has already past $300 million at the
global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history. And we're thrilled with the
recent opening of Lights Out. That's another micro-budget horror hit from New Line. Looking forward, Suicide Squad
is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release.
So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical
business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, a raucous comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and
Bradley Cooper that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint
Eastwood starring Tom Hanks and Storks, a charming movie from Warner Animation.
Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic
Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already
building. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened, and it's
already sold out through next May. The book version of the play script was released last week, and it had the most
preorders of any title at Barnes & Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. And the opening of the
Harry Potter – Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant
increases in audience.
That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K.'s continuing saga.
We couldn't be more excited, and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set
for release in November 16, 2018.
So we're in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses, and that puts us in a great position to
benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. We're making a lot of progress, both in
strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside.
And our investment in and Turner's agreement with Hulu is just another example of how we're taking advantage of new
platforms to serve consumers, increase competition and further grow our business.
We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content, and along with that
come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident
about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard who has the fantastic
financial details to give you.

Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first side of our presentation which is now available our
website. Starting with consolidated results, we're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date and
we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year.
Through the first half of the year adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%, and we
delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities
and revenue streams that will drive future growth.
We knew coming into the second quarter that we faced difficult comparisons from the timing of content licensing
revenue across our divisions, last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming
investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in
the quarter.
Even so, we were able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That
reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing in eliminations, and our continued company-wide focus on limiting
growth in overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter.
Adjusted EPS was up 3%. That's primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share
repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to
$320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders.
So we had a strong first half and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. As a result, we raised our outlook for
2016 adjusted EPS which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our
outlook later in the presentation.
Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner where the investments we've been making in the
transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues
once again grew 11% in the quarter, and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic
subscription revenues were up in the low-teens as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during
our affiliate renewal cycle. And excluding a close to 10 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription
revenue growth would have been in the high-single digits.
Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic
advertising grew in the high-single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected
another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA
National Championship game for the first time this year. International advertising would have been up mid-single digits
excluding a close to 10 percentage point drag from FX.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low-single digits. The
scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up well into the
double-digits over last year's upfront. At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original
programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way of this
year's Summer Olympics. The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory, and FX remains a
headwind.
Moving on, content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter. That reflects lower licensing revenues due to the
comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth
was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased 11% mainly
due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier and our continued
investment in bold, new original programming as part of the rebrand at TBS and TNT. Marketing costs were up
mid-teens to support those new original series.

Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well-positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the
second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make
important investments in new initiatives like iStreamPlanet, expanding Bleacher Report and CNN's digital products.
And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results
over the long-term as well.
Turning to HBO, where we're pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global
opportunity in subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the
quarter, and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain
encouraged with our progress.
Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter, mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with
Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues, highlighting our ability to effectively
monetize our original programming around the world.
Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double-digits, and that's a
reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics.
Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including
programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance
costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming front.
Separately, after considering consumer viewing patterns, including increased on-demand access to HBO's content
across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates of the period over which our original
programming is used. As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over a somewhat longer
time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. So the combination of reduced
amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted
operating income in the quarter.
While there will be some impact from reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was
recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization,
programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in
original programming.
Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup and combined with the continued investments
we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well-positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to
come.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we're also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across
theatrical, television, and games. Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver
of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. Looking specifically at the
second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games
business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had
significant TV licensing revenues from The Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld.
We also had fewer theatrical home video releases and a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and
carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating
income declined in the quarter.
In theatrical, we saw significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really
pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And The
Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office. So while we originally had higher hopes for
the film, we do not expect it to have a material impact on profits this year.
Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and
Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. Combined with the

healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its games business, Warner's is set up to
continue delivering strong growth both this year and well into the future.
Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half. That's up from a year ago, largely
due to growth in adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million
associated with the CME refinancing. And that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher
production spending at Warner Bros. Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted
operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016.
Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen
our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with
$22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly a result of our ongoing
commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation.
Looking at investments, we did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half, and as Jeff noted, yesterday we
invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. Our net leverage ratio at the
end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75 times, which we're on track to return to by the
end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit
ratings.
With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and
we're really pleased with how we're executing across our businesses. And that's reflected in our updated outlook for
2016. As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45. And that incorporates
around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of the losses and
PPA.
Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate, and that should help drive a nice
acceleration on adjusted operating income growth as well.
Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of
new original programming like The Night Of and Vice Principals and the timing of theatric availabilities and we'll
again face challenging comparisons in video games and TV licensing at Warner Bros. As a result, we anticipate growth
in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter.
So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating
momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to
continue that growth well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.

rights out of SVOD until later in the cycle, I wonder, what was the thinking on recent CW deal with Netflix which gave
a lot of Netflix the rights right after the broadcast window ended? So what changed in your thinking relative to The CW
versus what you said before?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: I'm not – I don't think you've characterized what we said before, right? I'll start and Kevin
will pick it up. The CW is in a different situation than many other networks or our cable networks in that it doesn't
currently receive material carriage fees. And so we made the decision this year not to have an in-season digital partner,
which essentially goes along with what we've been thinking, and we instead put more aggressive VOD rights and
stacking rights on The CW for the current season. Let's focus on that first, Kevin, and then let's go to the follow-on.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: The CW is the unique asset, because you don't – not only do you not get material retrans, but
we also don't own any. Time Warner doesn't own, but CBS owns some but predominantly don't own the station group
that it's being played on. And therefore it has slightly different economics than the other broadcast networks. But what
we did was actually give The CW more stacking rights by giving it exclusivity in the year. It has a lot more flexibility
in its ability to be able to convey a full season or any number between a full season and five episodes. So it can do, it
has a lot more flexibility than it had in the prior deal when The CW had a Hulu in-season deal and a Netflix out of
season deal.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: And let me just add to the philosophical side. Let's all look at the way this actually works
and it's working the way it should work. Consumers want, and they expect – particularly for series, where they pick up
the series maybe in its first year, maybe some other place – they want more on-demand access to the series, particularly
series that become serialized plots over a long period of time. So as consumers want that, networks – and it depends
which kind of networks and what kind of shows – networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more
episodes to cover story arcs.
So if you look at, for example, networks like in HBO or Showtime, or lately the Netflix business, Amazon. Those kind
of networks with their serialize shows have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over long periods of time
so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they
have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand, and to the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over
longer story arcs of episodes, networks increasingly ask for that.
So if you take, say, some of the broadcast networks – Kevin, you might want to comment on this – they've been asking
for more on-demand, in current season. What's happened for example in the broadcast networks over the last year?
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: Well we've been conveying and having very good conversations with all the broadcast
networks, and we've had an existing deal with Turner for a long time to convey full season stacking rights to those
networks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: For Turner, but then now you have some broadcast.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: We're having conversations with the broadcast networks, and we have a couple of deals
already in place for the upcoming broadcast season. We had a deal with FOX last year. And so I think that those –
you're seeing, from Warner Bros. perspective, we've been conveying those rights, and we will continue to convey those
rights.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah. So I hope that answers your question.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good morning. I have a couple more on Hulu. First, did your equity stake give you
a strategic leadership role with respect to Hulu's plans going forward? What does the 10% give you there in terms of
shaping the future of the product? And then second, with respect to the OTT product, and the relationship with Turner,
should we expect that the agreement is similar to an MVPD arrangement and that a smaller distributor and that you'll
be paid at the kind of the high end of the pricing range for the Turner networks with escalators that are consistent with
other distributors? Or is there something different given your ownership stake? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Why don't you do the affiliate situation first? Then I'll talk about the...
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Mike. It's John. So with respect to the virtual MVPD component, you should think
about the structure and the nature of our arrangement with Hulu being similar with the type of arrangements we have
with the virtual MPVDs that we're already in business with, including Sling and Sony Vue. And we're not going to
discuss pricing, obviously, but the structure is similar and we're quite pleased with the opportunity to participate in the
product when it gets launched.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Now on the governance side, we don't have an active role, and coming in as a 10% investor
without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance. Now we like the asset, and we like it even
more if it has better budgets for programming and more resources for platform capabilities. And we think that's helpful.
And as we said – Howard said it, I've said it – we're focused on making investments to capitalize on these opportunities
and to help serve consumer demand. They want all kinds of VOD and interface capabilities, and they want more choice
of bundles and price points. And we think that this helps it. It's part of a number of other services that, as you know, we
either have ourselves, like HBO NOW or other ones overseas, or the partnerships we do with others or the affiliate
deals, not just like the one John just described at Hulu but all the ones we've got with Sling and with Sony Vue and
with Comcast and Verizon and AT&T and all the other distributors.
So I think what you're seeing here is a resurgence of a kind of investment and health in the entire ecosystem that's
going where consumers want, and I think it's going to be a great thing for the diversity of product production and the
health of the industry.
<Q - Michael Morris>: John, if I could just follow up, are there significant differences between the virtual MVPD
arrangements with Sling and Vue and sort of your traditional ones with cable, satellite or telco operators?
<A - John K. Martin>: No.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. These proceed with your question.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. I just – one final Hulu question for John, and then a question for Jeff. John,
will the Hulu-Turner deal include mobile rights and have a minimum guarantee similar to what we're hearing AT&T
has but Sony Vue did not have?
And then for Jeff, with the guidance range you clearly have a line of sight for 2016, and correct me if I'm wrong, but
the year is coming in basically where you had hoped when you gave the $6 EPS guidance at the Analyst Day a couple
years ago, just less $0.50 or so of currency headwinds.
So my question is, when you look at the growth outlook for 2017 and 2018 relative to your original $8 EPS guide that
you previously had out there, other than the currency headwind impact, which should be the same $0.50 or so carried
forward, has anything else changed in your growth outlook when you think about the next couple years for the
company? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: You start.

<A - John K. Martin>: Hey, Doug, it's John. Let me start. Look, listen, I hope you can appreciate we're not going to
get into the details with respect to deal-by-deal in what's included and what's not included. I think just philosophically,
though, and we've been very consistent on this point now for some time, having the single most concentrated portfolio
of the highest value networks in the country, we would anticipate having carriage in many if not all of the new potential
entrants that come into the ecosystem. At the same time, while we intend to fully support our existing partners who are
incredibly important to us. So that – but with respect to which rights are in which deals, we're just not going to get into
that level of detail.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: And Doug, on your question about our general performance and earnings track, I love your
question. You're right, you're premise is right. But we're not going to go – you know how this – and give formal
long-term guidance right now. There's a lot of ins and outs that happen as we've been telling you as we go on
year-to-year. But you're right to point out and ask, well, gee, you're on a very good track, very much familiar to those of
you who have been following our predictions over the year. So we feel very good about it, and if you look at what
we're saying today and our results this year and the raise we just did and some of the strategic moves that we are
making and the advances where the industry is now finally to accelerate into a much stronger way of distributing the
fantastic content that it already makes, we feel very good about the earnings track for many years.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: All right. I had to try. Thank you.

Operator
Yes, our next question is coming from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please proceed with the question.
<Q - John Janedis>: Hi. Thanks. Maybe I will stick with the Hulu theme here. Can you also speak to the potential to
market or bundle HBO on any of the Hulu platforms as a way to further accelerate growth? And then, Howard, does the
EPS guidance assume maybe somewhere like a mid-single digit EPS impact for the last five months of the year?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: You start on that.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: John, it's Richard. Obviously we're in conversations. I have nothing really to add at this
time, but we're having constructive conversations and we expect they'll continue.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hey John, can you repeat your question?
<Q - John Janedis>: I just wanted to confirm with the PPA and the cost at Hulu that it's a mid-single digit EPS impact
for the last five months of the year.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Yeah, that's right, John.
<Q - John Janedis>: Okay. Great. And then maybe Kevin...
<A - Howard M. Averill>: You know, $0.06 that I mentioned.
<Q - John Janedis>: Okay. Kevin, I know you recently talked about the plan to reduce ad loads by about 50% on new
TNT dramas, and I think there's no question that it improves the viewer experience, but as you add more shows, can
you talk about your confidence level in your ability to have maybe at least a revenue-neutral outcome and to what
extent that was part of the discussion and negotiation in the upfront?

<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: I can answer for Kevin Reilly but this is Kevin Tsujihara. I think for Kevin Reilly it would be
five more Warner shows. But I'm going to let John Martin take that one.
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, John. So just, that's a hard act to follow. So for everybody's benefit, we have
announced that beginning in the fourth quarter, we're going to essentially reduce the ad loads on Tru TV in half. But I
think what you're referring to is that for the new original shows that are going on to TNT and right now it's really just
been Animal Kingdom, but we've made certain commitments to new originals that will be coming on later this year, we
are going with those shows with more content and less advertising.
And let me say that the early results are quite encouraging. And I would repeat that it's early. And we're going to be
obviously paying close attention to this, but it's all being driven by the fact that we know that we have to have a
network that has an experience that can compete with the very best consumer experiences in the world.
So we've reduced the number of ads. We've been engaged with in discussions with our agencies, with our advertisers
and what we've been seeing is smaller drop off during ad pods, meaning that we're retaining higher audience levels
during advertising commercials, which means higher ratings to the network. We believe the early results indicate that
there's even higher recall for the ads that are there.
We're working very, very hard to make the ads more relevant with our native product and our own internal production
capabilities to make sure that the advertising is more relevant and contextual with respect to the content itself, and that
was very, very helpful during the upfront and extremely, extremely well-received, one of the reasons why we were able
to garner double-digit CPM increases and we think we're leading the industry here.
<Q - John Janedis>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Next question?
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So you launched on Sling. I think you surprised a lot of
people by being one of the early partners when Sling launched their single stream product and you've been a part of
their multi stream product. And it's been call it more than 18 months now since Sling has been out. But Sling is still
charging the same kind of $20 for their core service. I'm curious, are you getting annual increases that are – I know
you're getting double-digits on your legacy MVPDs. Are you getting double-digit increases annually from Sling while
they don't raise retail price? How does that work or how are you thinking about virtual MVPDs and the ability to get
annual affiliate fee increases, especially with today's news vis-à-vis Hulu?
And then just two, you made an announcement I think last week or the week before about Chuck Lorre from Warner
Bros., and I'd love – you've been kind of hesitant before to sell multi-cam comedies, especially Chuck Lorre comedies
to Netflix because those are the huge win opportunities that you've gotten on the syndication side, such as Big Bang.
And I'm curious why this was the right deal to do to sell something like that and potentially limit your upside versus the
massive syndication values you can get off of those type of comedies?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: John, you do.
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Rich. It's John. I'll start. Listen, I think philosophically the way we're looking at the
potential new entrants, the virtual MVPDs, the Slings, whatever you want to call them, is we're looking at them in the
exact same way as we're looking at our traditional facilities-based partners. And we have a highly concentrated
portfolio of very valuable networks that we intend to get full value for over time, and one of the reasons why we've
been able to garner significant pricing increases is we've been starting from a lower base. But you should assume that
the deals that we're striking with respect to everyone carries with it similar rate card assumptions and accelerants.

<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: Hi, Rich. It's Kevin. As it relates to the Chuck Lorre show that we announced going to
Netflix, that was really a matter of the subject matter really lent itself to SVOD. Being related to marijuana usage and a
marijuana kind of background, it really didn't really lend itself to advertiser-friendly broadcast networks.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Fair enough.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Great. I think we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Yes, the next question is coming from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Morning, everyone. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, for Jeff on Hulu again, I
wonder if you could just clarify whether or not you will be licensing any of your content to Hulu's SVOD products. I
think I read somewhere that you won't be, but some clarity on that would be useful. And then also, on the live
streaming product, could you maybe give us a sense of what it might look like in terms of price points, content offering
and sort of availability of stacking rights and so on? That would be very helpful.
And then second question is just on for Richard maybe on HBO, I know Jeff said that now it had the strongest quarter
yet. I wonder whether you could – I could tempt you into updating us on some numbers there. And then maybe if you
could just let us know which international markets you are planning to launch that, the NOW product in, in the second
half. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Richard, why don't you?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Sure. Omar, I'll start. Obviously, I can't get into numbers other than to say we've had
substantial growth in the quarter. We see an enormous amount of momentum. We've lapped our marketing, and the
data we're getting is improving all the time. Churn is going down all the time, and we couldn't be more pleased as more
and more content suited to digital arrives. Jon Stewart is coming, Vice News is coming, Bill Simmons obviously very
conducive to it. We like the momentum we're seeing and I think it's reflected in the progress and in the numbers.
Internationally, early days in Latin America, as you know, with our launch so far in Colombia and in Mexico, and
we've announced later in the year launches in Argentina, in Spain, in Brazil. We're very excited about the opportunity
there. So again, this just reflects our ability to go multilaterally around the world, our networks business, OTT business,
our licensing business, wherever we think we have the best long-term monetization, that's what we're going to pursue.
Nordics is a case study in how fast we can improve momentum because the rate of growth in Nordics over the last year
has just been tremendous OTT.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Omar, if I understood your question, I think it was whether as part of our investment in Hulu
we had any individual or content licensing obligations or deals, and the answer is no. There's nothing in there
specifically, any particular content license. And so, that's the SVOD service. Now that means that of course we are and
we will continue to look at shows, or well and I guess you're asking about individual shows, where SVOD providers or
traditional providers come and want to license, whether it's Hulu, Netflix, et cetera, and we will do that on a standalone
arm's-length basis. If you go then, I think you asked this, to the MVPD, that we have an affiliation of our networks into
the bundle service, but that one, we can't really outline what their strategy and business plan is yet. I think they will be
responsible for that.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Okay. That make sense. So just as a follow-up maybe, Jeff, if you think about what you've said
before about licensing content potentially direct-to-consumer for the Turner networks, or more broadly across the
content that you control, how should we think about where Hulu fits into that? Is this now going to be central to your
strategy or you're going to continue to look at other ways to monetize your content, perhaps direct?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: I don't understand the – would you – so the Turner networks, which for example now are
available in a number – but they're all, you can get them and the shows-on-demand on every traditional distributor. You

can get them on every new virtual distributor of every single package size and price point. If you go to HBO, you can
get that through on-demand fully through every distributor basically in the world of any kind, and increasingly, you can
get it as a broadband delivered thing. So what is your question in relation to that?
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: So if you look at Hulu's service today, given your investment, do you see that as being central to
your strategy for distributing content to consumers? Or when you're looking at the over-the-top strategy? Or do you see
alternatives or other ways of distributing direct-to-consumer as well?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Well, we just spent the day here talking about how we think our networks, our brands and
our shows should be available in essentially as many places and ways for consumers to get them with VOD, et cetera,
as we can. And this is an additional way to do that. I don't -that's what we've been saying. So it adjoins all the other
distribution methods and that's a good thing.
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Okay. Okay.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Thanks
<Q - Omar Sheikh>: Okay. That's clear. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: Next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Hello. Thanks. I have a Turner question and maybe one more after Hulu. On Turner,
could you give us a little color on what you're doing in eSports, and how you think that business will grow over time?
And actually, one more on Turner. You mentioned that there was a sub decline, but it wasn't specified. Can you say
what it is?
<A - John K. Martin>: Sure, Jessica. It's John. On the sub decline, we're seeing continued subscriber declines in the
US at a similar rate as we've experienced in the most recent quarter. So call it approaching about 2%. Some networks a
little bit less, but no more really than, more than 2%. And all of the guidance that we've provided in terms of subscriber
revenue growth continues to assume the continuous level of those types of declines. Although, as I've been saying,
hopefully over time as these new virtual MVPDs get to the market with better, smaller packages of better networks
we'll be offering consumers different bundles at better price points and could and should result in the stabilization of
the subscriber overall levels.
With regard to eSports, which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and
excited about how we hosted the first-ever eSports tournament on television. We call it ELEAGUE, and across the
10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption. It's
brought millions of new viewers to the network. The age of the viewers of TBS are right down the strike zone of what
we were hoping for: young viewers, heavily skewing male.
We just announced an agreement with a new game, Overwatch. We're going to host that tournament beginning in the
fall, and we've announced the second tournament with Counter-Strike, which will air after that. So we love the fact that
we own this league in connection with WME and IMG. We think it's a huge area of secular growth. We absolutely
intend to participate in a big way in this area, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the first season proceeded.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: And, John, just a follow-up, which is the Hulu question. It's really for you, and kind
of what you said about growing with skinnier bundles. I heard what you said. You was very clear that, you said the
affiliates fees structure would be comparable to other deals. Can you talk a little bit about the advertising? In some
ways it may actually – it seems like it may be better because it's more targeted. Could you comment on that?

<A - John K. Martin>: Exactly. I think you asked the question, but it was more of a statement that I'll validate.
Everything that's happening at Hulu is moving in the same direction as to what we're doing on our traditional
ad-supported cable networks, which is trying to improve the consumer experience with less overall advertising, but
now we've got our Turner Data Cloud built out full capacity. We're going to have hundreds of, millions of records of
data by the end of this year, and one of the reasons why, again, we were so successful in the upfront is we think we're
leading the industry with products that can sell audiences rather than just demos and dayparts. So I think your statement
is completely accurate.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: We have time for one more question.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Doug Creutz>: Hey. Thanks. As you mentioned, you guys are having a pretty good year at Warner Bros.
Disney's having a pretty good year as well, but I think most of the rest of your peers are having a very difficult year. Do
you think there's been any change in audience behavior around the film industry? If so, how are you reacting to that?
And do you think that the studio business in general is in need of consolidation to fix some of these problems? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: I think what we're seeing is that the big franchises mean more than ever. If you look at the top
six films, they represent approximately 35% of the domestic box office. So when you think about what we laid out a
couple of years ago as the strategy, we thought that the slate needed to be kind of anchored by the big franchises like
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the DC movies and the Lego movies, and we're executing on that.
As it relates to whether we think that scale is required in that environment, I think that we're going to – we are one of
the few scale players on the film side, but even more importantly, we're one of the studios, one of the couple of studios
that have the big intellectual property that allows us to be able to anchor a slate like that. So if you think about
consolidation the way we think about it, I don't think you would need to see consolidation from players that don't have
intellectual property merging with other players that don't have intellectual property for scale, per se. What you really
need are the big franchises that are going to be able to drive the economics which is what we're seeing and kind of what
our strategy is based on.
<Q - Doug Creutz>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jessica L. Holscott>: So, Jeff, you might want to say a few words to wrap up.
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
All right. So just to wrap up, I hope you all feel the way we do. We're very pleased with our performance, we're
encouraged by industry developments and we think the company is very well positioned to bring the best content to
consumers in the way they want it. So that makes us excited about the future and we'd like to thank everybody for
joining.
