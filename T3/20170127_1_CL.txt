Investor Relations Officer.
On a reported basis, our net sales were down 4.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to foreign exchange and the
impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation. Organic sales were up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. The organic sales growth in
the quarter was driven by improvement in pricing, while volume excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of
Venezuela was down 1%. Pricing was up 2.5% in the quarter. Latin America was the driver of our organic sales growth
this quarter, posting continued volume growth, excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and strong
pricing.
In other regions, we saw headwinds in several of our markets, some of which were driven by one-time factors like
Indian demonetization and some distribution challenges in certain of our African businesses. We also did see a
slowdown in category growth later in the quarter in some markets.
For the year, reported net sales declined 5%, while our organic sales grew 4%, driven by a combination of pricing and
volume growth. For the full year, organic sales grew in every division, except Europe, which was flat. Excluding the
items specified in table eight of our press release, gross profit margin was up 180 basis points in the fourth quarter of
2016, versus fourth quarter of 2015, led by cost savings from our funding-the-growth initiative and our restructuring
program. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter 2016, from fourth
quarter 2015.
Excluding the items specified in table nine of our press release, our full year gross profit margin rose 160 basis points
to 60.3%. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit margin was up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period to 60.0%.
Excluding the items specified in tables eight and nine of our press release, our operating profit was up 2% in the quarter
and flat for the year. Operating profit on a GAAP basis was up significantly as we lapped the deconsolidation of our
Venezuelan operation.
Excluding the items in table eight of the press release, diluted earnings per share on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter
was $0.75, up 3% year-over-year. On a full year basis, diluted earnings per share on a dollar basis, excluding the items
in table nine of our press release was even with last year, but up double digits on a currency-neutral basis, after also
excluding Venezuela's results in both periods. On a GAAP basis, EPS was up 79% year-over-year, primarily due to the
impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela in fourth quarter 2015.
Through strong working capital performance, we continue to grow our free cash flow, further strengthening our balance
sheet. For 2016, our net cash provided by operations was up 7%. A year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as
our restructuring program is entering its final stages meant that free cash flow before dividends was up 13%
year-over-year. While the Q4 organic sales growth was lower than anticipated, we are optimistic that the pace of our
growth will improve as we progress through the year, driven by increased advertising support behind a full pipeline of
new products around the world.
From an EPS standpoint on a dollar basis, excluding charges from the 2012 restructuring program, and the other 2016
items specified in table nine of our press release, based on current spot rates, we are planning for growth in the low
single digits. The main drivers versus our previous expectations are foreign exchange, and slowing category growth in
several key markets. We expect free cash flow before dividends to be strong in 2017, reflecting solid operational results
and continued focus on working capital.
Now, we'll go through the performance in the divisions. First off, North America. North America net sales, unit
volume, pricing, foreign exchange and organic sales were all even with last year's fourth quarter. In the U.S., volume
growth in toothpaste was offset by declines in toothbrushes and liquid hand soap. In the quarter, we saw strong volume
growth for our Canadian business and for Tom's of Maine. Operating profit declined 3% in the quarter, as gross profit
margin expansion was more than offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.
A few North American highlights in the quarter. In the U.S., we finished the year with market shares either up or flat in
majority of our categories. Our innovation continues to perform well. We have a strong pipeline planned as we head
into 2017.

Our premiumization strategy continues to pay dividends. The Colgate Optic White franchise finished 2016 with 6.4%
market share year-to-date, up 80 basis points year-over-year. We expect further momentum in 2017 behind this month's
launch of Colgate Optic White Radiant. We are also seeing year-over-year improvement in market shares for our
sensitivity business, helped by our latest launch of Colgate Sensitive Smart White toothpaste.
Tom's of Maine also posted good growth in the quarter and the year. Year-to-date, Tom's toothpaste market share is up
20 basis points versus last year, driven by new products, particularly Rapid Relief Sensitive toothpaste.
Latin America finished the year strongly, with organic sales growth of 10.5% in the fourth quarter. Including the
impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and foreign exchange, net sales were down 10.5% for the quarter.
We remind you that we have now lapped the Venezuela deconsolidation, and 2017 numbers will not need to be
adjusted. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela, we saw volume growth of 1.5% in the quarter,
with growth in markets including Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina, partially offset by declines in Brazil. While
currency and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation resulted in a net sales decline in this division, productivity
from funding-the-growth, and pricing helped deliver 550 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. Thus,
operating profit grew in the quarter despite the net sales decline.
Some highlights in Latin America include, in Brazil, our toothpaste share is at 73% year-to-date, up one share point
year-over-year. We are seeing strong share growth in both Colgate Triple Action and Colgate Maximum Cavity
Protection.
In Mexico, we maintained toothpaste market leadership with an 81% share, behind strength in our Colgate Luminous
White brand, with market share performance improving sequentially as we finished the year. We remain encouraged by
the solid volume and organic sales performance of our Mexican business.
Latin America should continue to see benefits from a strong innovation calendar in the second half of 2016. In Personal
Care, we have seen multiple innovations across the Protex, Palmolive, Speed Stick, and Lady Speed Stick brands in the
third and fourth quarter.
Now moving to Europe. Europe's net sales and organic sales in the fourth quarter were down year-over-year, with sales
impacted by macroeconomic conditions, foreign exchange, and difficult retail dynamics. Organic sales were down
3.5% in the quarter, driven primarily by volume declines in France, where our categories slowed sharply in the quarter,
with the United Kingdom partially offsetting the decline.
Operating profit in Europe was down 5% in the quarter, driven by the net sales decline. Operating profit margin was up
70 basis points as a percentage of sales, driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses.
Our market share performance in Europe is solid. We continued our toothpaste share leadership at 35% of the market
and our premium-priced GABA business continues to grow share, up 40 basis points year-to-date in Europe. We have
seen regional share of market gains year-to-date in manual and battery toothbrushes, body wash, bar soap, body lotion,
and fabric softener. Our manual toothbrush share is up 170 basis points for 2016, driven by the premium-priced Colgate
Max White Toothbrush + Built-In Whitening Pen. In Q1, we have significant new product news in toothpaste, behind
the launch of Colgate Enamel Strength and our Colgate Natural Extracts toothpastes.
Now Asia Pacific. Organic sales declined minus 2% in Asia Pacific, with flat volume and negative pricing. Volume
growth across most of the division was offset by a decline in India, caused by the demonetization. The negative impact
of foreign exchange further contributed to the net sales decline of 4% in the quarter. Operating profit was up 3%
year-over-year. Operating profit margin was up 240 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by lower selling,
general and administrative expenses.
Some points on Asia Pacific include, as mentioned above, in India, demonetization caused us to swing from strong
growth through Q3 to a decline in Q4. Our recent launch of Colgate Cibaca Vedshakti continues to gain momentum in
the fast-growing natural space.

In Greater China, we still have work to do, but our organic sales growth improved sequentially and our volume was
positive for the quarter. Our online business is accelerating, offsetting most of the impact from a difficult offline
market.
Now Africa/Eurasia. Net sales in the region were down 1.5% in the quarter and organic sales declined 2%. Our
Africa/Eurasia business was negatively impacted by business disruptions with certain distributors, primarily due to
liquidity issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. Volume was down 12% in the quarter, driven by the Sub-Saharan Africa region
and South Africa. Pricing was up 10% and was positive across much of the region. Operating profit was down 4% in
the quarter. Strong gross profit margin improvement, driven by pricing and funding-the-growth, was offset by increased
advertising investment. Overall, our toothpaste market shares in Africa/Eurasia continue to trend positively with our
shares up year-to-date in the majority of our markets in the division.
Q4 highlights in Africa/Eurasia include, our toothpaste market share in Turkey continues to grow year-over-year,
driven by Colgate Total. Colgate Total brand market share is up 70 basis points year-to-date, driven by the Colgate
Total Pro line with share growth for Pro Breath Health and Pro White. And in Saudi Arabia, the second largest oral
care market in the region, our toothpaste market share is up 100 basis points year-to-date, driven by Colgate Maximum
Cavity Protection, Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief, and Colgate Total.
Now finishing up with Hill's. Q4 was a difficult quarter for Hill's due to challenges in the Pet Specialty channel.
Organic sales were flat in the quarter as growth in pricing was offset by volume declines. Net sales were up slightly and
included a benefit from slightly favorable currency. Operating profit grew 7%, primarily driven by gross profit margin
expansion, as funding-the-growth savings and increased pricing offset higher costs.
In the U.S., our strong growth in online and vet was more than offset by weakness in the Pet Specialty channel. We
continue to expand our online availability in the U.S., and our e-commerce growth in the quarter and the year was very
strong. We are also seeing significant growth in our online business in Europe, where e-commerce is an even bigger
piece of the Pet Food category. Developing market volumes were up nicely, driven by Hill's Prescription Diet,
Metabolic + Mobility and Metabolic + Urinary, Hill's Prescription Diet Derm Defense and Hill's Prescription Diet z/d.
So, that's it for the divisions. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Ian, who has some thoughts on our 2017
outlook. Ian?
Ian M. Cook
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone, and let me wish you all a happy and healthy 2017.
What I'd like to accomplish this morning is two things. Number one, reflect a little bit on 2016, and then talk more
specifically about our plans for 2017 in the context of the fourth quarter we have just completed.
I think it is safe to say that 2016 has been a year of growing uncertainty, filled with unpredictable and disruptive events,
especially in the fourth quarter, when we saw significant foreign exchange volatility following the U.S. elections, the
unexpected demonetization activity in India, and category slowdown in several of our key markets.
Against that, I would say, overall for 2016, we delivered solid performance overall. Top line organic sales growth, up
4%; broadly healthy market shares, as John has exampled in his remarks; good gross margin progress, up 160 basis
points to 60.3%; and at just over $3.1 billion, net operating cash flow up 7%.
As we move into 2017, I think it's safe to say that the uncertainty continues, and indeed there is likelihood of more
events unpredicted occurring as the year unfolds. So, how are we planning for 2017 in the context of how we ended
2016 and the fourth quarter? From a high level point of view, I think we feel confident that the strategy we have been
deploying for over a decade, a strategy that focuses on engaging with consumers, developing a steady stream of
innovation for those consumers, focusing on the efficiencies that allow us to fund our growth, and perhaps most
importantly, continuing to develop a cadre of talented leaders that we can deploy around the world to keep focusing on
winning on the ground.

Secondly, I would say that our discipline and focus on the fundamentals has served us well, and will continue to serve
us well. And my third point for 2017 would be that our overarching priority and objective is focused against growth.
So, coming back to the categories, as I mentioned, categories in several key markets slowed in the fourth quarter, and
we are now seeing growth in our categories across each of our major geographies that take the following shape. For
North America, we're seeing our categories grow around 2%. In Europe, we're seeing, in aggregate, categories basically
flat. And for our emerging markets, we continue to see category growth of mid-single digits clustered closely around
5%.
So, with that as a context of our consumers' behavior, the organic sales growth plan that we have for 2017 sees us
targeting the low end of our four-percentage point to seven-percentage point organic growth range. The growth we
deliver in 2017 is expected to rely on less pricing with a sharpened focus on profitable volume growth for the full year,
starting in quarter one. And from an organic sales point of view, we expect to see sequential improvement in quarter
one.
The innovation pipeline that John talked to remains as robust as ever. We continue to invest in the capabilities that we
need to serve new consumers in new places, think e-commerce, and as we said in the press release, strong advertising
support will be behind our brands and the innovation, and I will return to that in a short while.
Now, it's unusual for us to give country-specific data and detail, but I think, given the circumstances in the fourth
quarter, we feel it's important to a clear understanding of why we have confidence in the growth for 2017. So, let me
offer a few comments by each of the divisions related to the organic sales growth that we are targeting for 2017.
And let me start with Asia. As John said, the demonetization in India was, indeed, unexpected, and that saw a high
single-digit organic sales growth business become, in the quarter, a double-digit decline organic business. In fact,
excluding India, the division would have seen positive organic sales growth.
So, as we look forward into 2017 from that unexpected event, we were pleased in the fourth quarter with the sequential
progress we made in China and the return to volume growth. We expect that sequential progress to continue in China,
and we expect the recovery in India to build across the first half.
For Africa/Eurasia, the actions we took against a selected number of distributors are behind us, and the division would
have seen positive organic sales growth without those actions. And we expect to see positive progress in organic sales,
beginning in the first quarter in that division.
In Europe, the decline traces largely to France, and in France, we saw strong category declines in the fourth quarter,
both in volume and in value. And the subsidiary in France is developing stronger plans that are being put in place with
key customers to help drive category growth and our growth alongside the category.
In North America, we also saw a slowdown in the category growth rates and consumer consumption, and this was the
one division we saw increased promotional activity, which we are meeting in 2017.
For Hill's, as John said, we posted strong e-commerce progress. Indeed, our e-commerce growth in the United States
with Hill's was up some 60%. Our market share on e-commerce is higher than our brick-and-mortar share, and we
expect that growth, as we expand e-commerce distribution, to continue in 2017. But that was more than offset, though,
by the weakness in the Pet Specialty category, which, again, is being addressed by strengthened programs in
partnership with the principal retailers there and a focus, as John said, on channel mix. And finally, Latin America,
where we expect to see continued growth in 2017.
Now, I mentioned the strong innovation pipeline. I mentioned the capabilities that we are investing in to reach
consumers in new places. But, I would like to return to advertising and make a couple of comments. Number one, we
will continue with our focus on customer marketing activities in store that can and do build categories, and we are
deploying that, indeed, as we speak. But, turning to the traditional below-the-line advertising, in our 2017 plan, our
advertising is up, absolutely, and as a percent to sales. It's advertising that is increasingly digital and mobile, and we
have planned for continuity of advertising across the year.

The advertising will be behind the innovations that we have, the strong brand equities that we possess, India, for
example, Colgate was rated one more time the most trusted brand in the country. And we will also have advertising
focus behind the community programs that Colgate does in many countries, the turn off the tap type of advertising, the
scholarship program advertising, and advertising that relates to the schools programs that we have around the world.
These are all proven vehicles to build brand awareness, brand loyalty, and induce trial. And we are substantially
increasing our sampling in 2017 to further drive trial of the strong innovation we have.
Now for 2017, we are obsessive about protecting those investments. As you know, a sudden change in foreign
exchange can put pressure on short-term results, given the lead lag of actions to offset the impact of that foreign
exchange. We are not going to reduce our investment in advertising to deliver a quarterly number. What we are going
to do is to focus relentlessly across all lines of the income statement on productivity.
Our funding-the-growth program is as vibrant as ever, and will receive sharp focus. As John said, we will redouble our
efforts behind structural cost reduction in this last year of our Global Growth and Efficiency Program, and we will,
from a category, a product, and indeed, a channel mix perspective, focus on the premiumization that can be delivered
with the consumer. And from a material cost point of view, the environment is relatively benign in 2017 with material
costs estimated to be flat to modestly up, with a little bit of pressure in fats and oils, but a relatively muted landscape.
So, with that focus, and with that landscape, we expect our gross margin to be up at the high end of our 75-basis point
to 125-basis point range.
Tax rate for 2017 is assumed to be in the 31% to 32% range. Obviously, any changes to tax policy from the new
administration is not included in that estimate. We have obviously run many different scenarios, we are as informed on
the matter as you are, and obviously, if anything firm arises, we will inform you. I think – I would say that we are
certainly looking at tax holistically, all the different tax policies that may be adopted, and if one views it holistically,
we would expect it to be a net benefit, but again, our current tax rate of 31% to 32% does not include any assumed
benefit.
So, to summarize, our plan will see us growing at the low end of our 4% to 7% organic sales range, with sequential
improvement beginning in quarter one. For 2017, it's growth with less pricing and a sharper focus on profitable volume
growth. It's growth supported by innovation. It's growth supported by investment in capability. And it's growth
supported by advertising that is up absolutely and as a percent to sales and planned for continuity. And of course, we
have the clear focus on the ground plans and executional discipline to help accelerate that growth. And that is our
primary focus in 2017.
Gross margin, as I said, at the high end of our 75-basis point to 125-basis point range. Strong net operating cash flow
expected, and as you have seen in the release, earnings per share of low single digits in dollar terms, and an absolute
focus by folk in our company on delivering the growth across 2017.
So, those were my prepared remarks, and now we'd be delighted to open the call to questions. Hello?

<Q - Caroline Levy>: Thank you very much. Could you just quickly tell us what your thinking is on the currency hit
to EBIT and earnings? And then as I always do ask, Ian, if you could talk a little bit about the climate in China and
Brazil, those two countries, which seems to – Brazil seems to have deteriorated meaningfully for the first time for you.
China, the bricks-and-mortar business maybe has deteriorated as well. So, if you could just touch on those two that
would be great.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, I think the foreign exchange, from a forex point of view, we're now estimating at about 3%.
Obviously, the bottom line impact is more, so the change from the guidance we provided – preliminary guidance we
provided before entering our budgeting process is really composed of two factors. One is the foreign exchange, and the
second is based on the assumptions I just went through, the fact that we have recognized slower market growth into our
planning for next year.
Turning to China and Brazil, I would say two separate cases. Brazil is indeed in challenging economic times. As John
said, overall in Latin America, we have been very pleased with our performance. We note that several companies have
been negative on Brazil. I think our view would be our market shares continue to be strong in that country, and indeed
growing, as John said. We have taken pricing necessary to offset foreign exchange in part, and we have seen some
slowdown in category growth, with negative volume from time to time. So, we're just going to keep focusing on
growing our market shares in Brazil, and overall in Latin America, expect a healthy business there to continue.
Regarding China, again, we were pleased that the full quarter saw us make sequential improvement, which had been
our plan. We were particularly pleased to see volume growth come back positive. Our market shares are holding well.
You are correct that our e-commerce business has loads of potential. We grew dramatically in China. We have a
completely standalone team that focuses on driving that business in China. But we do have opportunity to increase our
market share further, because in China, our market share is not in line with our brick-and-mortar share yet on
e-commerce, so that gives us plenty of opportunity to grow.
So, we remain, I must say overall, very committed to the emerging markets. We see a strong consumer base there. We
have strong brand loyalty there, and we continue to see good opportunity for growth there.
<Q - Caroline Levy>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll go next to Wendy Nicholson of Citi.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, good morning. My first sort of question is really just a follow-up. I mean, when you
talked to us in late October, it didn't sound like the world was falling off a cliff as much as it clearly did for your
business. And other than the India demonetization, which is an extraordinary event, I'm surprised things all decelerated
as fast as they did.
So, I guess my first question is, with your guidance to planning to see sequential improvement in 2017, what's your
confidence where we sit here end of January that the first quarter will in fact show an improvement from the 1.5%?
And then kind of tacked on to that, and sorry for the long question, but Colgate has long had this 4% to 7% organic
growth target, and you haven't been there for a while, and I'm just wondering if it's time to look at that, reset that, at
least take the maybe 6% and 7% part of that guidance off the table. And if you were to do that, would you be able to
take another hard look at your cost structure and maybe have another restructuring program? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good. Well, thanks for the question, Wendy. Yes, we feel confident in sequential improvement,
which is why we say it and why we went through the divisions making the comments we have made. And you are right.
There were a collection of events that impacted us in the fourth quarter. One has to say that the foreign exchange aspect
of things was a surprise to most. Surely, the India demonetization was a surprise. But what gives us confidence are the
reasons I have laid out in my prepared remarks, in terms of we understood what needed to be addressed, we are in the
process of addressing them. And therefore, the plan we have is precisely that, one that sees us sequentially improving in
the first quarter, and sees us driving for growth at the low end of that 4% to 7% range.

Another restructuring, Wendy, I think the way I would rather come at that is, I understand the intensity behind the
language when we say that we are going to be relentless in driving the last year of our current restructuring program,
which clearly focuses on structural cost and, as again we have said, in a world that is slowing even more than it has. So,
we recognize the challenge and we are being, and will continue to be, relentless on taking advantage of the opportunity
of this last year of a restructuring program to address that structural cost.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And when you think about what happened in the fourth quarter, sort of the zigs and zags,
I mean, one of the markets that I think is most interesting to me is France. Not that it's all that large or whatnot, but it
strikes me as a very stable market generally, and for it to turn negative in terms of category growth surprises me. And I
just wonder, maybe I'm forgetting history and developed markets have always been so economically sensitive when it
comes to toothpaste, but can you make any comments on that, whether that is oh, yeah, not a surprise, or, oh, yeah,
that's kind of something new and different that we haven't seen before?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, clearly, France categories turning negative was not a pleasant or expected event. I think
there is public information out there that says that some retailers in France have suffered from the same problem, which
is to say consumer purchasing weakness in France. So, you're certainly seeing deflation in France, and indeed in some
categories, volume reduction. So the focus has to be to right that with your customer partners on two things. Number
one is innovation that is price accretive so that you can grow the category value, and hopefully the volume, and the
brand marketing and in-store customer marketing to drive consumption at the retail level. So, the sharpness of the
slowdown was a surprise.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Got it. Thank you.

We'll go next to Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Wonderful.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: It sounds like guidance for 2017 assumes a lower level of pricing growth. I'm just trying
to get a sense, are you expecting a significant change in pricing? Obviously, you mentioned North America, but are
there any issues with price gaps in other regions? And are we talking more about tweaks to promotional levels or could
there be list price changes?
And then the second part of that is you also mentioned higher marketing spending in 2017. How comfortable are you
that you will get a tangible top line payback from the higher marketing, as well as the incremental promotion, given it
seems like from an industry perspective, the volume payback in those areas is less than it's been historically recently?
Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, okay, Dara. So on pricing, when we talk SPI, selling price increases, we simply have in our
plan, less pricing, because commodity pressures are more benign, and transaction impacts have lessened. A large part
of our pricing is indeed carryover pricing from year-to-year.
When you talk promotion, and tweaking promotional levels, that has been, for us, largely North America, where we did
see stepped up promotional activity in the fourth quarter. And we have made some pricing gap adjustments in China on
our business, which has returned us to the volume growth, which we plan to build on in 2017. But beyond that, I would
offer no broad scale observation.
On marketing spend, again, the focus here is growth. We have, like everybody else, return on investment models. I
think when you talk about in-store activity, or shopper marketing, if you will, you are talking more about what can you

do to induce purchase of higher-priced products with less reliance on price at retail. So, I think that needs to be the
focus, rather than diminishing return.
And on the advertising side of things, given the strength of our advertising, of our brands, and given the strength of our
innovation, we see that as a very good return, particularly with the effectiveness of advertising that I tried to allude to
earlier, and the continuity of advertising over time. And of course, from an e-commerce point of view, that has very
good return. And from a digital marketing point of view, that has very good return as well.
So, we're quite comfortable with the return side of things. I think what one has to try and guard against is a devolution
into zero-sum promotion pricing, so we're reacting where we need to, but it's certainly not something we're looking to
lead.

We'll go next to Stephen Powers of UBS.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Great, thanks. First, just a follow-up on France. I know you cited the category slowdowns
in that market. But at least in toothpaste, according to the Nielsen data that I'm looking at, the issues appear more
company specific than category. I think Nielsen has Colgate volumes down 30% December period, relative to flat for
the category, with Unilever, Glaxo and Henkel the beneficiaries. So, just some more commentary on that would be
great.
And then if I could tack on a forward-looking question. I know John cited category decelerations and FX really
explaining the lower EPS outlook, but I was somewhat surprised not to hear elevated competition in that algorithm as
well. So, just any thoughts there would be appreciated, because your gross margin outlook doesn't imply significant
competitive pressure either. So again, just your outlook on the competitive pressure and has it changed at all since your
October outlook? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. First, let's start with the comment on France. And I was trying to be, shall we say,
broad-based in my remarks earlier. The fact of the matter is, we have had an issue with a retailer in the French
environment, which is resolved, and will see us back where we were before in the first half of the year. So, that's the
specificity to the Colgate aspect of France. But it takes nothing away from the fact that on the other categories, the
category declines were sharp and meaningful. But on the Colgate brand specifically, there was a customer issue, which
has now been addressed in a mutually acceptable fashion, and we'll see business trading return to normal in the first
half of this year.
Now, as regards competitive pressure, the one that we have spelled out is, frankly, the only one that we see beyond
what has been normative in our markets, and that is in North America and that is one that we have stepped up to
address within our planning guidelines for 2017.

We'll go next to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So, I guess the stock reaction would suggest that there is still a debate about what were you saying,
and kind of belief in acceleration. And what I'm really hearing from investors, just to build on some of the previous
questions, is that investors really want to understand and disaggregate your top line organic slowdown and then the
expected acceleration further than we have done so far. So, just to get under that a little bit, can you tell us kind of what
your, it doesn't have to be a precise number, right, but what percentage of the deceleration category and yours would
you attribute to macro versus kind of one time, like in France, versus competition?
And if you say the bulk is not competition, like I think you did to Steve's question a second ago, I would want to note
that the list of countries you're losing share in has grown. So, Mexico, India, China, France, U.K. now, over the years
has definitely grown. And as you look forward, what you are expecting to change from either macro competition or one
time, to see the top line acceleration, or is it really just your own activities to improve and get the acceleration?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, I mean, disaggregating all of that, I mean particularly the competitive activity piece, is
almost impossible. And in fact, we don't break it down that way. So, the largest change that shapes our top line
projection for 2017 was the reduction in category growth, the lessening in category growth that we are seeing, that we
have simply re-planned against. And we see our top line growing for the reasons I have said. When you come to the
competitive activities, the kind of shares you are talking about, I mean, take Mexico, which I think John talked to, our
share is about 81%, and in the prior year it was just over 81%. That's on a value basis.
Our market shares, in general, Ali, if you go through them, if there are slippages, they are quite modest slippages, and
they are not accelerating in any way, with the exception of the French matter on Colgate that I just described. So, I
mean, what we think will build our business is innovation, is the advertising that we are committing to, including the
in-store advertising, but with a commitment to the brand advertising in the manner that I have described. A focus on the
fundamentals at retail, and I think from a competitive activity point of view, we will be responsive when we need to be
responsive from a competitor point of view, but we don't want to do it in a zero-sum game fashion.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So, that's helpful. Thank you. The reason I'm – well, maybe what's behind kind of the question,
when I scratch my head a little bit, is that you have usually been able to leverage even the lower end of the 4% to 7%
organic sales growth target that you have been delivering. To Wendy's question, over the past few years you're at the
lower end of that, into double-digit EPS growth, ex-currencies. But, for 2017, it certainly doesn't seem like that is
something you are able to do, suggesting you are going to have to spend more back. And I'm trying to get underneath
that in terms of, look, you're not going to get double-digit EPS growth for this year, but your top line is roughly, you
are saying, what it's going to be what it has been.
So, you are spending more back, why, right? So, is it that you're feeling Yunnan Baiyao in China being more
aggressive or Procter or potentially whoever, have you lost a little bit of the mojo? Like, why are you spending more
back if it's not competition, I guess, is what I'm trying to get at.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I guess the answer would be, and I think what we're beginning to see through this earnings cycle,
is that growth in many places has indeed slowed further. And so, what we're saying is what is a reasonable growth

objective in uncertain times and how do we ensure that we build our brands to deliver that growth at this unique point
in time? And so, we are saying, I mean, I think the gross margin expansion is quite strong. I think from a top line point
of view, organic sales growth at the low end of our range will certainly put us in a good comparator group. And the
focus on the restructuring that I mentioned earlier, and further driving down our structural cost, will equip us to be
leaner going forward, if this rate of growth in the world does not reaccelerate.
And so, I'm saying, we're saying, that we think it is right, at this point in time, to overweight focus on growth, but it is
growth of our businesses at a time when, sure, all competitors are looking to do the same thing in a slowing world.
Everyone is still looking to grow.
So, from the big picture point of view, it's always a competitive environment. What I'm trying to delineate against is,
we believe in the quality of our innovation to drive our business against competitors. When I talk promotion, it's more
in-store pricing promotion, which we would rather put against trial for new innovation, but we will be competitive
where we need to be competitive. And I think that's the year we're looking at.

We'll go next to Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yes, thanks and good morning. Ian, the question is on the category growth. So, can you give any
context or clarity on exactly what's driving some of the [ph] down-drops (51:41) in the category growth? Is this trade
down, is this frequency, is it inventory outside of, obviously, what you talked about with South Africa? Any context
around that would be really helpful.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, I think there are a few elements to this. And it's not a generalized statement for the world.
Obviously, there is in some part of the world, particularly Europe, deflation as pricing comes down to stimulate volume
in some categories. We have seen that for several years and that remains unabated. From a consumer behavior point of
view, they don't go away from the behavior of brushing their teeth. They will exhaust pantry inventory, so, which is to
say, if people have more than one tube of toothpaste at home, they may try and stretch that tube before they reload their
own pantry.
There is, as we have seen, a sort of a subtle inventory correlation to a slowdown in categories. So, these are all
component factors. I mean, as you know from the Kantar study, Colgate is in 2/3 of the households on the planet, and
we are very disciplined and very focused on making sure our in-home penetration stays at elevated level. So, if there is
any short-term slowdown from a volume point of view due to pantry destocking and the like, that will bounce back
afterwards. So, I wouldn't point to anything, Nik, that says there is an underlying behavioral change here that is of
concern.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: It's foreign exchange, Bill. I mean, the two principal elements are – now this is against the
preliminary guidance we gave in October to where we are now. So, it is simply the foreign exchange and the lower
category growth, which is reflected in our growth target for the year. It's those two things.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. I thought before you were at 10% local currency growth, and it seems like the implied
guidance now is 5% local currency growth. Am I incorrect?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Oh, no, no. Sorry, I was misunderstanding. No, no, no. The implied currency guidance is 5%, and
that is structurally driven by the income statement. I mean, the growth we have, the margin expansion, and the
investment we choose to make behind the business.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. But was it not 10% before? Am I off? I thought it was like you thought 10% local currency
was the right number and now it's 5%.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, it was 10% in 2016. We guided in October to 10%. Actually, at that time, that was in dollars.
So, what we're tracking against is that October guidance to where we are now. And we're saying that the two
differences are foreign exchange and volume.

We'll take our next question from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Got it. Thanks. So, around advertising, can you talk about sort of order of magnitude on the
advertising margin change? Because, is your view to get back to sort of a historical level that's about 100 basis points
higher as a percentage of sales than where you sit now? Because assuming there isn't something really different below
the line, it would seem to suggest a fairly big move upwards in operating expense to get to your outlook, your EPS
outlook. And then on the other hand, if it turns out that you need to spend more to drive top line improvement, how
willing are you to do that if it does end up impacting EPS?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think for 2017, we have stepped up our advertising quite meaningfully from 2016, and we
believe in an uncertain time with clearly slowing category growth, with the innovation pipeline we have, it is to our
advantage in 2017 to invest that advertising, deliver that growth and keep consumers with our brands. So, we think it's
a good level, Olivia. I mean, we have planned it diligently and we're very satisfied with the advertising level we have.
As I said, it includes a sharp uptick in sampling as well, and these are all linked to the programs that we have on the
ground behind our brands and the new products that we have. So, we think the plan holistically is an appropriate plan
for 2017.

<Q - Jonathan Feeney>: Good morning. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First, on Hill's, we've been
doing some work around the channel, and it looks as if, we've been hearing anyway that at least one of your brands has
been delisted in one, maybe both of the major specialty channels, but also hearing that there's some innovation in the
pipeline potentially. So, any comment you could make around the Hill's business as it relates to new products or just
the progress there, I would appreciate it.
Secondly, in India, I know great business for you historically. You mentioned the behavior doesn't really change,
there's quite a bit of inventory in anybody's pantry of Colgate product. Does this mean that you get a restock in India
and you get better performance at some point in the next six months? Thank you very much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: On your second point, I'd love to think so, Jonathan, but I wouldn't count on it. The focus we have
in India right now is simply rebuilding the pipeline over the first half of the year. If we get a rebound, then wonderful.

On Hill's, let me sort of paint a broader context here. The strategic decision that we have taken, based on consumer
behavior, is to keep our brands speciality, which is obviously a brick-and-mortar channel, and go where our consumers
are going, and our consumers are going e-commerce. And they are going to the traditional places you would expect, the
Amazons and the Chewys of this world, and their rate of adoption of buying our products on e-commerce is very
elevated. So, we are moving there.
The brick-and-mortar retailers, the two principal pet speciality retailers, we have not been delisted from either retailer.
We have good plans with one and we are in discussion with the other. And the one short-term difficulty we have with
the second retailer is that our shelf location and the number of SKUs we have in the store have been both reduced and
moved to another position. And we believe that we can together develop a win-win solution for that to rebuild the
business in the brick-and-mortar at the same time as we're driving it online.
And on Hill's innovation, we have considerable innovation in Hill's. For confidentiality reasons, I prefer not to talk
about it. But that's the story on Hill's in the U.S., Jon.

We'll go next to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Two things, one was just on the – two and a half things. The conversation around
category growth, Ian, it was great when you walked through kind of your outlook by broad region. But I'm not sure
what the change is. Like, U.S. at 2%, Europe at flattish, and emerging markets at 5%, kind of feels like where we've
been. So, I'm just curious what's changed.
Second thing was on the build from kind of a double-digit in dollars to low single digits in dollars for EPS being FX
and volume, it feels to me like isn't it more pricing? Because I'm hard pressed to think that you were previously
forecasting volume growth as 6% and now it's 4%, given you said it's going to be more volume than price weighted.
So, is it your outlook on pricing perhaps that's changed more than volume?
And then finally, just SG&A was actually up quite a bit, and I was just curious – as a percentage of sales, sorry, given
your commentary on focus on restructuring and taking cost out, was there anything particular in the quarter on SG&A
to be mindful of? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. So, on the category growth, yes, it has changed, actually, Lauren. In the U.S., we were
seeing 2% to 3%, and you may remember me commenting that I was getting wildly exuberant that it was moving to
3%. So, that has now come down by a percentage point. Europe was always flat to modestly up. The range of Europe is
now negative to modestly up, therefore, flat overall. And in the emerging markets, whilst I used to talk mid-single
digits, the reason I talked 5% now is mid-single included a number with a six in front of it, and that is now off the table.
So, those shifts are real, and that is what is built into our planning. So, if I go back on your second point, if I go back to
our planning, indeed, it is all volume, because pricing is, más o menos, more or less at the same level we had in the
original plan, slightly higher in fact. So, it's all volume.
And then finally your point on SG&A, yes, that's dollar leverage – or deleverage, rather. Actually, our dollar overhead
is down, but with the impact on the top line and the amount of dollar denominated [ph] overhead (63:25) we have, we
don't benefit from a ratio basis, which is why we talked about relentlessly focusing on our cost structure in this last year
of the restructuring. I think those were your three questions.

We'll go next to Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: Okay, thanks. I'll just make this really quick. I guess, first, just in terms of the reacceleration on
the volume, can you maybe talk a little bit about how excited you are about some of the innovation coming out? I know
there's innovation every year, but certainly with this 1.5% volume you did in the third quarter, put aside the challenges
of the fourth quarter, but sounds like you are getting back to a 3% range. How much of this can you contribute to really
the innovation, the step up in innovation? What's coming out with obviously, giving away any trade secrets?
And then the second question just on pricing being just a small contributor this year, can you just talk maybe about
where you are still taking pricing? I know a lot of it is rollover from last year, maybe how we should think about Latin
America contributing, versus where you're still going to have price investments, such as Europe? So, obviously the two
will offset each other to some degree. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, the trouble is, Jason, if I was to display enthusiasm, you wouldn't notice the difference. So,
in terms of volume acceleration, reacceleration, part of it is building back from those one-time events that we
mentioned, so that is an important part of it. And the strengthened plans we have in place as I detailed earlier. And
innovation is a strong part of it. We tend to be fairly low-key in terms of talking about innovation and I plan to continue
that tradition. But John mentioned some. I would just say we have a broad array of good innovation, and we will be
driving that, starting in the first quarter across the year. But I wouldn't lay innovation as the outsized re-accelerator of
growth in the first quarter. It will be a part of it, but it certainly won't be all of it.
And on pricing, I mean, I think the way you should think about it is that in the main, much of our pricing has been to
offset the transaction impact of foreign exchange, and therefore, you can assume that the pricing taken or being
deployed now is in regions that face those kind of challenges. But I repeat, our focus for 2017 is on growth, and our
focus within growth is on profitable volume growth.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Sure.
Operator
We'll go next to Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley.
<A - Linda B. Weiser>: Yes, thanks. I just had a question also on the Pet Care area. Can you just explain why the
e-commerce penetration is higher in Europe? Is it just that the bricks-and-mortar is less developed there, or is there an
actual difference in how consumers are approaching the market? And then secondly, can you explain, does the trend
towards premiumization, is it disconnected from the general economic strength and high consumer confidence like in
the U.S. in Pet Care? Or is it actually linked to it? So as the economy strengthens, it is actually easier to get
premiumization or to get consumers interested in spending more on their pets in the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, frankly, Europe, and I don't mean anything political by this, Europe is a smaller geography
than the U.S., and more urbanized. And when you think of the literal volume of those bags, the convenience factor for
e-commerce in Europe is much higher for the consumer. And that is a big driver of why the adoption for bulky products
is so high. And premiumization, look, people pay for value, and what they perceive as value is not just price. And
therefore, and we have said this before, the reason our focus is on innovation is to create value that the consumer
believes is good value, even if the price is a premium price to what he or she may otherwise buy.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Oh, hi, Stephanie.
<Q - Stephanie Benjamin>: Just a quick question. Do you really expect any impact to your Pet Veterinary business
from the recent Mars acquisition of VCA? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think the short answer is no. You may know that Mars also own another group called Banfield.
We have very strong shares in both VCA and Banfield with our Hill's business. Mars have said that they have owned
Banfield for coming on a decade. Mars have said they will let VCA run as an independent group. And you should know
for VCA, Pet Nutrition products are about 5% of their sales. So, that's not really their business. So, the headline answer
would be no.

We'll go next to Mark Astrachan of Stifel.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: Yes, thanks, and good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask about growth by category, sort of in a
different way versus what we were talking about from a country standpoint. Anything notable specific to Home Care,
Personal Care, Oral Care, in terms of your own expectations, and perhaps, even sort of how you are thinking about that
now, versus maybe three months ago, two months ago, six months ago?
And then just quickly on something different, the expectations for spend in EPS, how are you thinking about the
assumptions for category and competition, meaning your expectations for the increased ad spend, absolute and percent
of sales, does that assume that competition is greater than equal, less than where you ended 2016 would be helpful.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, in terms of your spending question, I mean, that's a very complicated question. We build
spend based on what we see by market from competitors. Now these days you don't see everything, because some of
the online spending is not tracked, so there's an estimated component of it. And so, you structure the spend to be
adequately competitive. I'm now talking the traditional advertising spend. And as I have said, we plan it then to be
continuous for the year, behind innovation, behind the brand, and sometimes behind our community programs. Where
you see the greatest short-term changes, and I commented on North America, is more in promotion than in the
traditional advertising. So, we have built a plan for 2017 that we think is adequately competitive and strong enough to
drive the innovation we have and the brand equities that we have around the world.
Now, when you get into categories, we have a very clear strategic view, which doesn't change, depending on what
happens in a quarter. So, our strategic view is that we focus in order of priority behind Oral Care, Pet Nutrition,
Personal Care, and Home Care, in that order. That has been our focus because of the continuing underlying growth
rates of the categories, even if they have slowed, and because of the margin profile of each of the businesses. So, our
category decisions strategically are informed by the categories, not by quarterly events.

We'll go next to Jason English of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Happy Friday to you. Quick question on the Africa/Eurasia distributor stuff that you had to work
through. I apologize if I missed it in prepared remarks, but I don't think I've heard a lot of detail. Can you walk us
through what happened there? And then the second question is on capital allocation. Your share repurchase activity was
a bit less – a bit more subdued this past year. You're sitting on more cash than you usually end the year with. Organic
growth is clearly a little harder to come by. How is all of that impacting your thought process behind capital allocation
moving forward?

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, you did miss some comments, Jason, but let me talk again about Africa/Eurasia. It was
distributor issues with a select number, small number of distributors. It had to do with cash liquidity because of foreign
exchange moves, and it saw us moving business away from distributors, and indeed, bringing back some inventory. I
guess, the telling point that we made in our prepared remarks was that the division growth would have been positive
from an organic sales point of view without that event, and that we expect organic sales progress to recommence in the
first quarter of 2017. Relative to capital allocation, our current thinking going into the year is that our share repurchase
will be broadly in line with the share repurchases we made in 2016.

And at this time, we have no further questions.
Ian M. Cook
Okay. Well, good afternoon to everyone, and to any of the Colgate people listening, we're in the first quarter. Thank
you.
