Let me now turn the call over to Howard. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Q2 of fiscal 2015 was a stunning quarter for Starbucks on
almost every level. Record Q2 revenues of $4.6 billion, record Q2 operating income of $778 million and record split
adjusted Q2 EPS of $0.33 per share, all clearly demonstrating a continuation of the strength, momentum and robustness
we saw in our business during holiday Q1. Equally impressive is that our Q2 results were delivered despite foreign
exchange headwinds and soft consumer environments in several key markets.
Our global comp store sales increased a strong 7% in Q2, with 3% coming from increased traffic. Our 21st consecutive
quarter of comp sales growth of 5% or greater in a spectacular result given that our comps are now calculated off of a
U.S. store base of over 7,000 stores and a global store base of over 10,000 stores. No other global retailer approaching
our size or store base comes remotely close to posting such consistently strong comp performance.
Our Americas segment delivered another outstanding quarter with performance driven by the successful introduction of
several innovative new coffee beverages including Starbucks Flat White, our new Tiramisu and Caramel Flan beverage
and expanded selection of Teavana branded tea beverages and very positive customer response to our new breakfast
sandwich lineup, all of which contributed to increased food attach across virtually all regions and day parts.
Turning to China and Asia Pacific, now with over 5,000 stores, our China-Asia Pacific segment delivered a
company-leading 12% comp increase in Q2, almost entirely coming from increased traffic and a strong increase in
operating income as well. We also completed the acquisition of Starbucks Japan in Q2 and are now in a position to
aggressively go after business across all channels in Japan, both in and outside of our stores in ways never before
possible. And we are already seeing an acceleration of our business in that key, highly opportunistic market.
CAP remains a focal point of our future growth and we are on track to meet our goal of doubling our CAP store count
to roughly 10,000 locations, tripling our revenue to over $3 billion and tripling our operating income to over $1 billion
over the next five years. In addition, I'm proud to say that EMEA delivered the strongest Q2 performance in its history,
reporting both record operating margins and record operating income. And our Channel Development segment also
delivered a banner quarter with a 16% increase in sales and strong increases in both operating margin and operating
income, while at the same time, further increasing Starbucks' already industry-leading share of premium single-serve,
premium packaged coffee and premium packaged tea.
Starbucks, by a wide margin, is the number one premium coffee brand in the K-Cup category and we now have shipped
over 2.5 million K-Cup packs since launch.
Starbucks' stellar performance in Q2 was multi-segment, multichannel and multi-geographical, driven by our people in
distinct markets all over the world, yet woven together by a common thread, industry-leading partner-centric and
customer facing innovation and the ongoing strength and global relevancy of the Starbucks brands and retail
experience. Our history and experience demonstrate and our research unequivocally confirms that the investments we

make in deepening our connection to our people links directly back to value creation for our shareholders.
By offering every eligible partner the ability to profit alongside our shareholders through Bean Stock, providing paid
healthcare coverage, providing competitive wages and incentive compensation opportunities, reimbursing college
tuition costs through Starbucks College Achievement Plan, sharing and advancing our common values and investing in
the communities in which our people live and work, we are and will continue to make significant investments in our
people around the world. And these investments are bearing fruit for our shareholders. You'll hear more about that, and
about our additional partner investments that we are making in a few moments.
On today's call, I'm going to provide you with an overview of some of the innovations and strategic initiatives that we
announced or that we began to shape in the quarter. Innovations and initiatives that will enable us to further extend
Starbucks Global Coffee Authority and leadership around all things retail and mobile and position us to continue to
lead and to win around the world into the future. Then I'll turn the call over to Kevin, who will share highlights of
individual segment and market performance in Q2. And finally, Scott will take you through our Q2 financial and
operating results and we'll finish up with Q&A.
Leadership around all things coffee remains at our core and we continue to innovate and invest in order to meaningfully
elevate the premium, highly differentiated, locally relevant coffee experience we deliver to over 75 million customers
from over 22,000 stores in 66 countries around the world each week. Starbucks Flat White, an espresso-forward
handcrafted beverage that combines premium espresso quality with creative artistry into a delicious hot beverage that
we introduced into the Americas segment early in Q2 has already generated a strong customer following and is driving
a food attach exceeding our original expectations.
On the heels of the success of Flat White, we also introduced both Starbucks Cold Brew and in certain markets,
yogurt-based fruit smoothies incorporating and leveraging branded Evolution Fresh juices. While in the early days,
each of these beverages is receiving a highly favorable customer response and we will be rolling out a fantastic lineup
of innovative new Frappuccino beverages and branded Teavana iced teas for our customers during our hot summer
months ahead.
You may recall that in our holiday Q1, we recorded record-setting Card sales and loads, of $1.6 billion that we
expected to drive traffic and positively impact our business in Q2, and that is precisely what occurred. More important
is that we are now seeing large numbers of last holiday's first time gift receivers become loyal, engaged, repeat
Starbucks customers, supporting and contributing to the growth we're seeing across our global customer base. And with
increasing customer acceptance of our mobile app, we now have over 16 million active users. Dollars loaded on
Starbucks Card continues to rise. This is a really important number. At 19% year-over-year increase in Q2 alone, in
which $1.1 billion in Q2 was loaded, a trend and a figure that bodes very well for our business in coming quarters.
We know that increased Starbucks Card sales drives increased My Starbucks Rewards membership and in turn increase
traffic and sales in our stores. We added 1.3 million new My Starbucks Reward (sic) [Rewards] (9:31) members alone
in Q2, more additional members in one quarter than most loyalty programs have in total and now have over 10 million
active members with almost 6 million members being active Gold members. My Starbucks Rewards will continue to be
among our most important business drivers as new members contribute not only to short-term increases in revenue and
profit, but also to long-term loyalty for many years to come.
In December, we introduced Mobile Order & Pay into 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. Since then we have expanded
Mobile Order & Pay to over 600 stores in the Pacific Northwest and we are now on track to roll out Mobile Order &
Pay nationwide this calendar year. Mobile Order & Pay has been extremely well received by our customers, enabling
them to order ahead, avoid lines, avoid waiting for orders to be filled resulting in shorter lines, faster service, improved
more efficient in-store operations and execution and an elevated Starbucks experience.
And Mobile Order & Pay is driving incrementality as we are seeing an increase in both attach and daily transactions in
those stores and markets where Mobile Order & Pay has been launched. In addition, as we've shared with you before,
we are on plan to launch delivery in Seattle and in the Empire State Building in New York City during the second half
of 2015. There's no doubt in our minds that delivery, like Mobile Order & Pay, will drive further incrementality and

profitability for the company.
Many of you had the opportunity to experience the world's most premium coffee experience for yourselves when you
were in Seattle for our Investor Day last December and visited the one of a kind 15,000 square foot of Starbucks
Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, what many have called the Willy Wonka of coffee. We fully anticipated the
Roastery would be a success and that we would build additional Roasteries in select U.S. and international cities in the
years ahead. But no one could have reasonably have anticipated the overwhelming customer and visitor response that
the Roastery is generating in only the first four months of its operations. Look for our second Starbucks Reserve
Roastery and Tasting Room in calendar 2016 in a city to be announced later this year.
And while the Roastery is an immersive experiential venue, it's actually so much more. Our intent with the Roastery
from day one was to create and build a new ultra premium coffee brand and business unit. The additional small-batch
coffee roasting capacity provided by the Roastery is enabling us to source, roast, blend and market spectacular, limited
availability micro-lot coffees from around the world and to meaningfully elevate the super premium coffee experience
we deliver to our customers. We're already expanding availability of Starbucks Reserve coffees to over 1,000 Starbucks
locations as we begin to build the Starbucks Reserve brand.
And the Roastery is enabling the launch of 500 Starbucks Reserve stores worldwide, a new class of stores that will
showcase the most premium of all super premium coffees in the world and the newest coffee brewing method such as
Pour-Over, Siphon and Starbucks proprietary brewing technology, Clover. Starbucks Reserve stores will also
incorporate an integrated Teavana kiosk to leverage traffic and growing consumer interest in super-premium loose leaf
and packaged Teavana teas.
Starbucks Reserve stores and Starbucks Reserve brand provides us with an exciting innovative, highly differentiated
new global growth opportunity that leverages all of Starbucks' strengths around the world in terms of coffee sourcing
and roasting, [indiscernible] (13:25), coffee beverage development, retail site selection and design, merchandizing and
customer engagement. Watch for the opening of our new Starbucks Reserve flagship store towards the end of calendar
2015 and the opening of Starbucks Reserve coffee bars within select existing Starbucks locations across the U.S. as part
of normal Starbucks store renovation cycles.
The addition of Starbucks Reserve coffee bars will both drive incrementality in existing Starbucks stores and quickly
build consumer awareness of our new Starbucks Reserve brand domestically and around the world.
In closing, before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to share with you what many within Starbucks and I already
knew, that Kevin Johnson is a passionate servant leader, a world-class businessman, an expansive thinker and a wise
counselor. The partnership and the insights that Kevin brings to the senior leadership team as a highly engaged six-year
member of the Starbucks board of directors and now as President and COO of our company are providing to be
invaluable and already having a tremendous positive impact across all business segments and geographies, and he's just
getting started.
So I welcome Kevin to the call, and I now turn the call over to him. Thank you, Kevin.
Kevin R. Johnson
Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was an excellent quarter for Starbucks across the board. Before
providing operating highlights for each of our segments, I thought I'd share a very brief update on my transition into
day-to-day management. Since January, I've been working closely with Howard and the Starbucks senior leadership
team to assure a smooth transition and a rapid ramp-up beginning on March 1. I'm now almost four months into a deep
immersion across all key business functions, as well as field vistits to stores and facilities throughout North America
and Europe, engaging with our partners, customers and suppliers.
Next week, my immersion takes me to Asia where I'll have the opportunity to visit Starbucks stores and partners in the
region with our Group President, John Culver. This immersion process is providing me with a more comprehensive
understanding of Starbucks business and operations. But more than that, the immersion is providing me with an even

greater appreciation of the enormous global opportunity that lies ahead for this fantastic company, and the remarkably
talented management team.
I'm committed to doing everything I can to create value for our Starbucks partners and shareholders, always through the
lens of humanity, around the world and into the future. Thanks to Howard and all the Starbucks partners for their warm
welcome and for their help in making my transition into this role so seamless.
Now, I'd like to tell you about Q2. Our Americas business continues to deliver strong, consistent, profitable growth,
with a 7% increase in comp sales in Q2 and record revenue, up 11% over last year, record operating margin and record
operating income. Our U.S. food program continues to be a key focus and a tremendous opportunity for us. I'm pleased
to report that in Q2, U.S. food sales grew 16% year-on-year and contributed two points of comp growth with every day
part, platform and region contributing to the increase.
Noteworthy is that the sales of our innovative new breakfast sandwiches contributed to a 35% year-over-year growth in
our breakfast sandwich program. Our lunch platform also delivered double digit year-over-year gains as well.
As Howard mentioned, we introduced the Starbucks Flat White beverage that was enthusiastically embraced by our
customers. Flat White both elevated the entire core of espresso category and drove increased food attach. We launched
another coffee-forward beverage, Starbucks Cold Brew in select North American markets with a plan to offer
Starbucks Cold Brew in many more U.S. stores this summer. While still early in its innings, customer response to
Starbucks Cold Brew has been very strong.
Handcrafted branded Teavana tea beverages sold in Starbucks retail stores continued to drive both food attach and
strong growth in the tea category in Q2 with tea revenue up 15% year-on-year, driven in large part by very strong
customer response to the launch of Teavana branded Shaken Iced Teas and Teavana Tea Lattes. Teavana represents a
very compelling strategic opportunity for Starbucks and we plan to expand availability of branded Teavana tea
beverages throughout Starbucks retail stores in multiple new geographic markets in the quarters ahead.
Based on our success in the United States with La Boulange bakery platform, we have now begun deployment
throughout Canada. Already nearly 70% of Starbucks Canada cafes have transformed pastry cases with the balance to
be converted by summer. And our core Frappuccino platform introduced 20 years ago, remains very strong and
continues to attract both new and repeat customers. Birthday Cake Frappuccino, available only five days in March was
a huge success. And as Howard mentioned earlier, we have some very exciting Frappuccino and branded Teavana iced
tea beverages planned for this summer.
Starbucks China-Asia Pacific region, our fastest growing region delivered another very strong quarter with comp sales
rising 12%, the strongest comp sale increase since 2012, with revenues increasing 124%, or 24% when excluding the
$270 million incremental revenue from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, operating income rose 29% from Q2 last
year.
We have more than doubled our CAP store count to over 5,000 stores in the past five years. We've added 769 net new
stores in the last 12 months. We will open our 1,600th store in China later this month where we now operate in 87 cities
and are on our plan to increase our store count to over 10,000 stores in CAP over the next five years.
Passion for coffee and partner customer engagement in CAP are among the highest of any market in the world and
response to customer and partner demand, we expanded availability of Starbucks Reserve packaged coffee, we now
offer Starbucks Reserve in 136 stores across 10 CAP markets. In Q2, we assumed full ownership of the strategically
important Japanese market. Japan is a market we first entered nearly 20 years ago, and now with full ownership, we
have the ability to further accelerate store growth, expand the Starbucks brand across multiple other channels and
cross-sell products into other CAP regions. As an example, we recently introduced ORIGAMI, our premium
single-serve pour-over packaged coffee formerly only available in Japan into Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Mainland
China to a strong positive customer response.
Our China-Asia Pacific business continues to perform extremely well, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term
growth potential of the market. The evolution of our EMEA business continues with the business reporting a 2% comp

sale increase in the quarter, with 2% driven by traffic growth, and 1% increase in ticket. We are building our EMEA
business by introducing new food and beverage offerings and innovative new store designs, while at the same time,
increasing sales across all day parts and successfully building capacity at peak. And we continue to enter high customer
traffic locations by adding additional channel licensees at venues such as train stations, airports and supermarkets.
Equally important, the EMEA team's laser focus on operations, and the ongoing mix shift towards licensed stores
enable that segment to significantly increase both operating margin and operating income despite formidable foreign
exchange headwinds, a subject Scott will discuss in a few moments.
Channel Development, now operating in 41 markets around the world, in Q2, our Channel Development segment,
already our second most profitable business segment increased revenue 16% and operating income 23% year-on-year.
At the same time, the Channel Development team increased share of every product within its portfolio, including Roast
and Ground, K-Cup, VIA and Tazo Teas, our Channel Development segment remains on track to grow its top line by
60% and its operating income by nearly 100% by the year 2019.
Since launch, Starbucks has built its leading position on the K-Cup platform through ongoing product innovation,
including the introduction of single-origin coffees, and seasonal and LTO offerings, including Holiday Blends, and by
expanding our channels of distribution. We will continue to innovate around our K-Cup portfolio including new
offerings for summer refreshment including Iced Starbucks Coffee and Tazo Iced Tea K-Cups to brew over ice. And in
Q2 our growing foods services business which increased sales of 11% year-over-year began serving millions of
customers traveling on Delta and Delta Connection flights around the world.
The global ready-to-drink coffee market, a market we are uniquely well-positioned to lead is large and growing rapidly.
Our plan is to double our international ready-to-drink coffee business over the next five years. We have taken an
important step forward with the strategic partnership we announced last month with Tingyi, among China's largest and
most respected beverage companies. Combining the Starbucks brand and our 1,600 retail store footprint in China with
Tingyi's local manufacturing capabilities, its grocery sales expertise and its broad distribution capabilities, positions us
to unlock the huge opportunity that exists for Starbucks ready-to-drink coffees in China.
Among the things that's impressed me most throughout my immersion has been the pace of innovation that's taking
place at Starbucks, highlighting all the innovation currently underway across the company in beverage, food, store
design, marketing, merchandizing would require many more hours than we have available today. But I would like to
share a few highlights of what I believe to be game-changing innovation taking place on the customer digital
experience.
We are delighted with the initial results of Mobile Order & Pay, our mobile ordering capability now available in over
600 stores across the Pacific Northwest. Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay experience is a proprietary, fully-integrated
technology that allows customers to order their food and beverage selections through their mobile device ahead of time
and go to their participating store to pick up the completed order. Our experience to-date gives us confidence that once
fully deployed, Mobile Order & Pay will drive a significant increase in mobile payment transactions in stores
throughout the U.S.
Enhancing our in-store experience with customer-focused digital experiences like Mobile Order & Pay creates a
positive flywheel effect on our business and attracts more My Starbucks Rewards members. Each new MSR member
represents a deeper, more personalized customer relationship and more personalized customer relationships allow us to
better serve customers and grow our business, as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of active MSR
members we are serving.
For the first time ever, we now have over 10 million active MSR members in the U.S., up 27% over last year, having
added 1.3 million new MSR members in Q2. We're now processing over 8 million mobile payment transactions per
week, equaling nearly 19% of our U.S. store tender. And in Q2 we not only experienced record Card redemptions
following the record holiday Card sales and loads, but we also recorded Q2 record Card loads of over $1.1 billion for
North America, a 19% increase year-over-year.

While Mobile Order & Pay is exceeding every internal goal we've set, we're even more proud of the difference the
technology is making in our customers' lives. We're receiving positive feedback from many customers. Students, who
now have time to visit Starbucks between classes, parents, who are able to easily order their favorite Starbucks food
and beverages while running errands with their children, and busy people from all walks of life, who are leveraging this
new capability to enable their own personal Starbucks experience. We also receive overwhelming appreciation from
deaf customers who are now able to easily order and receive their customized beverage just the way they want it.
Customer connection has always been core to who we are as a company and we are leveraging the digital assets to
expand and enhance that customer connection to what is now more than 16 million active users of our mobile apps in
the U.S. alone. We remain on track to fully deploy Mobile Order & Pay to all U.S. company-owned locations before
this holiday season. At the same time, we will begin testing delivery. In March, we announced that through a
collaboration with Postmates, a leading on-demand delivery service, we will enable customers to order food and
beverage items using Starbucks mobile app and receive on-demand delivery within defined areas.
We are also launching a Green Apron delivery test with our partners delivering orders within specific office buildings.
As Howard mentioned, our first Green Apron delivery test will begin in New York's Empire State Building in the
second half of 2015.
Creating a genuine Starbucks experience for our customers and an authentic and personal connection between our
customers and our partners is core to everything we do. Earlier this fiscal year, we began rolling out a series of
investments in support of our in-store partners who deliver the Starbucks experience. Conceived, carefully developed
and honed over the past year, the changes we have implemented are already touching 135,000 partners across our U.S.
store base. Changes include increased barista and shift supervisor pay rates, additional performance-based recognition
programs, updates to our dress code, a new food benefit, as well as our industry-leading College Achievement
Program.
We are also investing in digital solutions to automate store tasks, freeing up our partners to focus more of their time and
attention on customer engagement. We're beginning deployment of handheld devices, connected with a scanner to
simplify things like order – inventory management. This is just one example of many, where we intend to leverage
technology to empower in-store partners in support of our mission.
This is a journey, and we are committed to listening to our partners and to delivering further enhancements to the
partner experience. We are making similar investments in locally relevant ways to improve our partner experience
elsewhere around the world.
In closing, and as Howard mentioned, if there is one word to describe Starbucks record performance in the quarter, I
think it would be innovation; innovation around new locally relevant food and beverage offerings, innovation around
stunning new store designs, innovation through the creation of new global growth platforms all centered around coffee,
innovation around how we serve and engage with our customers and build customer loyalty, innovation around our
breakthrough mobile and digital technologies and innovation around how we invest in and connect with our most
important asset, our people.
Innovation will continue to drive our business in the future and provide us with the confidence and ability to continue
growing our business in markets and channels on a global basis. And while we are pleased with our Q2 performance,
we know that we have much more work to do to achieve our aspiration of becoming the world's most respected and
enduring customer brand.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Maw. Scott?
Scott Harlan Maw
Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to comment on the strong Q2 financial results that
Starbucks announced today, especially in light of the fact that each of our segments contributed meaningfully to the
results. Strong mobile comp growth of 7% in the quarter demonstrates once again the increasing strength and relevancy

of the Starbucks brands. Transaction comps of 3%, driven in large part by excellent execution in our key fast growing
CAP region, exceeded transaction comps in the Americas, reflecting the increasingly global nature of our brand.
Revenues grew to $4.6 billion, an 18% increase over prior year, despite nearly two percentage points of headwind
through foreign currency translation. GAAP EPS came in at $0.33 and our non-GAAP EPS also at $0.33 came in ahead

results we announced today were at the top end of that revised range.
Excluding non-GAAP items, operating income increased 23% over Q2 last year to $789 million, while non-GAAP
operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 17.3% in the quarter. Importantly, we saw a meaningful increase in
COGS leverage this quarter as supply chain initiatives we have previously discussed increasingly benefit our
operations. Our year-over-year operating performance improvement becomes even more meaningful in light of the
ongoing investments we continue to make around building new stores and renovating existing stores, the partner
investments we are making and unfavorable foreign currency translation.
I'll now tell you about each of our segments and how they performed in Q2. Our Americas segment revenues grew 11%
in Q2, primarily driven by a strong 7% comp growth and another quarter of 2% transaction growth. Of the 7% comp
growth, food sales drove two points of the increase while beverage innovation and tea drove one point each.
Noteworthy is that the contribution to comp growth from tea has roughly doubled since we introduced Teavana teas
into our Starbucks stores last summer, adding one point to comp in each of the last three quarters.
In Q2, Americas operating margin expanded 110 basis points over Q2 last year, to 22.7%, an excellent result as the
bulk of our U.S. store partner investments began in earnest during the quarter. The largest components of the new
partner investments were wage adjustments and the introduction of a new food shift benefit. Altogether, these
investments impacted Q2 operating income by $34 million and operating margin by 100 basis points. For fiscal 2015,
we expect partner investments to total approximately $140 million and this amount was fully included in our initial and
current guidance. Looking forward, we expect modest further expansion of the Americas margin during the second half
of the year.
Our EMEA segment increased operating income 65% over Q2 of last year to a Q2 record $29 million. Our licensed
store portfolio in the region continues to perform exceedingly well with high single digit comps once again this quarter,
reflecting the strength and resiliency of the Starbucks brand. At the same time, EMEA's operating margin expanded
470 basis points to a Q2 record, 10.4%, reflecting the continued progress that the EMEA team is making against our
plan to improve operations, and achieve mid-teens operating margins over the near-term.
EMEA saw a decline in revenues, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation and the ongoing shift from
company-owned to licensed stores in several markets. These factors, coupled with continued consumer weakness in
several countries within the EMEA region make this segment's Q2 performance that much more impressive. We remain
confident that EMEA's operating margin will reach the upper end of our 10% to 12% guidance during fiscal 2015.
Our China-Asia Pacific segment delivered a 29% increase in operating income to $112 million in Q2. CAP operating
margin declined from 32.8% to 18.9%, reflecting the impact of our acquisition of Starbucks Japan. As I had mentioned
previously, our Japan stores, remaining among our most profitable in the world. Excluding the nearly 15-point financial
impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, CAP's operating margin increased by 80 basis points driven
primarily by sales leverage throughout the region including very strong sales leverage in China.
We continue to drive an increase in store unit economics in China and our newest class of stores is delivering excellent
first year operating profitability. The CAP team remains laser focused on continuing to deliver substantial disciplined
profitable growth, and we are increasing our CAP operating margin guidance slightly as we now expect operating
margin to approach 20% for all of 2015.
Channel Development had an excellent Q2 with operating income increasing 23% to a record $156 million. Operating
margin for the second quarter expanded 210 basis points to 36.5%, primarily driven by efficiencies in cost of goods
sold, strong results from our North American Coffee Partnership that delivered its highest quarterly year-over-year
profit growth since 2009 and sales leverage. We now expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin

improvement in Channel Development in fiscal 2015. Strong results during the first half of 2015 enabled us to generate
earnings per share at the upper end of our 16% to 18% non-GAAP target EPS growth range.
Accordingly, in March, we increased our guidance range and today, reaffirm that range with GAAP EPS targeted
between $1.77 and $1.79 and non-GAAP EPS targeted between $1.55 and $1.57. For Q3, we are targeting GAAP EPS
of between $0.39 and $0.40 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.40 to $0.41. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS in the
range of $0.40 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.43.
One further note about our guidance for Q3 and Q4; while we fully expect margin expansion from Q3 to Q4, our
earnings growth for Q4 will be slightly below our average earnings growth for the year, due to the impact of the partner
investments, higher negative foreign currency translation and lapping a particularly strong Q4 of 2014. Revenue growth
for fiscal 2015 remains targeted at 16% to 18%, despite two points of headwind from foreign currency translation. We
continue to expect commodities to be roughly neutral in 2015 as compared to 2014. Our coffee team's patience around
coffee pricing paid off resulting in our costs for fiscal 2015 being below average market prices.
Moving on to margin, we now expect a modest increase in fiscal 2015, non-GAAP operating margin over last year,
representing a slight increase over our prior guidance. We still anticipate 1,650 net new stores in fiscal 2015, but we
now expect Americas to have approximately 600 net new stores, slightly lower than previous guidance, due to the
impact of the closing of the 132 licensed Target stores in Canada. Our EMEA net new store target moves up slightly to
200 and net new stores in CAP remains the same at 850. All other guidance remains consistent with last quarter.
A quick note on 2016 coffee pricing; due to the recent drop in coffee prices, we have been locking in supply for 2016
and are now close to 70% price for 2016, that price is somewhat favorable to 2015. We will update you on the impact
of coffee prices on 2016 performance as the year progresses.
Finally, a few words of caution about extrapolating our current quarter performance into results above the upper end of
our guidance; while we are comfortable with the range that we affirm today, several factors need to be understood
when considering the upper end of our range. First, the U.S. store partner investments that both Howard and Kevin
spoke about will be fully ramped up during the third quarter and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 impacting margins for
the Americas segment during the back half of the year. We have fully planned for these investments. However, the
future benefits that will flow from these investments are significant and we will not hesitate to take advantage of
opportunities to make additional targeted partner investments that build and strengthen the business as we move
through the balance of 2015.
Second, both CAP and Channel Development had banner second quarters and we fully expect each segment to finish
the year very strong, but we do not anticipate a repeat of second quarter performance for either segment. For example,
in the back half of 2015, our internal projections call for Channel Development revenue growth to be closer to 10%,
consistent with the growth that we have seen over the past several years.
Finally, foreign exchange is becoming an increasingly challenging headwind with over 2 percentage points of negative
impact on both revenue and earnings growth planned into the back half of 2015. This was not contemplated in our plan
or our initial guidance for the year. And we are still planning to deliver earnings growth of 17% to 18%, despite over
two points of currency impact. In fact, we modestly increased both the top and bottom ranges of our full year EPS
guidance last month. We believe that this level of growth will represent best-in-class performance, the right level of
investment in our partners and an industry-leading return for shareholders.
One final subject before turning the call to Q&A; in the past, we've given guidance for the upcoming fiscal year during
our third quarter earnings call, even though our annual operating plan is typically not finalized until September. Kevin
and I have been discussing this and given the size and scale of our increasingly complex and global business, have
decided that going forward, we will move future guidance to our Q4 earnings call, enabling us to complete and fully vet
our plan prior to providing guidance. Be assured that this change is not related to Q3 performance to-date. In fact, we're
quite pleased with how the quarter has started, nor does it signal any coming change in long-term targets. It does not
and our long-term targets remain unchanged. Instead, we're making this adjustment for the sole and simple reason that
doing so will result in a more complete and informed forward guidance conversation.

Q2 represented another quarter of strong growth and excellent financial and operating performance for Starbucks all
around the world. As we enter the second half of 2015, and look to the future, we are ideally positioned to continue
benefiting from the investments we are making in our people, in our stores, and in innovation, and to continue
providing world class returns to our shareholders. We will continue to update you on our progress as we move

Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Mobile Order
& Pay. Couple of questions, related, one of them is, you're about halfway through the year and you have 650 stores and
you're looking to accelerate, I think, quite nicely in the back half. If you could talk a little bit about what you've learned
that will allow you to accelerate that pace.
And the other piece we're curious about is, are you seeing that only people who already use Mobile Pay or using the
Order & Pay, or are you actually attracting new customers to the use of the app now that you have the ordering
capability?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Go ahead, Adam.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Okay. Thanks, Howard. Yes, this is Adam Brotman. I'll take the second question first. The
answer is yes, we are seeing new customers come in and use, join MSR, use the mobile app and also [indiscernible]
(43:05). So this is not just leveraging the strong base that we already have in our mobile commerce platform. In terms
of the rollout plans and what we're learning, we're very pleased with how this has started. We will actually see a
significantly ramped up, accelerated pace of rollout in the second half of the year, as you mentioned.
We have a big wave of stores coming on this summer, and while we continue to learn and optimize a couple of areas,
for example, the estimated wait time pickup, we're dialing in store level menu and inventory management. These are all
things that we're going to continue to improve on but frankly we're ecstatic about the fact that out of the gate, our
customers and our partners are really pleased with how this is going. In fact, Seattle started out even quicker than
Portland. And as we rolled it into more dense urban environments, that bodes really well and how this is going to
continue to drive transactions and be a great thing for our customers. And operationally, our partners are telling us
there's no impact and they're very happy with this as well.
So we're excited to accelerate that rollout, as you mentioned, in the second half of the year. We're also going to be
adding this to our Android app and launching this in the U.K. and in Canada all before the end of the year. So we're
truly just getting started.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you, and congratulations on a great quarter. I want to ask a question about the
Americas with the check growth, very impressive. It's the highest two-year ticket growth we've seen in many years.
And when some of these new premium products like Flat White, like Reserve, like Cold Brew, with the Mobile Order
rolling throughout this year, with the food attach increasing as you've talked about, lots of tailwinds here, could this be
the beginning of a run of closer to mid-single digit ticket growth in the U.S.?

<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Cliff, you want to start?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Keith, thank you for your – it's Cliff. Thank you for your comments there about our ticket
growth. Yes we're absolutely delighted with our ticket growth in the quarter. We've seen 2% come from food, we've
seen 1% from tea, we've seen strength from our base business, whether it is Frappuccino in the Sunbelt or, as you say,
Flat White, all of which helped our ticket in the quarter, plus our routine and disciplined approach to price in the
quarter, all have helped. As far as the future, I'll pass it over to Scott.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yes. I think the only thing I would add, Keith, is that ticket mix was blended nicely across
the three drivers that Cliff is talking about. So a little bit of price, a little bit of up-level of [indiscernible] (45:44) with
Flat White and some of the things that we're doing with food and a nice increase in attach. So the mix of that is really
healthy. And so as I said in my comments, I think we're quite excited about how the rest of the year looks, but we're
still holding to our mid-single digit comp guidance as we look forward.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Congratulations. A couple of P&L-oriented ones, perhaps for Scott. The comp
leverage was really strong in the quarter as you mentioned, and you mentioned in the release, how supply chain
efficiencies were driving a good bit of it, particularly in the Channel Development segment, but as we look forward,
how should we think about that COGS line? That plus coffee, will that kind of leverage continue?
And then separately with regard to G&A, you had a significant increase in the quarter. I think it was 27%. What
investments are driving that and how should we think about that line as well? Thanks.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: On the COGS point, the short answer is yes, we expect continued leverage. I don't expect it
to be as high as it was this quarter. This was a really good quarter with some of the initiatives that we talked about
kicking in. And also in Cliff's business, significant continued traction around waste, but we see that leverage continuing
in the quarter, and we've got a number of things stacked up against making sure that happens.
And then on G&A, the biggest driver of that at the corporate level, is some true-ups that we had around total
compensation.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thanks. Just a couple of clarification questions; forgive me if I missed it, but did
you give the Mainland China same store sales increase for the quarter within that strong CAP number?
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: We didn't break it out, Joe, but as always, China is obviously the biggest contributor to that
growth. So we were really happy with what we saw in China this quarter.
<A - John Winchester Culver>: Joe, this is John. I would just add that, I mean, the main driver for the comp growth
has been transactions, and the experience that we're providing across the region has never been stronger. And in
particular, what we're seeing is that Starbucks is becoming part of that daily ritual of our customers in China and Japan
or in the other markets that we're operating in. And the level of frequency of our existing customers and the new
customers that we are attracting continues to grow. We're now serving well over 5 million customers a week across the
region, and extremely proud of the job our team's doing over there.

<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Okay. And then just a question on the Tingyi, if I'm pronouncing that correctly,
agreement; how quickly will that ramp up? And the bullet in the release mentions the ready-to-drink coffee category.
Will that cover tea products as well?
<A - Michael Conway>: Yes, Joe, this is Mike Conway. So we currently distribute the Frappuccino product in China
today, although it's in a more limited geographical presence than we would have. From a timing perspective, we're
going to be transitioning in 2016 to Tingyi and we expect that with the strength of their distribution and their
knowledge of the marketplace, combined with our strong brand, that we will significantly unlock the growth for China.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Mike, do you want to just spend a little bit more time on Channel Development since we
haven't had an opportunity?
<A - Michael Conway>: Sure.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: And also with regard to Tingyi, maybe talk about how many points of distribution they
have?
<A - Michael Conway>: Yes, absolutely. So – and you also – Joe, mentioned about tea, and yes, we will over time, be
launching tea as well with the Tingyi distribution. We will, from a channel to distribution perspective, points of
distribution; they have well over 100,000 points of distribution within China. And, for Channel Development, for this
quarter, actually very pleased with our results; our 16% growth was by all measures, quite exceptional and was driven
by a number of factors for us.
First of all, very, very strong programming, in-store execution, as well as the success of, and launch of the innovations
like our new Iced K-Cup platform. And as we think about the remainder of the year, we have other innovations coming
on as well, including the launch of iced or rather, our cocoa K-Cups as well. And so we expect very strong performance
in the back half, although expect it to be more in line with our historical growth of around 10%.
<Q - Joseph Terrence Buckley>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi. Actually another question on the Channel Development side of the business; so, we've
seen in the last probably few months of Nielsen or IRI Data that pricing has actually come in for Starbucks both on an
absolute basis and relative to the market. Just sort of curious – just the logic behind that, if that was seen as an
opportunity, your net profit accretion, if it's sending off potential entrants into the market with Dunkin', moving into
more points of distribution, just some of the logic behind that, and of course, congratulations for a fantastic quarter.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yes, thank you. From a pricing perspective, we actually are quite pleased with the way we
were able to balance our base with promotional pricing. You combine that with the strong in-store merchandizing that
we had, we were able to achieve significant share growth across all of our businesses during the quarter. And so, we'll
continue to monitor the market, continue to monitor the pricing and make appropriate shifts, but at the moment, we're
quite pleased with how our pricing is lining up in the marketplace and then in particular how we're driving share in the
market.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - John Glass>: Thanks very much. A few quarters ago, there was a notion of maybe greater partnerships in the tech
side, either using some of their technology, maybe white-labeling some of the Starbucks payment platforms, et cetera.
So, where does that stand now? What's your current thinking on that?
And, Kevin, as you come to this full time, maybe are there specific areas that you think are even greater opportunities
that you bring your outside experience into Starbucks?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I think Matt Ryan's going to start and then Kevin will follow-up.
<A - Matthew Ryan>: Sure. We continue to be in a number of active dialogues right now about a number of different
partnerships, leveraging mobile. We see the continued growth as being our permission to do more and more in that
space. We're not prepared to announce anything specific today, and what I can tell you is in the months and year to
come, there'll be more on that front.
<A - Kevin R. Johnson>: Yes, and then in terms of opportunities for us to better leverage technology; early
observation, I think, I think we're ahead of the industry in thought leadership around the digital customer experience,
and we're going to keep pushing the envelope on that. I think we've kind of outlined that for you and there's more ideas
even behind that. The areas that I think we have opportunities certainly is with our in-store partners on leveraging
technology to help our in-store partners with the tasks they have to do that are more about the administrative side of
things like inventory management, making it easier for them to do scheduling of our store partners, communicating
with our store partners, the way we reach in-store partners with training and communications. We've got a tremendous
opportunity to step up our game in that particular area. And we're going to do more there.
And then certainly if you look at how we're utilizing information across the enterprise to make more informed and
better decisions, whether it's using data, big data kinds of analytics to help us with store location or big data analytics to
help us understand how to do a better job of promoting to our customers at different times of the year. I think those are
the big opportunities that we see and we're going to continue to drive forward with those.
Operator
The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: Hi. Thank you. Howard and Kevin, you're very, very clear that Mobile Order & Pay has
exceeded every goal that you've set, so I wanted to get just a little bit more into the details of this. I guess one would
think that Mobile Order would work the best if the constraint or the pinch point, I think in your words, would be at the
register and not at the barista. And so, as that rollout has continued, I mean, what you've actually learned about
increasing barista capacity. I mean is it just an issue of adding more baristas, adding more equipment. And as you think
about Mobile Order, Mobile Pay over time, how much more latent capacity exists within the existing Starbucks unit
because of this technology?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: John, this is Howard. Cliff is going to take that in terms of the details of the question. I
think it's fair to say that we did not intend, nor do we foresee adding equipment as a result of Mobile Order & Pay. The
incrementality that we're seeing in the early stages strongly suggests that we're going to be able to integrate this well
within the engine of Starbucks. With regards to labor and how we're deploying, I'll let Cliff take it. But I would say as
Adam shared with you, that the early signs of Mobile Order & Pay is, this is going to be a much more seamless
integration than we really anticipated, both in terms of the customer response and level of convenience. And also, I
wouldn't underestimate one other thing, which we learned with Flat White, and that is our people are so excited and so
proud of this initiative and this technology, they've embraced it, they're enthused about it. And as a result of that – that's
one of the primary reasons why it's working so well.
Cliff, do you want to answer the issue of incremental labor?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yes, let me just talk about this. I think one of the things that we're seeing is convenience,
improved relationship between the customer and their store where they order. They feel much more in control of it.

Food attach is strong in it, and just the repeat nature of these transactions is really, really helping. It is convenient for
the customer, they have no queue time, they're coming in and going straight to the [indiscernible] (56:20) and
collecting. That in terms is freeing up space in the stores, and taking stress away from the register transaction. And we
are seeing really encouraging signs of growth peak in our busiest stores, which is, what is most exciting here.
Those busiest stores, [indiscernible] (56:43) really talk about Seattle, but where we have put in Mobile Order & Pay,
we're seeing really strong growth at peak and there's been no additional equipment over and above putting in a printer
to receive the orders from customers. And it's really encouraging that we will be able to get more capacity at peak out
of existing stores with the addition of Mobile Order & Pay.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Adam, can you or Kevin just talk about how this has been integrated into the ecosystem
with regard to – this is not a bolt-on – thank you.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Yes, I mean, it's – first of all, the ecosystem you're referring to is the mobile commerce
platform which includes loyalty, the mobile app, our Card program, our POS systems in our stores. We integrated all of
those together. And it's actually that entire mobile commerce platform ecosystem as you heard earlier, is accelerating.
We're seeing unbelievable numbers of active MSR members, mobile user – mobile payment transactions. So it's into
that momentum that we've launched Mobile Order & Pay.
So this is not a bolt-on, it's a leverage that existing ecosystem, and I think that's why frankly our customers are loving
it. They don't have to download a new app, they don't have to learn something new; this is just seamless for the
customers just like it is for the partner.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: That's great. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the Mobile Order & Pay initiative; it sounds like
you might be starting to see some increases in My Starbucks Rewards members also as a result of rolling this out. So
just wondering if you can maybe comment on the thought process or how you sort of think about the increase you're
seeing in the loyalty program members and how you plan to utilize that as you get this rolled out. Maybe more
one-to-one offers than what you're doing currently, or maybe that's not part of the plan. But any thoughts there would
be helpful.
<A - Matthew Ryan>: Sure. This is Matt Ryan, again. Thanks for the question. There are two ways looking at this.
There are lots of ways we're actually growing our membership and Mobile Order & Pay is one of them. We are actually
increasing the strength of our value proposition over time with more offers through one-to-one, people are recognizing
that. People see the convenience within the stores. And because it is an overall initiative to recruit more and more
people, we're seeing the growth in the platform. That begets a virtuous circle whereby we can do more things with that
platform.
Certainly the ability to become more and more targeted and send more offers to the right person at the right time in the
way they want it is a capability we've been growing here but the growth of that platform is, in fact the permission that
we have to do more over time in the digital space, because as we grow that engaged base of customers, the adjacent
things we can do with them, starting with Mobile Order & Pay, moving on to delivery and on to other opportunities, is
going to be an enormous long-run play for us.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Thank you. And have you seen, in fact, that the membership levels in the Northwest has
increased since you rolled the Mobile Order & Pay out?
<A - Kevin R. Johnson>: Well, I think, as Adam commented earlier, we have seen increase in MSR with new MSR
customers coming to use Mobile Order & Pay. And granted, we're just in the Pacific Northwest right now so it's still
early days. But I think that's a fantastic example of a feature that is a customer-focused feature. It's all about that benefit

to the customer and the consumer and we think offering those types of benefits and those types of features as part of
our mobile app, it will bring more people into the MSR program.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Jeff Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions, one on the Americas comp. I don't
know if you mentioned this, but in terms of the traffic growth across all day parts, just wondering whether you were
seeing again stability across all the day parts and whether or not that would imply that, at this point, there's still no real
signs of throughput constraints despite obviously the outside comp growth.
And then my other question was just on the Americas units. I know that in fiscal 2015, I guess half of your opening's
going to be licensed. Just wondering whether there's any underlying strategy in coming years to move towards more
licensed over time; not unlike, I guess, many of your international markets. Thanks.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, Jeff, and I'll take both the questions. This is Cliff. As we said earlier in the script, we
have seen growth in the Americas in all day parts, all geographies and across all platforms. It really was a very
balanced portfolio and we are seeing growth at peak times in our busiest stores which really gives us the
encouragement that we are – we still have room for capacity and Mobile Order & Pay will only help that in the coming
months.
Secondly, around the store growth, this quarter as we said it was a bit of an anomaly with the closure of the 132
licensed stores in Canada, so that will distort the number a little bit this year, but I think over the coming years, you will
see us continue a balance between company-operated and licensed stores. There may be times where it goes up or
down, one way or the other, but in terms of strategy, we continue to look for opportunities to grow both our
company-operated and even here in the U.S., we still see a very healthy pipeline of new opportunities, and we open,
very soon, our first small footprint store in New York which gives us another opportunity for growth and as Howard
said earlier, with the premium nature of the building of the Roastery, we have, again, another opportunity for growth.
So we see the pipeline out into the future being very healthy balanced between company-operated and licensed.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Let me just add a few things to that. For those of you who follow the company for many
years, it wasn't that long ago that our stores closed early in the evening. 7 O'clock, 8 O'clock at night and most of our
business, 50% or so was driven before 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. In the last few years, I think Cliff and his team have done
a wonderful job of two primary things. One, really dealing with peak times and being able to drive throughput in a way
that would not create a transaction-driven environment but really honor the customer and now with Mobile Order &
Pay, that's going to leverage even more. But the big news over the last couple years is identifying day parts and need
states through unique products in which we could leverage the fixed asset of the store.
So, lunch as an example, is driving a significant level of visits and incrementality both in traffic and in ticket. The new
opportunity with smoothies in terms of health and wellness, identifying that need state and leveraging that day part
opportunity which is mostly refreshment in the afternoon and health and wellness. And then one thing we have not
talked about either in the script or the Q&A, is the advancement of evenings, which we're very excited about.
And so all these things have given us the ability to integrate new product, new levels of innovation, and identify need
states and day parts that five years ago, candidly, were not part of the unit average volume. And if you look at the
average volume of Starbucks, both in terms of mature stores and probably most importantly, new stores, we are
experiencing the best-performing new store class in our history and one of the primary reasons is what I've just
described. Then you leverage MSR and Mobile Order & Pay on that, and your imagination can really – I can't begin to
think about how much volume we can put through these stores. And I think we're just getting started with the level of
innovation we think the food team can create and so that's why we're so excited about the future in terms of the
opportunity to drive incrementality in existing and new stores.

The next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Whoever put the coffee in Delta, thank you so much, and on
that note, can you talk a little bit, just walk us through I think it's 100% of coffee locks for this year. We know it's
favorable. Can you give us any color on how much? We were supposed to also see a benefit of lower dairy and diesel I
think in the back half of the year. Are you seeing that? And then also, thank you for the color on 2016, and the lock
there. Prices lower, again, by how much? Just wondering, can we kind of flow that through? Or do you want us to
assume you'll make investments against that? Thanks.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Thanks, Nicole. So as it relates to 2015, what you have to remember is that coffee prices
throughout 2014 were quite low. So for a long time, they were in the $1.20 and $1.30 range. And so, 2015 coffee
prices, despite the fact that we were patient and waited out all the spikes above $1.90, and bought it far below average
market prices. Our coffee is actually a little bit unfavorable year-over-year, but that's much more about how low 2014
was than it is around 2015. We actually did a really good job buying below the market. So, a little bit of unfavorability
and a very little bit, offset by favorability in dairy and diesel. That's kind of how the year's shaping up.
When we gave guidance all the way back in the summer, we expected coffee prices to come down, just given what we
saw in the market. We didn't know they were going to come down, but we expected that. We waited, we were patient
and when they came into our target range, we filled up our needs for the year. So that's how to think about 2015,
roughly flat, a little bit unfavorable on coffee, a little bit favorable on dairy.
On 2016, because we did so well in 2015, despite the fact that we've locked at slightly lower prices. Again, that
favorability, while meaningful, is probably not as high as you might calculate based upon average market prices. So
we'll give you a more update. We still have a full third of our coffee to price; we'll give you a bit more update as we
move into 2016 and become more specific.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thank you.

The next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Good afternoon.
<A>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: I wanted to ask on the CPG business. I think Danone announced on its earnings call that it
was co-branding an Evolution Fresh product with you, yogurt product. Obviously the Tingyi deal, I think is a big deal
in the CPG space in China for 2016. So just kind of going back, two Analyst Days ago which would have been, I
appreciate, quite a while ago, where you talked about the CPG space and how you thought it could rival the size of the
U.S. retail business at some point in the future.
Could you talk about your growth plans within CPG which I think you've obviously crystallized around the K-Cup
business, but there's lots of opportunities in a lot of different aisles, in not only the Americas, but also in China. So
could you talk a little bit, maybe add a little bit more detail around that? Would really appreciate it.
<A - John Winchester Culver>: Yes, Diane, this is John Culver, and let me just take that. Clearly, the CPG business,
first off, had a very strong quarter, and it continues to grow. And our expectation is that it will continue to grow at that
double digit rate in the foreseeable future. Now as we look at the growth; that growth is being driven by our core coffee

and really K-Cups is a big piece of that. As we look at other areas of growth though, we see tremendous opportunity to
grow outside of coffee. The biggest is the tea opportunity, and in particular with the Tazo Tea, and then as we
introduced Teavana tea down the aisle, and through ready-to-drink as well.
And then we've also worked very closely on Evolution Fresh. And Evolution Fresh, today, stands in over 11,000 doors
across the country. The CPG share that we have both in natural as well as in traditional FDM is very strong and it
continues to grow. We've just repackaged the product and we now have new packaging, an 11-ounce and a 15.2-ounce
and then we've also launched Evolution Fresh smoothies in our stores and we anticipate launching Evolution Fresh
yogurt with fruit on the bottom in our stores with our Danone partnership. So for us these are all investments that we
continue to make in our Channel business, given the relevance and the strength of the business and also we're very
optimistic about the future growth of the business going forward.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens, Inc.
<Q - Will Slabaugh>: Yes, thanks, guys. One more question on Channel Development but more on the international
front. Just – I don't know if you have an update you can give us there on some key markets internationally, sort of
where you stand now versus what type of growth you might expect in those key markets in the next couple of years as
you might hit your goals.
<A - Michael Conway>: Yes. Well, thank you, this is Mike Conway. We see China-Asia Pacific as being one of our
most important markets going forward. Certainly with the partnership we have with Tingyi, China will be a big market
for us particularly driven by the size of the ready-to-drink, energy and coffee business. And we also – Japan is one of
our longest standing ready-to-drink markets while it is somewhat mature. At the same time there's a lot of growth for us
there particularly with the move that we made now fully owning the Japan market. Beyond that, there are a number of
emerging markets that we're really focused on. We still have a fairly emerging business within our Latin America
region and we're looking at markets like Brazil to establish a presence there, another big market for us.
And then we have an established relationship in [indiscernible] (71:28), but we have probably the largest number of
markets – I'm sorry, in Europe, we have the largest number of markets in EMEA and we continue to drive our business
there as well. But the U.K., France, those are some of our largest markets. But I think about the significant growth that
we have from ready-to-drink coffee, we're really looking at the CAP region as well as Latin America.

The last question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Andrew M. Charles>: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in. Just wanted to touch base with Adam on the mobile
payment, just jumping to a roughly 19%, it had been stuck for a while around 15%. Just wanted to know what you
attributed the increase in mix to?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Thanks, Andrew. This is Adam. It's a great question. The core – I look at the core
ecosystem that Howard and I were talking about earlier. It's an interconnected set of parts that all have momentum. So
the fact that MSRs, you've seen the momentum in MSR, you've seen the momentum in mobile active users in general.
You're seeing the momentum in Card loads and Card redemptions, and those things are all tied together. So like the

flywheel, they all power one another, and so it's not a surprise that we're seeing that kind of acceleration happen when it
comes to mobile payments as well. Over 8 million per week, approaching 19% plus in the U.S. in terms of
