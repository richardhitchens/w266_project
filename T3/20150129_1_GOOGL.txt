or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our
results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are
expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and,
as applicable, other special items. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital
expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP
measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ellen, and welcome to 2015, everyone.
Before we get into the numbers, I'm going to give a brief overview of our performance this quarter, as the data is
actually quite noisy through the P&L.
So to start, let's say that we saw continued strength in our core advertising business. This was really driven by a strong
holiday and the mobile performance from our Sites line. We saw great momentum in our programmatic business,
highlighted by our mobile display and our ads platform product. But we also faced a few real challenges as well.
On the revenue side, clearly as you've heard, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a gross negative currency
impact of $616 million just into Q4. But thanks to our hedging program, the net impact was actually attenuated with a
net revenue of – impact of $468 million. Also, on the other revenue line, not only did we see that negative currency
impact really impact the Play growth, particularly in Japan, but also while the Nexus 7 was very well received as a new
phone, we had real issues and unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted. So for
both these factors in fact, we see lower other revenue growth this quarter.
On the expense side, we had a number of unusual charges to our operating expenses hit this quarter. I'll try to provide
you more details in a few minutes as we go through the conversation, but together these items added up to slightly over
$300 million in expenses to our P&L.
Lastly, if you go to the CapEx line, you'll note that we've made real estate purchases in Q4 which helped us relieve both
pressure on our workspace for current employees, but also to accommodate our future growth, and this also resulted in
a large sequential increase in our real estate capital expenditures this quarter.
So now that you have the basics, why don't we dive into the details? Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 15%
year-over-year to $18.1 billion, and was up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross
consolidated revenue growth would have in fact been 18% year-over-year. And despite all the FX pressure, our Google
site revenue was up a healthy 18% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, and was up 10% quarter-over-quarter, in part driven
by the strength in our mobile search. Network revenue was up 6% year-over-year at $3.7 billion and was up 8%
quarter-over-quarter.
As a reminder, our network business includes really two types of businesses with different growth profiles, our legacy
AdSense business, particularly AdSense for Search where we've continued to make policy changes for the benefit of
our user experience but which has negatively impacted the growth in clicks specifically. Our cleanup efforts have
resulted in fewer clicks but also higher CPCs, as I'll discuss in a minute.
The other business in the network line are newer display and programmatic businesses including AdMob, Ad
Exchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. Finally, Google's other revenue grew
19% year-over-year to $2 billion, was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in our Play Store,
but offset by the FX impact and the challenges in our hardware business I mentioned earlier.

Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 14% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were
down 3% year-over-year and also down 3% quarter-over-quarter. And if we go on our monetization by property, the
Google site paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. With Google Sites, CPCs were
down 8% year-over-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter.
On the network side, network paid clicks were down 11% year-over-year and down 7% quarter-over-quarter, but our
network CPCs were up year-over-year 6% and 10% quarter-over-quarter for the reasons I mentioned. Our monetization
metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors. They include geographic mix, device mix, property mix, FX,
as well as ongoing product and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance, if you go to our earnings slides which you'll find on our Investor Relations
website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenues by U.S., U.K., and Rest of World to show the impact of FX
and the benefits of our hedging program, so please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
So despite large currency headwinds, we saw solid performance from our core advertising business around the world.
The U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $7.9 billion, the U.K. was up 10% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, and
in fixed FX terms it actually grew to 11% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 18%
year-over-year to $8.6 billion, accounting for 47% of total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, in fact the rest of the world
grew at a healthy 24% year-over-year.
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 22% of advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP
other cost of revenue was $3.1 billion in Q4, which exclude SBC as well. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled
$5.8 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. And as result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.6 billion
and non-GAAP operating margins were 31% in Q4.
As I mentioned at the beginning, we had a number of unusual operating expenses that impacted us this quarter. We
typically review our estimates, accounting policies and balance sheet on an ongoing basis and make adjustments when
we think and see it necessary. Normally I wouldn't call out these but because they totaled slightly over $300 million
this quarter, I wanted to give you some sense of these adjustments although I won't be providing a lot of detailed
breakout.
So first, we took approximately half that amount in compensation charges resulting from a one-time payment and
reclassification between SBC and bonus expense. The other half came from a review of our real estate portfolio, where
we decided to take a write-down on a small number of assets and also one-time payment to buy out a number of leases
in a couple of markets where we face acute space pressure.
Headcount was up just over 2,000 in Q4. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 53,600 full-time employees.
You'll notice also that our effective tax rate was 16%, again another discrepancy for Q4, which was really primarily
impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credits for 2014, with the entire credit being taken in Q4, as well as
continued mix shift from earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $128 million. Interest income and realized gains
on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more detail on OI&E,
please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We are pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, and this
quarter most of the CapEx was spent on – related-to-facilities, production equipment, and data center construction, in
that order. So as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have been opportunistic about acquiring space in real estate where
we need to really pressure and accommodate for future growth. To that end, our facilities expenditure included just
over $900 million of real estate investments during the quarter, of which $585 million was related to the acquisition of
our property in Redwood City that we disclosed in our 10-Q for the third quarter.
Our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, and I also want to note that we completed in Q4 the sale of Motorola Mobile to
Lenovo on October 29. We recognized a gain on disposition of $740 million net of tax, which is included in our net
income from discontinued operations.

So there you have it. Despite a noisy quarter from a P&L perspective, we can say that we had strong results in our core
business, as evidenced by our 18% fixed FX growth this quarter, and are well-positioned for the year ahead and the
long term.
Now as Larry says, although the vast majority of our resources and time continue to be invested in our core products,
we also have enthusiasm to invest in new promising ideas like self-driving cars or Loon. We use the same disciplined
approach to these new areas that we used for investing in our earlier bets like Android or Chrome or Display. Our
projects start with small dedicated teams that are given clear milestones to hit before they can get further investments.
And you know, in cases where we achieve success against our milestones, we expand our investments, and you saw
this as an example earlier this week with our fiber teams. We greenlighted 18 cities in four metropolitan areas in the
U.S. out of the 34 cities and nine metros that we had reviewed in 2014, and they're off to the races.
In other cases, when the teams aren't able to hit hurdles but we think there's still a lot of promise, we might ask them to
take a pause and take the time to reset their strategy, as we recently did in the case of Glass. And in those situations
where projects don't have the impact we had hoped for, we do take the tough calls. We make the decision to cancel
them, and you've seen us do this time and time again.
So before I turn it over to Omid, I'd like also to note that in many ways, 2014 was a year of significant investment
growth both in CapEx and OpEx at Google. From an investment perspective, we'll continue to seek a healthy balance
between growth and discipline and a willingness to throw a little back when we reach the limits of what we believe we
can manageably absorb.
So with that in mind, I'll take it over to Omid now to provide more specifics on the successful performance of our core
and new businesses. Omid is joining us by phone from another location today so I hop it over to you, Omid.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everyone. Happy New Year and thanks for joining us today. This is Omid and it's my pleasure to
join you from London tonight.
I'm glad to be here to reflect on the last quarter and look ahead to 2015. 2014 ended with healthy momentum, enabling
us to achieve $66 billion in revenue for the year. In Q4 we launched Lollipop, our newest version of Android, refreshed
our line of Nexus devices, and introduced Inbox by Gmail, a new inbox that enables users to focus on the messages that
matter most to them. Meanwhile, our sales teams worked diligently with our advertising partners to deliver a strong
holiday season.
Today I'll do a quick walk-through of the business highlights from Q4. First I'll give an overview of the different
sectors of our ads business, performance, and brand advertising and our advertising platforms. Then I'll cover progress
in our emerging non-ads business.
Let's begin with the performance advertising. We continue to evolve the foundation of Google's advertising business to
reflect the multi-screen, constantly connected world. Mobile is now behavior, not a device, and it has a variety of
unique characteristics.
First let's talk about local advertising. On mobile, consumers want to know about the stores and goods near them. We
launched some exciting updates last quarter. In October we announced local availability for Product Listing Ads and
Local Storefront, products that give customers real-time information about goods that are in stock close to where they
are. Major retailers like Macy's and REI took advantage of these local inventory ads during the holidays. Overall, we
saw strong engagement and results from big box retailers during the holiday season.
A second priority has been the creation of new measurement tools. We recently added estimated store visits to our
estimated total conversions measurement suite. Now advertisers can see a reliable estimate of the number of times a
search ad click drives a store visit. During the holidays, ULTA Beauty reported that 12% of clicks on search ads led to
a store visit, with significant gains in ROI from their AdWords search marketing spend. These mobile-specific metrics

help advertisers measure the full impact of their mobile marketing.
A third area of progress is apps. We have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads on Google Search, AdMob and
YouTube, and this business continues to grow at a healthy clip. During the holiday season, Office Depot used Google
Search ads to promote their Elf Yourself app that helped shoppers create videos of people re-imagined as dancing
elves. By using Google Search ads, they saw a 65% conversion rate. We have recently enabled users to more
seamlessly navigate between apps and the web and find what they're looking for in apps more quickly.
In organic search, 15% of signed-in users' searches on Android now return deep links through apps. We also offer app
deep linking in search ads. Booking.com uses Google Search ads to drive installs and re-engagement via deep linking
for their mobile app. Last quarter, we continued to see great traction with our established mobile advertising products
as well, particularly Google Shopping. Online growth remained strong with Google Shopping traffic on mobile devices
up nearly 100% compared to Q4 2013. For much of the holiday season, mobile shopping clicks exceeded those on
desktop as users increasingly made purchase decisions on the go.
Now I would like to turn the YouTube, where we continue to deliver great results for brand advertisers. YouTube now
has more than 1 billion users. Every day, people watch hundreds of millions of hours of video on YouTube, generating
billions of views. Watch time is up 50% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our YouTube partners, and partner
revenue has increased by more than 50% year-over-year. We're seeing great momentum in mobile advertising on
YouTube. Mobile revenue on YouTube is up more than 100% year-over-year.
TrueView, where advertisers pay only if someone watches their ad, also continues to do very well. Walmart U.S.'s
holiday performance is one of many success stories. During the week of Black Friday, they used YouTube's TrueView
format to drive a 300% week-over-week increase in views of their channel, and more than 28 million views on the
week. This was a 600% increase in YouTube channel views over the same week in 2013.
And while we're all anticipating a certain football game in Arizona this weekend, the action has already begun for its
advertisers on YouTube. Nearly 70 ads or teasers related to the big game have been posted to YouTube this year, up
55% from the same time last year. People have been – people have already watched them more than 44 million times,
up 25% from last year, and for more than 70 million minutes on YouTube, nearly triple the watch time compared to the
same point last year. On average, people watched each ad for more than a minute and a half.
We continue to develop the tools that make digital work for brand marketers, their agencies, and premium publishers.
There were two particular areas of focus from Q4 that I would like to highlight, programmatic and measurement. Let's
start with programmatic. Automated ad buying has benefited performance-serving advertisers for years. We're now
extremely well-positioned as brand advertising shifts to programmatic as well. We're seeing great traction overall from
our advertising and agency partners. Today, all the top 10 global agencies use at least one product in our DoubleClick
Suite. Specific products within the DoubleClick Suite have shown exceptional momentum
DoubleClick Bid Manager, our primary front-end for programmatic buying, has doubled in volume over the past year.
During the recent U.S. midterm election, programmatic represented nearly one-third of advertisers' Google ad budgets.
We're seeing that video, the ultimate brand medium, is starting to move to programmatic as well. After launching in
June of 2014, Google Partner Select, our premium programmatic video marketplace, now has more than 50 publisher
partners, including Hearst Television and Food Network, and includes brands like BMW.
Next, we continue to invest in measurement tools that enable advertisers, agencies and publishers to better understand
the results of their digital marketing. It starts with addressing the question of viewability. Nothing else matters if a
human did not see your ad. This is a top question for the industry, and at Google we're doing our part to address it.
Since July, we have been rolling out viewability reports across our ad platforms so that brands will know whether their
video ads on digital channels were actually seen or not. We recently extended this active view reporting to video ads.
Large advertisers are finding technology like this to be very useful. For example, Kellogg's used DoubleClick digital
marketing to buy their inventory programmatically and increase their ad viewability by 70%.

Once a brand knows that their ads have been viewed, they need to determine if the right people saw those ads and if
they made an impact. That's where our tools to measure brand lift come in. We have run more than 6,000 brand lift
surveys to help determine brand recall and purchase intent. For example, Mondelez wanted to measure the
effectiveness of a recent digital campaign for the launch of a gum brand. With brand lift, they found a 36% lift in brand
awareness versus a control group and a 97% lift in ad recall versus the control group. Getting this type of feedback in
real-time is impossible with offline media. This sets digital apart.
Let's move now to our emerging non-ads businesses. Google for Work had a great quarter. We started working with
PwC to help them and the companies they advise use Google for Work to move their businesses to the cloud. Cloud
Platform continues to make good progress. We hosted our second Google Cloud Platform live event in November,
where we announced several new products such as Google Container Engine.
Our digital content businesses are strong. I'm excited about Google Play's development. Movies are now available in
more than 102 countries, music in 58, and books in 65. It's growing internationally at unprecedented speed.
In December, we partnered with Sony to digitally release The Interview. It has been publicly reported that the film
generated over $50 million in its first weekend, and that Google Play and YouTube drove the majority of those sales.
We launched YouTube Music Key Beta, a monthly music subscription service that provides ad-free music, background
play, and offline viewing. This will also include a subscription to Google Play Music, with more than 30 million songs,
expert-curated playlists and more.
Our hardware efforts demonstrated momentum. Just in time for the holidays we launched the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and
Nexus Player devices.
Chromecast continues to be a hit. Just last week, we saw our one billionth tap of the cast button. Chromecast usage per
device has increased by 60% since launch due to a growing roster of new apps and features. According to NPD Retail
Tracking Service, in 2014, Chromecast was the number one-selling streaming media device in the U.S.
Chromebooks are now available in 33 different markets and enjoying strong success in K-through-12 education market
in the U.S. I continue to be impressed by the work of our marketing teams that they've done around the world. The
Year in Search has become an instant classic, and YouTube Rewind is fast becoming one. From the Android, "Be
Together, Not the Same," campaign to Nest's first TV ads and much more, our marketing team contributed to our
success in the all-important Q4 through a wide variety of efforts.
There's a wrap for 2014, and we're excited for what lies ahead in 2015. In closing, I want to thank our great partners,
customers and users, without whom we wouldn't be successful. Thank you all so much. Now let's get back to Patrick
for Q&A.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Omid. Before we turn to Jamie for Q&A, I was highlighted by the team here that I actually had a slip. I said
Nexus 7 instead of Nexus 6. And although the Nexus 7 is still a great device, what I really meant in my comments was
to talk about the Nexus 6, which is this amazing device that we launched with the Lollipop launch.
So with that, why don't I turn it to Jamie and we'll go to Q&A. Jamie, if you can give the instructions, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Great. Thanks. So, Patrick or Omid, I think it's been a few years since you talked to the Street about
the run rate of your Display business. I wanted to see if you're willing to toss us a nugget here in terms of what your

gross billings currently may be, recognizing that you may be seeing growth in that revenue contribution depending on
different products?
And also, it looks like U.K. revenue saw a modest bit of acceleration on an FX-neutral basis. I mean, granted comps
were probably modestly easier, but anything you can call out that helped there? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yes. Sure. It's Patrick here. So on both topics, on the U.K. we did see a good performance this
quarter on the U.K. versus last quarter, and as you said – mentioned, 11% year-over-year. So the note of the U.K. is, the
core business there is doing well. If you go back to last – the deceleration, we have – it's a big portion, it's like 10% of
our revenue. We – or over 10%. The – you'll remember that in our mix of products that are in the U.K., clearly our core
products are there, but also AFS, like the network business, is actually prominent in U.K. as well as in the U.S., less so
in the rest of the world, and so that has an issue on the mix.
And then also, think of it as a promising item which is, there's areas of new products such as Play that are actually
stronger international than they would be in the U.K. or the U.S. So there lie some of the differences between the
growth rates, but in many ways a lot of opportunities there. So that's what's going on in the U.K. Quite pleased with the
programs there in Q4.
And then on the issue of Display, we haven't updated the numbers to the Street, and so we have to continue to kind of
give you the updates that we do, and if we actually have a chance in the future, then we'll let you know when it's time to
do so.
So thanks for your questions, Stephen, and we'll go to the next question, please, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Hi. Thank you. Two questions if I may, Patrick. You hired 2,000 people this quarter
versus 1,700 in the same quarter last year, which is a 22% increase. The Google management talks a lot about the
opportunity front of the business. If that's the case, why aren't you hiring more people and spending more in R&D? Can
you tell us what are the specific constraints that you guys have or impose on yourselves that prevent you from hiring
3,000 people this quarter instead of 2,000? That's the first one.
The second is the following. A few quarters ago, I seem to recall you saying that you did not manage the business for
margins, but you manage it for profit growth. Yet your operating income is down year-on-year, and even if you add the
$300 million it's growing very slowly. You could see how investors would look at that and say, well, how do you
reconcile these things? How do you think investors should think about this trajectory of operating income growth?
Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Okay. So let's take them in – each in step. On the issue of hiring, you'll notice that relative to
last quarter also, which is – our third quarter is typically a big quarter because we get the influx of the hires we do at
colleges and otherwise. We actually decelerated from the third quarter as well. What we are managing for is, we just
have a very high bar for hiring. If you can pass the bar, then we hire you. We also have capacity constraints on
leadership, like there's a natural kind of number that you can kind of absorb within the culture of Google. It's really
important not to lose that culture and to have velocity, to have traction. So there's no sense bringing 5,000 people that
we couldn't kind of bring into the teams and really make them perform in it.
So what we manage on the hiring is, we have our plans, and so we have a rate of targets, of hires per each of the [ph]
pals (28:27) in the areas in the company. And then from there the next hurdle is really about, can we find these people.
And then finally, just making sure that we keep this kind of balance of bringing at a reasonable rate so that we can
actually absorb them in the company without losing the velocity and the culture of the place. So it's actually a pretty
complex puzzle, but we're managing it. It's never perfect, but we're managing it to the best we can. So that's the first
question.

On the issue of margins, look, we have different – if you think of the businesses in Google, we're looking for growth,
we're looking for growth in revenue, we're looking for growth in operating profits, absolute dollars, and we're looking
for great returns on investments. That's the puzzle we solve for.
So you have an advertising business that may have higher margins, lower capital intensity than say another business
which may be Play which has much lower margins, great prospect for growth with very large pools of revenue and
margins available, and we go after them for sure. You have fiber, right, and in the access, which is a completely
different kind of capital intensity. But again the question is, does it promise or does it have a case for large dollars,
operating profit delivery and high revenue, and then a decent return on capital?
That's how we manage it. And to kind of say, okay, well, we have what we have today, but if Play could grow at – just
to take the case, ten times faster than it is doing right now, right, it would impact margin, because on a weighted
average basis it would drag it down. But we'd love it. We'd love to be able to grow Play ten times faster than we are
today.
So that's how we think of the puzzle. We manage them each individually for their potential, the returns, we all look for
these big margin pools in these big revenue pools, and then we just allocate our capital to make sure that it's balanced
across these initiatives for maximum velocity. That's the way we think about it, Carlos.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner-Neto>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you very much for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot for the questions. I have two. Patrick, given the importance of Google stock
prices as a motivator for existing employees, for recruitment of new employees, I think many investors out there
wonder if we're getting closer to a point where it might be a wise use of resources to return capital to shareholders.
Other large tech companies do it, nearly all the media companies do. At what point would you and at what point would
the Board of Google consider capital returns?
And then second question is, I'm just wondering, on the switch of the default browser on Mozilla from Google to
Yahoo in the quarter and going forward, is there any way you could quantify the impact of that? And investors are also
wondering, is it possible that could happen for your Safari agreement with Apple? Thanks a lot.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So why don't I take the last question first, and then the first question. The last question is,
you've all heard the announcements about Mozilla, and so when we – we don't comment on the details of any of our
partnerships that we have. Having said that, we continue to do two things that really matter. One is, our users continue
to actually go in – if they love Google, they'll continue to find Google. Whichever platform, whichever browser, and
that's really what we're focused on doing.
And then the second pieces is, the way to win in this in the long term, right, it's very simple. You just make wonderful
products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical, people will find them. And so that's the strategy
that we're using, and we just don't comment on any of our – we've never commented on any of our deals, so we won't
comment on Mozilla either.
And then for your first question, Anthony, I mean, again, I – again I can – I just can reiterate the same message that I
give on a regular basis which is, share price does matter. It matters to our Board, it matters to all of us, we're all
shareholders in the company, and we do review this issue on a regular basis. We reviewed it again responsibly with the
Audit Committee, with the Board, and I just have nothing to announce today.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you so much for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the questions. One, on device mix which Omid, you called out, is there any
sense you can give us of whether some of the pricing per ad unit is starting to close from the device mix, so even
though you're getting more volumes from mobile, whether it be smartphone or tablet, we're starting to see any impact if
pricing continues to move up versus desktop pricing you're seeing across your ad portfolio? Would love any
commentary around that.
And then second, Patrick, you called out the FX impact in the Q4. Any help you can give us on how we should be
thinking about the FX impact going forward on either a gross or a net basis to the business as you see it versus spot
today? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Sure. I'll let Omid answer the first question, and then I'll jump on the second.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure. Thanks, Eric, for the question. The way we look at this, as I said, we look at mobile
and as a behavior today really, as a – versus a specific device, and people are using screens interchangeably,
simultaneously throughout the day. And we really think about the user and the context rather than a particular form
factor or device, and similarly in terms of the pricing model here.
What we are focused on, really building this ecosystem just the way desktop took a long time to develop and have the
right ad formats that really took advantage, that the platform has to offer, we're looking at this the same way. We are
developing different kinds of formats working with marketers on mobile, estimated store visits, app install, app
re-engagement ads, and cross-device conversions, and we really feel good about the traction we're having and our sales
team and advertisers, agencies, partners are working with us, making rapid progress here.
So unfortunately I can't disclose any specific breakdowns, but I can just say that we're very focused on all aspects of
this. Just as we evolved the desktop, we're doing the same in this world.
On to you, Patrick.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you. On the issue of FX, I think that the most important point to think about in Q4 is, I
mean, it was material. As I said, it was like on a gross basis over $600 million. You've all seen the deterioration of the
euro, the GDP, the yen, I mean, versus the U.S. dollar.
The one thing I would just note from our results in Q4, I mentioned this in the past that, our FX rates are set at Google a
month in arrears. So in last week of November, we would have set our FX rates for December. So interestingly, the
December rate will set January and you've seen already in December a continued kind of nose dive in certain areas,
especially the euro and the yen. So all I can say is for all the information we have right now is that's not going away
and I think that everybody should be kind of considering it.
On the flip side of that, I just want to kind of reinforce the fact that our FX hedging program continues to do exactly
what it's supposed to do, which is in a low volatility environment we buy insurance and in moments where we have
such shocks like we're having right now, we did get a lot of benefit out of this hedging program.
Just as a reminder, we hedge profits, right, we don't hedge revenue. It just happens that we book the profits to revenue
because of the accounting rules, and so we see, we have seen in Q4 approximately $150 million of hedge benefits,
which is actually quite a substantial amount on the total of $600 million. And we'll continue to have hedge benefits
through the course of the year to a certain extent. So I think that from that perspective, right, real hit in December
additional, but in a good position from our hedge FX program.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Great. Thank you so much.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for those questions. Jamie, why don't we go to our next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. I had two questions. Patrick, towards the end of the prepared remarks, you said that
Google will show a balance of growth and discipline and a willingness to throw a little back. Can you just elaborate on
that comment? What do you mean when you say that? Are you referring to the pace of expense growth or throwing
something back in terms of capital allocation? Just a little clarity on that one.
And then Omid, the question on app indexing. I think you guys said in November that logged in searches have about
15% coverage in terms of app content. Where's that percentage today? And when do you guys think it will be closer to
100%? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Ross, it's Patrick. Let me jump in on the first question then I'll let Omid answer the second. On
the first one all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and community at large is, as I said, 2014 was a
year of significant investment growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to us, and where
we see great momentum. That what I wanted to make sure is that our investors continue to understand that we will push
for growth, but in a disciplined manner. And if things don't materialize in the way that you don't hit your hurdles, you
don't hit your timing, we are actually disciplined to make sure that we don't have expenses ahead of the curve. And we
continue to monitor it quite closely.
So in that sense, if we see conditions change, it's really important that you have the confidence that when we manage
these investments we do it in a prudent manner, right, optimistic but there's always a dose of circumspection to make
sure that you get the best bang for your buck in these roll outs. And that's what I really wanted to kind of communicate
and signal to the Street, which is it's a balance. It's always about a balance but given our situation, given all the results
that we've had, I mean, 18% year-over-year growth in our sites, if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the
business growing 18% year-over-year despite all the FX headwinds, right? It just tells you, look, this is a license to
continue to invest smartly in the way we do, but I just want to kind of reaffirms to you that we do it in a smart way and
a disciplined manner. We're driving to make sure we don't waste our shareholder's money. So with that, I will turn it
over to Omid to answer the first question, please.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Yes. Thanks, Ross. So as I said in my opening remark that 15% of signed in users searches
on Android now return deep links to apps. The way we are focused on this is that we have opened up app indexing to
all Android developers so that their apps can appear in searches also linking directly to the right content in the apps.
And it really becomes a job between the developers trying to understand intent and how obviously our search works
and determining the best results to provide, including the deep links.
We offer this deep linking in search ads as well. Booking.com used Google Search ads to drive installs and
re-engagement, real deep linking with their mobile app. And we are seeing more and more adoption like this by our
advertisers. So obviously it's an area we're going to continue making progress on. We are very pleased with the traction
we are having on how mobile monetization is performing. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question, Ross. Let's go to our next question, Jamie, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. Patrick, just going back to return on capital again, there was – there's
some news today that there's a potential bill to allow repatriation of cash back to the U.S. at a 6% tax rate. I'm
wondering, would that impact how you and the Board think about return of capital, or is that sort of a completely

irrelevant separate point?
And then second, Omid, for either of you, any color you can share with us on your wireless ambitions? I think both on
the MVNO side and 3.5 gigahertz, there's been a lot of discussion in the press of what Google's up to. Any update you
can give us on that would be great.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So on the second question – thank you for your questions, Ben. And on the second question
that you've asked, right, there's a lot of speculation out there and if we had to answer every speculation on Google's
part, what's going on, I mean, we'd just – it'd be – my PR team would be really busy. So we just won't comment on any
speculative news.
On the first question on return on capital, absolutely. I mean, we have right now a mix of kind of roughly 60-40
between our – U.S. 40%, international 60% of our cash. We have good use for our cash in both places, but if in fact we
had a lot more flexibility about repatriating cash, that would make a big difference in the way that we think about it and
– or at least we'd take it in consideration for sure in our dialogue with the Board and – so it's clearly one element that's
a part of the puzzle that we would take into consideration.
So if there's anything you can do to get that thing through Congress, we'd really love it, and just let us know when that
happens.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: I will call my congressperson. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you so much. All right. Jamie, we're going to go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. You've had greater emphasis on e-commerce over the last
few years with Google Shopping and Express. I was hoping you could give us an update on Google Wallet and how
strategic that is to your business overall and kind of closing the loop, payments in general?
And then secondly, can you comment, Patrick, on whether there's just anything in particular in driving the gap that we
saw on Sites between paid click volume and CPCs beyond some of the normal mix shift issues and FX? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So why don't I take the second question immediately and then I'll let Omid answer the issue of
the commerce.
So on the first one, look, it's – I want to come back on the Sites issue, because 25% and then the minus 8% in terms of
click growth and CPCs. And I want to start with that, because that's always the case that when people kind of just focus
on one, they – we kind of tend to forget the big picture which is, it's a mix of these two things that give you this
revenue that's been very strong in Sites this quarter, so never look at them in isolation.
Having said that, as I said in my prepared remarks, the monetization metrics for Sites has all the factors that I kind of
usually discuss, which is geographic, device, property, the FX, and all of the things I talked about. So I think it'd be
misguided again this quarter to pin it down to just one trend. I think people have a tendency to say okay, well, it's
mobile, right, or it's FX. And – but I'd like to point out three things specifically this quarter. As we know, as already
mentioned, right, FX has been a big impact this quarter. I also noted the strength of mobile performance in our Sites
earlier, and I'd remind you that our Sites line also includes YouTube where we continue to see impressive growth, both
in developed countries and emerging markets.
So there's the rest of it, there's all these pieces, but these are the kind of like, some of the pieces that we should take
note during this quarter. If that makes sense. I would turn it over to Omid to answer the first question on what's going
on with Google Shopping, et cetera.

<A - Omid Kordestani>: Yeah, on shopping and commerce in general, and then I'll talk on payments, really our focus
is building products that turn consumers' shopping intents into actions quickly, easily, and enabling businesses to
connect and retain these customers.
On payments, the goal is really to remove all the friction that one encounters now in the shopping experience, and what
we're really working on here is move beyond just tap-and-pay and have a full functional payment system. Today, users
can send money to friends through Gmail using the Wallet app, and we also just made this functionality available in the
U.K. Loyalty gift cards can be stored on the Wallet app, the Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to
purchase with two clicks. So we really are focused on building a rich offering here to make it easier to shop and pay
and remove the friction.

Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. I don't know if you can help us at all, but just an overview of core search growth
at all if you can, in some of your mature markets. Any way to break down that at all?
And then as you think about the search improvements you've made, just a little high-level overview? Obviously you
had some big changes with PLAs and Enhanced Campaigns over the last couple of years. Didn't seem like there was a
lot for this holiday, but maybe outline some of the improvements you've made recently. And then how is your pipeline
looking for this year? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Omid, do you want to take that question?
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Yes, I'll start and then we can add more context if you have more color you need, Justin.
So in terms of Product Listing Ads, PLAs, it's a very successful product, and we're really pleased with its performance,
advertisers are very pleased with it. And we also have Local Inventory Ads that enable merchants to show customers
information in the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Australia. Obviously we're going to continue to expand that.
As I said in my remarks, we added Estimated Store Visits in December, and it's been one year since we launched
Estimated Total Conversions. And just to give you some anecdotes with customers, PetSmart saw 10% to 18% of clicks
on search ads led to store visits and they are now investing more in ads to reach customers across multiple screens.
Famous Footwear, a nationwide chain, they have 1,100 stores, they found that 15% to 17% of the clicks on ads resulted
in store visits, and they were able to mix up the products that they promote and their in-store merchandising strategies
by region.
So for us it's early to think about the impact to revenue, but we really expect these suite of products to continue to help
the advertisers measure the full value of their online spending and work with us to enhance those.
In terms of specific search numbers, we don't really break that down and provide any more data on that. Thank you for
your question.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Justin. We'll have – do we have time for a couple more questions? Okay, so,

And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Hey. Thanks. I'll echo Stephen Ju's comment earlier. I think it would be great if you broke
out the nonperformance advertising at some point in the future, that data point would be very helpful.
The CPC trends on Sites, they kind of inflected back down after showing a positive trend. It's kind of hard to think that
that's nothing but FX. I know you have this mix of other factors. So could you just clarify that or could you quantify
what CPC Sites, CPCs would have been year-over-year ex-FX?
And then finally, Omid, could you just talk broadly about YouTube, and you've come back, you're more engaged with
the company. I think there's a bit of a change in management's approach I think to YouTube and how you want to
position it. I know it's a broad question, but could you just talk about what you want to do differently with YouTube
going forward for the next few years? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So on the first question, why don't I jump in, and then I'll let Omid talk about YouTube.
Look, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if you look at the Sites CPCs, we purposefully actually don't point to one item,
like I think it would be tempting to just say, okay, it's all FX this quarter because geography has a big impact, as I
mentioned, right, different properties on our sites. So YouTube has an impact as well, and since it's growing and it's
growing in emerging markets as well as in its core more developed markets, I purposely made the case that it's very
important to note that on the mobile side, I think we see continued strength in mobile. And so from that perspective, it's
always trying to catch up to the desktop, which itself is always improving. But we see positive trend there.
So it is a mix of all these factors, and we don't give out all of the details on a quarter-by-quarter mix, because they just
move all over the place. So that is the answer for that one, Mark. Sorry, that's not Mark. And then I will let Omid
answer the question on YouTube.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Sure. So first of all, in general, just to give you a sense of this, as you said, I've come back
and I just spent a lot of time at CES, here in Europe spending time with customers as well. And there's just tremendous
excitement about YouTube, and there are over a billion people come to the service every month, and YouTube mobile
revenue is up more than 100% year-to-year.
And what we're really after here is finding the click for brand, GRP brand list, other metrics, and advertisers are already
running brand list studies. About 6,000 of them have done this already with us. And what's really unique about this
service is the velocity that the creators enjoy to create and deliver content to a worldwide audience, and our investment
in the service, in the creators just continues to pay back for us.
So I know based on my meetings I spend a lot of time with consumer goods companies and at CES with major agencies
there. Everybody just wants to do more. There are a lot of success stories, the way they engage with us, and for us, the
challenge, frankly, is to structure our sales organization, hire the right people to go deeper with these customers with
our agencies, and so you'll just see a lot of success and emphasis from us as we go after the branding dollars.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you. Thank you so much, Mark. Jamie, we're going to take one more question. So if
you can turn it on, please.

And if you check your mute button, sir. We cannot hear you.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Hello?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: There we are.
<Q - Mark A. May>: All right. Sorry about that. Two questions, please. Could you tell us what your strategy is in the
area of digital payments and is there a way that you can leverage Android to develop a differentiated product in the
market?
And then secondly, sorry if I missed this, but how should we be thinking about the strategic and the financial
importance of search partnerships, like for instance the Safari deal and if there's anything that we should be reading into
the recent changes at Mozilla, and I think before that, Spotlight and Siri Search as far as either Google's strategy and
thinking in this area or its competitiveness in these deals? Thanks. Sorry. It's a lot, but...
<A - Patrick Pichette>: That's okay, Mark. No problem. So I'll take the second question and then I'll flip it over to
Omid to answer the Wallet one.
So on the issue of partnerships, Google has a lot of partnerships, right? It's an anchor of our strategy, because it actually
gives us distribution, distribution is good, and so we always look for partnerships in many spaces. Partnerships have to
be win-wins, and in that sense, right, we always look for those combinations. But also at the end of the day there's a
second piece of the strategy which is, as I said earlier, building amazing products. Because if you build amazing
products, then people want to distribute your products.
And so that's why we have Omid and the whole Search team that actually do this amazing job through the knowledge
graph and all the other elements of Search and no matter what the device, no matter the location, no matter the time of
day, if we give you the answers you're looking for in 10 clicks less than it was before, and even faster and better all the
time. That's what wins. And that's the core of what we're focused on. And then people will find a way to get to Google.
So, yes, partnerships matter, but at the core of it, you need partnership because you have phenomenal product. And
that's what we're going to continue to build in this amazing company. So I'll let, with that, Omid talk about our
developments for digital payments.
<A - Omid Kordestani>: Hi, Mark. I already addressed this a little earlier, but so I'll summarize it again. But we're
really after removing the friction here in all the products to improve commerce and make the experience for our users
seem less here.
There are really two areas we're focused on. One is really building a full functional payment system that just is beyond
tap & pay, so I mentioned that earlier, using Gmail and the Wallet app to send money to friends, loyalty, and gift cards,
and buying with Google button with a press of two clicks. So and we just – the NFC devices are available, and we're
really getting closer and closer to broader merchant adoption, and so you'll see us emphasizing that through the devices
that we're supporting out there as well as the payment services and commerce services that we provide. So I think you'll
