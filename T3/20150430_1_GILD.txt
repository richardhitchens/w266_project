MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences first quarter 2015 earnings
conference call. My name is Ashley, and I'll be the conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in
listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patrick O'Brien
Thank you, Ashley, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with the
details of our earnings results for the first quarter of 2015. The press release along with the detailed slides are available
on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences website.
The two speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And
based on a great deal of interest in Gilead's R&D pipeline, Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of
Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, will provide an update on our R&D progress. Also in the room
with us for the Q&A session are John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, President and

Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations.
Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements, including
plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain
assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially
from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent
press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement made
during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I will now turn the call over to Robin Washington.
Robin L. Washington
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. The year is off to a great start, and I'm pleased to summarize
the results of the first quarter of 2015.
Gilead performed well across all therapeutic categories, achieving an all-time high in net product revenues. We
continued to invest in research and development, commercial operations, and initiatives to increase access to treatment.
And importantly, our medicines are now reaching approximately 10 million people around the world. The company
also continues to execute on our capital allocation strategy.
Earlier today we reported non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2015 of $2.94 per share and total revenue of
$7.6 billion, an increase of 99% and 52% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2014. HCV product sales were
$4.6 billion for the first quarter, a doubling year over year and an increase of 19% sequentially, driven by continued
launches across many geographies. This quarter alone, we estimate that approximately 90,000 patients started on a
sofosbuvir-based therapy in the U.S. and Europe. Product sales excluding HCV were $2.9 billion. [audio gap] (3:23 –
3:30) Give us a minute to... [audio gap] (3:32 – 4:02)
Okay, I'm going to continue. Product sales excluding HCV were $2.9 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the first
quarter of 2014, driven by continued uptake of our HIV single-tablet regimen. Underlying prescription demand grew
for our newest single-tablet regimens, STRIBILD and COMPLERA, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Overall
HIV product sales were down 16% sequentially, primarily due to an inventory decrease in the U.S. following an
inventory build that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a higher proportion of sales into Medicaid and ADAP
[AIDS Drug Assistance Programs] programs, which are more heavily discounted.
Turning to the U.S. in more detail, Q1 2015 net product revenues were $5.2 billion. HIV net product revenues
increased 15% year over year to $1.4 billion. Growth was driven by our single-tablet regimens, with STRIBILD
increasing by more than 50% and COMPLERA by 24%. The recently updated HIV treatment guidelines from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services reinforced the benefit of improved single-tablet regimens like STRIBILD.
ATRIPLA was appropriately downgraded in the guidelines, as we anticipated. In fact, underlying prescription demand
for ATRIPLA declined 8% year over year, and we expect it will continue to decline as it is replaced by better
single-tablet regimens.
U.S. HIV revenues declined sequentially by 24%, due primarily to decreased inventory across the supply chain.
Wholesaler inventory levels declined to the near bottom of established ranges, and we also saw a drawdown by
sub-wholesalers. Both of these trends are similar to what we've seen in the first quarter over the past several years. In
addition, HIV sequential revenues were impacted by a one-time favorable accounting accrual in Q4 and a shift in payer
mix in Q1, as I previously mentioned.
U.S. HCV revenue increased 8% sequential to $3.4 billion, as an increase in patient volume was partially offset by a
higher level of rebates for commercial plans that were executed throughout the first quarter of 2015. Many of these

agreements became effective during the quarter, so we expect to see the full gross-to-net impact in the second quarter
of 2015.
In the U.S., approximately 70,000 patients initiated treatment with a Gilead HCV product in the first quarter, an
increase of 50% over the prior quarter. Since the December 2013 approval of SOVALDI, more than 210,000 U.S.
patients have started on a sofosbuvir-based therapy. We estimate that at least 90% of genotype 1 HCV patients
beginning treatment in the quarter started therapy on HARVONI and that greater than 80% of genotype 1 patients have
direct access to the product through either preferred or parity formulary status.
Turning to Europe, Q1 2015 was a record quarter, with $1.8 billion in product revenues inclusive of currency
headwinds. HIV revenue growth was driven by our single-tablet regimen. EVIPLERA together with STRIBILD grew
by 55% year over year. And for the first time, combined quarterly sales exceeded sales of ATRIPLA in a quarter. More
than half of new patients initiating therapy started with a Gilead single-tablet regimen, with EVIPLERA and
STRIBILD being the first and second most prescribed regimens in Europe. These two regimens were also the most
prescribed for patients switching therapy.
HCV revenues in the EU approximated $1 billion in Q1, which reflects the first quarter where SOVALDI was
prescribed in each of the big five countries. In some countries, most notably the UK, restrictions have resulted in
limiting treatment to sicker patients. Uptake for SOVALDI was particularly strong in Spain, driven by rapid
achievement of regional reimbursement. HARVONI access is progressing at a faster rate than we saw with SOVALDI.
HARVONI reimbursement is already in place in a few smaller countries of the EU, and we expect reimbursement in
Italy and Spain to be in place in the second quarter.
In Europe, we estimate 21,000 patients started therapy with a Gilead regimen in the first quarter and that the total
number of patients treated since the approval of SOVALDI in January 2014 has now surpassed 50,000.
Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses for the quarter were $651 million, up 17% compared to the prior year,
due to the continued progression and expansion of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in the liver disease
and oncology areas. Additionally, personnel and infrastructure expenses increased to support ongoing clinical study
activities, geographic expansion, and marketed product support. Sequentially, non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased by
$248 million, driven by one-time M&A-related costs that occurred in Q4 2014. We expect that our R&D expenses will
continue to ramp up during the remainder of 2015 as our level of clinical activity increases.
Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the quarter were $600 million, up 20% compared to the prior year, driven by the
growth in our business and geographic expansions during the past year, as we continued to launch SOVALDI and
HARVONI. Sequentially, non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased by approximately $200 million, driven primarily by a
favorable cumulative adjustment for the U.S. Branded Prescription Drug Fee based on the receipt of the preliminary
invoice from the IRS.
Turning to cash flows, during the first quarter of 2015 we generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations. It is important
to note that this figure includes unpaid rebates associated with the launch of HARVONI, and future cash flows will be
impacted as these payments are made.
We utilized $3 billion in cash during the quarter to repurchase 29.6 million shares at an average price of $101.38 per
share, which completed our May 2014 $5 billion share repurchase program. As of April 1, we initiated purchases under
the recently authorized $15 billion share repurchase program.
Earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share of
common stock, with a payment date of June 29, 2015 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on the
record date of June 16, 2015. This is the first quarterly dividend declared under our dividend program announced in
February 2015. Initiating the dividend reflects our continued confidence in our business and financial position. This
dividend complements our share repurchase program and gives us an additional vehicle to return cash to our
shareholders in a consistent and predictable manner.

Finally, I would like to update our full-year 2015 financial guidance provided to you on February 3 and summarized on
slide 31 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. We now expect 2015 product sales to be in the
range of $28 billion to $29 billion, an increase of 14% to 18% over 2014.
Our guidance for product revenue is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: the full-year impact of our
discounts, chargebacks, and rebates associated with pricing negotiation with pairs in the United States and Europe;
market share and full-year effects of competition; potentially incorrect assumptions regarding HCV patient flow; a
larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FSS, Medicaid, and
the VA; the timing and success of our commercial launches of SOVALDI and HARVONI in Japan; the effect of new
HIV treatment guidelines downgrading ATRIPLA to an alternative therapy; and the potential for continued volatility in
foreign currency exchange rates. All other components of our 2014 (sic) [2015] guidance remain unchanged.
I will now turn the call over to Norbert.
Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.
Thank you, Robin.
Over the past 25 years at Gilead, I've often been asked about the source of our next phase of growth, and I've never
been more confident because of the numerous programs we have to address unmet medical need. I will spend the next
few minutes detailing some of our programs underway across the therapeutic areas of HIV, liver disease,
cardiovascular, oncology, and respiratory inflammation.
In HIV, we are advancing various tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF, containing regimens. TAF is a nucleotide HIV
reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI], and some of the key clinical data were presented in February at the CROI
[Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections] conference in Seattle. In two large Phase 3 studies, the
single-tablet regimen of E/C/F/TAF was shown to be non-inferior to STRIBILD, with improved renal and bone
laboratory parameters. And the data from these two studies were published in the April 16 issue of The Lancet, giving
credence to these results.
Another study demonstrated that E/C/F/TAF could be safely administered to patients with mild to moderate renal
impairment. And a study in which nearly 1,500 patients on various regimens were switched to E/C/F/TAF is currently
ongoing, and we will share the final 48-week data from this study at an upcoming conference.
The marketing authorization applications for E/C/F/TAF have been submitted in a number of countries. U.S. FDA has
assigned a PDUFA date of November 5, 2015. This application was followed just this month by F/TAF, a fixed-dose
combination of TAF and emtricitabine, representing an improvement over TRUVADA.
And a third application, R/F/TAF, a new single-tablet regimen combining rilpivirine with the F/TAF backbone, is on
track to be filed in the third quarter of this year. For the R/F/TAF application, we will be using the priority review
voucher, which was acquired from Knight Therapeutics in November last year. If all applications progress successfully
to approval, we will be able to launch three new TAF-containing HIV regimens between November 2015 and the
middle of 2016.
Based on promising Phase 1 PK and viral dynamics data, dosing has begun in the Phase 2 study of GS-9883, a novel
once-daily integrase inhibitor which does not require boosting, in combination with the F/TAF backbone. If successful,
this could yield a third TAF-containing single-tablet regimen to offer to patients.
Also at CROI, we presented data on the ability of a TLR-7 agonist to induce viremia in SIV-infected monkeys
completely suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Based on these encouraging results, we have initiated a clinical study
of GS-9620, a potent TLR-7 agonist, to potentially eliminate the virus reservoir and achieve a functional cure of HIV.
Now turning to liver disease, the pan-genotypic regimen of sofosbuvir and GS-5816 is currently being evaluated in four
separate Phase 3 studies, all with a 12-week treatment duration. Based on the data to date and the success of
HARVONI, we believe the best medical use of sofosbuvir and GS-5816 will be in non-genotype 1 infected patients,

where the unmet need is the greatest. We should be in a position to share the top line results from these four Phase 3
studies with you in the third quarter, and hope to file marketing authorization applications towards year end.
Last week at the annual EASL [European Association for the Study of the Liver] conference in Vienna, a number of
presentations confirmed the high efficacy and good safety and tolerability of SOVALDI and HARVONI in different
patient populations in non-genotype 1 HCV infections and in real-world use.
Data were also presented on the use of the pan-genotypic triple combination of sofosbuvir, GS-5816, and GS-9857.
GS-5816 is a pan-genotypic NS5A enabler. And GS-9857 is a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor. The data indicate that
the shortened treatment duration of less than 12 weeks but more than four weeks could be feasible for all patient
populations. Based on these results, we have initiated two Phase 2 studies with this triple combination regimen to
compare treatment durations of eight weeks, 12 weeks; eight weeks and six weeks.
On March 25, SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin was approved by the Japanese Minister of Health, Labor, and
Welfare for the suppression of viremia in patients with genotype 2 hepatitis C infection. This is the first all-oral
interferon-free treatment for genotype 2 infection in Japan. This was an expedited review and approval based on the
unmet need and lack of alternatives for the more than 200,000 Japanese patients infected with genotype 2. Also in
Japan, HARVONI is under regulatory review and we expect approval by the middle of this year for the treatment of
patients with genotype 1b infection.
For most patients, treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection is lifelong, and we continue to pursue research aimed at
identifying finite treatment durations that may lead to a functional cure for hepatitis BS antigen conversion. Two
approaches, GS-9620, the TLR-7 agonist, and GS-4774, a therapeutic yeast-based vaccine, are currently in Phase 2
studies in virally suppressed chronic hepatitis B infected patients. Data from these studies are expected in the second
half of this year.
In addition, TAF as a single agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B is in Phase 3. TAF would represent an
alternative to VIREAD for the treatment of hepatitis B, and data from the Phase 3 studies are expected early in 2016.
In non-viral liver diseases, simtuzumab is undergoing evaluation in two studies for liver fibrosis due to NASH and in a
study for primary sclerosing cholangitis. These studies are fully enrolled, and the 96-week endpoint data should be
available in the fourth quarter of next year. NASH is a disease with a complex biology and one that might require more
than one approach for effective treatment or different options at different stages of disease.
So in addition to simtuzumab, two other mechanisms are being explored. The first, GS-4997, an ASK-1 inhibitor, will
be evaluated in a Phase 2 study both by itself and in combination with simtuzumab. And the second mechanism is
GS-9674, an FXR agonist, which we obtained through the acquisition of Phenex, and hope to have in the clinic before
year end.
In our inflammation respiratory areas, simtuzumab is in Phase 2 evaluation for IPF. This randomized
placebo-controlled study has now completed new patient screening, and completion of enrollment is anticipated in the
second quarter. This is an event-driven study, and results are expected in 2016.
As reported on our last quarterly call, the MMP9 antibody, GS-5745, has shown promising efficacy and safety in a
Phase 1b study in ulcerative colitis. Based on these findings, we will advance this program into Phase 2/3 in the second
half of this year. GS-5745 is also in early clinical testing for its potential utility in COPD, rheumatoid arthritis, and
Crohn's disease.
Many advances are also happening in our cardiovascular area. The NDA for the use of the combination of ambrisentan
and tadalafil for front-line treatment of PAH was submitted to FDA in December, and a PDUFA date of October 5 was
assigned. Ranolazine is currently being evaluated in more than 2,600 patients as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary
intervention to reduce hospitalizations driven by ischemia or the need for revascularization. This study has met the
required number of events, and we hope to be able to do a blind test study in the coming weeks. If the results are
positive, a supplemental NDA submission is planned towards the middle of the year.

The late cardiac sodium channel inhibitor, GS-6615, is in clinical development for four indications, long QT-3
syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease.
This is a low-dose once-daily compound that may provide options for these patients where none exist today. In
addition, we're exploring the use of GS-6615 for long QT-2 syndrome and for drug-induced QT prolongation.
And now moving to oncology, oncology is an important area of unmet medical need for which scientific advances
allow us to explore combination products and novel targets. We now have a strong oncology program, with 30 ongoing
and planned clinical studies, of which 10 are Phase 3 studies. Idelalisib is being evaluated in a number of Phase 2 and
Phase 3 study programs in CLL and NHL, both in the front-line setting and in previously treated patients. We continue
to be excited about the profile of idelalisib, including results in relapsed CLL in combination with ofatumumab, which
will be presented next month at the ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] meeting in Chicago.
Like many experts in the field, we see the future of hematology/oncology in the use of chemotherapy-free drug
combinations to drive deeper and more durable responses and to achieve a cure. We now have four classes of kinase
inhibitors, PI3K, SYK, JAK, and BTK, a program which was recently in-licensed from ONO Pharmaceuticals. With
these agents that target multiple signaling pathways, we are in a favorable competitive position, and our programs lend
themselves nicely to pursuing combination therapies.
In addition, we're also pursuing collaborative arrangements with other companies. An agreement was recently signed
with AstraZeneca to explore the combination of idelalisib with AstraZeneca's checkpoint inhibitor in diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma and triple-negative breast cancer, and we hope to initiate clinical studies in the second half of this
year.
There are two additional promising new opportunities for our portfolio of kinase inhibitors. The first is the use of these
in solid tumors. And the second is in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, where there's evidence that kinase
inhibitors have immuno-stimulatory effects through inhibition of regulatory T-cells and/or myeloid derived suppressor
cells. Based on this concept and following pre-clinical and clinical data, we will initiate a Phase 3 study in the second
half of this year of momelotinib in front-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, where patients will be randomized on
momelotinib or placebo on the background of gemcitabine and abraxane. The Phase 1 study in second-line pancreatic
cancer is currently ongoing.
Additionally, momelotinib is undergoing evaluation in EGFR mutated first-line non-small-cell lung cancer and in
combination with a MEK inhibitor in KRAS-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer. We will be initiating additional Phase
1a studies of momelotinib and idelalisib in solid tumors in the future. We will keep you apprised as we make additional
progress with our portfolio of kinase inhibitors.
As indicated in our last earnings call, the anti-MMP9 antibody GS-5745 has shown promising efficacy and safety in a
cohort of gastric cancer patients. Based on these results, we're proceeding directly into a Phase 3 study, in which 430
patients with gastric cancers will be randomized to the current standard of care or standard of care plus GS-5745. We
hope to initiate this study in the third quarter. And GS-5745 is also undergoing [indiscernible] (27:37) evaluation in a
Phase 1b study in pancreatic cancer.
In closing, Gilead has a broad discovery and development pipeline. Moreover, strong financials and cash flow allows
us to take advantage of external opportunities as they arise. As we have stated before, we strategically evaluate
opportunities carefully for their scientific merit and commercial potential. Thus, the depth and the breadth of our
current programs together with the myriad external possibilities give us great confidence in our future.
I would like to take this opportunity to recognize our 7,500 employees for their continued hard work and dedication and
their willingness to successfully collaborate with external organizations.
With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and thanks for taking the question.
When you guys think about the durability of the hep C market, what have you learned so far about the capacity to treat
in the U.S. and EU and then the queue of patients that are awaiting therapy, also U.S. and Europe? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Hi, Geoff. It's Paul here, so thanks for the question. This is something clearly on our mind as
well as we assess and think about our guidance going forward during this year. So the U.S. had 70,000 starts in quarter
one. And a large number of those, the vast majority of those were HARVONI starts in GT 1. And we think that there
are various dynamics here. There probably were some patients being warehoused at the end of quarter four waiting for
HARVONI. We then had the impact of all the contract negotiations early in the year, and we had a widening of the
pipeline, in a sense, in terms of fibrosis restrictions by many of the payers that we made contracts with.
Going forward, we see the prescriptions, the same data as you see, and we do see a flattening off at the moment. But we
also think that in general we're very early days into this launch. So the run rate would imply that we're somewhere
north of the 250,000 patients that we indicated last time we thought was possible in the U.S. this year.
I was at EASL last week myself and spoke to a number of physicians, and I asked this question. Did I think they were
seeing physician capacity being reached? And the answer was not physician capacity per se, but really back office
capacity to deal with the bureaucracy and paperwork. And whether that thins out a little bit in the rest of the year is to
be seen. But I think the run rate we're seeing with some of these dynamics of fibrosis restrictions opening up, with prior
authorization, patient flow seeming to ease up a little bit, but at the same time, we see physician office capacity
challenges. It's somewhere between 250,000 and the high 200,000s I think of patients we'll probably see being treated
in the U.S. this year.
Going to Europe, we're also very happy to see a large number of patients being treated in Europe for the first time,
around 20,000 in the first quarter, the majority of which are in the big five countries. And what we're seeing in Europe
is SOVALDI now approved in the big five countries and HARVONI available in Germany and in France under the
French ATU system. And we've signed agreements where we should see HARVONI in both Spain and Italy quite soon.
This is great news. The capacity constraints in Europe is really the budgets that have been set by the governments. And
we've worked with the governments in terms of the prevalence, the number of patients that they hope to treat, and we
encouraged them to really maximize the amount of budget they could put towards hepatitis C. Nevertheless, they are
single payers with budgets. And we think that we should get to the top of those budgets this year. So we previously said
we thought in Europe, around about 100,000 patients was probable for 2015, and I think that's our thinking at the
moment. I hope that covers it.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: It does, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. I really appreciate you taking my question. Great hep C number,
congratulations. I was just wondering. The IMS data that we all watch for the hepatitis C market seemed to indicate a
flattening and then a decline in the new prescriptions, which has now translated into an apparent flattening to decline in
the total prescriptions, so I guess I'm wondering. Should the interpretation of that data be that the U.S. hepatitis C
market has peaked, or is there something wrong with their IMS data? Or alternatively, is there a reason that we should
think of a reacceleration coming up sometime this year? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Mark, that's a hard question to answer. I think again I would just emphasize. It's early days still
in the U.S., as some of the contracts that the payers we contracted with in the first quarter, that starts to unfold. Some of
them have very open fibrosis restrictions. Some of them are still fairly restricted to sicker patients. We have this

dynamic of warehousing. We also have things like the direct-to-consumer campaign that you may have just noticed
starting. And I think all of these things are dynamics that are moving. So again, the data points that we've seen, I agree
with you, would imply a slight flattening of the U.S. market. But I would say there's still a possibility of further growth
in the rest of the year. But again, I'd just emphasize, it's very early days to make a prediction on that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Porges of Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thank you very much, and I'll add my congratulations on a remarkable quarter and
progress. Maybe just change gear a little bit. Robin, could you update us on where your cash is and where your cash
flow is? And then really phenomenal cash flow, are you thinking about how else you might use that other than the
dividend and the share repurchase? Obviously, you're just going to have a massive amount of cash flow. And related to
that, can you raise debt in Europe against that cash flow? Is that something you've done, or are you just doing it
onshore? Thanks.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Sure, Geoff. So just to get the stats out of the way, if you look at our cash, for the full
year we expect our cash balance, 40% or so of that we expect to be onshore. And relative to cash flow, it's slightly less.
About a third of our cash flow is generated in the U.S.
We still think we have fairly significant capacity to borrow in the U.S. We do discuss borrowing externally. It's not
something we plan to do immediately. Relative to our overall cash balance, very similarly to what we've been saying all
along, we're really focused on investing in our pipeline. We continue to look at strategic opportunities that may make
sense for us, with a focus on Phase 2 or earlier stage assets. And the rest, as you see that we've been doing, is we will
be redeploying it or returning it to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great, thanks for taking my question. It's a question I guess for whoever wants to pick it up.
It's just a little bit of understanding. Where are you on the payer mix and the rebate mix in the U.S. hep C market? And
can you give us a sense, what's going on with Medicaid? It was about a $1 billion book of business for you last year,
but very much mixed geographically around the country. How is the ramp going there? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Okay, Yaron. So we have negotiated and signed contracts I think now with about 90% of the
covered lives in the U.S. Of that 90%, 83% have direct access to HARVONI either through an exclusive arrangement
or through a parity arrangement. I would take this opportunity to say once more that Gilead really believes that
prescribing should be in the hands of doctors and their patients, not through these exclusive arrangements.
The payer mix is around 70% what I would call commercial and 30% public. And within that commercial, that includes
Medicare Part D at roughly half that amount. And the reason I make that split is because the rebates associated with
those covered lives would be in the same ballpark, with clearly higher discounts with the public payers.
Medicaid I'm not going to comment on extensively except to say that we have ongoing negotiations. And I'm sure you
appreciate from a competitive point of view why I can't talk too much about that. Nevertheless, we are winning some
exclusive arrangements and our competitors are winning some exclusive arrangements. And I think that's all I can say
really at this point. I hope that covers it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great, thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the big number this
quarter. At the EASL meeting last week, nice to see you out there. Thematically, one of the things that was emerging is
a lot more emphasis on hepatitis B drug development, and you guys have your two programs where I think you're going
to see data this year. So, Norbert, can you just talk about those programs and what you're looking for as a basis for a
go/no-go in a Phase 3 decision? And I guess are you looking for a functional cure in these studies, or are you looking
for a basis to find the right combinations to move that forward? Thanks very much.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: So, Matt, thanks for the question. So with the TLR-7 agonist, GS-9620,
we're looking for S reduction. So it doesn't have to be complete S conversion, but if we would see like a 2 log or so,
something that clearly indicates S antigen goes down, that would be an incentive to go into Phase 3. And with
GS-4774, the therapeutic vaccine, yeast-based vaccine, we're looking more at immunological parameters. So are we
seeing a robust anti – S antibody or S antigen or anything that would indicate the specific hepatitis B infected either
antibody or T-cell immune response.
The other thing I would like to point out, Matt, is the hepatitis B cure, as we call it here, is one of our largest research
programs right now. So we have a fair amount of head count, particularly biology. We're looking at compounds that
could inhibit cccDNA; that could make cccDNA go away. We're looking at epigenetic approaches and a few others that
I don't want to talk about because it's too early and too confidential. But that's a big area of focus for us, and we hope to
see some data towards the – in the second half of this year.
I would like to point out one last thing, Matt. These two studies, both with the TLR-7 agonist and the yeast vaccine, are
in virally suppressed patients. So whether or not we see anything with these virally suppressed patients, we would then
go into treatment naïve, non-virally suppressed, and actually, we have initiated already the study with the TLR-7
agonist. That's the second follow-up study that looks at the same compound in viremic patients, because there are
reasons to believe why immunologically it would work in viremic patients that it couldn't work in virally suppressed.
So I hope I've answered your question.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Thanks very much, Norbert.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Great, thanks, my congrats as well. Norbert made some comments on BD and whatnot. I just
wanted to ask broadly what you can say to your appetite for deals, whether they're small, medium, or big. Specifically,
John Milligan I'm sure is in the room, had commented earlier that as a corporation, you're not really ready for a big
transaction. I wonder if anything has changed and how you should be thinking about your capacity for deals, small,
medium, or large, as we get through hep C.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Hi, Michael, thanks for asking me a question. I appreciate that. We have talked about
this in the past, about having constraints on what we could do, basically limitations on the kinds of activities we can
undertake because of how difficult it was to get SOVALDI and then replace it with HARVONI in such short order.
And as we exited last year, we really felt that we had achieved a greater balance across the company and that we had
the capability to do more things and to look at more things than we have in the past. And as each month and quarter
goes on, we actually gain more ability to do those things as we move forward.
Now Norbert highlighted all the very exciting opportunities that we have in our pipeline, so we do feel that we have a
very full pipeline. But I think with our position as a company, with the cash flow that we have, and with our appetite to
continue to do more things for more patients around the world, there are some good opportunities. It would be a good
time for Gilead to consider a wide range of things.

But I can't tell that you that we have an appetite for things large or small; it would have to be the right fit for Gilead.
We typically like things where we can have impact on Phase 3 and where we can accelerate those products either into
the approval process or into greater indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we're looking for
things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility of them overall. So
we are open to suggestions. There have been many mentioned out there. But I would say that I want to stick very
closely to the kinds of areas that we're in here today.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thank you and congratulations on an outstanding quarter. I was just looking at your slide
22, where you speak to the patient dynamics in the U.S., at least the ones that are considering sofosbuvir. And I'm
wondering how that's going to change or if you could speak to how that could change by the time some of the other
companies reach the market, some of the combination products could reach the market. And maybe taking a step
further, just thinking about your triple combo, it seems like the goal will likely be limited to an eight-week regimen,
and how we should think about the competitive implications of that as other companies also pursue a triple
combination.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: I'll take the first question around slide 22, which is the type of patients that are being treated in
terms of genotype, fibrosis score, and whether they're naive or not. I think there will be some dynamics through this
year as the sicker patients get treated. And I think payers that are currently restricting fibrosis scores will start to open
up a little bit. That's something I would imagine will start to happen in 2016, although there are plenty of patients it
seems through all scores at the moment.
We have some data on intent to prescribe during the first quarter, which shows that doctors – the physician level in the
U.S. where doctors intended to prescribe actually slightly more than half of their patients being fibrosis score zero
through F2. In reality, we know though that payers are putting some restrictions on, not all payers but some of them.
And so most likely, the actual treatment is going to be biased towards the sicker patients, and that will start to unfold.
We also saw a very – as you can see from the chart, 82% of patients naive to treatment. I guess that would stay the
same, possibly even increase as the experienced patients get addressed.
You asked about how we would see that change with other competitors in the market. I think I would just emphasize.
We're extremely pleased with the clinical profile of HARVONI. And at EASL last week, we saw more data showing
how HARVONI can deal with really sick patients extremely effectively and some other genotypes. And that clinical
profile will only get stronger during the course of this year as we amass an incredible amount of real-world data. And I
think that data will be very advantageous for us as other competitors with no real-world data enter the market next year.
So I think the dynamics of the type of patients will change a little bit over time, but there are plenty of patients out
there. And we're seeing plenty of patients coming from the diagnosis pool into treatment, and plenty to keep this market
going for a number of years yet.
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: Ian, it's John Milligan. You asked the second part of the question about the triple and
the duration of therapy. I would say I've read some conflicting reports coming out of EASL. But I can tell you from the
own interactions with physicians and thinking about the dynamics of market, we do think it could get down to a shorter
duration. I think certainly, as Norbert said, the 12-week, eight-week, and six-week durations that we'll be looking at in
our triple combination, it's our goal to try to collapse the most number of patients down to the shortest duration
possible. And it will be interesting to see how this triple works across the wide range of different kinds of diseases,
both by genotype and by stage of diseases where still the severely ill patients have fewer options because many of these
agents can't be used in severely ill patients and they don't tend to cure as high a rate. We've seen that certainly as you
get into Child B and Child C scores.

I think what will happen here is that it will go down to some easy duration to use. But the push-back we've been getting
from doctors and from regulators is that six versus eight weeks doesn't really matter to them. In fact, I'm not sure eight
versus 12 weeks matters all that much as long as it's simple, as long as it's safe, and as long as there's a surety that
they'll get high cure rates. That's what they're looking for. So it's the outcome that seems to matter more than the
duration. And we can also tell you from the regulators point of view, they don't view shortened duration as an
important parameter at all. So that will create an even further barrier on all of us as we try to get to shorter durations if
we can't provide that simplicity across a wide range of patients, and that will make it more difficult for those products
to come to market.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Philip M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. On simtuzumab, Norbert, it sounded like
in your prepared remarks you said we were going to get the 96-week data at the end of 2016. I think in prior calls,
management had suggested that the 48-week data could come out late this year, so I guess two parts to the question.
One, are we now not going to get the 48-week data from simtuzumab? And then two: what's your most recent thinking
on the ability of Gilead to file for approval of simtuzumab on this Phase 2 data? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: So there is a 48-week analysis, but it's a futility analysis that is being done
by the DSMB. So if the DSMB comes to the conclusion there is absolutely no chance that we'll ever reach the endpoint,
then they will recommendation to stop this study. And then of course, the decision is up to us. If they don't see that,
then they will simply tell us continue.
The real endpoint is 96 weeks. And by the way, this was negotiated and agreed upon with the FDA. The FDA felt for
something like NASH that as a chronic, potentially lifelong disease, 48 weeks is not enough for treatment duration.
They would like to see 96 weeks. But if we can show a convincing reduction, so in the cirrhotic studies, so there are
two NASH studies. One is in cirrhotics, and at the endpoint there is hepatic venous pressure gradient. If we see a
clinically meaningful reduction at week 48 and week 96 in HVPG, that would get us potentially accelerated approval
under the subpart. I can't remember what it's called for biologics. It's subpart H for small molecules guidelines.
<Q - Philip M. Nadeau>: Would you care to elaborate on what's clinically meaningful?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger, Ph.D.>: We are still debating. The FDA, to be honest, they're completely informed
about HPVG, so we have to have another meeting with them to talk with the thought leaders, but the thought leaders
felt 20% reduction would be a huge clinically meaningful benefit.
<Q - Philip M. Nadeau>: That's very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So I guess just as a follow-up to the color you
provided on hep C discounts, so does your guidance of 46% still hold? And how do we think about this quarter
stocking for the quarter? And then lastly, when you think about hitting that 46%, how do we think about when you'll hit
that 46%? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Hi, Robyn. So let me just say we made a very atypical statement last quarter by describing
gross to net. And by the way, gross to net is not the same as discounts or rebates. There are other items in there. And
we've taken the view that for competitive reasons, and I hope you appreciate why, we don't want to discuss gross to net
really ever again this year.

Having said that, during the first quarter, some of the contracts, and Robin said this in her script, that we signed, started
to be executed during the first quarter. So I would say we're in steady state really from quarter two, and the guidance
that we've just given absolutely reflects our assumptions around gross to net in the U.S. hepatitis market. I hope that
answers – I didn't quite hear your very last part of the question.
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: How much stocking occurred.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Sorry, stocking. There was actually very minimal stock increase during the first quarter, I
would say not materially in the hepatitis market; a very slight increase of HARVONI stocking, matched by a slight
decrease in SOVALDI stocking.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Maybe if I just could ask something; so both you
and your competitor AbbVie have indicated that most of the contracts have started to come in but didn't fully come in,
and there's potentially an acceleration, at least AbbVie has of their run rate and their market share into April. I'm
wondering if you can just comment on dynamics in April. I know you said during the quarter you had about a 90%
share. I'm just wondering if that has shifted dramatically as some of these additional contracts have come on.
And then if I can just sneak one in for Robin, can you just say what the one-time impact was from the branded
prescription fee on SG&A? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: So the April share data, I actually don't have anything at my fingertips, Matthew, but I'm not
sensing any dramatic change whatsoever in the dynamics and the share and the prescriptions that we're getting. Robin?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Sure, Matthew, so to your point, the majority of the SG&A quarter-on-quarter decline
was driven by the one-time impact and then a further decline because we got a preliminary invoice from the IRS. So we
took down our accrual a bit. It was under $200 million associated with the new estimate that we've got. And I'll
reemphasize that it is just an estimate, so we'll see what happens longer term when we get the final invoice in August.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Most of my questions were already asked. But for Robin, can
you comment more on the impact or the magnitude of the unpaid rebates and from the cash flow standpoint that you
alluded to your prepared remarks?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Sure. So as you know, we had the significant increase in contracting that occurred in Q1,
primarily related to HARVONI. It usually takes the payers and governments up to about three months to six months,
sometimes even nine months to ultimately come back and charge us for those rebates or chargebacks. So if you looked
at our cash flow, it grew over $2 billion quarter on quarter. So all we were saying is, that's just because that cash hasn't
actually been paid out. So our run rate probably is not at the $5.7 billion going forward in further quarters. Does that
make sense?
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Great, thanks very much. Regarding the patients treated, the fibrosis side of the patients treated,
you give us the stats in the U.S. Can you talk about the similar information for Europe? And can you also give us a
sense of the pricing point that you negotiated in Italy and Spain and the budget cuts?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Sure. So fibrosis scores in Europe, interestingly, do vary somewhat between countries. So in
fact, in Germany, there are fairly open treatment restrictions. Therefore, there's a range of patients from sick to not sick
being treated. That's different in France and in Italy and Spain in particular where the budget constraints are really
ensuring that only the sicker patients are being prioritized at this stage. They're really in Spain and Italy, for example,
and the majority of the French patients are F3 and F4.
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: Price point?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: And I wouldn't comment on the price points except that the listed price points are between
€41,000 and €45,000 for SOVALDI. And we would anticipate probably a premium of around 15% for HARVONI
when those numbers get announced.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'm just wondering. On the HIV franchise, now that you
have a very broad strategy with respect to the TAF combos, can you help us think about just the longer-term market
share that you think you can retain post the entry of generic VIREAD, and maybe some other generic competitors down
the road as you think about the longer-term longevity of that franchise? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: That's a really tough question, predicting into the future. Today, as I think everyone knows, we
have a very substantial market share in the HIV world. And even in this quarter, we see in the U.S. about eight out of
10 patients naive to treatment go onto a Gilead product. About six out of 10 are getting a Gilead single-tablet regimen
with a TRUVADA backbone. And we're seeing very good growth of our TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens like
STRIBILD, which is growing 75% year on year, COMPLERA, 33% year on year. And you can see both in Europe and
in the U.S. that the top three or four regimens remain Gilead single-tablet regimens. So we're in a very, very strong
position today. And we're competing with the GSK products, and we do see their impact. For example, we were getting
seven out of 10 patients in the U.S. on a Gilead single-tablet regimen. We're now getting about six. But I do think that
emphasizes that single-tablet regimens are the way forward here.
We have very strong data with E/C/F/TAF, and we hope to have switch data at launch. And as we mentioned earlier,
the PDUFA date is November 5 of this year. We are getting our organization very much tuned up for that launch. And
we'll be focusing, of course, on really trying to bring the conversation back to the importance of a great backbone. And
we have great confidence that the F/TAF backbone is a great innovation over TRUVADA, with very high efficacy and
safety benefits, which are really increasingly important for the aging HIV population. So I think that it's all about
whether doctors feel that the F/TAF backbone warrants priority. And we're going to make sure that our medical
organization and our therapy or our specialists out in the field convey that data very clearly.

<Q - Ying Huang>: Thanks for taking my questions as well. Firstly, I was looking at the SOVALDI weekly NRx
number, which is stabilizing at about 600. What are those patients? Are those just genotype 2 or genotype 2 and 3
currently being treated with SOVALDI? And should we use that as a steady rate, if we do GT 1 versus GT 3 at about a
four-to-one ratio in the U.S., in a steady state in the future?
And then the second question here is about I guess payer mix. So you said that in the first quarter it's 70:30. But in the
next three quarters, what is your assumption for the payer mix for the HCV market in the U.S.?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: So there are two questions in there. The second question, we think that the payer mix will stay
relatively steady. And the reason, as I said earlier, the 70:30 was because these are the broad buckets of rebate rates. So
we think that that will remain steady. John, do you want to answer the first question?
<A - John F. Milligan, Ph.D.>: The first question was about where is SOVALDI being used, and it is principally
being used in genotype 2 and genotype 3 patients. As we exited the quarter, it was clear that there were still some
patients on sof [sofosbuvir] plus simeprevir, probably patients finishing out their regimen from last year. We don't
know if that will continue or not, but I expect there's a smattering of use in certain patient types for that. And there's
probably still a little bit of use for patients in combination with interferon.
And your question was about the run rate. I think there seems to be a steady flow of patients who are genotype 2 and
genotype 3 in the United States, but HARVONI is quickly making SOVALDI obsolete in many areas. And I suspect as
more data rolls out, there will be more and more HARVONI use and less and less SOVALDI use.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: There's a little bit more of a different genotype profile in Europe. Some of the countries have
more genotype 2 and 3. The UK is actually an example of that. So we would expect SOVALDI to continue to have
some utility, especially in some countries like the UK, for example.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you.
