Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone.
Never before in my nearly 40 years in and around the oil and gas industry have I seen a more difficult year for the
industry. The down cycle in the 1980s was bad, but 2016 represented the sharpest and deepest industry decline in
history. However, today, I'm really excited about what I see happening. Now, we came through 2016 in pretty good
shape. First I want to highlight a few of our 2016 accomplishments.
We finished the year with total company revenue of nearly $16 billion and adjusted operating income of $690 million.
And once again, we believe we outpaced our primary competitor in growing our market share. We generated
significant cash flow from operating activities during the second half of the year, and increased our cash position for
the full year. We successfully completed our structural cost initiatives and were able to cut more than $1 billion in costs
out of our business.
Now for some fourth-quarter highlights, I believe we had a fantastic quarter in executing our strategy. First and
foremost, I am very pleased to announce that we returned to operating profitability in North America after three
quarters of losing money. We achieved incremental margins of 65% in North America. And we continue to clearly gain
market share as we outgrew our primary competitor in not only North America, but Latin America and the Eastern
Hemisphere.
We gained significant market share throughout the downturn, coming out of it with the highest market share in North
America that we've ever had. And in Q4, we utilized this increased share to drive margin improvement, and I will
discuss that in a few minutes.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we maintained our margins quarter-over-quarter despite continued stress on pricing and
revenue activity. We achieved over $1 billion in cash flow from operations in Q4 alone, underlining our commitment to
efficient working capital management.
On a low light, as a result of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, our $0.04 per share adjusted operating results did
get hit by a significant foreign exchange loss of $53 million or $0.06 per share. So, these results reflect the successful
execution in a tough environment, and position us for the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Now, let me take a few minutes to discuss what we are seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for
the coming year. Despite the positive sentiment surrounding North America land, it is important to remember that our
world is still a tale of two cycles. While the North America market appears to have rounded the corner, it is on the
upswing. The international downswing is still playing out.
Let's talk about North America. In the second quarter call, I told you that customer animal spirits were back in North
America. Last quarter I said that these animal spirits were alive but somewhat caged up. Now these animal spirits have
broken free and they are running. However, not all customers are running in the same direction or as a pack, but they
are running. These animal spirits can be seen by the dramatic increase in customer M&A activity, energy industry
initial and secondary company offerings, the significant private equity capital moving into resource plays and, of
course, the increase in the rig count.
Customers are excited again, and our conversations have changed from being only about cost control to how we can
meet their incremental demand. As things began to recover in Q3 and four, we made a conscious strategic choice to not
chase additional market share and erode our profits further. Therefore, our North American revenue did not grow at the
same pace as the rig count for the last several quarters.

The historically high level of market share we've built in the downturn gives us what we call the power of choice in the
recovery. This is the ability to work with the most efficient customers who value what we do and who reward us for
helping them make better wells.
With this power of choice, we continued to execute our strategy of high-grading the profitability of our portfolio with
customers that value our services. Let me tell you how that strategy worked. In Q1 and Q2, in a competitive pricing
environment, we built the highest market share we ever had in North America by demonstrating to our customers the
benefits of our efficiency and technology, and the ability to make better wells.
We saw that historical high market share as an advantage, and we wanted to utilize it. In Q3, we told you that we were
willing to strategically trade some of that historically high market share for better profitability. Clearly, the time had
come to improve returns and that is what we told our customers.
In Q4, as demand for our equipment increased and availability tightened, our customer discussions revolved around the
unsustainable pricing that was in place, and the need for us to make a return before we were willing to continue to work
for them or add new equipment.
If a customer agreed to better pricing, we continued to work with them. If not, we took that equipment and used it to fill
the incremental demand with a customer that shared our view on how to work together and make better wells.
These conversations about the need for a healthy, profitable, and viable service industry were sometimes hard, but they
needed to happen. So in effect, we kept active equipment working at a higher price, while we believe our competition
brought equipment into the market to fill that demand at a lower price point. They gained share that we no longer
wanted while tying up their equipment at a lower price point in an accelerating market. By executing this strategy, we
intentionally gave up some market share in the short run, but we met our goal of returning to operating profitability in
North America. We did this because it's important to keep in mind that above all, we are a returns-focused company.
As we go into Q1, we continue to benefit from increased demand from customers and are now at the point where we
are bringing back cold stacked equipment. This newly activated equipment is only being added at a rate that ensures it
is profitable. It should also stabilize our market share at above historical levels. This action is a meaningful step in the
right direction to maintaining the leading market share we have while at the same time achieving industry-leading
returns. Bringing back equipment is not without a cost, and Jeff will talk about this in today's pricing dynamics in a
minute.
So as I look at 2017 in North America, I really like how it's shaping up. I expect as we finalize the execution of our
strategy that revenue will meet or exceed rig count growth in 2017. However, we will have to contend with the cost of
reactivating frac spreads and inflation on our inputs. Keep in mind that our suppliers also expect to benefit from our
customers' animal spirits.
So let's turn to the international markets. There, pricing and activity levels remain under pressure as we near the bottom
of the cycle. Low commodity prices have stressed budgets and impacted economics across the deepwater and mature
field markets, which has led to decreased activity and pricing throughout 2016. These headwinds still persist today.
Now there's been a lot of debate as to what commodity price will reactivate the higher cost basins, such as the
deepwater complex. It is clearly higher than the price that we are seeing today. Also impacting the price will be OPEC
compliance with its new production guidance. Most people agree that the U.S. is now the world's swing producer, and
it has demonstrated its ability to ramp up production quickly at a price that may make it difficult for deepwater projects
to compete.
We believe that the race to get deepwater project cost down versus the impact on commodity prices on increasing U.S.
shale production will have to play out over the course of 2017. Therefore, we do not expect to see an inflection in the
international markets until the latter part of 2017. In the meantime, our international customers remain focused on cash
flow, and traditional contracting cycles will likely mute any dramatic rebound coming off the bottom. We expect
revenue and margins to slowly grind down during 2017 as the market seeks to stabilize.

Overall, our 2016 results show what we have executed in a challenging market, guided by the lessons learned from past
industry cycles, our strategy focused not only on managing cost, but also aligning our resources to strengthen our
market position, and I think we've done that.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to cover our operational and financial results. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.
2016 certainly was a whale of a tough year. I want to thank each of our employees for their hard work and commitment
to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton's value proposition. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize
asset value for our customers. There's been a lot of change in North America over the last few months. Dave shared
with you how we used our market share strategy to regain profitability. The next step in boosting profitability is
increasing prices, so let me start by talking about where we see pricing.
Wild rumors are circulating in the industry about huge price increases. That's just not a universal fact. Given our
position in North America, no one knows more about pricing than we do, and here is what I do know.
First, I like talking about price increases more than decreases. It's a nice change. Second, the service price recovery is
starting from an extremely low base, in many cases below variable cash cost. Third, the level of pricing that satisfies a
particular service company depends on where they are on the profitability continuum. And finally, even though the
industry is starting at different profitability levels, every company will have to march back up the same path to
profitability.
During the downturn, our industry went through a steep regression in profitability as pricing and activity declined. The
industry moved from positive operating margins to negative operating margins, then to negative EBITDA, and
ultimately wound up struggling to cover variable cash costs. It was a fast and hard road that caused a dramatic shift in
the landscape of the service industry and wiped out a significant amount of shareholder equity.
The pricing brawl continues. As the industry recovers and equipment availability tightens, pricing at the margin is
ultimately set by whoever is satisfied with the lowest returns. It's important to understand that our competitors'
motivation for margin and returns is largely built around where their pricing is anchored today. For example, if they're
at negative variable cost, then they're trying to get to a negative EBITDA. If they're at negative EBITDA, then they're
trying to get to negative margin, and so on.
I can tell you, despite what you hear in the market, it's clearly a bridge too far to skip from negative variable cash to
positive operating margin in one step. So the industry pricing regression I discussed earlier needs to become a pricing
progression. This means that for now, Halliburton will have to compete with companies that are satisfied with lower
levels of short-term profitability, but we don't believe their pricing is sustainable. You can't have negative margins
forever.
In the meantime, Halliburton will continue to maintain our focus on execution and service quality as we defend our
position without sacrificing price. I believe that superior service quality is a prerequisite to having a meaningful pricing
discussion, and our dedication to service quality helped create the profitable results for the quarter.
As Dave said, we're at the point in the cycle where we feel it's appropriate to bring equipment back into the market. We
have a disciplined approach which looks at the required combination of market demand, market share and profitable
pricing. Our stacked equipment was the best in the industry when it went on the fence, and it's the best in the industry
as we bring it back.
Our manufacturing and maintenance capabilities provide us many levers to pull, from reactivating cold stacked
equipment to building new. This competitive advantage allows us to minimize the cost and time to deliver the
necessary equipment to our customers.

Our decision to bring equipment back is based on returns. However, there's an associated expense to activate cold
stacked equipment. Industry estimates for reactivating spreads very widely, and while our efficiency and expertise
allow us to be on the lower end of the scale, it doesn't make it free. Because we immediately expense some of the cost
to reactivate the equipment, it will be a drag on our margins for a few quarters. To give you a rule of thumb, we
believe, on average, it will cost $0.01 per share in the quarter we bring back a given spread. After we absorb the impact
of this additional expense, our margins should accelerate towards the end of the year.
Now turning to the international markets; Latin America had a solid quarter. While the region continues to experience
activity and pricing headwinds, we were able to finalize a number of items that have been pending throughout the year
for which we had deferred profit. We saw an uptick in software sales in Venezuelan and Mexico, and improved activity
in Colombia and Argentina. At the same time, headwinds persist in the larger Latin American markets. And until these
are alleviated, we do not believe we will see improvement. However, we are committed to the region and believe that
oil and gas is a critical element to the regions' broader economic recovery.
The Eastern Hemisphere was similarly strong in the fourth quarter, but pricing pressure and offshore exposure mean
that we continue to expect some decline for these regions in the near term. We expect to see an inflection in the rig
count in the latter half of 2017 supported by strengthening activity in the land-based mature fields markets. I'm more
excited than I have ever been about how our approach to collaboration and maximizing asset value resonates with our
customers and employees. We continue to focus on increasing barrels and decreasing cost for our clients. This focus is
being rewarded in tender wins across the globe. And I could go on and on with examples, but I just want to highlight a
few right now.
In Oman, we recently started work on a $0.5 billion production enhancement contract which will bring our superior
technology and expertise to an exciting tight gas market. In India, we were awarded a five-rig, multiyear contract
across several product service lines. This win is a direct result of the team's integrated approach and efficient solutions
designed to execute the work. It's a great example of how we can collaborate both internally and with our customers to
solve challenges and create results.
Landmark had a great quarter and year. Our digital solutions, including OpenEarth and iEnergy, are gaining wide
acceptance. Both are platforms for collaboration that cultivate data sharing, application building, and knowledge
discovery. Using our Exploration Insights platform, we started a strategic basin mastery project for a customer that will
allow comparison of assets across their global portfolio. This will save the customer hundreds of hours of time and
millions in financial investments. Reservoir Insight is a great example of how we can maximize our customers' asset
value.
These examples show our value proposition at work and highlight the successes we've had this year. In many ways,
2016 was like a barroom brawl, where everyone and I mean everyone took a punch. But it's 2017 now, and the brawl
will continue, but I like our chances in that fight. You know why? Because we're focused on adding capacity where it's
required, keeping a lid on fixed costs and doing the best job serving our customers. I really look forward to seeing the
year unfold.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Jeff. Let's start with a summary of our adjusted fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third
quarter.
Total company revenue for the quarter was $4 billion and operating income was $276 million, representing a sequential
increase of 5% and 115%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America, the
continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives, and end-of-year software and product sales.
Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9%, with operating margins improving by
approximately 550 basis points. The higher U.S. land rig count drove increased equipment utilization, particularly in

our Drilling and Evaluation product lines. We also saw the impact of our strategy to improve pricing and profitability in
our pressure-pumping business that Dave described earlier. Latin America revenue increased by 3%, and operating
income nearly tripled, primarily driven by increased activity levels in Colombia and Argentina and year-end software
sales in Consulting in Venezuela and Mexico.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 9%, with a decrease in operating income of
5%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by weather-related activity declines in the North Sea and Russia,
partially offset by improved activity in Egypt and Nigeria. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 10%,
with an increase in operating income of 32%. These results were primarily driven by increased software sales and
project management services across the region.
Our corporate expense totaled $67 million for the quarter, and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will remain in
that range for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest expense for the quarter was $137 million, better than our guidance
as a function of both higher cash balances and higher money market rates. We expect that this level of net interest
expense will remain through the first quarter of 2017.
We reported $91 million of other expense for the quarter. This line item was impacted by foreign exchange losses in
various countries, primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. The single largest factor included in our adjusted
results was a $53 million or $0.06 per share non-tax-deductible impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound.
Our ability to hedge our exposure to the Egyptian pound in front of this devaluation was limited due to the illiquid
nature of the derivative market and the inordinate economic cost associated with entering into any available derivative
contracts.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 34%. The quarterly rate is always a function of the tax
rate you expect for the full year. And 2016's rate estimates have been particularly volatile because earnings were so
low. This quarter's rate was also affected by a foreign tax assessment and a new deemed profit jurisdiction, the
nondeductible exchange loss in Egypt and our earnings mix as the U.S. begins to recover. For the full year of 2016,
however, our effective tax rate was 24%. And as we go forward in 2017, we're expecting the full year effective tax rate
to be approximately 25%.
During the fourth quarter, we also incurred impairments and other pre-tax charges of $169 million, approximately
one-third of which was severance-related cost primarily related to head count reductions in the Eastern Hemisphere and
Latin America, as we continued to right-size our business to the current market.
We also recorded $54 million for the net impact of the previously announced settlement of a long-standing class-action
lawsuit. This amount was recorded in Corporate and other in our GAAP results.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $720 million of cash, improving our cash position at year-end to $4 billion. This
increase in cash was primarily due to working capital improvements and continued disciplined capital spending. We
improved our days sales outstanding in the quarter by 10 days, while our days of inventory dropped by 6 days.
We continue to believe that we've moved into a period of shorter duration cycles. And given the amount of excess
capital available in the market, we're hesitant to build any additional tools or equipment unless it is new technology
built for a specific contract we've won, or the expansion of market share.
Consistent with that strategy, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2016 with a
total CapEx spend of approximately $800 million. Our current guidance for 2017 capital expenditures is $1 billion.
This CapEx guidance includes reactivating cold stacked pressure pumping equipment, and continued conversion of our
hydraulic fracturing fleet to Q10 pumps to support our surface efficiency strategy. We also expect depreciation and
amortization to be approximately $1.4 billion for 2017.
Of our $4 billion in cash, approximately half is offshore. We require about $1 billion to run the business. Given the
strength of our cash position and the potential impact of U.S. tax reform, we're actively evaluating our options and
opportunities around uses of cash, which could include accelerating the maturity of debt, funding acquisitions and
organic growth projects, or shareholder return opportunities.

Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments for the first quarter of
2017. Our international results will be subject to typical weather-related seasonality in the North Sea and Russia, and
the roll off of higher-margin year-end software and product sales, which tends to hit Latin America more acutely.
This will be exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Dave described earlier. Although difficult to predict, at this
point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a little under 10%, with
margins down several hundred basis points. And in Latin America, we anticipate revenues to increase sequentially by
mid to low single-digit percentages, with margins retreating to the low-single digits.
As we move into 2017 in North America, we anticipate, subject to weather disruptions, that our revenue growth will
return to perform in line with the U.S. rig count, which is already up 14% against the fourth quarter average.
Furthermore, we believe our margins will reflect incrementals of 40% to 45%, as they absorb the impact of adding
additional pressure pumping equipment to the market.
There is one last comment I'd like to make in terms of financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter
of 2017, we'll start reporting our four geographic regions showing revenue only and will only report operating income
by area, which is consistent with our major peer.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar
So let's sum things up. For what it's worth, we believe we were one of the winners in the 2016 downturn. Our 2016
results reflect our successful execution in a historically tough environment, and provides us with a position of strength
for the markets ahead.
The North America market share we built in the downturn provided us the power of choice and therefore the ability to
drive returns. We strategically gave up market share in the short run for the sake of regaining profitability, but we fully
expect to get it back. We are bringing back cold stacked equipment to satisfy customer demand. This equipment will
meet our return hurdles and stabilize our market share above historical levels. Each spread, however, will cost us $0.01
per share in the quarter that we bring it back.
The headwinds we faced in the international markets in 2016 still persist, and we do not expect to see it turn until the
latter part of the year. As a result, we will continue to control our costs. And just like we were the winners in the
downturn, I fully expect that we will win in the recovery.
Before we open it up for questions, I wanted to let you know that due to longstanding travel and business commitments,
I will not be participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf.
With that, let's open it up for questions.

structure more variable. But at the same time, I was just wondering if you're considering expanding any part of the
chain at this stage.

<Q - David Anderson>: Okay, sorry about that, Dave. I was just asking about with increasing proppant intensity and
the market share gains you've talked about, I was just curious about where you are in your utilization of your supply
chain and your logistical network as you build that out. Can you just help us understand where you think you are and
whether or not you think you need to expand that?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, thanks, Dave. This is Jeff. Look, the logistical infrastructure that we have continues
to prove itself extremely valuable. And as the market tightens, it gets utilized even more. And we've got sand positions,
transload type positions in every market. We've invested in the logistics, which in my view is the most important part
of that supply chain, and that's the part that gets the tightest the quickest. And so we like where we are. We even
completed some activities through the downturn in key markets, so we actually never backed away from that. And yes,
it will be valuable.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks, Jeff, and, Dave, maybe a bigger picture question here. I was just curious your take on
what E&Ps are saying now somewhat publicly. They really continue to downplay or even dismiss the impact of service
cost inflation, continue to be adamant that the majority of these cost savings have been structural. I'm just curious what
your take is on this. And if you were in their seat, would you be factoring in a 5% to 10% increase in cost in the budget,
or would you be using something higher at this stage?
<A - David J. Lesar>: I would be using something higher, number one. Number two, clearly some of the cost
reductions are structural. But I think as the equipment tightens, commodity prices increase, and everybody wants
availability of equipment when they want it where they want it and how they want it, I don't see that there is going to be
the ability for the customer to hold prices down. It's going to be a supply-and-demand market, it always is. We will
work with those customers that want to work with us. And really, the model for us hasn't changed. Efficiency is way
more important than pricing. And those customers that want to work with us to keep our equipment efficient are those
that we're going to work with, and I think that we'll both be winners in that scenario.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. Thanks, Dave.

Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open. Please check
your mute button.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Angie.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Hi. So this question is really for Dave or Jeff. I thought it was very noteworthy here that
you're reactivating fleets today, and I'd appreciate more color on this decision as you actively weigh out pricing versus
share in your thought.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks, Angie. Look, the decision to add equipment is really around we see the market
tightening. And in our view, our market share strategy works through the downturn. And as we bring equipment back,
clearly it's an economic decision. Each time we put equipment back to work, we expect to make returns. But we also
want to maintain that power of choice, which is very important to us as the market recovers. And so as Dave just said,
we really like our customer mix today, and we want to make certain that we can serve those customers. And we see
that's a key component of how we win the recovery.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Okay, very helpful. And then maybe you could talk about the potential or do you see or
is there a potential for any bottlenecks in the second half of 2017, either with logistics, sand, or people? And is there a
possibility that that could lead to an increase in the pace of pricing across the industry?

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: It's always the same three things. It's equipment, sand, and people that tend to crop up. I'll
take those one at a time though. From an equipment perspective, it's as much speed to market as it is anything else. And
we're so happy with our manufacturing footprint in Duncan, so differentially we have that advantage. Sand again is not
– sand volume I believe will be adequate, but it's the logistics. And again, from our perspective, we're well-positioned
there. We've maintained the infrastructure. And then finally, people, and we were fortunate to keep our experienced
people to the degree that we could through the downturn. That will pay back as we go into recovery mode. And it's
easy to forget, but in 2014 we actually hired 21,000 people onto our payroll, so we have the ability to flex. And so all of
those things are being managed today.

Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Jim.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<Q - James West>: Jeff, when you talk about the frac pricing in North America and your ability to raise pricing or to
raise pricing with the customers you want to be working with, I guess a couple of things, I'd say, one is, is all the price
increases that you've asked for so far, are they sticking? And then two, if you are – as you unstack equipment, are you
meeting your full return threshold or is this more of a, let's get in front of the market with some market share to get that
return later?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, James, the pricing is still a fight. I mean, it's not – what we are seeing so far is, I'd
say, a good start. The utilization and efficiency largely got us to where we are, though, clearly we have seen some
pricing, and that's progress. But we are absolutely not where we want to be. So as we look at equipment, we expect
better returns. So what I think is important to note that at least in the last 90 days, we're at a place where more work is
in fact helpful.
<Q - James West>: Right. Okay. Okay, got it. And then, maybe for Mark, just to clarify, I'm coming up with our math
about $0.11 of negative currency adjustments for the quarter, so the quarter would be more like $0.15. Obviously,
$0.06 of that is from Egypt. Are we correct on that, that it all drops to the bottom line, so it would be more like a $0.15
quarter, or you should call it $0.10 if you wanted to say Egypt is the outlier?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: You're right in assuming, generally speaking, currency losses, because they're essentially
– we're a dollar-denominated company, part tax-effected. It's not a realizable loss in the countries that they're recorded,
so that's true that they're not tax-effected. However, I don't know that I would jump to that conclusion. Clearly, the
Egyptian pound devaluation was something that was sort of out of the norm. The pound had been pegged to the dollar,
and all of a sudden they decided not to be, it was an immediate 50% reduction in the currency.
<Q - James West>: Right.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: The other part to the currency loss is though, I would say, we experienced those quarter-in
and quarter-out. And I would say that for the most part, the rest of them are not unusual.
<Q - James West>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: So they are a function of the strengthening dollar. But if you look back over the last
several quarters we've had them, they're in the numbers, and they were a part of how we had guided the Street as well.
So I don't know that I would necessarily exclude those as being...
<Q - James West>: Okay.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary regarding the
reactivation of pressure pumping spreads, if I could. Jeff or David, or anybody give any color on maybe the magnitude
of the reactivations that you are discussing with customers? And for the ones you're contemplating, do you incur the
cost primarily in the first quarter, or are you in talks about also reactivating equipment in the second quarter and so
does that drag from a cost standpoint continue into the second quarter as well?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Jud, we're not going to answer that. They are just competitive and it's a key part of our strategy
in terms of how we go to market. I think the color we would give is that what we want to do is be in a position to work
with those customers that value our services. And we expect to see the flight to quality that's pretty consistent in this
part of the market. And for that reason, we've put the time and the effort into making certain that our equipment is the
best in the business.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. Understood. I guess another question, even though you are seeing the headwinds from
reactivation cost in 1Q, the first quarter guidance is for incrementals of 40% to 45%. Just to make sure I'm thinking
about it the right way, as you get some of the reactivation headwinds behind you and, of course, see higher pricing, is it
reasonable to anticipate later in the year we – that for some quarters, we should see higher incrementals than that 45%
as you get pricing and the alleviation of the reactivation-related headwinds out of the way?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Hey, Jud, one of the things you need to – I know we talked about the cost being in Q1, but
there will be cost in Q2 as well.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: ...and the ability to get all of the fleet activated is going to take a little bit of time. We're
not going to be activating all of the cold stacked equipment that we have, but there is a – there is some decisions around
how much we're going to make available in the market at this point in time, and then we'll make later decisions. And
again, we've talked about being very flexible in this market, watching how the market behaves. But as Jeff said, we're
going to get equipment ready to go. It's going to cost us something, and we'll probably be doing that through the course
of the end of Q2 and then sort of decide where the market is and where we are to address how much further we go.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, back to the pricing narrative here, I'm a little bit confused.
On the one hand, you state explicitly in the narrative that the sequential improvement is driven by pricing and activity.
Secondly, your refusal to reactivate equipment without adequate rates of return, and yet we're processing nontrivial
reactivations over the first half of this year. So by implication, pricing is improving, notwithstanding the fact that it
might not be of the same magnitude that you would want it to.

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Correct, Bill. Yes, we are – we're seeing improvement. Our visibility is improvement
further into the future as opposed to the other way. And as a result, that's the case for reactivating equipment. We see
places for that equipment to go and make a return, albeit not the returns that we would like, but certainly a return and
getting us on the path to making those returns.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: And notwithstanding the fact that we had a margin strategy in the fourth quarter versus a
market share strategy and the delta between revenues and rig count. I would suspect that over the course of 2017 and
beyond, the fundamental completions intensity versus drilling intensity would probably put an upward bias on your
revenue versus rig count. And so at some point over the course of 2017, the rate of revenue expansion should outstrip
the rate of rig count expansion, correct?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes. I mean, I...
<A - David J. Lesar>: That's a fair analysis.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I agree with that.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And then last one from me, Mark. I know it's hard to expound on this at this stage
because of the fluid nature of the subject. But can you talk a little bit about Halliburton's tax optionality, tax rate
optionality in the event of the fact that the U.S. corporate tax rate has been lower?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I don't know that I can say much. I mean, I think that one of the things that we think about
is in relationship to where our cash is. And we're a U.S. domiciled company. It would have a dramatic impact on us.
You see particularly during this period of time when North America is beginning to expand, a drop in the U.S. tax rate
would make a difference from a manufacturing perspective. Most of our equipment is manufactured in the U.S. We
actually had worked a strategy to move manufacturing around where it was geographically located to serve the markets
where it was situated, and so all of that would be helpful.
This past year in 2016, if you'll recall, we have already taken the tax hit to basically – if a situation presented itself that
we could bring our cash back to the U.S. in a tax-advantaged way, we could do that without a significant impact on our
results. We'll watch that very carefully. But we have – I guess what I'm telling you is, we have tremendous optionality.
I think what we're just going to pay attention to is, how is that going to move forward. We're going to be working with
Congress on the Hill. Our tax Senior VP will be going to the Hill in a couple of weeks, and we'll just – we'll continue to
try to – we'll stay tied into where things will be moving and to move as quickly as we can to take advantage of
whatever presents itself.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you, sir.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much. I was quite impressed with the international margins, and you highlighted,
of course, year-end software and product sales like we always see. But could you be a little bit more specific on the
margin development into the first quarter as well as the revenue numbers that you guided?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Maybe when you say more specific, I think we tried to give guidance by area. North
America revenue should be in line with the rig count. Our incrementals should be in that 40% to 45% range. When you
look outside of North America, our Eastern Hemisphere, which probably benefited more from some of the year-end
product sales, but also gets hit more by weather-related seasonality in the Q1, we expect that the revenues will be down
a little under 10%, high single digits, and that the margins, the impact – the margins did look great. They're very strong
because of the product sales. They should drop off a couple hundred basis points in the first quarter. And then Latin
America, even though we had strong software sales of Consulting, which impacted – and those come at very, very high

incrementals. We actually think revenues will be up a little bit but that it will have a marginal impact, and they'll still
fall back down to the low single digits.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: And margins in Latin America?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Margins will follow back into the low single digits.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Low single digits, okay.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Margins will be down.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: I thought that was the revenue, okay. And the second question would just be on the North
America reactivation of pressure pumping. At what point do you believe that you have to add new capacity rather than
cold stacked and relatively intact capacity?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, that's a decision we'll make as we work through the process and certainly not
something we're going to share today just from a competitive perspective. But we do believe that we like where we are
now and we like the plan we have in place.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay, thank you very much. I'll hand it back.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Good morning, guys. And when you all complain about getting too much pricing or note that
you've gotten enough pricing, that's the day the world ends. The comments about reactivation costing $0.01, was that
$0.01 per spread that you reactivate? Because if I do just math on a 35% tax rate, that's $10 million to $12 million
reactivation cost per spread. Am I doing the math correctly, guys?
<A - David J. Lesar>: You're doing the math correctly.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. Yeah, maybe...
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: ...a little color on what that is, then. So as we think about $0.01 per spread, we see
estimates are all over the place. I actually believe we're at the lower end of the range in the sense that it's equipment
repair, but it's also advanced hiring, it's the logistics that go with each spread. So that's sort of a fully loaded look at
reactivation. And you would expect to have the best equipment in the marketplace, so we've certainly put the time into
that.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay. That clarification is helpful. And if I could, on the international side, you guys note
that the international inflection is probably going to be later in 2017. And, Jeff, I think you said it was onshore that you
expected to move up first and mature fields. Where do you guys see sub-Saharan Africa and offshore Brazil, when do
we start to see an improvement in deepwater?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I think that's the toughest hand in terms of efficiency. And I would say at this point in time
the commodity price just hasn't stabilized at a high enough number that makes it as attractive, and I'm just looking at
recent headlines, but a lot of investment moving to North America unconventionals that where that money had choices.
And so I also think that from an inflection timing perspective, the lead time between investment decision and drilling
activity is long in those markets for a lot of reasons. And every day that we see delay, that gets pushed out yet even
further. So we like our position in both of those places, and we'll be ready when it does recover. But I really don't – we
think it's further out than – further out.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim, let me give you an anecdote. I was talking to the CEO of one of our IOC customers
Friday. Obviously, I'm not going to say who it was, and he said that there is not a single asset in their portfolio outside

the U.S. that competes with their U.S. opportunities right now. And to me, that's a pretty amazing statement to me in
terms of really how much further commodity prices have to go up to bring some of these more either highly
complicated or longer-duration projects to the front of the queue to get an FID decision made around them.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay, that's very helpful, guys. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. You may begin.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: I just had a quick question on the reactivation cost, $0.01 per quarter per spread. Is that
quarterly impact including both OpEx and CapEx framed relative to your earnings power, or is that actually what hits
the P&L during the quarter?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It's not $0.01 per quarter per spread, it's just $0.01 per spread, and it is just the operating
expense impact, the cost. As Jeff indicated, it's more than just the maintenance on the equipment itself. It's also the
recruiting cost and the other activation costs that we are incurring to get that spread ready to go. It does not include the
capital cost. And so as I articulated, our capital forecast for 2017 is right now set at about $1 billion, and that
incremental that we're looking at between 2016 and 2017 is a fairly good estimate of some of the activation costs that
will be incurred on the capital side to get some of that equipment ready to go, including retrofitting some of our old
equipment with Q10s as we get them ready to get back in the market.
<A - David J. Lesar>: This is Dave. I think here's a simple way to think about it. We bring a spread back this quarter.
The negative impact on our earnings is $0.01. In the second quarter, that spread starts to earn revenue and will give us
the incremental margins and incremental revenue for that spread, so the $0.01 is a one-quarter impact. But clearly, we
will be likely to be bringing some spreads back in Q2. So the impact of those spreads in Q2 will be $0.01 per share,
which is why I made the comment earlier that it's really going to be toward the end of the year once we've absorbed the
front-end costs of these spreads coming on where we really expect to see our stimulation and pumping margins pop up.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it, that's clear, and then a question on sand delivery. Jeff, have you seen any degradation
to the percentage of jobs that you're supplying sand for in the marketplace?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No, not necessarily. We continue to deliver sand to most of the jobs where we work. The
surety of supply is such an important piece of our own efficiency model that we make certain that we control those
variables when we go to work, and we've found it to be very effective.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: And so today when you talk about putting fleets back to work at a profit, one, is that an
operating profit? And two, does it include the logistics cost and investment?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes, when we think about making an economic decision about putting a spread to work
and making returns, it's fully loaded operating income returns for the company.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. Good to hear, thanks.

<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Thanks. I was hoping to elaborate on the logistical challenges you were discussing earlier,
specifically from an E&P perspective. Are there any pinch points to focus on beyond labor and proppant that could
create some challenges as we move up the cycle here? Just I'm thinking about things like water and electricity. Some of
these emerging plays like the Delaware, it seems like that could be an issue for the E&Ps, and I'm just curious how
you're partnering with your customers to try to work through those issues.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Look, central to our value proposition is how we collaborate and engineer solutions to
maximize asset value. And a key component of that is collaboration around all of those things that help our customers
be successful. I don't see those necessarily as issues that can't be overcome by any means. Water and electricity are
things that our customers are very good at managing. And so I think we'll find solutions to those.
<Q - Sean C. Meakim>: Okay, fair enough. And then just to follow up on the reactivations, could you give us a sense
of the mix today for Q10s and maybe how that could progress through this year given the CapEx budget that you've
laid out?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: We still have about 60% of our overall fleet that's out there today that's Q10s. So as we
reactivate crews coming in, we're going to be placing an emphasis on Q10 fleets, including that we talked about
retrofitting some older equipment. If they need pump replacement, we're going to retrofit with Q10 pumps on that
equipment. And so our hope is that as this new equipment comes out, it will continue to increase the total percentage of
Q10 fleets in the market.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Q10 technology. I think it's
delivering the efficiency and the differential capital efficiency that we'd expected when we brought those out. So we're
certainly incentivized to make those a growing part of our fleet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. You may begin.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Kurt.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, a question for Dave. You bring out some very interesting points in your earlier commentary
and given your history now in the business and through the cycles. I was wondering if you can share your perspectives
on a number of different companies in the frac space that are going to becoming public.
I think on one hand, you can probably make an argument that it's positive because at the end of the day when you go
public, you've got to be as profitable as you can be. But on the other hand, as you go public, I'm sure shareholders are
going to expect some sort of growth which means more capital being deployed into the business. And this excess
capacity factor may be dampening the prospect for profit improvement. So I'm curious as to your perspective on that,
Dave. How are you guys thinking about it and what would be a good way for people like us outside the industry think
about that?
<A - David J. Lesar>: I guess the way I think about it is in a couple of ways. One is, you've got some sort of brand
names, and I won't say who, who are actually exiting the pressure-pumping business. So they have looked at the space
and have decided that they don't want to be in it for now or don't want to be in it at all. While at the same time, you
clearly have a wave of companies that are really just pumping companies only coming into the public market, and you
absolutely put your finger on it. I think by being public, there is an expectation that you have profit and that you get
paid for growth. And so what they hear from their shareholders, and I suspect in – to some extent most of their
shareholders are on this call listening, and it really is going to be the message that they get from those shareholders as

to what's more important; growth or profitability.
In our case, because of our position, we think we can have it both. We're not afraid of competition. We've had a lot of
competition come into the market over the past many years. We like our position there. We like our customers that we
have. So at the end of the day, we'll compete with whatever's out there, with whatever message their shareholders are
getting. But at the end of the day, it's about providing a good service to a customer at the right price, and I absolutely
love where we're positioned if that's going to be the state of play in it is.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great. And a follow-up maybe for you Dave too, your comment before was pretty intriguing
about your conversation with an IOC executive and how they're thinking about their portfolio. Would you say that, that
is – could you extrapolate that and say that the vast majority of the IOCs that you talk to have that same mindset? And I
would just try to put it into a context that the largest IOC in the world placed a $6.5 billion bet on the Permian last
week. So I think that does speak a lot for their feel of where their opportunity set is. So any incremental perspectives on
that?
<A - David J. Lesar>: No, I think each company is different, their portfolio is different. When they acquired those
assets are different, how long their production sharing contracts in many cases have to go. So I wouldn't generalize the
comment to the broader industry. I just thought it was an interesting anecdotal point from a particular customer. But
you're absolutely right. The – even the largest of the IOCs clearly have a focus on the unconventional in the U.S. and I
think that bodes well not only for our position in North America, but the future of the industry here.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate the perspectives.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Shannon. And as well as we before we finish, I'd like to emphasize two points. First, our strategy to
collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value, meaning deliver the lowest cost per BOE is built on
Halliburton's competitive advantage and is well aligned with our customers and is winning contracts and follow-on
work. Second, our focus on fairway customers who would best utilize our approach to delivering the lowest cost per
BOE, and our ability to flex quickly with the market place Halliburton in a fantastic position to win the recovery. We
look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may now close out the call.
Operator
