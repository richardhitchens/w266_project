MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this
time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Callahan
Thank you, Rachel. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2016 earnings
review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve
Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2
presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP
financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's
presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.
As summarized on slide 3, Lynn will cover the key milestones we reached in the quarter, as we near the completion of
our portfolio transition, and provide a brief overview of our new business segments. She will also discuss our third
quarter financial and operational highlights and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Steve will then provide an
overview of our third quarter financial results and load growth trends, as well as an update on regulatory activity. He
will also provide insight into our expectations for 2017, before closing with our key investor considerations.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong third quarter at Duke Energy, delivering
very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition.
We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition, and we also announced the sale of our Latin American assets. This
transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high quality, stable, and growing energy infrastructure
businesses.

Starting on slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3, we closed the Piedmont Natural
Gas acquisition, following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We're delighted to bring Piedmont's
industry-leading expertise into our company, as we expand our natural gas platform, supporting our transition to a
lower carbon future and growing investments in important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired
Piedmont for many years and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway.
In addition, on October 10, we announced agreements with China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to
sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2
billion, including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in two to four months, once we receive
required approvals in Brazil and China. We're making good progress. In fact, this morning, the Brazilian Antitrust
Agency preliminarily approved the transaction without any restrictions. This begins a 15-day statutory objection period
and if no objections are filed, the approval will become final.
I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction, also valued at
approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next three to five months. The proceeds
available will be used to reduce Duke Energy Holding Company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from
the transaction in a moment.
Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more predictable growth in earnings and cash
flows. I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions, as well as the continued dedication of our
employees at Duke Energy International who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look
forward to a timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business, and we're pleased to welcome the
Piedmont employees to Duke Energy.
Turning to slide 5, consistent with the transition of the portfolio, today, we are announcing the realignment of our
financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Prospectively, we will discuss
performance for three primary business segments: Electric Utilities & Infrastructure, Gas Utilities & Infrastructure, and
Commercial Renewables.
Electric Utilities & Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the
Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments.
As previously noted, Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure business, which will contain Piedmont,
our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky, and our gas pipeline investments, such as Atlantic Coast
Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont's existing joint venture investments.
With the realignment of our business, Commercial Renewables will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will
continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to
include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter.
With the divestiture of the Latin American generation business, the balance of the International segment will be
classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of
this business and adjusted earnings per share until closing.
Turning to slide 6, let me update you on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016
adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings
with strong results at our Regulated Utilities, due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment to cost
management and operational excellence.
As a result of the strong results through the first three quarters of the year, we are trending toward the high end of our
original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. This excludes costs associated with
Hurricane Matthew.
Turning to slide 7, we're continuing to move forward and deliver strong results on our $30 billion growth capital plan.
This plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and
modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders.

Here are a few updates. Site preparation activities are underway on our nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas
Modernization Project with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our
Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on
track to be completed by late 2019.
In September, we worked with the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Council to develop a plan to modernize and
upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50-year-old facility,
producing low-cost carbon-free electricity for Indiana residents for years to come.
Per the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the
recently approved renewable energy rider.
Last week, we issued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolina service territory.
This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers. Proposed projects must be in operation by
December 31, 2018.
Also in North Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN for our Duke
University combined heat and power project. The project will consist of a natural gas-fired generator that also provide
steam service to the campus and lowers the University's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat and power
projects represent an attractive energy solution that could benefit many of our universities and other large industrial
customers in the years to come.
Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management
programs within our local distribution companies and advanced construction of our pipeline projects. Let me briefly
update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution.
Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August and the project remains on track for a June 2017 in-service
date. Since our last earnings call, we received FERC's notice of schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Based on the
schedule, we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017.
This scheduled moves are expected in-service date to the second half of 2019.
In September, the project partners announced the selection of Spring Ridge Constructors as the lead construction
contractor, representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture of four leading U.S. natural
gas pipeline construction companies with extensive experience in similar projects.
As you recall, we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution Pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved
this project in December of 2014. However, in April of 2016, the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation, DEC, refused to grant the projects' water quality certificate. In response, the project filed lawsuits with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York seeking to overturn
DEC's action. Both of these law suits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals
scheduled for November 16 and we expect the decision in this case by mid 2017.
We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling as the Northeast lacks adequate access to
low cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides.
Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made
possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know, we managed through two major hurricanes this
fall. After Hurricane Hermine hit the Southeast in early September, our team restored power quickly and safely for
more than 200,000 Florida customers and 150,000 Carolinas customers.
Then Hurricane Matthew, as historic storm swept through our Florida and Carolina service territories in October. The
storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and widespread flooding, impacting many of our customers across the
Carolinas. The flooding, wind, and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system, leaving more than 1.7 million
customers without power. Piedmont's infrastructure experienced minimal damage.

In terms of customer outages, Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolinas,
Duke Energy Progress service area, with damage similar in scale to Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in
1989. In response, we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers.
We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our
employees and their unwavering commitment to serving our communities. Given the magnitude of the storm, we intend
to request a deferral of incremental cost and will ask that they'd be considered as part of our next base rate cases for
Duke Energy Progress, where the majority of damage occurred. Our current estimate of incremental cost is
approximately $200 million. We are still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimate.
Moving to our generation fleet results. In the quarter, our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear
units at Catawba and McGuire set new generation records, and our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for
generation in the quarter.
Also, in the third quarter, Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11
consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economics, environmental
and social efforts. This is a significant achievement earned by the entire company.
In addition, we were named at Site Selection Magazine's annual list of Top 10 Utilities in Economic Development for
the 12th consecutive year, another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer
base. Through September, our economic development efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investment and more
than 10,000 jobs across our service territories.
In conclusion, I'm very pleased with our progress, on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial
results in the quarter, and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We are advancing our strategic capital
investments and maintaining our focus on operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of
businesses is well positioned to deliver strong predictable earnings and cash flows to our investors.
Now, let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steven K. Young
Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter, as well as provide updates on the
current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll close
with a look ahead to 2017 and our key investor considerations.
I'll start with the quarterly results on slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior
year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported
results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and
presentation.
As a reminder, this is the last quarter for our existing segment structure. We begin managing the business under new
segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition.
On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third
quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. Regulated
Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance was
primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories, which added $0.14. We also recognized a
lower effective tax rate, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments, which contributed to an $0.08 increase.
Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio continue to be
favorable drivers of earnings, adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Weather-normal retail volumes also added $0.04,
with growth primarily in the Carolinas and Florida. I'll discuss those details in a moment.

Finally, our cost management efforts across the business provided a $0.02 uplift, despite additional storm cost in the
third quarter. Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M costs and finding efficiencies throughout our business
positions us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020.
Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter. The higher results were largely driven by
additional wind and solar facilities placed online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer
months.
Moving on, Other was down $0.14 for the quarter, largely driven by a higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax
benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlement. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance
in the Regulated Utilities segment.
For the year, we continue to expect the total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31% compared to
our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realized at International in the
first quarter.
Our first three quarters have been strong, reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As
we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05
in the fourth quarter. In Regulated Utilities, we have taken the opportunity to re-plan some of our O&M work,
including advancing a fossil plant outage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter.
In addition, the prior year results included a favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. Meanwhile, at Commercial
Renewables, we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original
expectations for the full year. Market returns continued to decline, and we remain disciplined on renewables capital
deployment.
With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are
trending toward the high end of our original guidance range, excluding costs associated with Hurricane Matthew.
Moving on to slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized
retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations for approximately
0.5% load growth.
Overall, we are pleased with the strength of our residential volumes, which continue to grow at 1.1% over the last 12
months, a strong 1.4% annual increase, and the number of new customers drives this growth. Utility-sponsored energy
efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continue to partially offset this customer growth.
Recently, we have seen the decline in usage per customer begin to level out a bit. Looking forward, positive trends in
new job and wage growth, as well as a recovery in housing, are positive signs for continued residential growth. Moving
to the customer class, we experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months, an improvement compared to last
quarter.
Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as non-manufacturing employment improves and office
vacancies continue to decline, even with new office space being added. These improvements are somewhat offset by
commercial businesses supporting manufacturing. In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and
education sectors, especially in the Midwest.
In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and
automotive continue to show resilience. However, the metals industry is once again experiencing declines. We will
closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into
2017.
Moving to slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DEP South Carolina rate case. In October, we
reached a constructive settlement with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement
was reviewed by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina during a hearing earlier this week.

The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing. We requested a $79 million
increase, with an allowed ROE of 10.75%, and equity structure of 53%, and a rate base of $1.3 billion. Our significant
energy infrastructure investments were the key drivers for the proposed increase.
The settlement provides for a $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53%
equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. If the settlement is approved as filed, new rates are expected to be effective
in January 2017. Customer rates will be implemented over a two-year period.
In year one, customer bills will increase by $38 million and step up to $56 million in year two. DEP will reduce its cost
to remove the liability by $18 million in year one to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year
of rate implementation.
Based on the settlement, coal ash cost that we had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15-year amortization
period, and we agreed to defer any future rate cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone and we expect
an order from the commission in the coming weeks.
With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on slide 12.
Consistent with past practice, we will provide guidance for 2017, including a five-year capital plans during our
February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses, Electric & Gas Infrastructure and Commercial
Renewables, of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. Accretion
from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017, a strong first year, reflecting the benefits of early
integration. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February.
International results through closing, use of sales proceeds and National Methanol are expected to contribute between
$0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to Other and contribute $0.05 per share based on
prevailing Brent crude oil prices, and our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to step down in 2017. The
use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion will displace future
financings at the holding company, and will also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates.
We estimate first quarter operating results from our International business could also add up to $0.05 per share of
earnings depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in
February.
I'll close with slide 13. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which
includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. Within months, we expect to complete our
multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low risk, high quality earnings and cash flows, and
supporting our long-term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the
energy grid, and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers.
With that, let's open the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Hi, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Michael.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning. Could you discuss in a little more detail the – I think you said that there
was – the results from Commercial Renewables was not as what you expected. Just wondering if we could discuss
some of the issues surrounding that?

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Michael, I would direct you to slide 16 of the deck, which gives you a comparison of where we
are for year-to-date results against original expectations. So you see Commercial has delivered about $65 million of net
income against our original expectations of $140 million. We are not expecting that we'll deliver $140 million for 2016.
Some of that shortfall will be the result of lesser capital deployment, as Steve mentioned, returns have been very
market-driven, so great for customers, but low for investors. And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on
wind and solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So, those are the two things I'd point to.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Is it that the market for investment has become more competitive than you expected, let's
say, a year ago, that returns on acquisitions are just smaller than you thought or is this more of a weather issue?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think returns are lower, Michael, and I think the other thing to consider for Duke as an investor,
we are in an NOL position as a result of bonus depreciation. And so as we look at returns, we consider that the
monetization of tax credits need to reflect when we will be a cash taxpayer. So, the DCF of that can challenge our
returns. So, that's something that we'll continue to monitor as the time progresses. We understand the market well. We
have great expertise in both wind and solar based on the business that we built. We still like the business. But, we are
disciplined in the way we deploy the capital based on the returns we're seeing in the market.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: How long does that NOL position go out to? What do you expect?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Currently, we are expecting, assuming there are no further extensions of the bonus, that we
would come out of the NOL position in 2019. We would then begin using tax credits, ITC production tax credits, so we
would still not be a significant cash taxpayer for a few years after that.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: So that would – that in theory could make the Renewables business a little more
competitive for you, right?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think as we get closer to that period of tax where we burn off the NOL, that will impact our
view of returns, Michael, because the relative value of the tax credits will be greater.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Right. Understood. All right. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good morning. First question, Steve, the proceeds from international sale, as you mentioned, you're
going to use to pay off parent debt. Can you remind me, on average, what's the average interest rate on the debt that
you're paying off?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, when we did the calculation there, we came out with roughly $0.05. We're looking at a
long-term holding company rate. It might be in the 3.5% to 4%-type range of that nature. So that's the basis of what
we're looking at, and we baked that into our financing plans anticipating that to happen. We'll initially take down some
bridge facilities of shorter term with the proceeds.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. But there's enough – that high cost or relatively high-cost debt available to get that kind of
savings?

<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, what I'm speaking about is we've anticipated this and baked it into our financing plans
to avoid issuances of HoldCo debt at that higher level.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. So one way to think about it is $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion of proceeds coming into the
holding company. So the average rate that Steve referenced is consistent with that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. Then second, the Commercial results that you're getting, $65 million year-to-date or $140
million for the year, I guess a little lower now, how much of that, roughly, is recognition of tax credits?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Tax credits are going to be a significant part of those renewable returns. Ali, I don't have a exact
number in front of me. We do have a modest amount of contribution in Commercial from the pipelines at this point
through the third quarter. We'll move that to the Gas Infrastructure segment in the fourth quarter, [ph] how would you
add? (29:39)
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct. The results for the Commercial Portfolio reflects small amounts of AFUDC on
the pipelines. That will be growing. But, right now, it is primarily from the Renewables business, and that is heavily
driven by the recognition of the tax benefits.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Last question. Lynn, as you look at this portfolio now post the international sale and you look
at your utility footprint, is everything essentially core as far as Duke is concerned? And related to that, as you're
looking at growth over at least the next three, four years, does M&A come back into the mix for you as you're looking
to deliver growth for shareholders?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So, Ali, the businesses that we own coming out of the transition are all core. And I think the
strength of the franchises we own in the Southeast with Gas and Electric and then a strong position in the Midwest are
all core businesses. And we'll be looking to drive growth through investments that build on cleaner forms of generation
