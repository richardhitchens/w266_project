MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Avon's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute
to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions]
I'll now turn the conference over to Gina Grant, Capital Markets Treasurer. Ms. Grant, you may begin your conference.
Gina Grant
Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Avon's fourth quarter and full year 2016
results. I'm here with Sheri McCoy, Avon's CEO; and Jamie Wilson, Executive Vice President and CFO. Jim Scully,
our COO is also with us today. Sheri will make some opening remarks, including her perspective on our overall
performance, progress on our Transformation Plan and highlight our 2017 priorities. Jamie will then take you through
fourth quarter and full year results. We will then have our usual Q&A session.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to
investors, although they should not be considered superior to the measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A
reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings
release located on the Investor Relations section of our website.
Our call will also contain forward-looking statements that concern our business and financial strategies including our
Transformation Plan, cost actions and savings, as well as outlook, performance trends and the impact of foreign
currency, taxes and tax rates. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in the cautionary
statement available on our Investor Relations website and in our SEC filings.
I will now hand the call over to Sheri.

Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Gina. Good morning and thank you for joining Avon's 2016 full year and fourth quarter earnings call.
Joining me today is our new CFO, Jamie Wilson who joined Avon on January 2. Jim Scully, Chief Operating officer is
also on the call with us today.
I will cover three areas on today's call. First, I will provide my perspective on our fourth quarter and full year 2016
results, including top market and category performance. Second, I will update you on our progress against our
three-year Transformation Plan and lastly, consistent with our approach in 2016, I will highlight our 2017 priorities.
In 2017, we continue to expect to make progress on our Transformation Plan and while we will provide a long-term
framework for our financial objectives, we will not give specific 2017 guidance as we allow Jamie time to settle into
his role as CFO. I will then turn the call to Jamie for a more detailed discussion of our financials and we will then open
the call for a Q&A session.
Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed with our fourth order results. It is clear that we have more work to do on
our multi-year transformation journey to improve consistency of performance, particularly in a handful of markets. For
the quarter, both our constant currency revenue and our active representative growth came in below expectations. On
the other hand, I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making on improving our profitability as measured by
our operating margin. I will provide more details in a few minutes.
While I will spend the majority of the time this morning discussing fourth quarter, I would like to give a brief summary
of our full-year performance. Overall for the year, and notwithstanding our softer fourth quarter performance, I believe
we made good progress. Our Transformation Plan is well underway and was a key enabler of our 2016 financial
performance. We are pleased with our improvement in profitability and expanded operating margin for 2016 despite
challenging global economic and sociopolitical headwinds.
Importantly, we delivered approximately $120 million in cost savings in 2016 above our target for the year. We also
significantly strengthened our balance sheet.
Specifically, full-year 2016 total revenues from reportable segments was $5.7 billion, and grew 3% in constant dollars.
Average order was up 4% driven by pricing and mix. Active Representatives were down 1%, which is below our
long-term goal of 1% to 2% Active Representative growth, driven primarily by Asia-Pacific, Ending Representatives
were flat year-over-year.
Avon's top 10 markets representing approximately 70% of revenue performed well and outpaced the growth of the total
company with higher average order growth and higher growth in Active and Ending Representatives. Eight of our top
ten markets grew local currency revenue with Colombia and Turkey declining for full year.
For total Avon, not simply reportable segments, adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points year-over-year to
6.5%, despite a negative FX impact of approximately 310 basis points. We are pleased with the improvement in
operating margin. This was largely driven by a combination of initiatives, including pricing actions and SG&A
improvement from our cost savings work.
Now, turning to our fourth quarter performance which, as I said, was disappointing, considering the positive trend in
the first three quarters of the year. Revenue fell short of expectations, and while we made significant progress taking
out costs, this was dampened by an unexpected increase in bad debt of roughly 210 basis points or approximately $35
million, primarily within our Brazilian business.
Revenues from reportable segments was $1.6 billion, flat in constant dollars. Active Representatives were down 2%
driven primarily by declines in Malaysia, Colombia, Turkey and Italy.
Ending Representatives were flat year-on-year as declines in Asia-Pacific offset growth in EMEA and South Latin
America. Average order was up 2% driven by an 8% increase in price and mix. Adjusted operating margin grew 130
basis points to 7.3%, primarily as a result of our pricing initiatives and cost savings, partially offset by bad debt
expense primarily in Brazil and a 100 basis point negative impact from FX.

In the fourth quarter, the top 10 markets once again grew faster than the rest of the world. However, growth was slower
than prior quarters. While we typically do not provide market level details, I would like to provide a few numbers to
give you a better perspective on our fourth quarter performance.
In the fourth quarter, our top 10 markets grew revenue low-single digit and the rest of the world declined mid-single
digit. For the full year 2016, our top markets grew constant dollar revenue, mid-single digit and the rest of the world
declined low-single digits. The slowdown in fourth quarter was primarily driven by Active Representatives. However, I
think it's important and helpful to put this in context. Our Active Representatives performance in the fourth quarter was
driven by weakness in two of our top 10 markets Colombia and Turkey, as well as a few mid-sized markets, most
notably Malaysia and Italy.
The revenue deceleration was a continuation of the trends we discussed on our third quarter earnings call. In the top 10
markets, Turkey and Colombia were again weak. However, decline in revenue in Russia also contributed to the fourth
quarter revenue shortfall. Colombia and Turkey continued to underperform as a result of macro and pricing issues
we've been facing for the past few quarters. In Russia, where we were responding to the impact of FX, we got ahead of
ourselves with pricing, specifically the pacing of our pricing actions and I'll speak about this in more detail later.
In the case of the mid-sized markets, we continue to be challenged in a handful of these markets, in aggregate they
impact overall company results. We've been making changes in the field in these markets to improve the experience for
the Representatives, specifically in Malaysia, Italy and Saudi Arabia. This has proven more difficult than anticipated
due to the complexity associated with making multiple changes concurrently in each market. I believe we are taking the
right actions to enhance the Representative experience and we'll deliver improved performance over the course of 2017.
While Jamie will speak in more detail about the results for the year and the quarter by segment, I will spend some time
discussing our top three markets, including macro trends and overall performance for the year and the quarter. In the
interest of time, I will be speaking about our top three instead of our top five. I would just comment that the Philippines
and the UK are on track and in line with our expectations.
Starting with Brazil, our largest market. In the fourth quarter, Brazil continued to post strong growth, delivering 7%
revenue growth in local currency, driven primarily by higher average order. Throughout 2016, Brazil has been growing
and improving share even with the backdrop of a tough economic, political and competitive environment. There have
been pricing with inflation in addition to raising price through innovation and mix.
In fourth quarter, we once again gained significant market share in Color, Fragrance and Skincare. We had strong
innovation in upper mass with successful launches of Avon Life which was created with renowned designer Kenzo
Takada and our own Avon Attraction fragrance. We are pleased that in 2016 we grew our upper mass brands at a faster
rate than the overall business, in all Beauty categories. We also added incremental advertising behind our Beauty for a
Purpose positioning in fourth quarter, which helped drive incremental sales.
Brazil's Representative recruitment efforts were solid throughout 2016, resulting in a modest increase in Ending
Representatives for the year. However, given the deteriorating economic environment, we saw a higher than expected
level of bad debt in the second half of the year. There are two primary reasons for this. One, the inability of some
consumers to pay. And two, in order to assist with new Representative recruiting, the team adjusted credit terms.
Moving forward, we're talking actions to adjust both of these factors by first, enhancing our collection processes, and
second, heightening our recruiting terms. We expect that this may potentially result in a moderated new Representative
growth.
Brazil, also launched a new digital platform to improve Representative engagement, and to make it easier for
Representatives to do business with Avon. We have implemented our new front-end for both Representatives and our
sales teams. This is a highly integrated digital platform, which provides her with capabilities, including mobile
responsiveness, better order placement, up-sell and cross-sell capabilities, social network integration, training videos,
credit management, data management and an easy online returns and exchange process.

We began rolling this out in third quarter, and we'll complete the implementation in first quarter of this year. To-date,
we see an increase in mobile use, representative productivity, and the implementation has gone smoothly. This is a
great new solution for our Representatives and our field associates, making it easier for them to run their businesses.
For the full year, Brazil, was above our expectation with revenue up 2% in local currency, including a negative impact
of 6% from MVA and IPI tax, driven primarily by higher average order. Moving ahead into 2017, we expect Brazil to
continue to deliver solid performance.
Turning to Mexico. In the fourth quarter, Mexico performed in line with our expectations delivering solid performance
with 2% local currency revenue growth, primarily driven by average order. We have successfully implemented pricing
with inflation and competitive pricing across key categories. The team continues to work on improving Representative
retention with their on-boarding and sales leadership initiatives.
Mexico delivered solid growth in Beauty due to the execution of strong innovation in Color with Avon True, in
Skincare with a new collagen and in personal care with Avon Care. The Fashion & Home category growth was
constrained as the team was flowing excess inventory in the fourth quarter and we anticipate this will continue in the
first quarter of 2017.
For the full-year, Mexico performed well with revenue up 5% in local currency, primarily driven by higher average
order. For 2017, we expect modest growth for Mexico. However, given the geopolitical dynamics, there is concern
about a potential impact on consumer confidence and spending. We will monitor and consider this in our planning and
execution strategies throughout the year.
Next, Russia. Performance in Russia in the first portion of the year was favorable, but we were disappointed by the
fourth quarter performance. In fourth quarter, revenue declined 3% in local currency, driven by a decline in average
order and a slight decline in Active Representatives. As I mentioned, the Russian team implemented significant pricing
primarily in Fashion & Home to recover margin as a result of the impact of FX. In hindsight, the team's pricing actions
were out of sync with the market. We were increasing prices as the market was moving in the other direction.
We are addressing pricing and at the same time, working to improve the competitiveness of our Fashion & Home
portfolio. We are also making some modifications to better balance pricing units for a few value-oriented Beauty
products that help drive Representative and consumer activity.
Jamie and I were in Russia in mid-January to review their plan and actions to improve performance. We were pleased
that the team is tackling the challenges with a sense of urgency and we expect to see improved performance in the
second half of 2017. Russia grew 9% in local currency for the full year driven by Active Representatives and average
order. Ending Representatives were also up for the year.
Now, turning to category performance for total reportable segments. For fourth quarter, Beauty was flat overall in
constant dollars with 1% growth in Fragrance, 2% decline in Color, and flat performance in Skincare. Fashion & Home
declined 2%.
Jamie will discuss units and pricing more broadly a little later, however, I would add that on a category basis, we saw a
higher level of unit decline in Fashion & Home due to pricing that we took to cover currency movements, as well as
decisions we made to scale back in a couple of areas in the Home category.
The bigger decline in units was in the value price segment, particularly in the Color category, given consumer price
sensitivity in some of our markets. And while we drove unit growth in the mass and upper mass segments, particularly
where we had strong new product innovation, this was not enough to offset the loss in units in the value segment.
For the full year, Beauty grew 2% in constant dollars with Fragrance growing 4%, Color growing 2%, and Skincare
growing 1%. Fashion & Home grew 2% in constant dollars year-on-year.
Now, turning to our Transformation Plan. We've accomplished a lot since we outlined our plan just over a year ago,
making good progress during our first year of the three-year Transformation Plan against our three strategic pillars;
invest in growth, drive out cost and improve financial resilience. We will continue to build on these as we deliver the

plans for 2017 and 2018.
In 2016, we successfully separated our North America business. Our strategy to focus on our top 10 markets resulted in
improved growth and overall performance in our top markets. As we move through 2017, one of our key priorities is to
deliver more consistent and sustainable revenue growth across our top 15 markets, which represents approximately
80% of Avon's revenue. As we said when we launched our Transformation Plan, in our first year, we focused more
heavily on driving out costs and improving financial resilience. We've made good progress here and Jamie will discuss
this in more detail shortly.
As we move into 2017, we are now able to place more emphasis on investing in growth. As a reminder, we outlined an
investment of $350 million in growth over three years, which includes an estimated $150 million in media and social
selling and $200 million in service model evolution and information technology, primarily in capital expense, to
improve the Representative experience. To accelerate growth, we must invest in the Avon brand and in improving the
Representative experience, all underpinned by the evolution of our social selling model.
Let me briefly discuss five key areas of focus and investment. First, strengthening the Avon brand is a key driver of our
success. While the brand is globally recognized, we must continue to build our relevance with women of all ages. In
2016, we successfully rolled out our Beauty for a Purpose positioning to all markets around the world. The attributes of
this program speak directly to Beauty and the importance of empowering women, which are proving very positive.
We are shifting more resources to digital and we've had huge success in the online element of our social engagement
with Representatives and consumers. Avon grew 25% in total global social media reach during 2016 to 20 million
Facebook fans, 280 million YouTube views and a doubling of Instagram followers to nearly 2 million. During 2017,
we will build on these successes with incremental investments in both digital and TV in top markets where we've
delivered the best return on investment.
Second, during 2016, we added to our strong innovation pipeline with many successful new products. For example, in
Fragrance, with products like Attraction and Avon Life, in Color with Avon Ultra Matte Lipstick and Big & Daring
Mascara, and in Skincare with innovative new products from the Anew brand.
And in 2017, we once again have an exciting pipeline of innovative products. For example, in the first half of the year,
we are introducing terrific new Color lines with Avon True for the [ph] loyalist (18:40) consumer and mark for the
color enthusiast, which skews to millennials.
We've been focusing on our top 40 brands, which represent about 80% of our business. These brands meet specific
consumer needs and offer choices in value, mass and upper mass. We are particularly pleased with our ability to
compete in upper mass fragrances in Brazil, which was the key objective for us in 2016. We will continue to drive this
model during 2017 with a goal of appealing to a broader spectrum of women.
Third, pricing discipline is also an important revenue driver for Avon and for our Representatives, and we've made
good progress. That said, there's a bit of an art to pricing in addition to science, and it's fair to say we are still learning
in some markets. This continues to be a focus for us in 2017.
Fourth, improving Representative engagement is one of the most important drivers of growth. We know from our
Active Representatives metrics that we've not made the progress we'd like in this area, particularly in some markets.
During 2016, the areas of focus for the top 10 markets was to enhance our onboarding process, begin implementation
segmentation to offer more customized approaches for Representatives, and improve our service model to make it
easier to the business with Avon.
For perspective, approximately 60% of sales are generated by people who've been with Avon for 18 months or more,
this highlights the importance of investing in onboarding, training, and retaining Representatives. In 2017, we will
continue to improve our onboarding processes for Representatives, including offering training to enable them to build
confidence and be successful in building their earnings.
Segmentation work is underway in a number of our top 10 markets, and we're adding more resources, as part of a
global initiative coordinated by our project management office. It will take some time to fully embed this approach in

our business as we build the systems to enable segmentation.
And lastly, to improve Representative engagement, it is critical that we evolve our service model. We plan to invest
$200 million in systems that is being phased over a three-year plan period. In 2016, as mentioned earlier, we initiated a
new service platform in our largest market, Brazil, which is proving to be a success with Representatives.
We have a rollout program to bring this approach to other key markets, starting later in 2017. We remain committed to
our long-term goal of 1% to 2% active Representative growth, and have plans for onboarding, segmentation and
modernizing our business to support this goal.
Lastly, we are a face-to-face social selling business. The opportunity for Avon is to more broadly embed digital and
online social selling into the fabric of our business. During 2017, we will be piloting in Argentina, a new all digital
platform between our Representatives and her consumers, personalizing this service at any point in the customer
journey, face-to-face or digital. Improved segmentation and integration of digital platforms and systems are part of our
multi-year journey and will help bring social selling to scale and underpin the growth of our business. Overall, we are
pleased with our progress against our Transformation Plan in 2016.
I will now turn to Jamie for him to review more details for 2016.
Jamie Wilson
Thank you, Sheri, and thanks again to all of you for joining the call today. I am very happy to become part of the Avon
team and to be joining a company underpinned by strong heritage and purpose and with associates passionate by
building their brands.
In my first seven weeks, I've been fortunate to visit a number of our locations including a market visit to Russia, one of
our top markets. I believe, it is an exciting time to join Avon that is in the early stages of implementing its
Transformation Plan, which is intended to return the business to long-term sustainable growth.
As the first year of our Transformation Plan, there was much to achieve in 2016. I will discuss the two financial pillars
shortly. But before going into detail on the financial results, I wanted to pick up on a couple of comments made by
Sheri regarding our growth agenda in addition to her discussions on Active Representatives.
As she set out, there's a lot to drive in this area and given the diversity of our operations. We saw a degree of
inconsistency in execution as we implemented the changes. Pricing is one of the key focus areas, but is not a single
dimension. There is a need to balance competitiveness with price and volume by product, by market to generate the
best return as measured by profit.
We've begun the journey to improve our profitable revenue growth management skills throughout the organization with
the aim of improving our performance and consistency. This journey will take time, but we should see improvements
year-on-year. 2016 did see an improvement in our ability to take price, particularly with our innovation. However,
across the portfolio, we did see mid-single digit decline in units sold, which negated some of the benefits.
Secondly, due to the combination of factors, the occurrence of a sizable bad debt in Brazil marked an otherwise good
year. We continue to look at our management of accounts receivable and we're implementing improved processes to
better manage this risk.
Our business is driven by campaign cycles. So, there is a lead time between taking action and the manifestation of that
action in the marketplace. We are working at improving our market insight and creating the flexibility to respond in a
timely manner to minimize this lead time. However, we should expect the course corrections from the issues that we
saw in the fourth quarter to start taking traction in quarter two.
Now, turning to the detail of the 2016 performance. Please note that my comments will primarily focus on adjusted
results for the year and fourth quarter. GAAP results, along with the reconciliation tables are included in our press
release issued earlier today and posted them on the Investor Relations section of our website.

Starting with the full-year performance including highlights from the fourth quarter. For the full year, reported total
revenue declined by 7% due to the negative impact of foreign currency that grew 2% in constant dollars. From
reportable segments, total revenue declined 7% due to a negative impact of foreign currency that grew 3% in constant
dollars.
Active Representatives declined 1% as growth in EMEA was offset by declines in APAC and South Latin America.
Average order grew by 4% and price mix rose 7% as we continue to benefit from pricing.
Ending Representatives were flat as growth in EMEA and South Latin America was offset by a decline in Asia Pacific.
In the fourth quarter, reported total revenue as well as total revenue from reportable segments declined by 2% due to
the negative impact of foreign currency, but were flat in constant dollars.
Active Representatives from reportable segments declined 2% across all segments. Average order in our reportable
segments grew by 2% and price mix rose 8%, again, as we benefited from pricing.
Full year adjusted operating profit was $372 million, an increase of $21 million with the fourth quarter being $114
million, an increase of $17 million. Full year adjusted operating margin improved 80 basis points to 6.5% primarily
driven by the favorable impact of price and mix, as well as continued benefits from cost saving initiatives. These
benefits were partially offset by 310 basis points of headwinds from foreign currency, as well as an increase in bad debt
primarily in Brazil.
Constant dollar adjusted operating margin increases in EMEA and North Latin America were offset by declines in
South Latin America and APAC.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating margin improvement was 130 basis points to 7.3% with 100 basis points of
headwinds from foreign currency. Increases in EMEA, North Latin America and APAC were partially offset by decline
in South Latin America. The net adjusted operating margin improvement reflects continued benefit from pricing and
cost initiatives, partly offset by higher bad debt expense.
Turning now to our reportable segments. EMEA has shown strong performance for us this year. For the full year,
reported revenue declined by 4%, while constant dollar revenue rose by4%. EMEA growth in constant currency was
driven by growth in both Active Representatives and average order. Ending Representatives increased, driven primarily
by growth in Russia and South Africa.
The EMEA segment margin was 15.4%, up 140 basis points, primarily due to the favorable net impact of mix and
pricing and lower supply chain costs as well as revenue leverage and lower advertising costs, partly offset by negative
impact of foreign currency transaction costs of an estimated 300 basis points. In Russia, local currency revenue rose
9%, driven primarily by Active Representatives. Local currency revenue in the UK was relatively unchanged as
average order growth was largely offset by decrease in Active Representatives.
Now, turning to the fourth quarter. Reported revenue in the EMEA region (sic) [segment] declined by 7% and constant
dollar revenue declined 3%, primarily driven by the revenue declines, Sheri spoke to, in Turkey, Russia and some of
our mid-sized markets.
The EMEA segment margin for the fourth quarter was 18%, up 240 basis points, primarily due to the favorable net
impact of mix and pricing and benefits from cost saving initiatives as well as lower advertising costs, partly offset by
the negative impact of foreign currency transaction costs of an estimated 100 basis points.
Moving to South Latin America, for the full year reported revenue decreased 7%, while in constant dollars revenue
increased 5%. Constant dollar growth was adversely impacted by an estimated 2 points due to additional state taxes
implemented in late 2015, known as MVA and the Brazil IPI tax that we anniversaried in May of 2016.
Argentina contributed 4 points to the segment's constant dollar revenue growth. Constant dollar revenue also benefited
from higher average order while Active Representative declined. Ending Representatives increased primarily driven by
Brazil. The South Latin America segment margin was 9.3%, down 100 basis points versus prior year, driven by an

estimated 320 basis point negative impact from foreign currency transaction costs and 200 basis points from higher bad
debt, primarily in Brazil due to the macroeconomic conditions coupled with actions taken to recruit new
Representatives, partially offset by the favorable impact of price and mix and lower supply chain costs.
In Brazil, local currency revenue for the year increased 2%. MVA and IPI taxes negatively impacted local currency
growth by an estimated 6 points. This revenue growth was driven by average order while Active Representatives were
flat.
Now turning to the fourth quarter, reported revenue in the South Latin America segment grew 9% or 6% in constant
dollars, primarily driven by constant dollar revenue growth in Brazil and Argentina. South Latin America segment
margin for the fourth quarter was 7.2% down 190 basis points, driven by 560 basis points of higher bad debt primarily
in Brazil, and estimated 90 basis points of impact (sic) [90 basis point negative impact] from foreign currency
transaction costs and higher advertising costs partially offset by the favorable impacts of price mix and lower supply
chain costs.
Moving to North Latin America. For the full-year, reported revenue declined 8% while constant dollar revenue grew
3%. This growth was driven by higher average order. Active Representatives were essentially flat while Ending
Representatives saw a modest decline versus the prior year. The North Latin America segment margin was 13.8%, up
190 basis points despite 150 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency transaction costs. The improvement was
primarily driven by the favorable impact of price and mix. In Mexico, revenue grew 5% in local currency, driven by
higher average order, which benefited primarily from pricing as Active Representatives were flat.
Turning to the fourth quarter, reported revenue in the North Latin America segment declined 10%, but grew 1% in
constant dollars primarily driven by Mexico. The North Latin America segment margin in the fourth quarter was
14.4%, up 150 basis points driven by the favorable impact of price and mix, partially offset by higher supply chain
costs and 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency transaction costs.
Moving now to Asia-Pacific, for the full-year, reported revenue declined 11% and constant dollar revenue was down
7%. The segment's Active Representatives declined partially offset by average order (sic) [by higher average order].
Ending Representatives decreased versus the prior year. The Asia-Pacific segment margin was 10.8%, down 20 basis
points from last year due to the unfavorable impact of mix and pricing, partially offset by lower supply chain costs.
In the Philippines, local currency revenue grew 2% as higher average order was partially offset by a decline in Active
Representatives. As it relates to our China business, we've been working on a solution for our China business and are
making progress working through a number of different business considerations.
Now turning to the fourth quarter reported revenue in APAC, it declined by 9% and declined 6% in constant dollars as
growth in the Philippines was not enough to offset declines in other Asian markets. The Asia-Pacific segment margin
for the quarter was 12.2% up 310 basis points from last year due to lower field related expenses and supply chain costs,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of mix and pricing.
Moving to tax, the adjusted income tax provision of $166 million was roughly in line with the prior year. The effective
tax rate from the continuing operations was 399% for the full year and 83% on an adjusted basis. Once again, our
effective tax rate this year was negatively impacted by the country mix of earnings and the inability to recognize
additional deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions, including the impact caused by withholding taxes on the
repatriation of cash to the U.S.
Related to cash flow, operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 provided $128 million compared with $91
million in 2015. The year-over-year comparison benefited as 2015 results included a $67 million payment to the SEC
in connection with the FCPA settlement that did not recur this year. Cash flow provided by operating activities also
benefited from lower operating tax payments, higher cash-related earnings as well as net proceeds related to settling a
professional services claim, offset by the unfavorable impact of the timing of payments primarily for inventory,
increasing levels of accounts receivable and a 2016 contribution to the pension plan for corporate U.S.-based
associates.

Free cash flow totaled $35 million for 2016. While this is an improvement over last year, it does fall short of our stated
guidance, mainly due to lower earnings and an increase in accounts receivables, mainly in South Latin America.
Working capital improved five days operationally when compared to a year-ago driven by continued focus on reducing
inventory and extending payment terms, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, as previously noted.
Adjusted EPS for the full year was $0.04 per diluted share compared to $0.01 per diluted share a year ago. While the
fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.01 per diluted share compared to $0.00 per diluted share a year ago. The
year-over-year comparison of adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by a number of factors. Foreign currency has an
estimated $0.28 per share negative impact with $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. The earnings allocated to
convertible preferred stock reduced adjusted EPS as compared to the prior year by approximately $0.04 per share for
the full year and $0.01 in the quarter. The loss experienced by the North American business for the year negatively
impacted adjusted EPS for the full year and fourth quarter by approximately $0.03 and $0.01 per share respectively.
As a reminder, while we own approximately 10% (sic) [20%] of the North American business and, as such, we will
share in a portion of any of the profit, losses of that business, we have no additional capital requirements. Lastly the
impact of devaluation in Egypt on our working capital balances had a negative impact of $0.04 per share for both the
full year and the fourth quarter.
Lastly I'll turn to the financial aspects of our Transformation Plan. 2016 was the first year of our Transformation Plan
and was focused on two of our three pillars. Significantly reducing and aligning our cost structure while improving the
overall financial resilience of the company. We've made good progress on both these fronts.
Our cost saving target for the year was $70 million from the Transformation Plan, plus $20 million to cover stranded
costs that resulted from the separation of our North American business, for a total of $90 million. As Sheri mentioned,
we overachieved this cost saving target realizing approximately $120 million in savings during 2016 from our
operating model on supply chain and sourcing initiatives.
The annualized run rate of these savings is approximately $180 million. Specifically, we've made significant progress
in our operating model work, which includes eliminating redundant regional layers, further reducing the corporate
center and shifting costs out of the U.S. We've also made steady progress in optimizing our sourcing spend and work is
underway on our supply chain initiatives to rationalize our manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, although
these projects are more long-term in nature. We remain on track to deliver the $350 million in Transformation Plan
savings over the three years.
With regards to financial resilience, specifically the balance sheet, during 2016, we benefited from $435 million of
Cerberus investment. And we took steps to reduce our leverage by prepaying approximately $260 million of debt. This
is slightly above our goal of $250 million of debt and extended our maturity profile from our debt strengthening our
balance sheet. This puts us in a good position to continue execution against our Transformation Plan.
As we look forward to 2017, some of the issues affecting the fourth quarter revenue growth will affect the first quarter,
but we believe the actions we are taking will begin to address this throughout the balance of the year.
Currently, based on the forward rates, we are expecting a continued easing of foreign exchange headwinds during the
year, although given the macro and political environment, this may change. We will continue to progress against our
Transformation Plan. Specifically for 2017, we expect to achieve a total of $230 million in cost savings on a
cumulative basis (sic) [in total]. This includes a run rate of the 2016 savings plus cost savings from the current year
initiatives.
In relation to investments in growth, we will increase capital expenditure on IT and supply chain by approximately $65
million. We remain committed to driving high quality sustainable earnings growth.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Sheri.

Thank you, Jamie. I will briefly summarize our key priorities for 2017. We will work to improve the consistency of
performance in our top markets by deploying more resources and focus on the top 15 markets, which represents
approximately 80% of revenue.
We will be driving growth, strengthening the Avon brand by increasing investment in advertising and digital platforms
in key markets, launching innovative products based on consumer insights and new technologies to appeal to a wider
consumer base across key Beauty categories, building on our pricing discipline, and importantly, continuing to improve
Representative engagement to make it easier to do business with Avon and earn with Avon.
We expect this will increase Active Representatives with a goal to deliver flat to 1% growth in Active Representatives
as we exit the year. And in 2017, we will continue with our cost takeout initiatives to deliver our goal of $350 million
over the three-year Transformation Plan period.
In closing, we are confident we have the right plans in place to deliver our goals and we remain on track for our stated
long-term financial goals of achieving mid-single digit constant dollar revenue growth, 1% to 2% Active
Representative growth and low-double digit adjusted operating margin.
Thank you again for joining us. Jamie and I are now ready to take your questions.

Please note, you'll be limited to one question and a related follow-up question until all callers in the queue have posed
their questions. Please note, once you have asked your related follow-up question, your line will be muted once again.
[Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from
Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hey. A couple of questions. First, the bad debt stuff in Brazil. Is that all cleaned up or do you
think there's going to be more of a tail going into next year?
And then longer-term, which is – I don't know how to model the company anymore, because the cash flow guidance
came in way lower than you guys said three months ago. And organic growth region by region just keeps going from
guardrail to guardrail. So, I know you don't want to give us bespoke guidance, but can you just give us some direction
next year in terms of organic growth and margins? Just are you going to grow organically and do you think margins
will be up versus 2016? Thanks.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Well, let me try and answer both of those. In the bad debt, obviously, our business does have bad
debt expense on an ongoing basis, but this specific thing, we believe, is fully cleared up and booked in the 2016 results.
So, we wouldn't be expecting a flow over of that into 2017.
In terms of the modeling the business, I mean, I think the what we have said consistently is that we are on track with
our Transformation Plan. We set out the guidelines on that which was to get ourselves to mid-single digit revenue
growth and double digit operating margin. And year one of that plan, which was the year that we're reporting on,
actually made progress on the operating margin. And we are expecting to continue to do that. So, I guess, we've got to
rely on that guidance for you and start modeling towards getting to that and in the course of conclusion of our
Transformation Plan.

inflation, actually down 1%. And Active Representatives also really pretty interesting decline there, and really EMEA,
which we haven't seen declines in the past couple of years. I'm still trying to understand what's happening. And as you
know, we've had this long view – long-held view that you're going to need to spend a lot more back than you think to
actually stabilize and grow the business.
Is that what you're ahead of that, given some discussions you've had about spending back? And if you could help us
really understand and quantify what you're going to spend on? I know you said ad spend and you said digital, but where
you're going to spend on, how much you think you have to spend on each of those buckets, and how much of that is
going to drive kind of improved top line growth versus just kind of stabilizing your competitive situation? And then I
do have a follow up.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Well, perhaps I'll just speak to investment and then I think Sheri will talk about the
Representative piece. I mean, we've consistently said that we needed to invest back into the Avon brand and our
products. And Sheri mentioned that which is going to be the key priorities and also the part of the Transformation Plan.
And we did highlight that of the $350 million we are expecting to take out, we'd be reinvesting a $150 million of that
over the lifetime of the plan back into that additional advertising. And it's not just prioritizing, it's across the whole
spectrum, as Sheri said, across the aspects of digital and other aspects of the business.
The other piece though that we've also consistently talked about is our investment in our underlying systems platforms
to enable us to make the relationship between the reps and Avon easier to manage and we started that process and that
will also go through into the pilot and the other discussions we're having in shaping our social selling. I think, within
that we were talking about spending an additional $200 million, that's obviously capital. So it's not going to hit directly
into the P&L, but will come back into the P&L by way of deprecation.
So I think, we've been fairly consistent on these buckets as to where we're investing. We believe that they are designed
to help us improve the sustainable growth of the business.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I would just add to that that as we look at and I'll use Brazil as an example, I'll point
to that as an example where we're very focused this year on driving market share, putting the investment and making
sure, we continue to manage the recruitment of Active Reps, we've had good success. I think, the challenge for us is
making sure that we, from a portfolio perspective, have more consistency of performance.
But we have a number of success stories within the market. Unfortunately, we don't have enough of those yet and as
we're driving significant amount of change in terms of how we're driving pricing, how we're driving innovation,
streamlining our brands, what we're seeing is inconsistent performance. And that's the area of opportunity for us going
forward. But we need to continue to invest. And we will prioritize that investment across our top 15 markets.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So I guess, I'm not – and Jamie I'm using both your words and Sheri your words. I'm not arguing
that you're being inconsistent with what you said you're going to invest. I'm observing that there are inconsistent
results, so you may actually have to up the investment quite significantly.
And as it ties to that – would love your response to that. But as it ties to that, your free cash flow, I mean, look, it's
nowhere near where it should have been, even if we give you the full credit of assuming you thought you were going to
get all the bad debt back, right. So I don't know, exactly how that works from your expectations. But totally nowhere
near where you thought it was going to be. And I get worried a little about when I hear about relaxing credit terms and
it backfired on you, how does that make me feel about your Representative base at this point. So, putting all these
things together, it makes me feel like, yeah, you're saying, you're going to spend $150 million, I get it, but it's not
enough, it's going to have be a lot more. And I don't feel more comfortable after either of you kind of told me that, yes,
you see some spots where there is improvements, but overall there is not enough of them. So, I think, you've got to
spend a ton more on this. So, a little bit of that [ph] and tied to (49:20) free cash flow. Sorry, I'm going on. Thanks.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Okay. Well, let me just take that, I mean I don't accept your [ph] concept (49:26) we'll have to
spend a ton more. I mean, there is a [ph] concept (49:29) on dollars you have to spend and there is time and training
and skills you have to build. A lot of these skills that you're trying to improve so that you can actually optimize things
don't happen overnight. So, it does take time for you to get around the whole of your leadership base and out into the

Representatives to train them to improve what we're trying to do in these areas. So, a lot of it can just be time rather
than necessarily lots of money being thrown at the problem.
And I think that the point we're making here is that we've obviously – the success stories that we've seen, particularly in
places like Brazil show that we're on the right track and doing the right things, what we now need to do is to make sure
that all those leanings trickled out into the other markets and we eliminate the inconsistencies.
But also Sheri talked a little bit about some of the model changes to make the markets more secure, some of the
mid-market model changes we're making. And so you've got to look at these things and give them time to actually take
traction. It doesn't mean that spending twice as much money would actually improve the problem any quicker. There is
going to be a pace at which the organization can absorb these changes.
So, I do think that we believe that we're on track. We have acknowledged that it was inconsistent in 2016 and our job is
to make that less inconsistent or more consistent in 2017. And so, I guess, that's where I would come back to on that
one.
In terms of cash, yes, we did invest the cash and obviously items like the bad debt and all these things were a
compounding factor in that. As we went through the year, there was some closing of the information there because of
the bank strike in Brazil in September. So, as we came out of quarter three, some of that information was not as
obvious because, I think, there was approximately around one month bank strike that meant it was difficult for the
Representatives to post cash. So, I think that that came as slightly an unexpected issue in quarter four and we'd expect
that to clear up as we go forward.
The point in relaxing credit terms is, yes, there was a little bit of that in Brazil in 2016, but it's not a general policy of
ours. And, therefore, I wouldn't be reading across that to sort of underlying trend and attracting Representatives and by
relaxing credit terms. That is not the case, it was a very specific action for a limited period of time in one market. So it's
not a general read across the company. I'm not sure I've picked up all parts of your question, but I've tried my best to
get through most of them.

Your next question comes from Stephen Powers. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Yes. Hi. It's UBS. Thanks. So, first, just to go back to something we spoke about last
quarter, would you be able to give us the breakdown, the split, specifically in Brazil, when I look at that 7% constant
currency growth? The split between unit volume, shipping and handling, and underlying price mix in Brazil? And then
I have a follow-up.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, we don't break out..
<A - Jamie Wilson>: I'm not – as far as I'm aware, we don't normally break that out market-by-market.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Well, you did last quarter, but I'll let it rest. So, going back to Ali's question on
investments, I'm still not clear and perhaps you can clarify a little bit more. Just how much did you invest against the
$350 million overall objective, as we think about 2016? I guess, split between the CapEx you talked about and the
operational investments? And then as we think about the investment a year ahead, can you quantify, how much of the
investment falls into 2017, again, split between the capital side which, I think, you gave us some – I think, it was $65
million, but maybe you can just help us there and the operational side?
And just philosophically, where you have currency favorability because you spoke about that. And for example, I think,
you're going to have ruble versus zloty and euro benefits in Russia next year, probably similar in Brazil. Are you
inclined to spend that currency upside, that transactional currency upside back, kind of to Ali's question about
incremental investment? Or is that something you're going to let flow to margins, just again philosophically? Thanks.

<A - Jamie Wilson>: Yeah. I mean, you're right on the $65 million, what we said is that in this year there'll be
increasing spend from the capital side of our equation, in 2017. And we don't break out the marketing because we think
that's competitive information. We are reinvesting in line with our expectation to meet the $150 million that we talked
about reinvesting over the lifetime of the plan.
Clearly, last year was more focused on the two financial pillars and going forward we'll be more focused on the growth
pillars. So obviously, that number increases through time. In terms of the transactional currency, there will be some
favorabilities, and I'm sure, there'll also be some unfavorabilities. And I think, in balance, we will have to see how the
year comes through.
I come back to the point, we believe we're investing the right amount to get the business back into growth. We don't
believe that we're needing to change that investment number. We set out our plan wanting to reinvest the $350 million
and that's where we will continue to focus. And if our view on that changes then obviously we'll share that with you.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Okay. Just and those – that $350 million, that is 2015 dollars or just as I think about that
rippling through because the FX has obviously moved.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Yes, it will be – the $350 million based on the time we announced the Transformation Plan,
which was in the beginning of 2016.
<Q - Stephen R. Powers>: Great, thank you.

The next question comes from Steph Wissink. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Stephanie Schiller Wissink>: Hi, good morning, Piper Jaffray. Just one quick clarification. I think, you
mentioned cost saving $250 million cumulative, I didn't quite hear was it off the $180 million run rate or off of the
$120 million that you achieved. Just clarification there on that.
And then Sheri, a question for you just regarding the continuum of performance across your top markets because I can't
quite sense whether the spread is widening or narrowing, and if the goal is to narrow the continuum of performance,
what are the specific initiatives that you can do kind of globally to start to see some improved visibility and controls
and predictability around the business kind of market-by-market? Thank you.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Well, if I clean up the cost saving bit. The number that I said was $230 million by the end of this
year. What that constitutes is the $180 million run rate from 2016 plus an additional $50 million achieved in 2017,
obviously the run rate of the 2017 results will be higher, but they don't all come in on at the beginning of year. So,
we've used the half year convention on that, so effectively it's made up of $150 million brought forward from last year
and an additional $50 million achieved out of new initiatives in the current year.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Great. And as it relates to the top market growth, we are pleased that in aggregate we're
seeing for the year stronger performance. One of the challenges we saw, specifically in fourth quarter was Russia. If we
dive into what the opportunity is to get more consistency across those markets, it's really around driving Active
Representatives growth consistently and that's the area of focus for us in 2017, as well as, as we're implementing
pricing, it's really important to understand the competitive environment in each individual market and making sure we
have the tools and skills to be able to do that as we drive that through the business.
We're consistent on driving the innovation, the flow, that's an area that we continue to be able to introduce great new
products around the world and I'm pleased with how people are driving that. But it's really the mechanics around the
Representatives and the pricing piece to ensure that we keep consumers engaged and Representatives engaged, and
that's the area of focus for us in 2017.

Our next question will come from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Barclays. So, just two questions. First is just on the top 10
markets now kind of going to top 15. So, Sheri, if you could just, I'm guessing Malaysia and Italy are among the five
new, but what else is in there? And importantly, what does it mean to sort of say, we're broadening the focus from top
10 to top 15? Is it financial resources, is it people? What changes that these kind of are in elevated status? That was the
first question.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Yeah.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Yeah. Go ahead, Sheri. And then I'll ask the second one.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Okay. Great. So, it's – I will just read you the list of the top 15, so – or the added five, I
guess I would say.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Great.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Ecuador, Peru, Italy, Romania and Chile. And one of the things we talked about was some
of the challenges with Italy, I will say, we're driving significant transformation in Chile and Romania and seeing terrific
performance. So, I think we have to look at that balance.
As it relates to how we focus more, one of the things that we do with our top 10 is we have a scorecard, we have a
management committee that meets and talks about the top 10 in terms of how we're performing. We are extending that
now, so we have better line of sight to the next five, and putting more resources. Our project management office has
been very helpful on helping us track that performance, and they'll be helping us with that as it relates to the additional
five. And making sure that they have the resources. We have people that have specific pricing capabilities that we can
have go into the markets, et cetera. We will be having those resources available.
So I think it's more the oversight, making sure they have the resources, and if they need training as it relates to talent or
other capabilities, we will focus on that. We've dedicated that this year to the top 10, but we're going basically from
focusing on 70% of the revenue to now 80% of the revenue.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: And Sheri, have these five, I guess, I'll just follow-up on this, have these five been
sort of the leaky buckets because last quarter, right, we started talking about the mid-sized markets being more of a
drag than anticipated, are these fives the leaky buckets?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So Italy, clearly, is driving a significant Transformation Plan initiative in their market,
they're taking out their mail plan, they're changing campaign cycles. They're really modernizing the business which I
absolutely think is the right thing to do. Perhaps, we underestimated the level of change in the field, but it's absolutely
the right thing to do. Ecuador had challenges in, particularly in the beginning of the year with Ecuador, and with the
earthquake. So we had challenges there and we're changing the field and doing some things there to improve that
business, so those two in particular were the challenge. Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, which I mentioned are not quite up
to the 2015 level, but they've had significant challenges again from some of the changes that we're making in the field
there.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Okay. Great. And then, my second question was actually just back around pricing, and
I sort of hate to do this, but Sheri,, hearing that we have sort of pricing capabilities, but we under – we kind of got it
wrong in various markets, art not science and so on. We've just heard that so many times before. And we heard it from
your predecessor, we've heard it a couple of times since you've been at Avon. As you think through sort of the pricing
analytics, the capabilities on the ground, I mean, what are you doing to sort of improve that visibility and skill set?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think, one of the most important things is a better view of the external world. I will
use Russia as an example where because of the currency movements, we were taking price. What happened is local
competitors started decreasing price and that impacted specifically our Fashion & Home business.

So having a better view earlier so that we're much more thoughtful about that. Obviously, the ruble also changed, that
contributed to the issue, and we're not going to necessarily be able to predict foreign exchange. But that's one area is the
buying data and getting more external information will help.
The other piece I would say is our ability to react to pricing changes in the market relative to our campaign cycle and
shortening that window, so that we have more flexibility to be able to change price. As we do things online, we can do
that. But still today, we're printing and so that's the other area of opportunity for us.
I will say that there's always going to be pricing because it's a very dynamic environment that we operate in. And we're
seeing a lot of movement relative to currency. So I would also say the area that's probably the more challenging for us,
Lauren, is Fashion & Home because we're buying that from China, we're bringing that in. And that's the area probably
as I look at the inconsistency, it's more in that side than it is in Beauty and we're much more able to react on the Beauty
side.
Jim, if you want to add anything to that.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: [ph] No I'd agree with that (1:02:36).
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: All right. Sheri, thanks a lot for that.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thank you.

And our final question for the day will come from the line of Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Great. Thank you. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just want to talk about the operating
margin target, the 2018 one. If it's still double digits that obviously would suggest about 350 basis points of expansion
in two years to get there. So first, I'm assuming that is inclusive of the bad debt impact from this year. So please correct
me if that's not the case. And if so why is it still the right target? And can you talk through the big deltas that you
expect to get you there within the next two years and then what your expectations are underlying for the macro
environment to get to that target?
<A - Jamie Wilson>: Yeah. I mean, I think the target we have restated is being that. So it means that we should exit, as
you rightly say, 2018, going into 2019 with those margins. So in other words, there's two years to get there. Clearly,
yes, the margin this year was depressed by the bad debt. So we wouldn't expect the 2017 margin to be depressed by
that. And it becomes, the rest of it comes from operational performance, I mean it's a combination of continuing our
cost takeout and getting our revenue line to perform where we'd like it to be. I mean, clearly, we will have still
transactional forex in there, we'll have to work with that and see if we can improve that. There's a number of items to be
improved over the period of time, but we don't break it down anymore than that.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Okay. And then of those top 8 markets and the top 10 markets that grew local currency revenues?
Can you breakout how many grew volume?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: We don't disclose the units by – I know that there was question earlier was on – even on
Brazil. We don't disclose the market level by the industry.
<A - Jamie Wilson>: No, we don't. And I mean, I think when you're talking, Olivia, about pricing. One of the things
that you've got to look at in pricing is that actually you're always bouncing price and volume. You don't necessarily
want volume to be growing all the time, if you're not getting the price, just getting the balance between that, you should
be looking at here is the [ph] – is at the top of that (1:04:49). You should measure on profit rather than on the two
individual component parts because there is always a mix between the two.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: And there's going to be a more equitable breakout in 2017 relative to 2016?

<A - Jamie Wilson>: Sorry, I'm not sure I understood that. Can you just repeat it?
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Yeah. Sure. In terms of do you think that there will – like as we move into 2017, do you think that
volume becomes a bigger piece relative to price?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: I think it's going to vary by category a bit. So, on Fashion & Home, we are curating our
business, so we made some decisions around some categories that we're exiting or actually scaling back. So, we are
going to see some declines there, and we're always going to be focused on trying to protect the margin to some level in
the Fashion & Home business. So we will – I am less bothered by a decline in units, if we're driving the overall health
of the business in a possible way.
In the case of Beauty, what we are very focused on is at the value segment of making sure we've got that balance. So I
do think we were very pleased this year that we grew units in mass and upper mass. The opportunity for us is in the
value segment, particularly in the Color category, because that's also how we bring in a new Representative. So, getting
that balance is the focus for us, so I was answering a question earlier about top 10 markets, we will be doing it there as
well as working with the mid-sized markets on that piece because that's critically important to get that balance right.
And there we would see a different trend hopefully on the unit bases in the value segment.
