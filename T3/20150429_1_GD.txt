Phebe N. Novakovic
Thanks, Erin. Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $2.14 per fully diluted
share on revenue of $7.8 billion, operating earnings of slightly over $1 billion and net earnings of $716 million. We
beat analysts' consensus by $0.20 and we're well ahead of analysts' expectations on revenue as well. We were also
better than our previous guidance and our own expectations. I should point out that we enjoyed an effective tax rate of
29% as opposed to consensus of around 30.5%. This accounted for approximately $0.05 of the outperformance.
Jason Aiken will more fully discuss the tax rate a little later. I should further note that the diluted weighted average
share count was 334.7 million for the quarter compared to consensus of approximately 332 million. So none of the
outperformance comes from a lower-than-expected share count. I have asked Jason to give you a little more insight into
our share repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks. All-in-all, this was a truly strong quarter from an operating
perspective as evidenced by the operating margin of 13.2% and a return on revenue of 9.2%.
It was a good quarter from a cash perspective as well. We had $745 million net cash provided by operating activity.
After capital expenditures of $98 million, we had $647 million of free cash flow from operations, about 90% of net
income. The general comparisons quarter-over-quarter are pretty compelling. Compared to the first quarter 2014,
revenue was up $519 million or 7.1%. Total defense revenue was up 10.1%, pretty remarkable. Our operating earnings
were slightly more than $1 billion, up 17.5% over the prior year's quarter, leading to a 120 basis-point improvement in
margins.
This very strong operating leverage is an important part of the story. Net earnings were up more than operating
earnings primarily due to the previously mentioned lower tax rate. Finally, EPS was up 25.1% over the year-ago
quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rate and lower share count.
Let me provide some commentary and a little perspective around the results of our operating segments. First,
Aerospace. Sales are down by $17 million compared to Q1 2014, less than 1% and down $132 million sequentially
against a strong fourth quarter. On the other hand, earnings outpaced the year-ago quarter by $27 million, about 6.7%
on 140 basis-point expansion in operating margin. Operating earnings were also up $19 million sequentially. The
20.4% operating margin for the group represents the high with both companies contributing.
A word of caution here. We are out of the gate fast, but this pace is not sustainable from a margin perspective. Orders
were not overly strong in the quarter, but need to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2014. It was a
quarter where the sales pipeline was replenished and strengthened; part of a normal cycle after a strong order quarter.
This is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter of 2014, following the strong fourth quarter of 2013. We're off
to a very good start in the Aerospace group.
Marine Systems. Revenue of $1.94 billion was up $342 million or 21.4% compared to the year-ago quarter and down
$97 million sequentially as one would expect against the fourth quarter 2014. Operating earnings were up $22 million
or 13.3% against the year-ago quarter and down $5 million sequentially. We had particularly good performance at
Electric Boat and NASSCO. Some of the more striking comparisons are found at Combat Systems. Compared to the
first quarter of 2014, sales were up $105 million or 8.3% and earnings were up $65 million or 46.8% on a 400
basis-point improvement in operating margins.
Recall that the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by a $29 million restructuring charge at European Land
Systems as a result of reductions in the Austrian operations, which were consolidated into Spain and Switzerland. If we
disregard that charge, margins would have been 13.4% on a pro-forma basis. Even on that basis, the improvement in
this year's operating margins is a significant 160 basis points.
Sequentially, revenue was down $251 million and operating earnings were down $67 million as anticipated in the
business that always has a very strong fourth quarter largely related to contract deliveries. All up, continued strong
performance at Combat Systems. It's been a long time since we've been able to report an increase in revenue in this
group.

IS&T. The big upside surprise incurred in this group. You might recall that our guidance was to expect a revenue
decline of 5.5% year-over-year. While that certainly did not happen in the first quarter, revenue in the quarter was up
$89 million or 3.9% against the year-ago quarter and off only $98 million against a powerful fourth quarter 2014.
Operating earnings of $217 million in the quarter was $34 million more than a year-ago quarter, up 18.6% on a 120
basis-point improvement in margins.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings were up $5 million on a 60 basis-point improvement in margins; once again,
nice operating leverage. The 9.2% operating margins were the best that this group has achieved in a while, and is very
encouraging. The trend is in the right direction.
So we're off to a very good start to the year, nicely ahead of our expectations. We do not, as a practice, change
guidance at the end of the first quarter. It is our practice, and has been for three years, to give you a full review of our
expectation at the midpoint of the year. Suffice it to say that we're ahead of the operating plan upon which our guidance
was based. We will work to consolidate our improvements and to continue to outperform.
I'd like to now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to start with a subject that we haven't talked about a lot in the past, and
that's foreign exchange rates. With our increasing international revenue base and the continued strengthening of the
dollar, we're seeing an impact in our reported results. Now be clear, this doesn't involve any economic gain or loss in
any of our contracts. What I'm referring to is the translation of our international operating results from their local
currencies to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.
Absent the movement of foreign currency translation rates, the growth in revenue and earnings over the first quarter of
2014 would have been even more robust than the numbers you see. Specifically, our U.S. dollar reported revenues and
operating earnings in the quarter were reduced by approximately $120 million and $20 million, respectively, compared
with the exchange rates that prevailed in the first quarter of last year.
In addition, our backlog was reduced by approximately $450 million from year-end due to the same translation issue.
Setting the FX impact aside, our Combat Systems backlog would have been essentially unchanged from year-end, and
our IS&T backlog would have been up slightly more than reported.
Moving on to a couple of items on our income statement. Net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million, versus
$22 million in the first quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of maturing fixed-rate notes with
proceeds for marketable securities on hand. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet reflects a net cash position,
that's cash in excess of debt, of $1 billion, essentially unchanged from year-end.
As Phebe mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate was a bit lower than we had forecast, and a bit lower than analysts'
consensus of around 30.5%. The effective rate was 29% for the quarter versus 30.1% a year ago, and the primary driver
was some R&D tax credit claims that were settled during the quarter. For the year, we're now anticipating an effective
tax rate more in the ballpark of 29.5%.
On the capital deployment front, you may recall that in the first quarter of last year, we repurchased a little over 14
million shares, including about 11 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program. Since the end of the
first quarter of 2014, our diluted share count is down another 12.5 million shares, the result of almost 20 million
additional shares repurchased in the past four quarters. And that includes approximately 4.7 million shares repurchased
in the first quarter of this year. Altogether, we spent $826 million on share repurchases and dividends during the first
quarter, or 1.3 times our free cash flow from operations.
Erin, that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the time back over to you for the Q&A.

Emma, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Erin. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells
Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Could you talk a little bit more about Aerospace and the margin? You said that it was not
sustainable, but there were a couple of headwinds that you had identified before about what might hold the margins
back this year. And so I guess, what of that did we not see in the quarter?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So as we talked about before, Aerospace margins tend to be lumpy, and estimating them
with precision is kind of like putting a tail on a moving donkey. But that said, in the quarter, we had a very favorable
service mix, high service levels with a good mix. We recognized some tax credits, a supplier settlement in Jet. So it was
really more on the upside than really any headwinds. But, at the risk of getting out ahead of our second quarter
guidance, I've already noted to you that our quarter one margins were above our expectations. And we're going to beat
the guidance I gave you in January. I'm just not sure by what amount. So I want to reserve that commentary to the
second quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Raviv>: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Jon.
<Q - Jonathan Raviv>: Phebe, just a notional question or a high-level question about your net cash position. What are
you seeing in terms of deployment opportunities here, given your very attractive balance sheet?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, we're in a net cash position at the moment, which Jason referred to. And we tend to
[indiscernible] (13:56) for no net debt position, not trying to say net cash. I think we gave you guidance and our
intentions in the January call. We will deploy, in the absence of any alternatives, and there aren't any, we will deploy all
of our free cash flow and then some to share repurchases and dividends. And that strategy hasn't changed.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Phebe, I wondered if you might elaborate a little bit on the big surprise in the top line in
IS&T. Obviously, it's your shortest cycle business. Quite a big revenue delta from what you'd talked about in the prior
quarter. I wondered if you just give us some color on what it was that shifted or came into the quarter? How should we
think about, again, the impacts on the remainder of the year in terms of performance and just any color you could give
would be great.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we had an increased sales activity across both Mission Systems and our GDIT
business. On Mission Systems, it was driven in part by the lower cost structure that we anticipated as a result of
combining AIS and C4, which made us more competitive. And that tends to be a pretty quick turnaround business. So
some of the orders quickly turn into sales. We had a good book-to-bill by the way in that program or in that whole
group, so that also positions us well for greater growth.
And as we combine those two businesses, we're seeing some additional sales volume that comes in by the strength of
going to market. On the IT business, they've won most of what they have been bidding on. And they are a power in
their market space. And so look, I don't have a sense of where we're going to end up in that business in particular given
all the puts and takes by the end of the year. But we'll have a real good sense of that by the end of next quarter, but a
solid beat on revenues and we're very pleased.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Thanks, Phebe.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the Aerospace side in terms of the large
cabin market and maybe give us a feel of what some of the different regions are doing, particularly, looking overseas
outside the U.S.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. The activity level, I would call it, careful. In other words, we've got plenty of
pipeline, but slow to contract, not unlike what we've seen in prior quarters. In short, North America and the Middle
East are okay. Russia, Latin America and China are slower at the moment. G650 and G650ER demand is robust. So
we're holding our own and then some.
I think, however, it's important to understand the theory of the case behind how we run this business, how we have
historically and how we will continue to do so. The only decline we worry about is the decline in earnings. So
accordingly, we always pull production down in the face of weak orders. We have no intention of doing so this year.
Given our large G650 backlog, we can, to some degree, feather in more G650s to cover potential downfalls. And, of
course, we always take cost of that business.
So I think the way to think about Gulfstream for the next two years is not necessarily as a strong revenue growth story.
Growth will return when the new airplanes enter into service. And this is pretty much in line with what we had
anticipated and predictable in a business that continues to refresh its product line with clean sheet design airplanes. So I
thought it'd be helpful to just give you a little sense of when we see changes in demand how we act. But, as I say, the
first quarter was cautious coming after a robust fourth quarter and this is pretty much what we have seen in the first
quarter for the last couple of years.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Great. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Phebe, just maybe to pick up on the last question, I think you said in the next couple
of years, and just on the G500 entering into service, it does seem like you're certainly ahead of where you could be. But
without pulling forward the schedule on this conference call, green deliveries, will they be a source of good revenue
growth for you in 2017 like the G650 was in 2011?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. Yeah. So we'll start to recognize activity in 2017 in anticipation of entry into
service in the first quarter of 2018. And it's really – this is the next two years and it's a transition period. I think that's
how you should think about it and we anticipated that as well. And you would expect that given that we've got new
airplanes coming on.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And then just to slide one in, which was on the inventory of used aircraft, you sold
one in the quarter. Did the level of used inventory that you're holding rise, fall, or stay the same?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. It was the same.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Same. Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes. Good morning
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Just continuing on with Gulfstream, when you look at the transition period and think
about what the trajectory might be for G450 and G550 deliveries, could you give us a sense on how you envision that
going or, sort of, what the backlogs are right now for those airplanes? And then when you think about it, as you said
before, you have the ability to take G650 up given at lot of strong demand for that airplane. Do you see the potential to
increase rate some on G650 within that next two-year period?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we haven't given you the backlog and broken it up by aircraft model. But again, let's
talk about the theory of the case. When you're bringing in new aircraft, the trick is to feather in that production with the
existing planes and so that you have a nice smooth transition. And that's what we're striving for and that's what we will
achieve. There's no reason to think that that isn't going to happen.
The G650 has a quite a significant order book. And, in fact, the deliveries now, the next available airplane is actually
slipped to the fourth quarter of 2017. So that healthy and long backlog gives us some flexibility, nice flexibility to
feather in some more G650s to offset that transition period, the feathering-in as we move to the new airplanes. So
wouldn't be altogether a bad thing, either, to reduce the wait time on those G650s and G650ER, given demand.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So you are seeing the potential to – the demand out there, to do some earlier G650
deliveries, if you want to?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Great.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: But we're going to be prudent about it. It's not wise to eat through your backlog, but to the
extent that we can and want to, we will feather in some additional G650s. I think that makes sense.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Jason, I've got one for you, if I could. It's on the free cash flow, which was really quite
strong in the quarter. I think Phebe said last quarter that international advance timing would put some pressure on free
cash flow this year, and it did in the quarter. But collections looked very strong. Could you talk about working capital
and how we should think about the cadence of free cash flow as we go forward through the year?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Sure. We were, as you said, off to a strong start in the first quarter. And to be quite frank,
stronger than even we had expected. As we signaled coming into the year, we were expecting a bit of a softer cash flow
outlook. And as you, I think, would expect in response to that, our business has turned toward sort of a war on
operating working capital and went after it hard in the first quarter.
And really that is the story. You could see even, despite a pretty big drawdown in the customer advances related to
some of those international programs, otherwise, excluding that, OWC was down in the quarter. So really strong
performance out of the gate. I would caution that we don't necessarily expect the first quarter to be reflective of the full
year. We're still expecting a tough road ahead, with some of the headwinds that we talked about. But really, our focus is
all about that management at OWC and going after the collections, as well as the supply side.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Is there any particular timing we should think about, where some of this strength
reverses? I guess, for the year, you'll do about 100% as you normally do, or a little better, but is there a weak quarter in
here?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: I would suggest the second half is where most of the pressure is on that front.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: So we'll be managing that through the balance of the year.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you, and terrific performance, Phebe. Well done.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So Aerospace, maybe if you could kind of give us the numbers you give us on the lead times
for each of the programs and a little color, you'd mentioned the supplier settlement may be – if you could quantify any
one-timers that bolstered the numbers in the first quarter at Aerospace? Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. So as I noted, the G650 and G650ER are out to the fourth quarter 2017; G550,
G450 about 12 months, where they have been; G280 and G150, G280 at the end of this year, G150 first quarter next
year. So pretty much consistent with what we've been reporting all along. As I tried to explain earlier, we had a number

of moving targets in the Gulfstream margin – provided considerable margin improvement, service mix, we took in
some tax credits.
We did have that supplier settlement. I'm not going to give you any particular numbers on any of these. And Jet
performed well. So couple of those are one-timers, but I'm not going to quantify them for you. I don't think that's
productive. We're very – particularly with respect to our suppliers, we're very proprietary about talking about our
relationship with our suppliers.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Can you quantify the total of all of those, without giving any of the granularity?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. We've led you to about 18% for the year. I didn't give you any quarter-by-quarter.
As I explained to you before, we get real lumpiness in Aerospace margins, which we talked about. So, I'm not prepared
to change the year guidance, but you can back into some of that. As I said, this is – Gulfstream has an awful lot of
moving parts, and so does Jet Aviation. So we have seen, for the last couple of years, a lot of lumpiness. We're not
going to see that 20% repeated going forward. And as I explained to you, we're going to outperform, just don't – my
guidance to you, I just don't know by how much yet, and [ph] I think (27:11) good sense of that halfway through the
year.

<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hi, Phebe, maybe just to stay on Aerospace. You mentioned Jet Aviation continues to be a
positive contributor. Can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing there? And then also related to that, are
you seeing any kind of slowdown in utilization rates in the large-cabin tied to kind of the energy market just given the
sell-off in oil we've seen last six months. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We continue to build that business. They've been a positive contributor on both cash and
earnings for about the last two and a half, three years. We've seen no change in demand as a result of – no decrease in
demand as a result of the change in oil prices. In fact, we're seeing higher demand. Backlog, the pipeline is good, and
we're adding to the backlog. So that business is increasingly well positioned.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thank you.

<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: How are you?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good.

<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: I mean, you did spend a little time there. So I figure it's probably worn off a little on you.
And there's a couple things that stand out. One was the backlog growth; second was you got an [ph] LHA (28:55)
post-shakedown availability, which sort of sets you up to do some interesting things. And it looks like NASSCO did
pretty well in a world where commercial is hard to do. So maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the variances, is
this sustainable rate you're seeing in Marine? Or was there some deliveries or some other material items that sort of
tweaked the numbers?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I think what you can expect is Marine will replicate its behavior in the past, which is
pretty steady-eddie. There was no one particular element that drove margin performance. With respect to the sales
growth, that's coming from a couple of places. We have increased sales at NASSCO on commercial work. And
remember, we're moving into the Block 4, which brings with it higher revenue and also we're seeing increased revenue
on the engineering and design for the Ohio Replacement. So all of those are long-term programs that will continue to
carry revenue and predictable earnings with them.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: And just – just to follow up for a moment, how is it that – what have you done there to
make sure, for example, at NASSCO that there's some opportunity to continue the business, because I know that's
always challenging from time to time, and then also making sure that Ohio Replacement stays on schedule?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. So with respect to NASSCO, they've got a nice backlog of commercial and
government, Navy, new construction. And recall, repair continues to grow in that for NASSCO. We have a bicoastal
presence. Back in, when I was EVP at the Marine group, we bought a couple of East Coast repair yards that have done
beautifully. So we've really increased our firing power in repair. And we're performing very nicely. Repair business is
moving to, and the Navy is moving to, from cost-plus contracts to fixed price and repair in selected instances. And
that's a real upside potential for us. We're very pleased with that.
So the repair business is robust. NASSCO is performing very well. They keep their cost bases low through continuous
improvement. And that is a highly functioning shipyard. So I like where they stand. They're competitive in the
commercial market space and, of course, Electric Boat as well continues to drive down its cost structure. And we'll see
over time increased margin improvement as we get further into Block 4 and continue our continuous improvement.
Every time we start a new block, we have some compression in margins, so we've given back some of the goodness of
the prior block to the Navy. But we've, over the last decade plus, reduced our cost structure and continue to improve
margins. So we're very, very well positioned.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Phebe, could you dig in a little bit more into the growth that we saw in Combat? It sounds
like it came through ahead of what your expectations were. Was it Saudi and the UK starting to ramp up? And does it
accelerate from here? And then...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I lost part of your question. You broke up. Can you [indiscernible] (33:01)
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Can you hear me now?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. I can hear you now.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Great. I was asking if you could dig a little bit more into the growth at Combat? It
sounded like it did come through ahead of your expectations. Is that Saudi and the UK program starting to ramp? And
does that actually accelerate from here? And then a separate question, press has reported that you pulled out of a couple
of programs in the quarter, Competitions, T-X and Manpack, if you could just touch on those as well? Thanks.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. So, look, you would expect with the prodigious increase in backlog that we
experienced last year that we would begin to see that backlog turn into sales and revenue increase. And that's what
you've seen in that group across the portfolio. On our Canadian/Middle East contract, we are finishing up our design
efforts and the initial variance. And we're going to begin production later this year. With deliveries in 2016 on the UK
program, we're working some small quantities of preproduction, but again, that will begin to ramp up. And there is -the
Army is increasing its capitalization in their wheeled and tracked vehicles. So all of that is upside and that we recognize
some of that. So, look, that backlog is flowing into sales and the key there is to perform on that backlog.
So let me talk to you. You asked a second question that's kind of interesting that we pulled out of some Competitions.
Let me give you a sort of the theory of the case here. We are not going to compete for programs or respond to RFPs
where we do not believe that we can get a fair and sufficient return. Chasing revenues that don't have good earnings
doesn't help us or our shareholders one lick. So this really has more to do with the discipline on how we run our
company rather than the response in any particular program. We're just not going to compete in programs where we
think that we can't make a fair return and a good return.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Yeah, hey. Good morning, Phebe. I just wanted to touch base quickly on if you could
remind us what you're thinking about capital allocation, particularly if there's some new properties floating on the
market. I mean, there might be an opportunity for you guys to do some vertical integration. Just what are you thinking
about M&A and vis-à-vis cash return to shareholders?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. So, Ron, I'm not thinking about M&A, because I'm not seeing anything. So it's just,
again, not on my radar screen. And our intent with respect to capital deployment remains the same for this year. We're
going to return capital to our shareholders in share repurchases and dividend. So I think that's pretty much consistent
with what we've been doing and what we've been saying, okay?
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Yeah. That's great. And can I ask one quick follow-on, if I may?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Can you give us a quick update on how things are proceeding with the G600 program, the
development there, and the developments on the G500 program?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we're proceeding well on both. The near-term G500, we ought to have first flight this
quarter. And we're on track, with no particular surprises. And the G600, we're starting to build the first prototypes and
so, all is well. We're on track and in line with what our expectations were.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. That's great. I was just curious if there's any chance that the G500 could happen
sooner, get certified sooner?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You mean first flight or entry into service?
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Entry into service, yeah, or is too soon to tell?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Now that will depend on the FAA's test program. So that's really – we work very closely
with the FAA. They have an important job to do, and they're really working together. They're a pacing item here.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi. Phebe, I want to follow up on your response to David's question earlier. I don't know if
that was a comment on T-X specifically, or just more broadly about how you're not going to invest, and we're not going
to bid on programs that don't provide fair or decent returns for your shareholders. Was there something about – I don't
know if it was a comment about T-X specifically, but was there something about the way that particular program was
structured that didn't appeal to you? Or was it more a comment more broadly about the level of investment it would
require from you guys, given that it's not in your core wheelhouse to participate in that program, which is a more
ambiguous return?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You got it.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: The latter?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: [indiscernible] (38:35)
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: It was the latter one.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: [indiscernible] (38:36) that's it in a nutshell.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It's not in our core. We had been thinking about participating on – the Air Force was
interested in an off-the-shelf trainer. But once those requirements started to change, there isn't just – no way that
becomes an attractive program for us. And so I think the appropriate response and good discipline [ph] was – would
(39:02) require that we just politely bow out.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. Thank you, Phebe. And a quick follow-up. Can you update the pre-owned delivery
expectations for this year? Or you still think it's kind of up year-over-year? Or how should we think about that? Thanks
for the time – in Aerospace.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Yeah. I think, as we look at the year, we're still expecting the numbers to be up a little bit from
what we've seen in the past couple of years. So a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we were expecting, but the
balance of the year, we're still seeing that come in.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. Thanks, everybody.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Hey, great quarter, guys.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Hey, Phebe, I just wanted to go further on capital deployment. I like what I'm hearing
about staying away from M&A, frankly. It kind of begs the question on repurchases, because I think you got a new 10
million repurchase authority in February. And I'm guessing, coming out of the quarter, you're probably only left with
about 7 million shares. You're probably going do $2 billion plus in free cash the rest of the year. So I'm wondering, do
you plan to go back to the board, sometime maybe this summer, to increase the authority?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So, look, we came out of the gate strong on cash, but as I told – what I told the Street in
January, the way to think about 2015 cash is that we're going to have a lighter cash year than we typically do have. And

I'm not prepared to change that. So do not think about the cash generation in terms that we have – historical terms. But
that said, let Jason give you a little bit more color on where we are on the share repurchases.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Yeah. I think you were pretty close on your estimates there. We had about 2 million to 2.5
million shares remaining from the prior authorization when we got the additional 10 million in February. And I think
we're sitting with right around 7 million – call it, 7.7 million or so remaining at this point. So I think I look at Phebe,
but anything beyond that is at the discretion of our board, so.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Okay. Hey, Jason, I didn't hear you object when Rob suggested a one times free cash
conversion for the year.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: No. I think as Phebe signaled, and I apologize if I missed that in his question or this predicate.
As Phebe mentioned, we're not expecting to be quite as strong as our traditional performance this year. So we expect
something a little bit lighter than that and a little bit lighter than the first quarter.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Emma, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. So your last question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Phebe, with IS&T and some of the outperformance you've seen there really over the past 12
months at this point, is it more a reflection of the budget environment and the procurement behavior being better than
expected or is it that the win rate has been better?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We're seeing a little bit more activity on the budget side, but it really is our win rate has
improved. As we continue to take costs out of our business, we become more competitive. And by the way, that's true
in the United States, Canada and the UK, which is where Mission Systems plays heavily.
<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Okay. Thank you.
