MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Taisha, and I will be operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode, later we will
conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please proceed.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Taisha. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The
results that we announce this morning, the audio feed of this call, and the slides that we'll reference are available on our
website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of
the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial
Officer, and Toby O'Brien who will formally take over as CFO on March 02 of this year. We'll start with some brief
remarks by Tom and Dave, and then we'll move on to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives,
and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.

Thomas A. Kennedy
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter driven by global
demand for our advanced technologies and solid execution across the company. Bookings were better than expected at
$7.1 billion yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 for Q4. Sales were up nearly 5% in the quarter as both domestic and
international sales increased, and cash flow and margins were strong as well. These results were made possible by the
dedicated efforts of the entire Raytheon team and I want to thank everyone on the team for the strong quarter and solid
year.
As I look back on 2014, I am pleased with our overall performance. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 for the year.
Bookings of $24.1 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The company capitalized on key domestic and
international opportunities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cyber security, C4ISR and training. This highlights
our continued alignment with our customers' priorities and our strong competitive position. Furthermore, we are
especially proud that we delivered better than expected booking performance even as one of our anticipated large
international Patriot awards moved into the first quarter of 2015.
Operationally, we continue to focus on reducing costs, improving affordability and delivering strong returns, while at
the same time we follow through on our commitment to invest in our future. As we look forward to 2015, we expect to
continue to perform well. Dave will walk you through our 2015 guidance in a few minutes.
Demand from our broad base of customers continues to drive growth in our international business. Over the past few
months, I continue to receive feedback from our international customers that investing in national security remains a
top priority given the global threat environment, and you can see this in both our fourth quarter and full year results.
Full year 2014 international bookings were up 27% over 2013 and were 35% of the total company bookings. I would
note that our international book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.28 and look for – at the fourth quarter it was 2.0. So we
finished the year with very solid international bookings. We saw strong demand across our international portfolio
during the year including bookings from Qatar for Patriot, and an air defense operating center; Kuwait for Patriot fire
units, Canada for the North Warning System, several countries for AMRAAM, South Korea for GEM-T missiles and
Australia for the Air Warfare Destroyer, among a host of others. At the end of Q4 international backlog increased to
40% of our total backlog.
Our domestic bookings in 2014 also improved over 2013. We received key awards in training, SM-3, AMRAAM,
Tomahawk and the FAA's STARS program. We also closed on a key competitive award including the Family of
Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminal, and last summer we also had a successful test at the Exoatmospheric Kill
Vehicle that allowed us to move forward on this important program that protects the homeland.
We saw strong bookings in our classified business which includes both domestic and international, and our overall
classified bookings increased by 29% in 2014. We feel good about the outlook for 2015 and we expect another year
with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. International bookings are expected to continue to be strong representing
approximately a third of our total 2015 bookings driven by opportunities from a broad base of global customers and
across a wide range of our products and solutions including missiles, tactical radars and command and control systems.
In addition, demand for the proven Patriot Systems Air and Missile Defense capability continues. New opportunities in
Asia and the Middle East as well as competitive awards in Europe continue to develop. As I just mentioned we are
close to finalizing a $2 billion Patriot order from an international customer in Q1. We also expect to conclude
negotiations on a Patriot upgrade program in South Korea within the next six months to nine months. Keep in mind the
GEM-T missile upgrade awarded to us in Q3 of 2014 is a precursor for Korea's expected follow-on hardware upgrade
to configuration 3+.
In Europe, Poland is expected to make the final down select for their medium range integrated air and missile defense
competition by the end of this year. Patriot is one of two systems in the final round of the competition.

From a domestic perspective, the final agreement on a fiscal year 2015 DoD base budget was reached in December.
Modernization accounts came in several billion dollars higher than requested yielding funding increases for several
Raytheon programs. We expect the administration to submit its fiscal year 2016 defense budget request next week.
While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in fiscal year 2016, we will point out that
even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher
in fiscal year 2016 than fiscal year 2015. While the domestic market is still constrained, the trajectory of the DoD base
budget is finally starting to trend upwards.
We see considerable opportunities in the domestic market, the growing sophistication of the threat to our national
security is creating demand for new innovative solutions. As a result we are investing more to develop the
discriminating technologies and differentiated capabilities that will enable us to provide our customers what they need
in area such as missile defense, electronic warfare, high energy lasers, advanced propulsion, and undersea sensors.
These investments will position us to capture future franchise programs and lay the foundation for growth.
Another area where we see continually evolving and pervasive threat is in cyber. In fact we've seen a nomenclature
change for certain areas of the industry, whereas C3ISR expanded to C4ISR, this is now evolving to C5ISR where the
latest C stands for cyber. Consistent with this many of our customers are turning to us to incorporate the latest cyber
protection into their networks and systems so that they are more secure. As always we stand ready to help our global
customers with our advanced cyber capabilities.
At the end of the last decade, we began adding to our organic cyber capabilities through acquisitions and we've made a
number of cyber related acquisitions since then positioning us as a technology leader in this growing market. Our latest
cyber related acquisition was Blackbird Technologies, which we completed in the fourth quarter. Blackbird not only
adds unique cyber and other capabilities but also expands key market channels in the Special Operations and Intel
markets for Raytheon. It is a great fit and we welcome their employees to the Raytheon team.
One of the key strengths at Raytheon is our ongoing commitment to our core values. And in 2014, we were recognized
for achievements in the area of ethics and integrity, health and safety and sustainability. We were awarded the 2014
Corporate Leadership Award by Transparency International, U.S.A. for our commitment to shape initiatives that
promote high business standards, transparency, and anti-corruption in the U.S. and internationally. We achieved the
best safety record in our history, significantly reducing both lost work days and recordable injuries. We recently
received the Energy Star Partner award from the EPA and have been recognized as one of the top green companies in
America for our strong greenhouse gas reduction program and sound energy practices. We were also recognized as one
of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by Corporate Responsibility Magazine. Our goal is to continue to build on these
successes.
Before wrapping up, I'd like to highlight another significant attribute that we pride ourselves on here at Raytheon; that
is, having a deep bench of management talent as a result of our strong leadership development and succession planning
programs. Over recent weeks we've made announcement that clearly demonstrate this.
I'd like to again congratulate Dave Wajsgras on his new role as President of IIS. Dave has been CFO of Raytheon since
2006. His tenure as CFO has been an integral component of an exceptional period of value creation for the company.
His deep industry background and broad experience working with both customers and industry partners will be key in
driving the global growth strategy at IIS. Dave will be succeeding Lynn Dugle who will be retiring after serving more
than 10 years with the company, including six years as the President of IIS where she delivered solid operating results
and outstanding leadership.
I'd also like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his new role as CFO of Raytheon. As many of you know, Toby has been with
the company for nearly 30 years and has held a number of business CFO roles in the company; and he was CFO at IDS
when I led the business, so I've had the pleasure of working with Toby before and look forward to doing so again. I am
confident that he will do a great job.
In summary, we had another great year at Raytheon and we have a solid outlook for 2015. With that, let me turn it over
to Dave.

David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results. Then I'll
discuss our outlook for 2015 and after that we'll open up the call for questions.
So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on the
Raytheon website.
Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth
quarter operating margin was 14.1%, and on an adjusted basis was 13%. For the full year, operating margin was 13.9%,
and 12.7% on an adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.86 and on an adjusted basis
was $1.71. For the full year, EPS from continuing operations was $6.97 and our adjusted EPS was $6.12.
Our sales for the quarter were $6.1 billion and $22.8 billion for the year. We also generated strong operating cash flow
of over $825 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, after a $600 million pre-tax discretionary pension
contribution which was not in our prior guidance.
Additionally, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $750 million in 2014.
The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $611 million. Also, as previously announced,
the company acquired Blackbird Technologies in the fourth quarter for approximately $425 million.
If you turn to page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong
bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $24.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $33.6
billion. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.16 and 1.05 for the year, and the company ended 2014 with a funded
backlog of $23.1 billion.
For the quarter, international orders represented 50% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 35% of
total bookings. At the end of 2014, approximately 40% of our total backlog was international.
Turning now to page five, we had fourth quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2013, and again,
was consistent with our expectations. So looking at the businesses, all had higher sales than the same period last year.
Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due
to higher sales on international Patriot programs. IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were up from the same
period last year primarily due to higher volume on classified programs.
Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2014 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The
increase was primarily due to higher sales on AMRAAM and Evolved Seasparrow Missile programs. And SAS had net
sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, higher than the comparable period last year, primarily due to increased sales on an
electronic warfare systems program. For the year, sales were $22.8 billion, down 3.7%, again consistent with our
expectations. International sales growth partially offset a decline in domestic sales.
So moving ahead to page six, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking
at business margins in the quarter, at IDS, IIS and Missiles, margins were essentially in line with or better than last
year. In the fourth quarter of 2014, IDS achieved some important program milestones, and I did briefly discuss this on
the call in October. And at SAS, fourth quarter 2013 benefited from the timing of profit adjustments. Said another way,
SAS had a tough comparison. Also, you may recall that this business had strong third quarter margins in 2014 driven
by the timing of performance that we had previously expected in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that at IDS, IIS
and SAS margins all exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October. Missile Systems did come in
slightly below our guidance driven by program mix.
So on page 7 you'll see that both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2014 our EPS was $1.86 and
for the full year was $6.97. And on an adjusted basis was $1.71 in the fourth quarter and $6.12 for the full year.

EPS for the quarter was strong and included the extension of the R&D tax credit which was not in our prior guidance.
As I previously mentioned the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2014. Again this
includes the $600 million pre-tax or $400 million after-tax discretionary pension contribution which was also not in our
prior guidance. Excluding the net discretionary cash contribution, our operating cash flow in 2014 would have been
$2.5 billion. It's worth noting that on this basis, we exceeded the guidance that we provided you in October due to the
timing of collections.
Moving on to the 2015 guidance on page 8. We see sales in the range of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion, flat to slightly
down from 2014. As for pension, we see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million which I'll further
discussion in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $225 million and $235 million. We see our
average diluted shares outstanding to be between 305 million average diluted shares outstanding and 307 million
average diluted shares outstanding on a full year basis.
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27.5%. Our 2015 tax rate is higher than 2014 primarily
due to the lapse of the R&D tax credit, which again is not included in our 2015 guidance. If the R&D tax credit is
extended it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points, and our EPS by approximately
$0.10. As a reminder we had an $83 million foreign tax credit in the first quarter of 2014 which also impacted the
effective tax rate, and for 2015, we are anticipating a non-cash $88 million tax settlement in the second quarter.
In 2015, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35, and our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.49 to $5.64.
Our operating cash flow guidance for 2015 is expected to increase to between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion.
Before moving to page 9, I want to mention that we expect the 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be between 1.0 and 1.05
times, driven by continued demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers and we again expect
stronger bookings in the second half of this year similar to both 2013 and 2014.
So if you'd move to page 9, here we've provided our initial 2015 guidance by business. Consistent with our prior
comments, we expect 2015 adjusted margins to continue to be solid in the 12.1% to 12.3% range. Our margins for 2015
will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments in technology with the objective of
returning to top line growth. The investments we've made in GaN and Cyber are paying off in significant ways today.
We fully expect these new investments in radars, directed energy, EW and advanced propulsion to lay the foundation
for growth over the next few years.
At IDS, we see margins in the 15.1% to 15.3% range. The change from 2014 is driven by mix, most notably the
planned completion of some of our international Patriot programs. And in 2015, we are ramping up on several new
programs including Qatar Patriot and the new international Patriot award expected in Q1. As you know, we typically
see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs which can improve over time as we retire risks and
drive operational improvements. Longer term, we see IDS margins improving after 2015 as the overall business mix
improves and as these new large international programs progress through the production cycle.
Additionally, you should note that we expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6% to be impacted by approximately 60 basis
points due to the Blackbird Technologies acquisition related cost. Excluding these IIS margins would be in the range of
8% to 8.2%. SAS margins are expected to be down driven by mix from lower volume as a result of completing some
international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2015. Looking ahead from a company level
perspective as domestic development programs transition to production and our international programs mature, we do
see opportunity to improve margins in 2016 and beyond.
If you would now turn to page 10, we've provided you with our 2015 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the sales ramp
throughout the year. In addition, the second quarter EPS is favorably impacted due to the previously mentioned
non-cash $88 million tax settlement.
And finally on page 11, as we have done in the past we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in
2014 as well as the projected 2015 through 2017 impact, holding all assumptions constant. As I mentioned earlier, we
see the 2015 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million which reflects our investment returns in 2014 of over 6%
on our U.S. pension assets, and the December 31 discount rate of 4.1%. The discount rate is down 100 basis points

from last year. Further we reduced our long-term return on asset assumptions from 8.75% to 8% due to a change in the
allocation of our plan assets and related investment strategies. Taken together these result in a lower favorable
FAS/CAS pension impact in 2015 compared to 2014. Looking beyond 2015, it is important to keep in mind for each 25
basis point change in the discount rate a result of $65 million to $75 million change in FAS/CAS takes place. Lastly,
required pension contributions are decreasing in the near term as CAS recovery is increasing. This has a favorable
impact on our pre-tax net cash flow over the forecast horizon.
Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Toby on his promotion. I've worked with
Toby for nine years and I can tell you that he understands Raytheon, has a strong network and is well respected across
the entire company. He has a deep understanding of finance, the industry and our customers, and he also has a strong
commercial background, having been the CFO at Raytheon Aircraft for close to five years. His extensive and broad
background provides a strong foundation for his and Raytheon's future success.
Now on a personal note, I would like to mention that it's been great to work with all of you since joining Raytheon, and
I am looking very forward to my new role. I am sure I'll see you at future Raytheon events.
Let me conclude by saying that in 2014 Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance with bookings, margins,
earnings, and operating cash flow all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong, and our international
business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet which gives us substantial flexibility and options to
continue to drive shareholder value. With that we'll open up the call to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I want to make sure, I understand the bookings and backlog trajectory better, and you
booked $24 billion in 2014 that's up from the prior year and your book-to-bill is above 1 yet your backlog declined
slightly. Can you connect those two so I can understand why, how that decline happened despite the good book-to-bill?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah sure. This is Dave. Our book-to-bill in 2014 was 1.05, as you just mentioned. With
that said, we did have little over a $1 billion in backlog adjustments which was inline with the adjustments we've had
over a number of years historically, and just to be clear backlog adjustments reflect several items including currency
fluctuations, under runs on completed cost type contracts and scope changes, including scope reduction on contracts
and finally contract terminations.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Because what I am trying -
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: [indiscernible] (27:26)
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: ...yeah it does, and what I am trying to understand is you mentioned some of the areas
that you're investing in so to lead to top line growth, but when you look at your guidance for next year, you've got a
lower revenue number, and if we come in with a book-to-bill again like this and – what I'm worried about is that you
have a trajectory where backlog may continue to decline, and I am trying to understand when we should expect to see
that growth in the top-line?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, so Doug, for next year we see sales essentially in line with 2014, flat to maybe down
2%. As you look beyond the 2015 timeframe, we do expect to return to growth in 2016 and beyond. And importantly
again, we do see very strong bookings both domestically and internationally again in 2015 as we saw in 2014.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, very good, okay. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So, hey Doug, just one last one there, in 2016, we'll have ramped up on two major new
Patriot programs, Qatar and the other one that will be coming in this quarter, and so that will generate significant
revenue growth for 2016.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: But what I am trying to understand on that is, that the international, a lot of the
international orders as you ramp down say on UAE, you ramp up on Qatar and others, how do you see that ebb and
flow? Because you'll also have some – you also have some coming down at the same time – and it's quite difficult to
track how each of these sort of adds and subtracts from your – the IDS top-line?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, so Doug, let me try to add something here. So, you'll recall there was a fairly
significant reduction in the DoD budget as we entered into the period of sequestration. That impacted the entire
industry and Raytheon was not immune from that reduction. So what happened a few years back is now making its way
through the backlog and through the sales line. That's partially offset over the last few years by the strength of our
international bookings and our international growth. So as we look forward, what happened from 2012 to 2013 is now
in the rear view mirror from an overall financial performance standpoint, and again, we do expect to return to growth
beyond 2015.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So does this mean that your expectations for your defense, your US defense revenues,
you're expecting that to stabilize which would make the international contributions more positive and allow you to
grow. Is that fair?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, Doug, I think you hit it right, the nail right on the head. The bottom line is that the
defense budget even with the BCA restrictions and caps does start to increase in 2016 and beyond. And so our domestic
business will start to trend up at that point, but at the same time we have a very, very strong backlog on the
international which will also be driving forward in terms of revenue. So we think – we see 2016 as the year that we
start ticking up.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Dave, can you talk a little bit about the cash flow? If I just look year-over-year, you talk
about a $900 million less contribution for pension, but you don't see operating cash flow go up anywhere near that. So
can you just talk about some of the moving pieces as to cash taxes and others as to why you're not seeing as big of an
increase without the pension contribution?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, Sam, I was literally 100% certain you were going to ask me that question, so...
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: So you win the bet.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So let me try to summarize this for you. In 2014, we had two items that impacted cash flow
at the end of the year. We had the discretionary pension contribution of $400 million on a net basis. And we also saw
some year-end collections in Q4 that we had expected in the first quarter of 2015; that's between roughly $100 million
and $150 million. So when you normalize for these two items, 2014, we did achieve the high end of our guidance at
roughly $2.350 billion; and for 2015 adjusting for the earlier collections, the range would be $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion.
So if you look at this year-over-year on a normalized basis, 2015 is roughly $300 million to $400 million higher than
2014 at the high end of the range. So, I hope that clarifies it for you. I tried to give you some numbers as I was walking

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Yes, and then can you give an update just on the GPS-OCX program, just because there was
a lot of press about overruns there, and I am trying to just square that as to, is that any impact in why IIS margins even
without the Blackbird are still showing a decline next year or in 2015?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, let me attack that one. On the GPS-OCX program there were some issues we have
worked with the Air Force on those. It is a very complex program, technology advanced. Number one it is a cost plus
program, development program, and it is revolutionary relative to adding information assurance capability to a very
large ground station for the GPS system, and we have been working with the Air Force on that program. We believe
that we have turned a corner on that program moving forward, and we don't see any impact in this year or in the out
years relative to that program. I don't know if that...
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Yes, that's helpful. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Two questions, nice to good luck Toby.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Thanks, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: But first is you know if we look across the board, although you set us up Dave a little bit for
lower margins and discussed mix, it still seems as if there is a change in the trajectory of the business and, is this as
much a set up for what you said is, well we beat our margins from our initial guidance, or in fact is there a business
change?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, so Howard, I appreciate you asking that question. So let me start out by saying at the
end of last year when Tom and I participated at the Credit Suisse conference, we did talk about adjusted margins in
2015 being in sort of the lower 12% range. So, again we are projecting a 12.1% to 12.3% margin. Now, there is a
number of areas that are important to mention here. Firstly, there is the program mix, particularly at IDS, and we talked
about the cadence of the longer duration production programs coming down in 2015 as we start out on the new
programs that we were recently awarded and fully excited to be awarded in first quarter and throughout the year.
You know, secondly, and maybe more importantly, we are increasing our spend in IRAD and program investments.
Last, we closed out the year last year with IRAD at just a little over 2% of sales, and as we look at 2015 we expect it to
be closer to 3% of sales, and that is, those are important technology investments that Tom addressed earlier that
position us well for both top line and bottom line growth. And then lastly, we mentioned this a little earlier as well, IIS
the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies from an IIS standpoint there is about 60 basis points of impact from the
amortization of acquisition cost or intangibles, and at the company level that's about 15 to 20 basis points. Now what I
just went through there is an offset there, there continues to be higher productivity as a result of the focused efforts
throughout the company. But when you stand back and look at this 2015 is a very strong year and positions us well for
2016 and beyond.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Okay. And then I am going to switch for a moment, and Tom I know you've been talking
about a large $2 billion order for some time and you know it's always hard to pin down a date, could you, elaborate a
little bit on what gives you increased confidence that we'll see it in this first quarter?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, so last year we had two, big international awards that we were working to bring in.
One of them we did which was Qatar for about $2.4 billion that came in in December. This other one did slip into the
first quarter. We are very close to closing on that deal based on the customer's schedule. This one will close in this
quarter. We're highly confident of that, and that's about a $2 billion Patriot order. What is significant here Howard is

both the Qatar and this order will be going on at the same time so it's definitely going to give us economic order,
quantity and capability in terms of being able to get the best material buys for those programs and also we'll definitely
be churning the factory three shifts on those two programs over here for the next three to four years. So they're very
important and are back-to-back which is good for us.

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Dave, we can't let you go without a question about pension.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. We had a feeling that was coming as well.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Cool. I thought really when you mentioned the discount rate has changed, but also I was
wondering if you could comment on how your rate of return ended up for 2014 relative to what you told us in Q3? And
also what's prompted you in this three-month period to change your assumed rate of return?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure yeah. We ended the year with a little over 6% actual return on our pension assets in
2014, and looking ahead every year we evaluate our long term return on asset assumptions. So in the fourth quarter of
2014 we did reduce our long-term target allocation for equities and increased our target allocation for fixed income,
and that's principally in order to reduce our overall exposure to equity volatility going forward. The change in asset
allocation resulted in a reduction of our long term ROA assumption of about 75 basis points, and that's basically in a
nutshell, how we see things going forward.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay, then as a follow-up on the guidance, I noticed you've increased your interest expense
expectations. Can you give us an idea of what's behind that? I mean, you anticipating taking on more debt or is your
cost of debt going higher?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, you'll recall that we issued $600 million of debt in Q4, $300 million in 10s and $300
million in 30s. Average cost was around 4%, and that's what you're seeing impact interest expense in 2015. It's all fixed
rate, that's an important thing to note, it's all fixed rate.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: So you're not anticipating any additional debt movement beyond what's been announced then.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, look we're always looking at our capital structure, to optimize the financial
foundation of the company. Standing back we – we still or have a very strong A- rating. We've talked about this in the
past, we don't see ourselves going lower than BBB+. I think I mentioned that exactly on the third quarter call. So we
could in the future but I am not signaling anything. We have a very strong balance sheet, and there is room to use the
balance sheet from a shareholder perspective and from other perspectives. It's a very solid foundation.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay, thanks very much.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Thank you.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Question Dave. The margins were down in 2014, you're projecting them down in 2015
again and then maybe a little bit better in 2016. I mean how do you look at what normalized margin should be, I mean
obviously the investments you're making are somewhat discretionary. So I just kind of see if you have, what your
answers to that might be?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, thanks George. So, you know let me start by saying, our objective is to improve and
grow earnings through both top-line and margin improvement. So, the company is focused on program execution, on
cost reduction and importantly margin performance, and we've talked about this before. If you look at the company
changes in mix, the timing of program completions and program starts all impact margin. In 2015, and I mentioned this
earlier, we're making important technology investments that drive future growth in margin expansion. After 2015 we
do see opportunity for margins to increase on an adjusted basis not from only a FAS/CAS basis and it's driven by a
number of different initiatives in addition to the overall business mix improving over time. Tom and I have both talked
about strategic sourcing, facility optimization, expanding what we call our Global Business Services, which is our
shared service initiative internally. So when you look at all this together I think you framed it correctly we do see
growing margins in 2016 and beyond, but at this point we are not going to suggest a target margin profile for the
company.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay, and one different one Dave, I don't want to disappoint you because you figured I'd
probably ask this as well. How much was international sales up versus domestic down?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: International sales in 2014 were up about 1.5% and domestic was down about 5.5%.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And how about Q4?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: In Q4, I am glad you asked that George. International was up about 6% and domestic was
up over 4%.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay, thanks very much Dave.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure George.

Your next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi, thanks for taking my question.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Hey Hunter.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hey, I appreciate all the commentary on margins, I am going to go there again particularly
sort of at IDS. Obviously you gave great color on sort of, the ramping work and Patriot and all that, but is there
something maybe going on, we've obviously always held the belief that international is much more profitable than
domestic, which of course it still is and will be going forward. But is there anything that you're seeing structurally,
particularly maybe in the FMS arena that's causing some degree of pressure on the international margin side? Maybe is
the bidding environment, getting little more aggressive? Is it – should we think of that sort of traditional gap between
international domestic holding as we look out over the next couple of years, or might we see some compression on
some of the international margin side?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, so Hunter I think it's probably best to let Toby O'Brien handle that question since he
just spent five or six years at the business. So, Toby why don't you go ahead.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure Dave.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. And Hunter, you know Dave hit some of this in his comments so and I'll just try to
add a little bit of color to that. I do have a good handle on the business having been there for about six years, as Dave
said, and know what drives it. You know from a big picture point of view, I can tell you it remains very solid business.
There are many things that can impact margins, but really the story with IDS margins in 2015 is driven by mix,
program mix and timing, and I think the thing to understand is that we've seen this before a few years ago where IDS
margins did fluctuate year-over-year and then they did come back, okay? And at that point in time it was the same
thing. It was a combination of the mix and the timing related to the program completions and program startups, the
same things that are impacting us here in 2015. So this is not a new phenomenon. We don't see any other pressures on
the business related to your other question. And to reinforce what Dave said, we would expect to see the margin profile
at IDS to improve after 2015 as the mix improves, and these awards that we've talked about Qatar and the other one
that we expect here in the first quarter that Tom talked about as they move through their production cycle.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. Yeah, thanks Toby, appreciate it. And another one on maybe this is sort of a backdoor
M&A question, but you talked obviously about even if sequestration comes back into play, you're going to see a higher
baseline budget going forward, but obviously the investment accounts are going to be under a little bit more pressure.
Do you guys see yourselves trying to move into sort of getting a bigger chunk of say the O&M budget to then be sort of
try to offset a little bit of incremental revenue headwinds that you might see in some procurement and R&D accounts?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, I think, the bottom line is in fiscal year 2016 even with the BCA caps, the domestic
base budget does go up. And we also, if you look at the [ph] F 2015 fightup (47:20) you'll see that the administration
has come in about $35 billion over what the BCA caps are for fiscal year 2016. So in either case, there'll be a base
larger base budget, and as part of that base budget the modernization is also going up. And so we believe that the
domestic, we will have some uptick business.
We're also seeing, and that's why we're making some investments this year with the evolving threat out there, there are
some opportunities for inserting some new technology and starting in 2016 and 2017. And so, that's another area why
we're moving forward on that. On the LISC [Launch and Test Range System Integrated Support Contract], the LISC is
a great win for us. That's a joint venture that we have with General Dynamics, and that does give us insight into the
ranges across the entire Air Force, so it's a great program for us there, just on the base program itself but giving us
insight into what technologies we can bring to bear to the Air Force to help them as they move forward to get to a more
affordable solution for all of the ranges.
And then the other major area we have is the Warfighter FOCUS program in terms of training, and we are working
with our customers to ensure they have the appropriate training moving forward to be more efficient and from an
affordability perspective.

the spend trajectory look like over the next couple of years?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, so specifically on the internal R&D, I noted it before with an earlier question but I
didn't give out the specific dollars. Let me start out again by saying in 2014 that ran a little over 2% of sales and in
2015 will be close to 3% of sales. That translates into, roughly speaking, about $500 million of direct R&D spend in
2014, up to between $600 million and $650 million in R&D spend in 2015.
Now importantly, that's only one element of our overall R&D focus. Every year, we book and bill, essentially, between
$1 billion and a $1.5 billion of customer-funded R&D, and this is another important element of our overall focus on
technologies. And lastly, there are occasions where we win large programs, particularly international, where part of the
program win is development activity for technologies that we can leverage on to other programs in the future. So, I
hope that helps and clarifies the way we're thinking about the company in 2015 and beyond.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That is helpful, but as you look out to 2016 and 2017 and beyond, are we moving our
internal R&D from 2% of sales to 3% in perpetuity or is 2015 a special year and we go back to 2% in the future?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, I'm actually glad you asked that. We're thinking about internal R&D in the upper 2%
range for the foreseeable future.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the yet-to-be-named Patriot customer, can you are talk
about what region of the world that might be coming from?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, the world is a pretty big place -
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: -- pretty big place, right?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: ... and so. Let's put it this way. There's three regions where we have significant demand
for Patriot. And one is Eastern Europe, another one is the MENA region and the other one is Asia Pacific and it's in one
of those regions. So I can't get into a direct – but all I can tell you is I do have a team in-country. We are essentially
complete all of our activities and now it's the customer is now going through some of their final arrangements, and we
look pretty strong here for a Q1 award. And again, it is important because if you take that on top of the $2.4 billion
Qatar, that's within a very short period of time, $4.4 billion of pure Patriot manufacturing where we have significant
control over – how do you say – efficiencies and in driving our material cost down to ensure we provide I would say
pretty good margins on those programs.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Tom, can you remind us, the installed base on Patriot is 11 or 12 countries at this point. How
many of them still need to have an upgrade?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So we've about, we have, with the new addition of Qatar, we've 13 countries that have
Patriot, that's with the addition of Qatar. And out of those we have probably another seven – excuse me it's eight,
another eight will have opportunities for the Configuration-3 upgrade. Because we have the upgrade we've done in
Taiwan. We've done the update in UAE. We're doing – we'll be doing the upgrade in Korea and moving forward, and
also Qatar will have that upgrade in it, and we've also been doing an upgrade on in Saudi on Configuration-3 Plus. And
then Kuwait if you remember at the beginning of this year, excuse me beginning of 2014 the first quarter we had a, we
got an order on for Kuwait for a Configuration-3 Plus.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great, thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So, bottom line is significant opportunity within the consortium of Patriot users, and
again that's, we are up to 13 countries. And with the Polish competition if that goes into the right direction that will
give us another country and allow us to have 14 participants in the Patriot consortium worldwide.

Your last question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Hey good morning, guys.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Just wanted to ask about from a couple of perspectives. One, can you tell us how much
Blackbird is going to contribute to revenue in 2015? And then part two, just on the cash flow outlook, it really looks
like at a reasonable level of share repurchases, it really looks like your dry powder is going to build pretty meaningfully
over the next couple of years. So, should we expect, especially now that you've got maybe some better DoD budget
visibility, should we expect M&A to accelerate kind of sharply over the next couple of years?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, let me, Pete let me talk about Blackbird real quick here. It is a great acquisition for
us. Number one, for its technology, and also for its channels into both SOCOM and also the intel communities. But in
terms of this year, it'll give us about a 1% in terms of revenue contribution for to the business. Just one other element,
we, it is a very excellent management team for Blackbird, and they also have a great workforce of I would call some
very highly skilled technical folks. So we're looking forward to the synergies that we will be able to achieve via that
acquisition.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, so Pete again, Toby O'Brien, the soon to be official CFO, it's probably best for him
to talk about his thoughts on capital deployment going forward, so Toby, why don't you handle that.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Sure, Dave. So Pete you know as Todd mentioned I won't officially be in the CFO seat
here until early March, but capital deployment is something I have spent some time on and given it some thought, and
you know Tom and Dave have described our priorities for capital deployment for a while and they have been pretty
consistent, and I do believe that our approach has and will continue to serve us and our shareholders well.
So bottom line at this point, I don't foresee the need for any meaningful changes to our current approach or priorities.
That said we will continue with an active share repurchase program. We will continue to recommend annual dividend
increases to our Board. And given the funded status of the pension plans and where we are now forecasting markets
over the next few years, we are not currently seeing any need for further discretionary pension contributions. And
lastly, as you know, our global growth objective it's very key to us. It will continue to be a priority and acquisitions that
create shareholder value you know meaning that they have to make sense economically. They have to fill a gap from a
product technology or market channel standpoint. They will become a focus more than they have in prior years, and
Tom just described Blackwater – Blackbird excuse me, and that's a good example of a acquisition that met that criteria.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Thanks, guys. And Toby, Dave's a pretty nice guy, I imagine he set you a low bar for
cash from ops for 2015, so...
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, no that was not done in a vacuum, okay.
