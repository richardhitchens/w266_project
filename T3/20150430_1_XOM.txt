MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.
Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury.
Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. Our
conference this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website.
So before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two.
Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. ExxonMobil
delivered earnings of $4.9 billion. The solid financial results demonstrate the value of our integrated businesses in a
lower commodity price environment. Regardless of our current market conditions, we remain focused on business
fundamentals and competitive advantages that create long-term shareholder value.
Upstream production volumes were more than 2% higher compared to the year-ago quarter, benefiting from new
developments in Papua New Guinea, Canada, Angola, Indonesia, and U.S. onshore liquids plays. ExxonMobil's

downstream and chemical businesses had strong performance across all regions, driven by lower feedstock costs and
improved demand coupled with our competitive product and asset mix.
Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic
growth continued to moderate in the first quarter of 2015. U.S. growth slowed relative to the fourth quarter, whereas
China's economy decelerated further, and growth in Europe and Japan remained weak. However, there are recent
indications that growth may be improving, particularly in Europe. As you know, energy prices continued to decline in
the quarter, leading to lower cost of supply in the downstream and stronger global refinery margins on higher demand.
Meanwhile, chemical gas cracking margins softened on lower product realizations, but remain advantaged relative to
liquids cracking.
Turning now to the financial results, as shown on slide five, as indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $4.9
billion, which represents $1.17 per share. The corporation distributed $3.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $1 billion was used to purchase shares.
CapEx was $7.7 billion, which is in line with our plan. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.5 billion. And
at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.2 billion and debt was $32.8 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased from $4.7
billion to $5.2 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our
ongoing asset management program yielded $8.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included
net investments in the business of $6.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.9 billion. Debt and other financing
increased cash by $2.7 billion.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share, a 5.8% increase from last quarter. Share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to remain at $1 billion in the second quarter of 2015.
Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings of $4.9 billion
were $4.2 billion lower than the year-ago quarter. Lower upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger
downstream results. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide eight, earnings decreased by $1.6 billion, as
lower upstream and chemical earnings were partly offset by stronger downstream results. Guidance on corporate and
financing expenses remain at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, upstream earnings in the first
quarter were $2.9 billion, down $4.9 billion from the first quarter of 2014. As you can see, sharply lower realizations
decreased earnings by $5.5 billion, where crude declined by almost $54 per barrel, and gas was down more than $2.60
per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $340 million, driven by growth from new
developments. All other items added another $250 million, primarily due to favorable tax effects.
Moving now to slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 97,000 barrels per day or 2.3% compared to the first
quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 129,000 barrels per day or 6%, benefiting from new projects, work
programs, and favorable entitlement impacts, partly offset by maintenance activities. Natural gas production decreased
188 million cubic feet per day or 1.6%. Field decline and divestment impacts were partly offset by volume adds for
Papua New Guinea LNG and higher entitlements.
Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on slide 11, upstream earnings were $2.6 billion lower than the
fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.4 billion, as crude declined almost $22 per barrel and gas
decreased more than $1.20 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $260 million,
driven by higher LNG facility utilization, entitlement impacts, and growth from new developments. All other items
reduced earnings by $500 million, reflecting lower benefits from tax items and absence of the Venezuela ICC award,
partly offset by lower operating costs.
Now moving to slide 12, sequentially, volumes were up 194,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 4.8%. Liquids
production increased 95,000 barrels per day on new project growth and entitlement effects, partly offset by field
decline. Natural gas production was up 594 million cubic feet per day, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe
and higher LNG facility utilization, partly offset by field decline.

Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the
quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of $854 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. Higher refining and
marketing margins increased earnings by $1 billion. Positive volume and mix effects added another $70 million. And
all other items decreased earnings by $260 million, including higher maintenance activities and unfavorable foreign
exchange effects.
Now turning to slide 14, sequentially, first quarter downstream earnings were up $1.2 billion. Stronger global refining
margins increased earnings by $900 million, while unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $70
million. All other items added $340 million, primarily from lower expenses and maintenance activities.
Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15, first quarter chemical earnings were
$982 million, down $65 million versus the prior-year quarter. Higher margins on lower feedstock and energy costs
increased earnings by $240 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added another $30 million. And all other items
reduced earnings by $340 million, mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
Moving now to slide 16, sequentially, chemical earnings decreased by $245 million on lower commodity product
margins. Positive volume and mix effects were more than offset by other impacts.
Moving next to the first quarter business highlights, beginning on slide 17, in our upstream business, we continue to
pursue attractive investments to commercialize our unparalleled resource base. As discussed during our recent analyst
meeting, 2015 will be yet another active year for new developments, including seven major project startups, which will
add another 300,000 barrels of oil per day to working interest capacity.
We reached several milestones over the last few months. Starting in Canada, first bitumen production was achieved
from the Cold Lake Nabiye expansion, which was completed on schedule and on budget. Nabiye produced 12,000
barrels per day in March, with volumes expected to increase to a peak of more than 40,000 barrels per day by year end.
Over its expected 30-year life span, Nabiye will develop 280 million barrels of recoverable reserves.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we initiated production from the Hadrian South subsea development in late March. And I'd
highlight that one of the Hadrian wells recently tested at 200 million cubic feet of gas per day, representing one of the
highest production rates on record in the Gulf of Mexico. Daily gross production from Hadrian South is expected to
reach approximately 300 million cubic feet of gas and 3,000 barrels of liquids from two wells.
In Angola Block 15, we successfully started up Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 project, notably ahead of schedule and
below budget. This capital-efficient project is a subsea development tied back to the existing Kizomba B and Mondo
FPSOs and leverages available [ph] oilage (12:35) for processing, storage, and offloading. The project develops 190
million barrels from three fields, and gross production is expected to reach 70,000 barrels of oil per day, helping to
boost total Block 15 production to 350,000 barrels per day.
In Indonesia, the Banyu Urip development is more than 96% complete, and commissioning activities are well
underway. The project's crude transport system, which includes onshore and offshore pipelines connected to a floating
storage and offloading vessel, has been installed and had its first lifting in April. Through implementation of early
production concepts, Banyu Urip is now producing 75,000 barrels of oil per day gross. Early strong well performance
enables continued use of existing early production facilities along with the ramp-up with the central processing plant.
We expect to reach peak field production of more than 200,000 barrels per day by year end.
The Kearl Expansion project in Canada continues to progress ahead of schedule. All major construction activities are
now complete, and our focus has shifted to commissioning and pre-startup activities. Facility startup is now expected
by midyear.
So with respect to our exploration program, we continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities. In Romania,
additional drilling is ongoing in the deepwater Neptune block, and data collected from these wells are being integrated
into development planning for the area.

Drilling operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are continuing. And we drilled and tested the Pirmam well and are
evaluating these results. Additional drilling is planned in the next several months.
And in offshore Guyana, we are drilling the Liza wildcat, which is the country's first deepwater well.
Lastly in the Gulf of Mexico, we were the apparent high bidder on 11 new exploration blocks in Lease Sale 235, further
strengthening our acreage position. We plan to utilize our advanced seismic imaging capability to enhance opportunity
evaluation on these blocks.
Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our downstream investments, which further strengthen our advantaged
portfolio, here again during the quarter we achieved several milestones. We completed the lube basestock facility
expansions at our refineries in Singapore and in Baytown, Texas, building on ExxonMobil's leading technology and our
worldwide manufacturing footprint. These investments will help supply high-performance lube basestocks to meet
global demand growth.
In Canada, commissioning is underway at the Edmonton Rail Terminal, a 50:50 joint venture between Imperial Oil and
Kinder Morgan. The terminal will have a capacity of 210,000 barrels per day, and will provide logistics flexibility to
support efficient, cost-effective market access for our growing Canadian oil sands production. The facility will also
enable us to deliver additional advantaged crude to our refinery system. Ramp-up of loading activities is expected over
the next few months.
Finally, we also continue to extend our operating cost advantage by improving energy efficiency of our facilities. We
recently funded and started construction of a new 84-megawatt co-generation plant at our Singapore refinery, which
will enable the shutdown of less efficient power generation facilities and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Upon
startup, the unit will add to our total 5.5 gigawatts of gross co-generation capacity around the world. And this is another
example of ExxonMobil's commitment to optimize manufacturing operations, improve energy efficiency, and to reduce
both environmental impacts and operating costs.
So in conclusion, ExxonMobil's results underscore our continued focus on business fundamentals and our competitive
advantages regardless of market conditions. In the first quarter, the corporation earned $4.9 billion, demonstrating the
value of our integrated businesses in a lower commodity price environment. In the upstream, we increased production
from new developments, while the downstream and chemical segments delivered strong results across all regions.
Resulting cash flow from operations and asset sales were $8.5 billion, generating positive free cash flow, which
highlights our disciplined capital allocation approach. The corporation distributed $3.9 billion to shareholders, and we
remain dedicated to creating shareholder value through the cycle.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]
We'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I'll try two, if I may. The first one is on, for want of a better expression, the upstream capture
rate. Specifically, I'm looking at the very strong international gas prices this quarter, which seem to hold up a lot better
relative to the oil benchmarks. And I guess the mix, there are a lot of moving parts obviously, but the mix also saw U.S.
gas production decline. So I'm wondering if you can just hit those two specific issues on what's going on with the
margin and whether you expect that strength to continue. And I've got a follow-up please.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Doug, we generally don't provide forward guidance on the commodity prices. In the first
quarter, our total gas realizations were about $6.11. And as you know, that's a combination of our flowing gas as well
as our LNG sales. And those LNG contracts have mixed fiscal terms that in many cases are benchmarked to liquid
prices. Obviously, there's some type of a lag effect associated with the market conditions.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So the strong European gas – or international gas rather is really more of a lag effect. Is that how
I should think about it?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I think from a LNG perspective, if you remember from our prior discussions, it is a very
significant part of our portfolio. And we had been adding significant liquids-linked volumes over the years, and
certainly is a factor for how our realization will change over time.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, I'll maybe try and follow up on that one offline to get into details. But my follow-up is
maybe a little aspirational in terms of whether you'll answer it or not. But at our conference in November and I guess
multiple times since, you guys have described Exxon as positioned for this type of environment as it relates to M&A.
Obviously, we've seen one very large transaction already. I'm just curious as to if you can qualify how you see the
market in light of that comment, and specifically whether Mozambique LNG is on your radar given that you've held an
advisory role there with the government in recent years, and I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Doug. As we've discussed previously, think about it more broadly as asset
management, which is a key component of our ongoing business. And we regularly assess our portfolio for
higher-value opportunities throughout the cycle. And as you have seen in our financial results that includes an ongoing
program of marketing assets where we believe that they have greater value to others. But likewise, we keep very alert
to opportunities on the horizon for acquisitions. And that may be bolt-on acquisitions, as I said in the past, that provide
natural synergies to existing operations that we can capture incremental value from, or larger acquisitions that
fundamentally will provide strategic value for us in the long term.
As you know, we're not going to signal specifics as to what our intentions are, but we keep very much alert to where
there may be opportunities for additional shareholder value. I'll remind you that given that financial strength that we
have, we can invest through our cycle, including in resource development opportunities, investments in our
manufacturing business, as well as potential acquisition targets.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's a more full answer than I expected. Thanks very much, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Doug.

Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Good morning Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Neil.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: On the quarter itself, it looks like production was a little higher than what we were expecting.
Some of that was the PSEs, but I think some of it was the underlying projects here. And as I think about Kearl, Angola,
and Gulf of Mexico starting up, you've got some ramp towards the back end of the year as well. So I was just curious as
we think about the balance of the year. Could there be some upside to the base case production guidance, or are we not
thinking about some of the turnarounds? Anything you can do to provide some color on the shape of production over
the course of the year would be very helpful.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So just from a production standpoint, I'd tell you that our guidance that we provided in
the analyst meeting last month remains the same, about 4.1 million barrels per day. We started the year very strongly.
As you highlighted, we added significant volumes, whether quarter over quarter or sequentially, associated with new
projects that we have brought on, which as you appropriately have pointed out, are continuing to ramp up.

As I said in my prepared comments, we've got seven new major projects starting up throughout the year. And this is
part of our significant investment program that we had implemented several years ago that saw our CapEx peak up
several years ago, as we wanted to progress these mature assets to capture long-term value, and we're seeing the
benefits of it today. Important in all that, Neil, is not only new projects but our continual focus on the base, making sure
that we have strong reliability. And we'll continue to integrate our learnings into productivity improvements.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: That's helpful, Jeff. And then if you could, comment on two top-of-mind or news topical subjects
here. The first would be any comments around Exxon Torrance and how we should be thinking about the ESP and
timing there; and the second as it relates to Russia, which I know you've spent a lot of time in, and how we should be
thinking about the impact of sanctions on longer-term growth from those operations.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, Neil. On Torrance, just for the benefit of the group, the Torrance refinery in
February experienced an incident which resulted in damage to the electrostatic precipitator. I'll say up front that we
certainly do regret the incident. And we're obviously going to be very diligent in understanding what the issues were,
what learnings we can take from it, and how do we incorporate that into our global business. But this precipitator is an
emission control device that removes fine particles from exhaust gas.
There are several investigations underway both at the state and federal level. Neil, at this time, we really can't estimate
when the investigations will be completed and when the site may return to full operations. As I indicated, we have our
own investigation that's in progress. I will say that we are diligently working to ensure continued supply to our
customers. Some of the units at the refinery are operational, and we are producing both gasoline and distillates. But we
continue to evaluate in parallel with the investigations. We continue to evaluate options to reinstate our capacity there.
With respect to Russia, broadly speaking, there's really nothing new to report at this point. As you know, the sanctions
remain in place, and we will continue to fully comply. I don't want to speculate when those sanctions will conclude.
But I'll remind you that they do not include our Sakhalin 1 operation, which here recently we're very pleased with the
successful start of the third field at Arkutun-Dagi. And I'll also say that we've had a longstanding and successful
business in Russia that's really built on an effective and I'd say mutually beneficial relationship with our Russian
partner. I guess the other point I'd leave you with is that we have a very diversified portfolio, with Russia just being
part of that, and it provides great opportunities for us to continue to grow shareholder value over the years.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Neil.

We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company.
<Q - Guy Allen Baber>: Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Allen Baber>: I was hoping to discuss Kearl performance a bit this quarter. It looks like some significant
improvement relative to where it ran last year and that you could have actually approached max rate there for the
quarter. So could you talk about what you're seeing there? And then could you also address confidence levels in a quick
sustainable ramp-up for the Kearl Expansion and what that timeline looks like and some of the benefits of applying
learnings from some of the struggles with ramping up Kearl 1?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, Guy. I appreciate the question. As we've said in the past, Kearl is an advantaged
long-life asset, one that has significant future potential as you look at how we further optimize the base. As you
highlight, we have continued to improve on our reliability towards our operating targets, and we are fairly consistently
producing at the 110,000 barrels a day gross. We were a bit short of that in the first quarter given some planned
maintenance that we took. But nonetheless, it's important to say that we are achieving higher rates. We've implemented

some facility enhancement opportunities, and we expect to see better reliability going forward.
As I said in my prepared comments, the expansion is progressing ahead of schedule. When that expansion comes in –
comes on, we will get further economies of scale with the full operation. And as I've said previously, we are fully
integrating the learnings from the initial development into the expansion real time such that we will expect to see better
ramp-up on the expansion versus the initial development.
I'd also highlight a couple other things, first that we are making additional investments to maximize logistics flexibility.
And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, the Edmonton Rail Terminal is going to provide additional flexibility.
And that takes me to my second point; that it really is fully integrated with our manufacturing business. And we're
capturing integration value throughout, if you will, the full value chain from upstream, downstream, and our chemicals
business.
<Q - Guy Allen Baber>: That's very helpful, Jeff. Also, I was hoping to get a general comment on what you all are
seeing on the capital spending front when it comes to securing costs reductions and managing your CapEx according to
the internal plan. It looks like you're tracking well to start the year from our vantage point. And more specifically, the
upstream non-U.S. spending was the lowest this quarter it's been since 2009, I believe. So could you just talk about that
a little bit? And is that just reflective of major project phasing, or have there been perhaps some significant cuts to the
international CapEx in areas that are a little bit less visible perhaps to the base or elsewhere that you could talk about?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So let me take your first question in the broadest concept. And as we've talked
previously, regardless of where we are in the business cycle, the organization stays very focused on driving down that
cost structure, whether it be in operating costs or a focus on capital efficiency in our major projects. Across our spend,
we are actively engaged with the various service providers, and we are making some really good progress in capturing
those savings, from raw materials to services to our rig rates to just fundamentally our construction costs. I will
highlight to just make a point that we have a very effective global procurement organization that is focused on
capturing the lowest life cycle cost, and I think it really does advantage us from managing that from a global
perspective.
I think it's also worth noting that our efforts go well beyond just trying to reduce costs from our service providers as we
do things such as continuing to integrate our learning curve benefits into our designs and execution plans. I shared with
you in my response to a prior question that real time we've been able to integrate our learnings in the Kearl initial
development into the expansion project. We continue to enhance our set of opportunities, including through
commercial terms as well as optimizing our development plans. And we continue to leverage what I'd say is the
collective ingenuity between our service providers and our own people in identifying and pursuing more cost-effective
solutions. And I'll note that given our financial capability, we're able to accelerate equipment and commodities
purchases in the softer market, which I think provides a real cost advantage to our project portfolio.
To date, since the price decline, I'd say that the drilling and related services have been most responsive to the current
market, and we've captured about an incremental 20% reduction in our well costs from the Lower 48 to unconventional
plays. In terms of our spend level, I would tell you that there is no new guidance. We've signaled a $34 billion target
for 2015. We are making good progress in capturing the savings, as I said, that was incorporated into that spend level.
But this organization tends to over-perform, and I expect that we'll see further savings beyond what we had envisioned.
<Q - Guy Allen Baber>: Great, that's very helpful, Jeff, and congrats on the strong quarter.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you.

<Q - Evan Calio>: I'll start with the macro – maybe another aspirational question. Exxon touches more barrels than
any U.S. producer, any refiner for that matter. Any color on demand trends that you're seeing, or is there broadly any
change or shift in the longer commodity down cycle view that was espoused at the spring Analyst Day?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Evan, let me see if I can just give you some thoughts on a broader picture. Currently,
we're ranging anywhere from 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day oversupply. General feeling is that as you get into
the second half, we'll see more convergence towards a balanced supply/demand. But as we all know, there was a
significant inventory build in 2014 due to the oversupply. And that has continued year to date, and that storage
overhang will need to be worked off over time. While we may converge in the second half of the year, I'd tell you that
there are still a lot of unknowns, one of them being is how the unconventional production levels in the U.S. will trend
over time, despite the fact that we've seen significant reductions in rig counts.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. My second question, if I could, on PNG, as Total finalizes a development plan for its
proposed second facility – I think it's this quarter, is there potential for Exxon to recover more costs or improve your
overall PNG – LNG economics with a bigger integration of the two projects or infrastructure?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Just broadly speaking, thanks for raising PNG, Evan, because it really does spotlight the
successful organization we have for our project execution and commercializing our resources. What a great success
story with a location that had limited infrastructure; the project was a significant feat for the organization in terms of
being delivered on time and on budget. It ramped up very quickly. It's been held at design rates, and we're just very
pleased with the outcome.
As you think beyond that, ExxonMobil and its partners continue to assess additional resource opportunities. As you
reflect on whether you can pull together enough resource in which to underpin a subsequent train, that's part of what's
being considered amongst the joint venture. I would tell you that that will be the most cost-effective option compared to
another greenfield development. So of course we are very well positioned there, and we are open to options to try to
reduce the overall cost structure for, in general, resource development within Papua New Guinea.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Given the superior economics you've had on the greenfield facility, I presume that a brownfield
expansion would be relatively high within the rankings of your relative potentially upstream projects?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, most definitely.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great, thanks a lot.

We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Thanks. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Blake.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: I think you pretty adequately addressed Guy's question on the capital cost trends, but I
was hoping you may elaborate a little bit more toward the operating cost side. Many of your peers have enacted hiring
freezes and head count reductions, et cetera. And while I know we're not going to get a specific absolute dollar figure
from you, I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about the trends we could expect to see on the operating cost
side aside from just the capital trends.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure. Blake, I would tell you that the comments I made earlier were really reflective of
both our operating costs and our capital costs. The point I would emphasize for you is that really regardless of whether
we're in a high price cycle or in a lower price cycle that we're in right now, the organization has remained focused on
the fundamentals. And you've heard us say before that we're price-takers. And we really focus on those things that we
control, and those things that we control are things such as cost. They're our reliability. They're our productivity. And

it's how we structure the organization in the most efficient way.
I'd tell you that we are very well positioned. We never lose sight of those fundamentals, but we're also very well poised
that when we get into a down cycle like this that we can capture additional savings. And as I alluded to previously,
given our financial capability, we're also able to invest during the cycle and capture a lower cost structure on resources
that we had planned to commercialize in the future. So I think very well positioned; we've got a very capable
organization that keeps their eye on the fundamentals through the cycle. And I think as I've said in the past, we're going
to lead that cost curve.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay, great. The second question for you, Jeff, the recent decision to increase the
dividend, obviously an interesting time to enact that. Obviously, it demonstrates confidence. But I'm noticing the debt
balance has increased about $11 billion from year-ago levels. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about how
you're thinking about shareholder returns and using the balance sheet to continue levering up depending on how long
this down cycle would remain.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I think that's a good question, Blake. When you think about from the perspective of our
capital allocation, nothing's changed. We have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach throughout
history, in the highs and the lows, with a focus on a long-term horizon. We remain committed to our shareholders to
invest in attractive business opportunities that are accretive to financial performance, and to continue paying a reliable
and growing dividend.
Across that business cycle, I'd say that we manage the cash by, as we've said before, returning the excess to our
shareholders through share repurchases or borrowing to fund our investments. But I think what you've seen with the
increase in the dividend and our continuing the stock purchases underscores our commitment to shareholder
distributions. And I think it also demonstrates the confidence that we have in our integrated business model.

Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks. Good morning, Jeff
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Asit.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: I have two quick questions. First on LNG utilization, you I think in your prepared remarks
mentioned utilization improving a little bit. Could you elaborate? Is it primarily related to PNG ramp-up, or is anything
else going on?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So LNG utilization is broadly defined by several operational commercial factors,
including maintenance, reliability of our facilities, and then market and commercial considerations.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Okay, all right. And then shifting gears to the Permian, Jeff, last year Exxon added about 65,000
net acres in the core Wolfcamp. How do you see opportunities evolving in this current macro environment? And on
that, could you update us on activity and volume relative to last quarter please, on the shale plays?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On the shale plays?
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So broadly speaking, as I said earlier when we were talking earlier about M&A, we keep
alert to where we've got opportunities to build a portfolio with accretive assets. So if those opportunities come along,
we'll go ahead and consider them. We're making great progress, as you heard in our analyst meeting, in terms of cost
efficiency improvements, productivity improvements, not only from our drilling completions but also initial well rates,
so really good progress. We've got great opportunities in the Permian and in the Bakken. Just broadly speaking, in the

trending downward, in part commensurate with the efficiency and productivity improvements that we've been able to
capture.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: And how do you see this evolving, the balance of the year trending down through year end?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We have been trending downward, like I said, because we've been able to maintain
real-time capture of additional benefits. So I wouldn't translate that into a linear relationship with activity levels.

We'll go next to Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Good morning, Jeff. Obviously, just moving over to Holland, Groningen has been
in the news again. I'm just trying to understand. What sort of decline did you assume that the Groningen field was
going to have over the next – to 2017 in your planning numbers? And how do you assess the risk that it might actually
be lower? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Ed, when you refer to decline, I think you're referring to the production constraints that
have been posted?
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yes, and obviously you laid out a corporate production objective for the firm.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And Groningen is a part of that. So I'm trying to get a sense what was already in the
numbers so that if it does get worse we can quickly estimate the impact.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure. So first let me start with the impacts in our operating performance here. Both
quarter over quarter as well as sequential, actually Netherlands was up due to higher demand, but that was offset by
some constraints. I'll be clear up front, Ed, that we did incorporate the advertised restrictions into the volumes
projections that we shared with you last month.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Okay, so if they get worse, then that would be a negative delta.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: It really is a function of what happens due to changes in demand throughout the year. But
yes, certainly if there are more extreme restrictions, that will have an impact.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Okay, that's something we'll watch, and then a broader question, which is more
demand related. Obviously, Exxon has refining, chemicals, upstream businesses around the world. You've started to see
some demand estimates from the main agencies be revised upwards. But apart from the chink of light that you saw in
Europe, your opening comments were a little bit downbeat on the global economy. So I was just trying to gauge I guess
whether you think that the recent increases in some of the demand estimates are real or not. And if not, what might be
the reasons, things like tertiary inventory building?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So from a downstream perspective, we did see margin improvements, but due to several
different reasons. So if you think about – in Europe there was some capacity that was brought offline within both
Europe and Asia, as well as due to lower crude prices, as well as some planned and unplanned maintenance that was
taking capacity off the system. And then lastly, there was some fundamental demand improvement in a number of
products like MoGas, distillate, fuel oil. We saw similar benefits in the U.S. as well. Going into the future, I'd be a bit
reluctant to extrapolate that beyond this quarter.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: But the earnings performance, what about demand, sorry, or both?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Are you talking about...

demand for the chemicals business is that it's going to continue to grow greater than the GDP by about 1.5%. Refining
demand I think is going to be a function of what happens in the economies.

Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thanks very much. Hi, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: I just wanted to ask specifically about the international upstream earnings. Most of your
peers have quantified the effect of the change in the UK tax laws within their releases. And I appreciate that you have
addressed the variance that has occurred in the other section, but I'm hoping to get the absolute amount from you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure, let me give you a little bit more color on just the tax rate. As you've seen in our
supplemental information, we had an effective tax rate of a little over 33%, and that's about a 12% drop quarter on
quarter. And as you would appreciate, the effective tax rate is an outcome of our business results across the geographies
in which we operate within. Now most of that drop was really due to the portfolio mix of income across our business
segments and our geographies. About 3% of that was associated with one-time tax items, primarily the UK tax rate
change, which amounted to about a $200 million positive impact on earnings.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Great, I appreciate that, another question that's a completely separate topic. Just in the
current oil price environment, without having seen a lot of deflation yet, are you expecting to make any FIDs this year?
And if you could, address Hadrian North specifically.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So, Jason, I would encourage you to go look at our recent financial and operating review.
If you look at that, you'll see that we have a list of projects that we anticipate that will start up post-2017, and that will
give you a sense for the next tranche of development opportunities that are currently in play. And many of these are in
development planning stages or even some in pre-FID, and that will give you a sense for what's on the horizon. We
don't broadcast planned FIDs in the future, but we do give you a pretty detailed list of what's out there that we're
working on.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Yes, got it in front of me. Maybe if I could just put it another way, have you seen enough
cost deflation in the deepwater yet to maybe accelerate your investment potential in that area, or have you seen very
little in terms of cost deflation?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Frankly, I'd tell you, Jason, that we're never really satisfied with the cost structure, and
we'll always continue to work on it. But as you can appreciate, there are a lot of factors. And as I indicated earlier, we
have seen what I would consider early innings of reductions in services like rig rates. We expect that we're going be
able to do a lot more. And as I alluded to previously, that also includes an expectation within our organization that we'll
be able to further optimize these development plans to maximize shareholder returns. But I'd tell you that we've got a
very, very large, diverse resource base to work on. It allows us to be very selective in what we decide to pursue. And
when we decide – when we get to an FID stage, it's been tested across a range of economic considerations such that
we're confident it's going be accretive to our overall financial performance.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks, Jeff.

Phil Gresh with JPMorgan has our next question.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Hey, Jeff. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Phil.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: One question on the quarter. You talked about the benefit from lower tax rates. I know you
had proceeds from asset sales as well. So I was just wondering if there are any one-time benefits from asset sale gains.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So as you saw in our materials that we sent out, there was about a just under $500 million
cash flow benefit associated with asset sales. That translates to about a 50% reduction in the number if you unwind the
remaining undepreciated investment that we have on our books. And those proceeds are really a result of sales really
across our upstream and downstream businesses.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Okay, got it. And then you've talked about a fair number of investments you're making,
Europe to high-grade your refining capacity to distillates. I guess maybe just give us an update. Remind me of when
that's supposed to be coming online. And then on the U.S. side, what opportunities might there be to debottleneck or
add new capacity here over the next few years if you think that that's a decent return project?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So, Phil, I guess you're referring to our Antwerp coker?
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Yes, exactly.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, so really good progress on that investment opportunity. I'd tell you that it's
progressing towards a 2017 startup.
<Q - Philip M. Gresh>: Okay. And then on the U.S., do you see any opportunities there to debottleneck capacity or
add new capacity in any of your refineries over the next few years?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We regularly evaluate our portfolio, both in the U.S. and internationally, for where we
can capture additional value for earnings growth. And I'd tell you that while I'm not in a position to go ahead and give
you any indication specifically that we keep very mindful of where we can capture additional value, and it primarily
falls in four key areas. One is trying to further improve our flexibility of our feedstock. Two is opportunities that we
can further reduce our cost structure. The third one would be in areas where we can increase our higher-value product
yields; and then lastly, as you saw with the Edmonton Rail Terminal, improving our overall logistics flexibility.

issues surrounding seismic conditions and property in the area. And so my question is whether or not we can get a little
bit more color on that situation, meaning it sounds like when you answered Ed's question a few minutes ago that the
implications for production may be negligible, but I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly. And then also,
there's also been talk of some financial penalties too. So any commentary that you could provide that would help us sort
this out would be appreciated.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So most the information, as you know, has been digested in the media.
<Q - Douglas Todd Terreson>: Yeah.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Just broadly speaking, the original target was about 42 billion cubic meters in 2014.
That's been reduced, originally reduced down to about 36 billion cubic meters, and then in the first half of 2015 down
to 16.5 billion cubic meters. It's still a very dynamic issue. Our understanding is there will be some further guidance
from the government coming out in July. But broadly speaking, as I referred to it previously, our production guidance
has been incorporating the production constraints that had been advertised externally. But it is having an impact, and I
don't want to mislead anybody.

We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great, thanks, maybe a follow-up on the earlier comment that you made on Canadian crude. Can
you give us – how big is the rail terminal that you're working on up there in Edmonton, and how much crude can you
actually move out of there by rail once it's up and running? And can you give us any – the differentials have obviously
been very tough up there in terms of heavy barrels; any thoughts other than the crude terminal in terms of ways in
which you might be able to optimize pricing going forward?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So the capacity of that terminal is just over 200,000 barrels a day, 210,000 barrels to be
exact. I'll emphasize the point I made earlier that it's part of our integrated businesses. It's a key element for us to
connect our upstream business to our refining and chemicals business throughout the Gulf Coast and the
Mid-Continent.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay, thanks, and then maybe a quick follow-up on gas decline as well. We saw a relatively steep
rate of decline in U.S. gas volumes quarter -on-quarter, and I realize there's a lot of quarter-to-quarter volatility. But can
you give us an idea generally, a good assumption for what you would assume for an annual decline rate in U.S. gas?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I'd say just to your point, our gas activity has been fairly limited in the U.S. We have
really transitioned a lot of our drilling activity in the Lower 48 to liquids plays, obviously because we see the value
proposition's stronger.
But I'd really back up and highlight the point that there is a real opportunity in the U.S. to commercialize this gas if we
were to remove some of the barriers that we've got before us. And as you all are aware, we've got an investment
pending in Golden Pass to convert that terminal to an LNG export facility. We think we're very well positioned with
infrastructure. We think it is a great opportunity for the United States. If we could increase the export options for the
U.S. producers, it's going to create additional investment. It's going to create additional jobs. And bottom line, it's going
to improve the economy. So I think the call to the government would be one of really taking advantage of the
opportunity that the U.S. has to really build energy security, not only in the U.S. but more globally by providing, if you
will, free trade.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great, I appreciate the comments. Thanks, Jeff.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Sorry about that. I was messing around with the speaker versus direct line. I'd like to follow up
a little bit on some of the volume guidance and the entitlements and the fairly significant amount of barrels that came
back in. As you think about the 4.1 million barrels for the full year and the outperformance in Q2, is there upside based
on entitlements, or would you say your projection based on an expectation of the futures curve in world prices et cetera
that we should think of 4.1 million barrels as really the right number?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I would tell you. If you go back to the analyst presentation, we had assumed, just for the
sake of the presentation itself, we had assumed a Brent price of $55 per barrel, and of course flowed that into our
production sharing contracts to give you a sense for what we would expect in terms of volume, and that is our target of
4.1 million barrels per day. Obviously, if price changes up or down, it's going to have an impact.
I really don't have a rule of thumb for you when it comes down to entitlement impacts which, as you know, include
many different factors, including the commercial structure as well as expenditure levels and obviously price. But we
had assumed a price forecast that's comparable to where we are right now.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, that's helpful. And then back to the OpEx cost reductions, is there any guidance you can
provide us or any help you can provide us in terms of how that ought to work its way into the system, or whether or not
most of that has been captured during the first half of this year, so Q1 and into Q2?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No. In fact, the guidance I'd give you, Roger, is that we're going to see further capture
opportunities as we progress through the year.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: So do you think the majority has come through, a minority, a plurality?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We have been able to capture savings in the first quarter. But as I alluded to, not all parts
of our cost structure have responded at the same level. And we'll continue to progress those, and we expect increased
savings over time.

We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Brad.
<Q - Brad Heffern>: Most of my questions have been answered, but I'll try more of a macro one. Obviously, Exxon's
always prided itself on investing with a more long-term demand viewpoint. Do you think that with the current down
cycle, we've taken enough CapEx out of the industry that we're going to face more of a supply/demand squeeze going
forward, maybe later in the decade or early in the 2020s?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That's a hard one to really answer. I would step back and just think about the overall
energy outlook that we publish annually. We're fairly confident given the range of variables that we test that we're
looking at about 35% growth in energy demand between 2010 and 2040. Fundamentally, that is how ExxonMobil sets
its investment plans. And obviously, we continue to test that not only annually but periodically.
In terms of how the business more broadly speaking is investing and whether that's going be sufficient to meet that
energy growth over time, there are a lot of variables in it, including you may recall that in our energy outlook, it really
does require very healthy progress on energy conservation. But broadly speaking, it's hard for me to say whether the
current level of investment will cause any shortages in the future.

We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with TPH.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. The first one was to get your thoughts on
Tanzania LNG. I saw that you went non-consent on the last exploration well with Statoil. And I didn't think it had been
featured in any of the four projects you highlighted on the slide at the Analyst Day. I'm just wondering if this is
something that's dropped to the back of the queue that you've deprioritized in this environment with your CapEx
cutbacks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Not at all. Tanzania, for the benefit of the people that are on the phone, brought – to date
we have participated in seven gas discoveries. We think total resource in place is in excess of 20 Tcf now. There is a lot
of work to do in a greenfield development like this. Statoil and ExxonMobil have been progressing development plans
for the initial discoveries, and then there's a very broader consortium that has been looking at the potential for an
onshore LNG facility.
We would tell you that the upfront planning is progressing. I will confirm that there was one well we did not participate
in, but I wouldn't use that as an indication of our lack of commitment. I think what's important here as we go forward is
we get better definition of the project. But equally important, you all know that LNG projects are capital intensive. And
what we need to ensure is that we have a stable fiscal regime with appropriate terms and conditions to underpin that
type of investment.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Okay, thank you, and then one last follow-up question. Going back to the acquisition market,
what we're seeing is it seems like a lot of the U.S. E&P companies and the integrateds are pulling out of international
and investing more in the U.S. We seem to see a similar trend with some of the NOCs, so I was just wondering. Are
you seeing more value internationally and less competition internationally for assets now relative to the U.S. market?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I think broadly speaking, it's a good observation. Broadly speaking, I think when capital
becomes constrained, that by definition that provides additional opportunities.
I would say that from our perspective, it's the value proposition that we bring that we hope that resource owners will
look to, and that is our strong balance sheet, our leading return on capital employed, our operational expertise, the
technology that we bring to resource development. I'll say that we have one of the best if not the best project execution
organizations. And then we've got a leading downstream and chemical business that's fully integrated with our
upstream. I'd say that as a package, those characteristics provide, if you will, the winning proposition for resource
owners.
<Q - Anish Kapadia>: Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you.

Our last question today comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking my question, guys. Can I go back to the balance sheet? You've always
said maintaining AAA is critical. Given that you're not currently funding the dividend and the buyback from cash flow,
what do you think is the cushion that you have in billions to lever up and still maintain the AAA?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I'd first say that AAA is really an outcome of our financial strategies. As you've heard us
say previously, operating cash flows are our primary source of funding for both our capital requirements and
shareholder distributions. We maintain a very strong focus and prudent approach to cash management throughout that

cycle. We have, as you know, significant debt capacity, but we'll maintain our financial flexibility. And we'll continue
to be very disciplined in how we invest and what we choose to invest in, but we're not going to forego attractive
opportunities. And I think that's a key differentiating factor for ExxonMobil is that we've got the capability to respond
when we need to respond. And we're very mindful of our cash balances and how far we want to take our investment
programs.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. Can I pressure you just a little bit on that? Have you looked at what the credit
agencies might say if you take on an additional $5 billion – $10 billion over the next year, year and a half?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Obviously, we look at all the variables when we talk about our cash management and our
financing capability. We keep a very mindful look at what our commitments are in the future. But I'll tell you that we're
very comfortable with where we are, and we're very mindful about where we are in terms of our debt. But I'm just not
going to quote any specific numbers.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it.

remarks.
