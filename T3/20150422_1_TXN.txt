MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day. Welcome to the Texas Instruments 1Q 2015 earnings release conference call. At this time, I'd like to turn the
conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin March, TI's
Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it and relevant
non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be
accessed through TI's website. A replay will be available through the web.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding
forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings,
for a more complete description.
Revenue growth of 6% from a year ago was within the range of expectations we provided in January. Automotive and
industrial markets were strong, as we expected they would be. However, revenue was in the bottom half of the range
for two reasons. First was weak demand in the last month of the quarter in our personal electronics market, particularly
PCs, and in our communications equipment market, particularly wireless infrastructure equipment. We believe these
market-specific issues were due to delay of investments by carriers in capacity upgrades for wireless infrastructure
equipment and a weaker-than-expected refresh cycle for Windows XP. The second reason was a steep decline in the

currency exchange rate for the euro relative to the U.S. dollar. The euro dropped about 10% during the quarter, and
even though only about 5% of TI's revenue is transacted in euros, it was a sharp enough drop that it negatively
impacted our revenue by about $20 million more than we had anticipated.
Even with these pockets of weaknesses, our core business of Analog and Embedded Processing turned in their seventh
and 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, respectively. Combined, these businesses grew 9% and were
86% of our total revenue. Earnings per share were $0.61, reflecting our continued attention to cost controls. Although
the vast majority of our revenue was transacted in U.S. dollars, ROE negatively impacted revenue by $20 million,
which translated to only about $5 million of impact to earnings and therefore cash flow. This is due to a partial natural
hedge against negative currency fluctuations due to our non-U.S.-based operations. It's nice to have a position to be in
this when you have almost 90% of our revenue comes outside of the U.S.
With that as a backdrop, Kevin and I will move on with our report on business performance that we believe continues
to represent the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $609
million. We believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing
shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing-12-month period was $3.6 billion, up 17% from a
year ago. Free cash flow was 27% of revenue, consistent with our targeted range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 2
percentage point improvement from a year-ago period and we believe reflects our improved product portfolio and the
efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing 300-millimeter output and the opportunistic
purchases of assets ahead of demand.
We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively invested in the
businesses. For the trailing-12-month period, we returned $4.1 billion of cash to investors through a combination of
stock repurchases and dividends.
In the first quarter, TI revenue grew 6% from a year ago, with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, primarily due to power management and high-volume analog and logic.
Silicon Valley Analog and high-performance analog also grew. As we mentioned earlier, this is the seventh quarter of
year-over-year growth for Analog.
Embedded Processing revenue grew 2% from a year ago, due to microcontrollers and connectivity. Processor revenue
declined, which was impacted by the weakness in wireless infrastructure. And, again, as I mentioned earlier, this is the
10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for Embedded Processing.
In our Other segment, revenue declined 10% from a year ago, primarily due to custom ASIC products, which also are
heavy in wireless infrastructure, as well as DLP products.
In distribution, resales increased 11% from a year ago. Weeks of inventory remained at historically low levels of just
under 4.5 weeks, which is a decrease by more than a week from a year ago and is even with the fourth quarter. This
level has decreased over the past few years because we have structurally changed how our inventory is managed and
the distribution channel with our consignment program.
From an end market perspective versus a year ago, automotive grew, with most sectors inside this market growing at
double-digit rates. Industrial had broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew, although growth in PCs was lower
than we expected. Communications equipment declined due to wireless infrastructure, and enterprise systems grew.
Kevin will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $1.82 billion, or 57.7% of revenue. Gross
profit increased 13% from the year-ago quarter, and gross margin was up almost four points. Gross profit reflects
higher revenue, increased factory loadings, and benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy as we build more
analog chips on 300-millimeter wafers.

Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $777 million were down $68 million from a
year ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing and Japan that were previously
announced. As we said, that restructuring was essentially complete at the end of last year.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a
noncash expense. Operating profit was $958 million, or 30.4% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the
year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 35.4%. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 18.3%,
more than doubling from a year ago, as we executed our restructuring plan to better align resources with the
opportunities that we are pursuing as we benefit from our investment for growth. Net income in the first quarter was
$656 million or $0.61 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations
was $609 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 124, about three days more than planned due to revenue coming
in at the bottom half of our expectations. Capital expenditures were $123 million in the quarter. On a trailing-12-month
basis, cash flow from operations was $4.04 billion, up 16% from the same period a year ago. Trailing-12-month capital
expenditures were $431 million, or 3% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditure is
to be about 4% of revenue, which includes our $8 billion 300-millimeter Analog plan discussed in our recent capital
management call.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.61 billion, or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow was 17% higher than a year
ago. As we said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing
shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is returned to shareholders or productively invested in
the business. As we've noted, our intent is to return 100% of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds we receive from the
exercise of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
In the first quarter, TI paid $356 million in dividends and repurchased $670 million of our stock, for a total return of
$1.03 billion. Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.14 billion. Outstanding share count was reduced by
3.2% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These returns demonstrate our confidence in
TI's business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the first quarter
with $3.30 billion of cash and short-term investments. TI's U.S. entities owned 82% of our cash. Because our cash is
largely onshore, it is readily available for a variety of uses, including paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI
orders in the quarter were $3.21 billion, up 5% from a year ago.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.38 billion in the second quarter. This
represents continuing weakness in our communications equipment and personal electronics markets, particularly for
wireless infrastructure equipment and PCs, respectively. We also do not expect a near-term rebound in foreign currency
exchange rates. We expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. Acquisition charges,
which are our noncash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about $80 million to $85 million per
quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our annual effective tax rate in 2015 remains about 30%, and this is
the tax rate you should use for the second quarter and for the year.
In summary, we believe that the first quarter demonstrates the strength of TI's business model. While we are not
immune to demand and currency changes, their effects are softened by the diversity of our portfolio and our markets.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.
David Pahl
Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an
opportunity for additional questions. Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we go first to Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Guys, thanks so much for giving me the chance to ask a question. There's so much
controversy in the industry today about whether the industry is as cyclical as it used to be, less so, et cetera. When I
look at your year-over-year growth rates, the June quarter represents the first time you've had a year-over-year decline
at the midpoint of your guidance in a long time. How do you think about that in the context of an industry where many
are arguing that we're not cyclical anymore?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, Jim, as you know, we've been pretty guarded at trying to predict the cycle. It's not something,
obviously, that we can control. We really just go to what we can look at and what we can measure. So as you kind of
tick through the things that you typically look at from a cyclical standpoint, we look at channel inventories are down a
week from a year ago; they're lean at just under 4.5 weeks. Lead times are remaining consistent. Our cancellations and
reschedules are very low.
In addition, we're continuing to deliver on time and very consistently with that. So we've got a couple of pockets of
weaker-than-expected demand, as we talked about specifically in wireless infrastructure and PCs. At the same time,
we're seeing automotive and industrial continuing to be strong, as we expect. So that's what we know. That's what we
can see. The debates will continue on, on how cyclical our industry will be or won't be.
<A - Kevin P. March>: I might just add that we do have several significant competitive advantages, the combination
of which we believe is pretty difficult for anybody else to replicate, and it helps us deal with any notion of cyclicality or
non-cyclicality. And those advantages include that we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry, which really means
engineers start their design work by looking at us first. We enjoy very low-cost manufacturing for all the reasons that
you've heard us talk about for the last few years, including our 300-millimeter wafer fabs. We have the broadest sales
channel – in fact probably three to four times larger than our nearest competitor. And we play in an extremely diverse
set of markets with long-lived products that can enjoy a significant cash return to our shareholders for a long time. So
we think that's what's really important to deal with, whatever may be happening in market cycles and just really make
sure we're a lot more competitively advantaged than everybody else.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow-up, Jim?
<Q - James V. Covello>: Yeah, thanks for that. It was helpful. Obviously you're talking about some weakness in PCs
and comms. In the industrial segment, we're starting to see some negative news flow from the customers. Do you see
pockets of weakness but there's just other pockets of strength that are offsetting those industrial customers that may be
weak? Because I know it's a very broad-based customer base. Or do you just not see any weakness at all in that
segment at this point? Thanks very much.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, Jim. I'll just say that, like you were hinting to, it's very broad based. So we service over
100,000 customers. Most of those will reside in industrial. And, again, I think it's probably helpful for me to just go
through – and when we say industrial, it means something different than I think the investment definition of industrial.
So it'll include things like factory automation and control, and medical, healthcare, fitness products, building
automation, smart grid, energy test equipment, motor drives display, space avionics, appliances, and other segments.
So, again, very, very broad. Of course we'll always see pockets of strength and weaknesses, but overall that industrial is
doing well. We've seen growth in almost all those sectors that I've described.
Okay. Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller, please.

And we'll go now to Chris Danely with Citi.
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Dave, you did a good job of outlining the – I guess, the relative
areas of weakness in Q1 from currency and comm and PC. Can you just give us what you think would be a bigger drag
in terms of company sales from PC versus communications? And then do you guys expect a negative impact from
currency in Q2 as well? And if you could give us magnitude of that negative impact.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, so the one that's pretty straightforward to identify, because it's really just math walking
through the numbers, is that on a year-on-year basis we'll probably see about a $50 million headwind due to currency
exchange rates. And obviously we're not assuming that we see a rebound in those rates.
We'll still see and expect to see the weakness in PCs and wireless infrastructure. And kind of in the balance of the
business, as you know there's always puts and takes. As an example, second quarter a year ago, DLP was very strong.
If you remember, it was benefiting from several world events, one of them like the World Cup. That won't repeat, so
that'll be weaker than it was a year ago and will continue for the rest of the year. But inside of that bucket we'll continue
to have puts and takes.
Do you have a – the other comment that I'd just make on that, that although we see those pockets of weakness, if you
look at the core businesses of Analog and Embedded, we do believe that those will continue to perform well.
So do you have a follow up, Chris?
<Q - Christopher B. Danely>: Yeah, actually just a couple clarifications. So would you expect the PC or the wireless
infrastructure to have a bigger drag on your revenue in Q2? And then it almost seems like – do we need the dollar to
weaken again for that impact to go away, i.e., if the dollar remains strong, is that going be like a negative impact for
you guys every quarter?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Chris, I would say that we probably don't have enough detail to tell you whether wireless
infrastructure or PC, which is going be more of a drag. We just don't expect them to be recovering in the second
quarter.
As relates to ROE, certainly with – if you take a look at just the euro alone versus a year ago, it's down 23%. The yen is
down 14%. We roughly average about 5% of our revenue in euros and around 3% in yen. So clearly with that kind of
weakness on a year-over-year compare, that's going to continue to be an issue that's going to just affect that kind of
math. Doesn't affect our ability to sell in those markets. Continue to remain very competitive in those spaces, as we
enjoy a lot of design wins. But unless the ROE moves back and the dollar weakens, then certainly with that kind of
dramatic decline in those two major currencies, that will be, at least on the fringes, a year-over-year compare headwind
for us.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah. And I'll just add to that that, like we saw in the first quarter, where we had an impact of about
$20 million because of the natural hedging we've got, the impact to operating profit and free cash flow was really only
about $5 million. So fairly small on that front.
Okay. Thanks, Chris. And we'll move on to the next caller, please.
Operator
We now go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess I don't want to beat
a dead horse, but just on the outlook. I mean, when I look at the Q1, it looks like you guys are only missing the
midpoint of your guide by about $50 million, and you explained $20 million of that on currency. As I go to Q2, if I just
kind of anchor against seasonality, you're kind of missing it by $150 million to $200 million. And I guess, sequentially,
are you expecting any more kind of headwinds from currency? I understand the year-over-year compare. I'm kind of
trying to figure out the sequential compare. And when I look at PCs plus comm infrastructure, help me understand the

percent of the business that represents. I'm thinking around 15%; maybe I'm wrong with that. And I guess I'm trying to
get a sense as to why you think the miss in Q2 is going be so much larger in those two buckets than the miss in Q1.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, John, I'll take the first part of the question, and Kevin can add in if he'd like to. The first, if
you look at our PC revenues as a percentage of our total, is around 5%. If you were to include hard drives into that,
that'll add a few points so you'll be just under 10%, in the upper single digits. If you look at wireless infrastructure, last
year it was about 10% of our revenue. So obviously combined there, you're in the mid-teens. So that'll give you an idea
of what that impact is.
Again, as Kevin kind of walked through the math of like the euro as an example, last year 18% of our revenue was
done in Europe. About a third of that, so 5%, 6%, is transacted in euro. And, again, sequentially – I don't know if you
have any additional comments on the impact of the euro?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, I think just 1Q to 2Q I think is what you're trying to ask for there, John. The average
ROE that we experienced on our billings in 1Q for the euro was about 1.13%. And for planning purposes we're using
1.06% going into 2Q. So there's going be a little bit of a – just a quarter-over-quarter ROE impact just from that
standpoint as it relates to the euro. Right now we're anticipating the yen to be pretty flat.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow-on, John?
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, I do, guys. And I know that within the comm section specifically, you guys were doing a
little bit of pruning with the product portfolio. And I'm wondering if any of the pruning that you've done is being
reflected in kind of either sequential or year-over-year growth rates, or do you feel like that that's not a factor as you
look at the June guide?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, we don't believe that that is a factor, John. I think if you look at the impact that wireless
infrastructure has, we sell more Analog product than we do Embedded or the custom ASIC products, so it actually hit
both Analog, Embedded, and Other. Of course you can see the impact more significantly in Embedded and Other
because it's a higher percentage of that revenue. But, again, we've got a good position really across most of the major
OEMs there. And so what we're seeing is really a change in shipments and demand.
So thanks, John, and we'll go the next caller, please.
Operator
We go now to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I was wondering if you could give us a handle
on where you see OpEx going next quarter given the revenue shortfall?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Stacy, OpEx was up about as expected fourth quarter to first quarter. And recall that in
the fourth quarter we typically are down a bit on OpEx because of seasonality for holidays and so on. And the absence
of those holidays in the first quarter, along with our annual pay and benefit increases, traditionally drives our OpEx up
quarter over quarter. Those pay and benefit increases kick in in February. So there's really only two months' worth
inside the OpEx right now in first quarter. So we'll have the full three months. So you'll see just a very slight increase
going into the second quarter.
<Q - Stacy A. Rasgon>: Got it. Thank you; that's helpful. For my follow-up, again on currency, I know you guys are
pointing to sort of direct translation effects. We've had other players who have pointed to demand destruction
concurrency, and I was wondering if you could give us your point of view on what you're seeing more broadly in the
market, not just for your revenues but also for your customers. And are you seeing any sort of broad-based canned
destruction because of the currency movements that we've had?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Stacy, we've talked about that, but there's no way for us to really point to something and
demonstrate evidence that that's actually occurring. Given that the entire industry tends to price in dollars for the

preponderance of what's being shipped, there's not a lot of other alternatives, it would seem, for customers from a
demand standpoint. But that's not to say there might not be a second-order knock-on effect like what you're alluding to.
And we just don't see any way that we can quantify that with any confidence.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah. And there's always pluses and minuses with currency movement. so it's really impossible for
us to be able to quantify that. Okay. Thank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We go now to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Given the timing of when you started to
see the weakness that you talked about in the March quarter and just given the softer-than-seasonal Q2 outlook, would
you have to ratchet down your wafer fab manufacturing activity or wafer starts here in Q2?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Harlan, yes we will be lightening up the wafer starts in 2Q. I would caution you, though, that
pulling back on the wafer starts doesn't necessarily mean that that will have direct impact on our inventory, as the work
in process in 1Q will become finished goods in 2Q. So we would expect inventory probably still goes up a bit in 2Q
even though we'll pull back on wafer starts a little bit.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then Analog was up nicely, 11% year over year despite the
headwinds. Embedded was up only 2%, which is a pretty significant deceleration year over year versus the prior
quarter. I'm assuming that the Embedded weakness was primarily driven by DSPs, given the muted wireless
infrastructure spending environment?
<A - David Pahl>: That – correct. It was impacted by the wireless infrastructure. And in fact, if you look at the
businesses inside of Embedded, we had good growth in microcontrollers and connectivity both. But processors were
down for the exact reason that you identified.
So, okay. Thank you. Carla, we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We now go to Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. One other avenue to get at the broad-based
demand trends – are you seeing any sort of difference in demand patterns from your distributor customers relative to
the OEM customers? Are they getting any more nervous or excited and willing to carry inventory? I realize the weeks
of inventory data that you gave before, but from a bookings perspective, any color would be helpful.
<A - Kevin P. March>: I think all I'd just offer on that, Ross, is that on a year-over-year basis, bookings were up 5%.
60% of our revenue does go through disty, so clearly we're seeing a lot of the bookings coming through the disty
channel. The inventory levels they're carrying are about 4.5 weeks, which is down about a week from a year ago. So
they continue to carry lean levels of inventory. And I think largely that's because they know that we carry inventory on
consignment. We also maintain very short lead times, as we have for a number of years now. And so their ability to get
inventory quickly is pretty reliable for them when they order with us. So I don't – from those kinds of elements inside
that space, there's no real, again, signs that we can look at that says, gee, there's demand destruction going on because
of ROE. Really can't do anything there.
<A - David Pahl>: Right. And I'd add, Ross, that if you look at our resales overall, that was very consistent with our
combined Analog and Embedded sales. So it was in the upper single digits, very close to the same number. Do you
have a follow-on, Ross?

<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Yeah, a quick one, just to make sure that I have all the moving parts. It sounds like in an
answer to a prior question, Kevin, you said OpEx will be up a little. You also said, sounds like utilization will be down.
It seems like putting that together with your earnings guidance it implies gross margin is going to be down a bit
sequentially. Is that – one, is that math directionally correct? Two, is the cause of the gross margin simply utilization, or
is there some mix effect that I also need to appreciate? Thanks.
<A - Kevin P. March>: You may be missing the mix effects inside there, Ross. I don't expect much change in the
margin.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thank you for that question, Ross. We'll go the next caller, please.

We go now to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joseph L. Moore>: Great. Thank you. In the markets that you're seeing weakness in PCs and wireless
infrastructure, do you think – is it an inventory or a demand problem? And I guess what is – we've seen other suppliers
into the PC sector talk about a return to sort of better-than-seasonal second half as you get past the inventory correction.
Where do you stand on that?
<A - David Pahl>: Joe, I'd just say first of all that the wireless infrastructure market has notoriously been very choppy
as you look at demand over the number of years. So there's usually a significant build as OEMs are planning to bid for
the operators' spend. And then it typically surprises us and there's an over-build that occurs. So one kind of begets the
other. We think that the wireless infrastructure market obviously long term is a good market for us, and we've got a
good position in. And just as the numbers come down they'll come up again one day.
On the PC side, that's only a couple of percent of our revenue, so I don't think we really have any unique insight on
that. We believe that that weakness is due to the inventory that's created because there wasn't as much demand in the
XP refresh cycle. But really nothing beyond that. And we'll see how the rest of this quarter goes before we start making
predictions on the back half. We'll just take it one quarter at a time.
So you have a follow-on?
<Q - Joseph L. Moore>: Yeah, and I guess, specifically, I think John Pitzer had mentioned the restructuring that you
did. But just specifically, you did cut back on R&D and macro base stations, and I'm wondering if there's anything
directly that would point to that decision versus revenue you're seeing now or is it completely separate from that?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, again, I think that when we look at those markets, they're very long-tailed and product
cycles. We continue to make investments; they're just not at the same rates that we were making five and 10 years ago.
And that's not unlike what we've done in other markets as they've begun to mature. So there's other areas of wireless
infrastructure that looks like it will be very promising growth, like small cells, and we continue to invest at very high
levels there while we have very little revenue today. So we just believe that we've got to throttle that investment based
on the opportunity overall.
So thanks for that question, and we'll go to the next caller.

We go now to Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Thanks a lot. I had two questions. First of all, I had a question about the channel. Did you see
any meaningful cancels this quarter? And then I had a follow-up on the inventory.

<A - Kevin P. March>: No. We saw cancellations continue to run very, very low, as we've seen for a number of
quarters now. And same is true of reschedules, too, by the way, also very, very low. So no patterns indicating change in
demand there.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Okay. Great. And then, Kevin, you said inventory's going to be up I think again, you said, in
June despite loadings being down. I guess my question is, what do you think is sort of the – now that you've had a
couple quarters to think about the mix, what do you think is the right normalized level of inventory? And do you think
that we're going to come back down to sort of that more normalized level during the back half of the year?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Tim, we're going to use 2015 to really kind of monitor the effect of all the changes
we've been doing with the portfolio and with our operations to model what we think is a more appropriate overall level
of average inventories to carry. What we did conclude was that the prior model, which had worked for us quite well, of
105 to 115 days was appropriate given the mix that we had. But clearly as we move to more and more consignment, as
we move to keeping lead times very short across the vast abundance of our portfolio, that dictates that we've got to
carry more inventory than we have in the past. And so what we use in 2015 to run various tests on what the appropriate
level of inventories are to beat the service metrics that our customers have come to expect of us. And then probably by
the time we get to early next year when we do our capital management update, we'll go ahead and articulate a new
model at that point in time.
<A - David Pahl>: Great. Tim, thank you. And we'll go to the next caller, please.
Operator
We now go to Romit Shah with Nomura.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah, thank you, Kevin and Dave. I just – I wanted to clarify how these two segments that
comprise 15% of revenue are driving what I estimate is a 500-basis-point miss relative to seasonality. Are you guys just
being conservative in anticipation of maybe a fallout in some of your other end markets? Or am I just not fully
incorporating other parts of the equation here?
<A - Kevin P. March>: So I'll go ahead and just – I think Dave attempted last time. I'll give it a try. There are several
moving parts going on there when you look at 2Q, and the best compare is on a year-over-year basis. So just the ROE
alone impacts us about $50 million from a year-over-year compare for growth rate. Then you go beyond that and
you've got continuing weakness in wireless infrastructure and PCs. And then you've also got the absence of the benefit
that DLP had a year ago, which was meaningful due to the World Cup and other large sporting events. In fact we saw
some of that impact of DLP already begin to occur in first quarter. As we mentioned, DLP was down quite a bit in first
quarter. So you got those kinds of headwinds – ROE, wireless infrastructure, PC, and DLP – and then we've got the rest
of the portfolio basically doing fine, consistent with what we've been seeing in the economy for the last few quarters.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow on, Romit?
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah, thanks for the clarification, Kevin. I just wanted to ask you about M&A. There's been, as
you guys have seen, a lot of activity over the last year. And when I think about TI, M&A has certainly been part of
your DNA over the last 10 to 15 years. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about M&A specifically in this
environment, relative to buying back your own stock?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Romit, our M&A posture hasn't changed at all, meaning that the most important thing is
that to the extent that we consider an acquisition, it's got to be something that fits into our strategy that's consistent with
our portfolio interests, and something that we can generate long-term returns on and therefore excess free cash flow for
our shareholders. If it kind of passes the strategy test, then it's got to pass the numbers test. And, frankly, we have a
hard time with many of the companies that are out there today, making those kind of numbers work.
Contrast that to when we bought National back in 2011 at a time when all semiconductor stock prices were
considerably lower, you can certainly see in retrospect that was a very good return for our shareholders. So we tend to

be very disciplined on that. We'll continue to be disciplined on that. Buying back own shares right now, especially as
long as they trade below the intrinsic value of the company, is – also continues to be a good return for our shareholders,
especially from a free cash flow perspective.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thanks, Romit. We'll go to the next caller, please.

We now go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi. Thank you. Kevin, you mentioned if you look at the portfolio, the rest of the business
is doing fine outside of the factors that you highlighted. If you go back through history and look at such a sharp
deceleration – such a sharp destruction, let's use that word – on the exchange rate, when do you expect that to manifest
itself in other parts of the business? So, for instance, the distributors in Europe and other pieces, widgets that semis go
into for instance, in industrials and autos, what does past currency issues tell us on that front? And then I had a quick
follow-up.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Ambrish, I wish I had some clever insight on that, but I'm afraid I don't just from an
experience standpoint. I actually do not recall that in my experience in this capacity – and I've been in this role for a
very long time now – seeing currency drop this sharply in this short a period of time. So I have no history from which
to try to get a reference point to answer a question like that. I think we're just all going to have to wait and see where
this takes us.
I think the encouraging part is, especially in industrial and automotive, is that the silicon content going into those
spaces continues to increase year over year. And so despite ROE impacts, I don't think that's going to slow down the
silicon content increases in those spaces. And, frankly, if you look at the pricing of those end equipments, the cost of a
$0.50 analog chip going to $0.55 is pretty irrelevant to an automotive customer, I think. So you look at the more macro
effects and especially where we see growth for semiconductors in auto and industrial, it doesn't seem likely that we
would see a sharp impact in demand caused just because of ROE. There may be other factors that may lead to that kind
of difference.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I'd just add that as many arguments as putting pressure on demand, there's as many
arguments that it could help demand on the other side. So it's really tough to be able to quantify each of those impacts.
So, Ambrish, you've got a follow-up?
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Yes, I did, Dave. Thank you. And this is a clarification in response to Ross's question.
Kevin, did you say gross margin will be flat? And if so, the way to think about it is that factory loading goes down in
the non-300-millimeter, and 300 millimeter is continuing to ramp, so that offsets that lower factory loading?
<A - Kevin P. March>: That's a safe way to think about it, Ambrish. There's mix going on inside there, but clearly we
continue to ramp up 300-millimeter, which is much more cost-effective for us. So in balance we don't expect much
change in margins.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thanks, Ambrish. And we can go to the next caller, please.

We go now to Doug Freedman with RBC Capital.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. Thanks, guys, for giving me an opportunity to ask a question. Just to follow on that mix
shift that you're seeing, Kevin, can you possibly give us the utilization on your overall factory base and the utilization
that you're seeing in 300 mil? And then I have a follow-up.

Page 11 of 12
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Doug, on the utilization, we typically would just talk about that if something drastic has
occurred. So I won't go into that right now. I will remind you, though, on the capital management call I did discuss for
RFAB in particular that we have the majority of the equipment necessary to support the build-out of that factory to a $5
billion revenue level, and that in 2014 we'd achieved about $2 billion worth of build for revenue in support of that. So
call that roughly 40% utilized. But at the same time we're also converting DMOS6 from its exclusive use by Embedded
Processing to also be able to be used by Analog. And that'll add another $3 billion of 300 millimeter Analog capacity in
DMOS6. So you could say in a sense that our utilization of 300 millimeter may actually decline, but that's not because
of loadings, that's because of increase in our capacity.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: And the question, really, that I have as my follow-up is when you look at the year-on-year
growth, last year clearly we had a nice year, but with the guidance you've just offered, we're actually down
year-on-year. If we look at the long-term growth rate of your business, is there a point in time at which you might
adjust what you think your long-term growth rate would be such that you felt factory consolidation would be part of the
equation to drive higher efficiency?
<A - Kevin P. March>: No, Doug. Factory consolidation isn't on our radar. What we're really interested in is very
inexpensive factory acquisition with extremely low carrying cost that allows us to grow into it in a very efficient
manner. As we've been talking about, Analog and Embedded Processing combined, for an extended period of time
now, have been growing at about a 9% compound annual growth rate. And in fact, even combined for this 1Q that we
just closed out, they grew another 9% year-over-year. So they continue to grow quite healthy. I would expect that as we
move forward in time, we'll look at those factories that provide us the best cost efficiency and cash flow delivery and
keep those operating and loading those. That's probably going to be biasing our loadings towards 300 millimeter.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I'd just add, too, that if you look at the growth rates in time and just look at what's
happened in second quarter, the overall numbers are very strong. I mean, if you look at our gross margins, you look at
where our OpEx levels are, our operating margins, with that 9% Analog and Embedded Processing growth, this quarter
we turned in 27% free cash flow, right? So our financial performance isn't predicated on having to hit a certain growth
level. We can do very well in a low-growth environment, or things if pick up we're in a good position to be able to
support that as well.
So, okay. Thank you, Doug. And we go to the next caller, please.

We'll now go to Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just looking back at the weakness in PC
market, you clearly had a fairly seasonal December. I don't know if you saw any PC slowdown there. Intel sure didn't.
But then, it looked like you took a correction in March. So, one, if you can – I apologize if you already answered this –
but within Analog, was your high-performance and Silicon Valley still up in March? And really it was the PC dragging
it down? If so, would be down probably double-digits. Is that the right way to look at it? And then as you look to June,
Intel is up, PC channel's starting to turn around. Is it just that you're working through some inventory? Or is there any
way you can quantify that? And then kind of just help me with the math as to when do you really start to see this?
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, well, let me take a shot at it, and then I'll let you ask a follow-up. Some of that I think we've
touched on. But, again, the weakness that we saw, Blayne, was – really had manifested in March, and it was both in
PCs and in wireless infrastructure. Obviously I don't know how that played out at some of our competitors, but we do
expect to see that weakness in second quarter. Obviously, our guidance is reflective of that.
So I don't know if that helped, or if there's part of that you'd like to ask a clarification or follow-up?
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Maybe I would ask – and obviously you're not going to sign up for a full-year forecast, but when
you look at the businesses of PC and comm, clearly they've been down for several quarters here, or will be with the
June guide. To get full-year growth would require a substantial pickup in the second half. Do you see these as

headwinds this year for you? And if so, how much?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Blayne, I'll just take that. We'll go ahead and forecast the balance of year in front of each
quarter when we get there, so we just give you the guides one quarter at a time. Obviously, I think you guys are
probably better equipped than we are to come up with analysis to help figure out what the year might be, and we'll just
