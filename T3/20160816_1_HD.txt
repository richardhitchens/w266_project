Now before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on
our website.
Now let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, achieving a milestone of the highest quarterly
sales and net earnings results in company history. Sales for the second quarter were $26.5 billion, up 6.6% from last
year. Comp sales were up 4.7% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.4%. Diluted earnings per
share were $1.97 in the second quarter, up 13.9% versus last year. In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted positive
comps in the second quarter led by our Western division, and all 19 U.S. regions and top 40 markets saw single-digit to
double-digit comps in the quarter.
Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico reported
positive double-digit comps in local currency, making it 51 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth. Our
Canadian business also posted positive comps in local currency for a total of 19 consecutive quarters of positive comp
growth.
We continue to see broad-based growth across our stores; both ticket and transactions grew. All of our merchandising
departments posted positive comps and we saw healthy balance of growth amongst both our Pro and DIY categories,
with Pro sales outpacing our DIY business in the U.S.
The Interline integration is progressing as we continue to deliver on the acquisitions of value drivers. We have been
piloting our first business use case, offering Interline's catalog of products to Pros shopping Home Depot stores. We are
pleased with the traction that we've seen in this pilot, although it is still early days. We continue to work towards
leveraging Interline's capabilities to expand our share of wallet with our current customers as well as gain new
customers.
Our online business had sales growth of approximately 19% versus last year and represented 5.6% of total sales. As
Ted will detail, we continue to leverage our merchandising tools to refine product offerings across channels based on
customer preferences. Our goal is to provide our customers with the convenient and fulfillment options they desire. We
continue to build out capabilities to improve the overall customer experience. For example, in recent months, we began
implementing our dynamic ETA feature for online purchases. Dynamic ETA provides a delivery date based on the
customer's location. In the past, we issued a generic delivery window estimate which allowed for extra time or cushion
for the delivery commitment to customers. As we've begun to implement the dynamic ETA, our promised delivery date
to customers is earlier and more accurately estimated. As a result, we're seeing an increased conversion in customer
satisfaction.
We continue to see great productivity from our supply chain as the dividends from investments made over the past
several years yield a positive impact on our inventory productivity, logistics costs and service to our stores and
customers. As you know, we see our supply chain transformation as an ongoing work-in-progress and continue to
optimize our network with initiatives like Supply Chain Sync. Sync is in the early stages of a multiyear rollout.
We are investing to more effectively meet our customers' demands. The rollout of COM, our new customer order
management system is now fully deployed in all U.S. stores. The next phase of COM is to optimize and fine tune this
new system. Following behind COM is the rollout of BODFS, or Buy Online, Deliver From Store which we expect to

be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
While we had a strong quarter, as you have heard, we are instituting a high degree of change across many areas of the
business. With this amount of change, there will be learnings and opportunities to refine the process along the way. In
the quarter, we identified several opportunities for improvement, particularly around inventory management and freight
handling which we're working to address.
Turning to the macro environment, we continue to see positive signs in the housing data, which we believe serve as a
tailwind for our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing our earnings per
share guidance for the year to reflect our outperformance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. A
successful spring season depends on the hard work and dedication of the 400,000-plus associates we have serving our
customers today. I want to close by thanking them. Based on the first half results, almost 100% of our stores qualified
for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. We are very proud of their efforts.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.
Edward P. Decker
Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our results in the second quarter. Core maintenance
and repair categories as well as many Pro-heavy categories continued to have solid performance in the quarter. Our
growth in the quarter was balanced. Total comp transactions grew by 2.2% for the quarter, while comp average ticket
increased 2.5%. Ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per basket as project business continued to show
strength. Our average ticket was also positively impacted from slight commodity price inflation mainly from building
materials and lumber. The total impact at ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 18 basis
points. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact to our average ticket growth of approximately 69
basis points.
Focusing on big ticket sales in the second quarter, transactions for tickets over $900, representing approximately 20%
of our U.S. sales, were up 8.1%. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were HVAC, appliances and
roofing.
All merchandising departments posted positive comps led by appliances, which had double-digit comps in the quarter.
Tools, lumber, plumbing, décor, indoor garden, building materials and lighting were above the company's average
comp. Hardware, outdoor garden, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, paint and flooring were positive but below the
company average.
As Craig mentioned, we continue to see notable strength with our Pro customers. Pro sales grew faster than the
company comp led by our high-spend Pro customers. This continued strength led to comps above the company average
in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, power tools, power tool accessories, wiring devices and interior doors.
We saw continued strength in the core of the store as our customers undertook various projects. For example, landscape
lighting, laminate and vinyl flooring, [indiscernible] (9:48) organization and cleaning had strong comps in the quarter.
Widespread and record-setting heat in the quarter drove strong performance in HVAC, air conditioning, fans and air
circulation. Sales were also strong in categories like irrigation and watering, which delivered double-digit comps.
Our store associates did an exceptional job executing our summer events and creating excitement in our stores. Our
Memorial Day, Father's Day and 4th of July events provided excellent values and we saw strong demand from our
customers. These events helped drive robust comps in appliances, tool storage, outdoor power and grills.
In our ongoing effort to update and refresh our assortments, we continually leverage our merchandising tools to
fine-tune our online and in-store assortments. One specific example of this is with our patio offering. We found that
many customers want to come into our stores to purchase and pick up their patio sets. We altered our assortment and
put certain patio sets back into the store. This strategic move was well received by our customers, leading to record
sales and sell-through in our stores.

Our online business had strong growth in the quarter, with double-digit traffic growth and improvement in conversion.
Our interconnected retail initiatives continued to evolve to meet the changing demands of our customers. Mobile and
tablet are over 50% of our traffic and are important tools that our customers use to engage with our products, our stores
and our associates.
We are enhancing the functionality in mobile with features like larger and clearer product images, live mobile chat and
a simplified check-out experience. As evidence of the success of our interconnected strategy, approximately 42% of our
online orders are now leveraging our store footprint for fulfillment and nearly 90% of our online product returns are
processed through the convenience of our stores.
Now let's turn our attention to the third quarter. Our focus on innovation is a key part of our strategy. For our Pro
customers, we will be introducing the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system in our stores this fall. This DEWALT system
uses the innovative FLEXVOLT Battery which identifies various types of DEWALT tools and adjusts voltage to
provide the appropriate level of power needed. These products provide corded performance without the cord and the
innovative brushless motors increase tool run-time and durability, saving our Pros time and money on their job sites.
Amongst big box retailers, the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system can only be found at The Home Depot.
As smart devices continue to resonate with customers, we are excited about expanding smart technology with the new
Ryobi Garage Door Opener. This innovative system connects with any smart device and allows our customers to
operate their garage door remotely, talk on the phone or play music through an embedded Bluetooth speaker or park
with ease using the Laser Park Assist attachment. The new exclusive Ryobi Garage Door Opener can only be found at
The Home Depot.
The fall season and cooler temperatures are just around the corner and we have an incredible lineup of great values and
special buys for our customers during our Labor Day, fall cleanup and Halloween/Harvest events.
With the Halloween Harvest season, we have a tremendous amount of new seasonal products like the exclusive
Animated Window Projector Kit which allows our customers to easily decorate their windows with animated digital
holiday clips. This is the first digital decoration in the marketplace and it is exclusive to The Home Depot.
Our exciting third quarter events, along with outstanding execution in stores, will position us for success in the third
quarter.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to remind you that our net earnings for the
second quarter of 2015 included a pre-tax net expense of $92 million related to our 2014 data breach and a $144
million pre-tax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. When added together, these two items contributed $0.02 of
diluted earnings per share last year that did not repeat this year.
So with that, let's get started. In the second quarter, sales were $26.5 billion, a 6.6% increase from last year, driven
primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline Brands. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar
negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $181 million or 0.7%. Our total company comps store or
same-store sales were positive 4.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 2.3% in May, 7.5% in June and 4.5% in
July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.4% for the quarter with positive comps of 3% in May, 8.4% in June and 5%
in July. Our monthly comp sales were a bit distorted by the timing of Memorial Day. Last year, Memorial Day sales
were included in our May results. And this year, they were included in our June results. Adjusting for this timing shift,
our U.S. comps would have been 4.3% in May, 7% in June and 5% in July.
Our total company gross margin was 33.7% for the quarter, an increase of three basis points from last year. The change
in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors: First, as expected, we had 22 basis points of gross
margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our

supply chain, driven primarily by increased productivity and by lower fuel costs. And finally, we had 12 basis points of
gross margin expansion due primarily to reaching higher co-op and rebate tiers in certain category classes which
lowered our costs. For fiscal 2016, we continued to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we
reported in fiscal 2015.
In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 78 basis points to 18.2%. As I mentioned,
our expenses in 2015 included $92 million of net data breach-related expenses that did not repeat in 2016. In the
quarter, we were pleased with our expense performance as total expenses were under our plan. But due to our
continued focus on expense control, we now believe that our fiscal 2016 expenses will grow at approximately 32% of
our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the quarter was 15.5%, an increase of 81 basis points from last year. Interest and other
expense for the second quarter was $228 million, up $144 million from last year, reflecting last year's pre-tax gain on
sale of HD Supply common stock that did not repeat this year.
In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 37% compared to 37.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. For fiscal
2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to be approximately 37%. Our diluted earnings per share for this second
quarter were $1.97, an increase of 13.9% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, inventory was $12.3 billion, up $464 million from last year,
due primarily to the impact of Interline. Inventory turns were 5.2 times, up one-tenth from the second quarter of last
year. Year over year, accounts payable increased by $778 million to $8.3 billion, reflecting the timing of purchases and
the impact of Interline.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 9.46 million shares of outstanding stock. For the
remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding stock using excess cash,
bringing total anticipated 2016 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending
long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 29%, 400 basis points higher
than the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
Now turning our attention to the full year, recent GDP growth estimates suggest a slowdown in the U.S. economy from
what we expected. But we are encouraged by the strength of our core business as the U.S. housing market continues to
recover. Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming the sales
growth guidance we laid out at the end of our first quarter. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately
6.3%, with comps of approximately 4.9%. Implied with this guidance is a comp for the second half of fiscal 2016 of
approximately 4.3%. This is not a reflection of a sequential slowdown in sales, but rather a reflection of year over year
performance. On a two-year stack basis, we expect our comps in the back of the year to be about the same as what we
reported for the first half of the year.
While we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance, we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year
principally because of better expense control and therefore more operating leverage than we anticipated at the end of
the first quarter. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted
earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.6% to $6.31.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call and Sherlon, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. There was a lot of noise, sounds like, in the early part of the
quarter with weather and some Memorial Day shift. Was there any – I don't know if it's possible to measure this, but do

you think there was some degree of demand destruction that you didn't pick up, granted, June-July improved. But I'm
trying to get a sense if you think underlying demand could actually be stronger than it looks.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, I think there's no doubt to your point that May was a tough start. When you look at
variability in the quarter, month-to-month compared to a year ago, we had higher variability and part of that was clearly
driven by weather. An example would be in Washington, D.C. alone, there were 20 days of rain in the month of May.
So it's hard to tell, but clearly, we know there was an impact.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow-up, I mean there's a lot of noise in retail across many
segments. You mentioned that the housing or housing outlook is fine. I know this seems obvious, but can you maybe
just talk about what gives you confidence in it? Is it the Pro growth? Is it the type of projects? I'm sure it's all the above,
but love to hear just some color on that topic.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So clearly, when we look at housing, things that we focus on are home value appreciation
which continues to grow. We look at housing turnover, which is kind of running at norms. A little north of 4% of the
housing stock is projected to turn in fiscal 2016. And then we look at new household formations and all of those are
drivers in our business and all of those continue to recover.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: But I would say what gives us confidence is strength in the big ticket. As Ted called out,
another outstanding quarter in our big ticket categories. As Ted also called out, the growth in the quarter was balanced
between ticket and transactions. And part of the ticket growth was item in the basket growth and that tells us that the
project business is alive and well. And then finally, when you look at the strength in Pro and our Pro business outpaced
our DIY business. So when you couple just the trends that we see in our existing business, coupled with what we see in
housing, it gives us confidence for the back half of the year.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
We'll go next to Kate McShane, Citi Research.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Sure.
<Q - Kate McShane>: This might sound a little nitpicky, so I apologize. But I just had noticed in your prepared
comments that you had mentioned that kitchen specifically was below the company average comp. And I just was
trying to reconcile the strength that you saw in Pro during the quarter versus some of this merchandise commentary and
what you're seeing more specifically in terms of what is driving that Pro business in Q2.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Well, our overall kitchen business did comp positively. The special-order kitchens are not
as much of a Pro category. The take-with kitchens, our in-stock kitchen business, is more of the Pro business and that in
fact was a stronger comp than the special-order.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You would expect to see some seasonality in our kitchen business. People are on vacation
during the summertime. Putting a new kitchen into your home isn't really top of your mind. We expect the kitchen
business to come back in the fall time because it typically does.

<Q - John Baugh>: Thank you. Congratulations on a strong quarter. I was just curious on payables, which were quite
strong. You mentioned timing. If you could just talk about the sustainability of that number in the second half and
whether your free cash flow assumptions have changed at all for the year. Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Hey, John. The payables performance at the end of the quarter was a reflection of increased
purchases. Craig commented in his remarks that we had some learnings during the quarter. And one of those learnings
was actually we had an error in our order, a logic that we use for inventory purchases. And so we corrected that error
and have corrected it and actually sent purchases to our suppliers. So that is just a timing matter. It will normalize itself
by the end of the year, so this isn't a consistent trend.

Operator
We'll go next to Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Morning.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Wanted to talk about inventories a little bit. We've heard a number of vendors
talk about inventory destocking at retail; orders down in the second quarter. Is that process largely behind The Home
Depot, does it in any way reflect a less robust outlook for the market? And I know, Craig, you mentioned learnings and
process improvement around inventory management and freight handling. Did I have any impact in terms of what we
heard from the vendor community?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Hey, Chris. As Carol just mentioned, one of the learnings this quarter was in fact that we did
have an error in an update logic that we put into our replenishment. We identified that, corrected it, and that clearly did
have an impact on the order flow that happened during the quarter. That has been corrected moving forward.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. And just thinking about the weather and thinking about the first half and
the upcoming fourth quarter, in retrospect, now that you're further along, could you reassess the amount of pull forward
and the bathtub effect between the first quarter and the second quarter? And as you think about lapping this upcoming
fourth quarter, I think a lot of investors are talking about, hey, the – Home Depot really benefited from a warm winter.
What's your thoughts on that? And do you think the fourth quarter in effect pulled forward demand from the first half
of this year?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It's really, really hard to gauge that. Clearly, as we called out in the first quarter, we felt that
there was some pull forward. It's really hard to know exactly how much that happens. Who knows what the weather in
the upcoming fourth quarter will be, but we'll try to stay focused on driving the business.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And we know we had a large comp in the fourth quarter of last year that we have to comp on
top of and we've planned for that. We'll have a great holiday event that we'll talk to you about next quarter.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got three kind of quick ones. I think the first
one is the 60-day terms I think that you guys brought forward. I think it was in end of last year, beginning of this year
for the Pro sales. Any quantification on what you think that's doing to your Pro sales as you look at it? I know you've
talked about strength there.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right. So as we look at sales on our private-label card, particularly our commercial
private-label card, we're really pleased with the results. Sales are up year-on-year, ahead of our expectations. Our new
accounts are up double-digit, ahead of our expectations. So it's still early days. We're only six months into the program,
but we're very pleased with what we're seeing.
Now if I could zoom out a little bit and talk about our private-label program in total, we actually saw a decline in
penetration year-on-year of about 30 basis points, taking our penetration down to just under 23%. The decline was
attributed to a decline in the consumer card. And when we peel back the layers of the onion to say, well, what's
happening with the consumer card, we see a few things.
Last year, we had a few promotional events that we did not repeat this year, so that impacted the penetration. And then
we see increasing competition coming from bank cards. In fact, I received one just at my home this week from Visa
that's offering deferred financing. So there's increased competition out there.
And then finally, and interestingly, we're seeing a robust penetration increase in PIN debit. PIN debit up over 100 basis
points year-on-year is now the third largest form of tender inside of our company. So the first largest is the bank card,
the second largest is the private-label card and the third largest is PIN debit.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Interesting. Thank you. That's good information. Have you guys looked at when we go
through election cycles, kind of what, you know, we're obviously going to heat up the election cycle and we've heard at
the high end, some high-end consumers are postponing certain purchases because of the election cycle. Have you guys
looked at your numbers and how does that flow through The Home Depot as we go through the fall?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: To be totally honest with you, we're focused on our customer. We don't really pay a lot of
attention to it. It's all about how do we take care of our customers every single day and make sure we're driving value
for them every day.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. Then my last – and this one is definitely a random question, but – it's our second
year of Prime Day. Do you guys feel Prime Day as Amazon does it? And then I'll yield. Thanks.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Interestingly, on Prime Day, there's so much activity in the marketplace. It draws a lot of
shoppers online and our customers respond and we have a good day drafting off Prime Day.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. Perfect. Thank you, guys.

We'll go next to Budd Bugatch, Raymond James.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter. I guess my first question has to do with the
Interline integration. Maybe talk a little bit more or give us a drill-down and give us some color of, A, what you're
doing, and B, maybe the impact on the economics of the company during the quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So, Budd, we're, again, still working through the integration. We're kind ahead of the value
drivers. We like what we see, but I'll let Bill comment on that; he's here.
<A - Bill Lennie>: Budd, we talked a little bit the last call about our customer intercepts and research that we're doing
and the prioritization of our use cases where it's based on really the customer feedback, plus if you look at the market
opportunity. And we have in pilot our first use case which is the ability to enable customers to shop Interline
assortments inside The Home Depot stores. We have a pilot of 20 stores. It's really early days, but our results are

exceeding expectations. They're really three times expectations. So it's encouraging. It says that all of the assumptions
there of the ability to increase share of wallet with the Pro remain intact. And so we'll get that – continue to focus on
that. But again, it is very, very early days.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And in terms of the impact on the quarter, as we talked about, our top-line growth exceeded our
comp sales growth because of the impact of Interline. We called out the impact on our gross margin. It did have a
dilutive impact on our gross margin, which we more than made up for with productivity and supply chain and vendor
co-op and rebate.
And then it does add more variability in expenses. So if you look at our expense growth factor for the quarter, backing
out Interline, it was a little higher than 60%, as we expected. As we now anniversary the Interline acquisition moving
into the third quarter, our expense growth factor is going to come more in line with what we expected.
And in fact, our expenses are under such good control, we were under our expense plan for the second quarter. We're
taking our expense growth factor down from the year. At the beginning of the year, we said it would be about 40% of
our sales growth. We now think it's about 32% of our sales growth.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And my follow-up really has to do with appliances, double-digit comp, if I heard you
correct. Ted, how sustainable is that? What's causing that? Do you see that in advance of the market itself?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Well, there's clearly some share opportunity in the marketplace that we've purposely
positioned ourselves for. So we continue to invest in expanding our appliance showrooms with the larger showrooms.
We can put more display pieces on the floor. It allowed us to get a much broader showing of Whirlpool's offering as
well as high-end brands like KitchenAid. So we're just a lot more relevant in the space with a better offering.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And a double-digit comp in appliances meant 50 basis points of total comp growth for our
company.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And just quickly, just one follow-up. Is – Pro penetration, can you give us any comment
on that as a percentage of sales?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It's hovering where it's always hovered, around 40% of sales.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Right.

We'll go next to Michael Lasser, UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Craig, how long do you think that
home improvement demand can remain decoupled from other sources – other elements of the economy, other elements
of retail? I think Carol in her prepared remarks noted that some economic prognostications have been ratcheted down,
but you're keeping your forecasts for same-store sales in place. So how long do you think that this can be an oasis
within the broader economy?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, I think when you look at a few factors, first of all, there's about 4.6 months of supply.
Average historical is about six months. So that certainly means there's opportunity as you go forward. That's also
helping to keep home value appreciation going and there's projections in the market out there from various sources that
would say home value appreciation continues for the next couple of years for sure. And so I think this is a tailwind that
we see for the foreseeable future in the guidance window that we've given.

<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And if you look at some of the housing markets that have gotten really hot, San
Francisco, Miami, are seeing similar trends there? Or any signs that demand is starting to ebb out?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We don't – yeah, we don't really see any change.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We haven't seen any change. The fundamentals, as Craig pointed out, for housing and then the
impact to home improvement are really, really good. And you go back to household formation, if the number of people
in households were to drop to the 2000's level, it would create 4.3 million new households. Now, will they all go into
single-family-owned households? No. But we serve both. We serve owned household and we serve rental households.
So there's just a tremendous amount of tailwind that continues to support our business and our business outlook through
2016 into 2017 for sure, if not 2018/2019.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And my follow-up question is on the implementation of COM along with change in your
ordering algorithm that you implemented in the quarter. Did that have any impact on sales? Did it drag down sales at
all? Did it have any impact on in-stock?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It's really hard to know. We really don't know and the reason that we don't is there are so
many items, candidly, in the store that could be substituted. So if we caused ourselves hurt in one item, it's very
possible that a customer picked up another item. So it's pretty difficult to tell.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Understood. Good luck with the second half year.

We'll go next to Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter, guys.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: I just wanted to follow up one of the last questions. So you exited the quarter with a pretty
healthy trend. It sounds like the tone is positive on the demand outlook. Is there anything we should be thinking about
in terms of the cadence of comp growth in the back half of the year Q3 versus Q4?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. The way that we've built our plan and our forecast is that the comps for Q3 and Q4 will be
more or less the same; shouldn't see a lot of variability there. Now, where you will see variability is on the expense
growth factor. The expense growth factor will be higher in the third quarter than it is in the fourth quarter, principally
because of year-over-year comparisons. For the full year, the expense growth factor should be about 32% of our sales
growth.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just to dig in a little bit further. Have you seen any major
change in trends or the demand outlook exiting the quarter, like early in the third quarter here?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No, we're very pleased with our August results. Parts of the country obviously are flooded. We
have a store closed in Louisiana and we – our heart goes out to the people who are impacted by that. But if you ignore
that kind of activity, we're very pleased.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. Got it. And then one of the things that you guys talked about is the growth in units per
transaction. I'm just wondering is there a change in trend there? And if so, do you think that's a result of some of the
initiatives or is the composition of the projects that are getting done right now may be a little bit different? Like, how
do you think about that trend?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: I think that the units per transaction, this is about the third quarter now that when you think
of all the positive comps we've had over the past several years, the units per transaction really didn't move that much.

But the last few quarters, we've seen a healthy growth in units per transaction and it's really units in the larger ticket
items. And when you start to get into larger ticket items, you're looking at 40, 50, 60, even 70 items in a basket. So this
is clearly a project. While appliance sale, for example, would help the average ticket, you're only looking at one or two
items, the appliance and maybe some connecting hoses. But our project business remains very healthy and the growth
of that unit per transaction and units and things like lumber and building materials, are very healthy for the business. So
it speaks to Pro and it speaks to project.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. That's great color. Thanks very much.
Operator
We'll go next to Peter Benedict, Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Yeah, hey, guys. Just following up on that. Is there any historical perspective you guys can
provide us with around this units per transaction trend that you're seeing? How does the current metrics compare to any
periods in the past? And when you started to see an uptick historically, how long does that go on for? Is there any
perspective around that you could help us with? Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The granularity in items per basket, our history is not so good. Our record-keeping is not so
extensive. So we can't really go back to prior periods. But what we can currently – and this is I think a really
good-news story in terms of the health of the Pro, is that while – high-spend Pros drove the outperformance, the gap
between high-spend Pros and low-spend Pros is narrowing. And as that gap narrows, as we would expect, that's a sign
of health in the Pro space. So we would expect this trend in items per basket to continue.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Carol, thanks. That's helpful. And then just my one follow-up would be just curious if
you guys are seeing anything around mix shifts within categories, building products in particular. Any evidence of any
trade-up going on or anything like that? Thank you.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Well, we've continued to see trade-up. We've talked about this the last several calls, where
we're looking at all our price points. And again, we had another quarter where our comp progression moves as we go
up the line structure from good, better, best. And specific to Pro pricing, I'd say the only callout would be lumber prices
are on the move and you're starting to get some trade-off between plywood and OSB just as those prices get back
elevated, the more premium product in plywood, there isn't as much of a gap in that product class.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Clearly, innovation is a driver to the customers stepping up in the line structure. When you
provide new innovative products, people step in.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks very much.

We'll go next to Dan Binder, Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Thank you. I just want to go back to the comment you made earlier about the
replenishment error. I was just curious if it was significant enough that it created any in-stock or in-stock issues or lost
sales impact?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We definitely saw an impact in our in-stock position for about six weeks during the quarter,
but clearly have recovered from that at this point.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And let's put that in perspective for you. We strive to have in-stocks of 99% or greater. As
Craig pointed, we were six weeks under that goal, but the largest gap was 13 basis points. So it wasn't a major
disruption, but because of our standards to be 99% or better, we felt...

<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, we missed our own expectations.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. Great. And then you mentioned earlier that there were certain promotions you
didn't repeat causing the private-label penetration on credit to come down a bit. I was just curious on that, if you could
talk a little bit about your promotional posture, how you're thinking about promotions relative to the market both from
big box, online. Anything you can share with us on that front, that'd be great.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: I would say that we have really redoubled our efforts to focus on everyday value for the
customer. So we are increasingly focused on providing the best product with the best brands with the best prices every
day for all of our customers regardless how they pay.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. Last one for you, if you could. Last year, there was a willingness to take on
some more debt for share buyback. Thus far, you've stuck to the $5 billion share buyback. Is there a scenario where you
could see the leverage increase a bit? I think you're still under that two times adjusted debt to EBITDAR at this point.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We are. We are around 1.8 times, which gives us about $3 billion of borrowing capacity
relative to our targets. It's not our intent to let that borrowing capacity continue to grow. And as we have in the past,
we've opportunistically taken advantage of interest rates and availability to raise incremental debt and increase our
share repurchases. But you should think about our past practice as something that we should continue in the future. But
we like to guide based on what we know today. And what we know today is excess cash to buy back shares. And if we
elect to issue some incremental debt and buy back some additional shares, we'll let you know.

Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Morning.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Congrats on a nice quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: My first question, I apologize, may be somewhat repetitive to some of the prior questions, but just
to be clear, and I think someone else mentioned, there's been a lot of noise out there in retail sales lately from what
other companies talk about. And clearly, we talked here about weather. But as you look at the data maybe even more
granularly than we'd have discussed today, is there anything – are you seeing anything to suggest or anything to hint at
a more cautious consumer environment, particularly in a bigger ticket type product?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: No, I think, as we've said, we're fortunate that we are in a space where the customer is
willing to spend. That's clearly driven by the dynamics that exist in the housing market overall. And as Ted called out,
we had a strong performance in tickets above $900, growing 8.1% in the quarter and driven not only by big ticket
categories like HVAC and appliances but by the units per basket around the project business. So, it's very encouraging
what we're seeing in that.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay. And then maybe – thanks for that. And then a follow-up, Carol, on the expense leverage
side. For a while now, it seems that Home Depot continues to beat expectations with regard to expense leverage. You
mentioned that again today with now the higher EPS guidance for the year. So maybe more color on exactly where this
latest bit of beat is coming from. And as you look out, is there anything to suggest that at some point, Home Depot
could really have a more difficult time leveraging expenses? Or are there continued opportunities?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we view productivity as a virtuous cycle in our business. And we are constantly looking
at ways to drive productivity while ensuring that the customer experience is the best it possibly can be. Most recently,

our HR team did a great job of renegotiating some contracts in support of our medical benefit programs for our
associates and that reduction has caused actually a cost out. And with that cost out, our people costs aren't going to be
as high this year as we anticipated. That benefit will flow through into 2017, which is a good news story. And there are
other examples of that. I won't bore you with all those examples but there are other examples of where our team

<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I know you guys are focused on everyday value. I know
you already commented on that, but there was some noise in the quarter regarding maybe heightened promotional
cadence from some of the competitors in your space. Is there anything to note from your vantage point regarding
changes in the promotional environment?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, from time to time we see increases in promotional activity. We saw it certainly
during the quarter, but we're focused on driving everyday value for our customers.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. So nothing of note. And then, Carol, I know one of the things you've talked about
increasingly over the last couple quarters is the aging housing stock in the U.S. I'm curious if you'd start to come to any
conclusions regarding how big of a driver or impact that could be on your business over time. Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we're doing more research in this regard because we've never been in this place in our
country. So we don't have any history to rely on. So we've got more research to do. It actually makes us comfortable
about our growth forecasts as we go into 2017 because when things start to break, you got to fix it. And so we think it's
a tailwind, but Scot, I can't quantify it yet. Maybe we'll get that research done by the end of next quarter, we can give
you some more thoughts.

<A - Mark Holifield>: Yeah, we're pleased. As we've mentioned, it is a work-in-progress. We continue to see
opportunity to improve our in-stock, our inventory productivity, our logistics costs. Sync is the biggest initiative we
have going in that. Sync is currently in two-thirds of our RDCs, 12 our 18 RDCs, and we're handling about 60% of the
cost of goods sold, the dollar volume that goes through there on the Sync initiative. From that, we're seeing mainly
improved transportation costs and smoother demand flow and we're working with our suppliers to continue to improve
those benefits for all in the supply chain. So we'll continue along that path until – but we're not in a hurry. It's still early
days and it's a multi-year initiative that we're pursuing there.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: To put it in perspective, between 2011 and 2015, on a cumulative basis, our supply chain has
driven 68 basis points of gross margin expansion. So it's been very productive for us. We called out the productivity
that we experienced in the second quarter and year to date, we've had about 12 basis points or 13 basis points of
productivity. So we continue to anticipate benefits coming on the gross margin line through the productivity in our
supply chain. And also there will be longer-term inventory turn benefits. We never want to go out of stock, but there
will be longer-term inventory turn opportunities.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And that really comes from shortening lead times.

We'll go next to Greg Melich, Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I'd love to dig a little deeper into the digital online business. I think up 19%, still
quite strong but it is decelerating. Is that just law of large numbers? Was there something given all the initiatives you
have, whether it be Sync or supply chain changes or getting ready for BODFS that's impacted that?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yeah, we don't look at it as a deceleration. On a nominal dollar basis, we've now grown
over $200 million for...
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: 14 quarters.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: 14 quarters. One change was the patio line structure I spoke about. We put more value
product into the store that really sold incredibly well, and that took about two points, three points of comp off our
online number. So we've been running at that 20%-ish, 20%-plus for several quarters now, growing the business $200
million a quarter.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay. Got you. And if you – and just to make sure I got the numbers right, I think you mentioned
42% of online now is done through the stores. And want to make sure I got that right. And two, as you go to this
Deliver From Store, how do you think about that in terms of how it could change the online business?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yes, that's right. So 42% of online orders are picked up in the store and 90% of returns are
processed in the store. And then one of the big benefits following the rollout of COM is we are now following with,
what we call, BODFS, which is Buy Online, Deliver From Store. We've always delivered from our stores. The
difference now is you can execute the transaction online and pick a much shorter delivery window for your delivery.
We're in about 700-plus stores now with Buy Online, Deliver From Store; very early days. We'll be finished with that
rollout by the end of this year and we're seeing really nice pickup from our customers in reuse, particularly our Pros,
who have used Buy Online, Deliver From Store are coming back and using it a second time and third time. So we think
that fulfillment number, which is the 42%, will grow when we include BODFS deliveries in that number. It's just – it's
very early right now.
<Q - Greg Melich>: That's great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.

That will come from Laura Champine with Roe Equity Research.
<Q - Laura Champine>: Good morning. I wanted to dig a little deeper into what's going on with the Pro. Do you think
that you are benefiting from the growth of the market or are you actually taking market share with Pros? And then
assuming you're taking share with Pros, do you see more strength with smaller Pros, larger Pros? What categories are
you dominating that's driving that share gain?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, I definitely think that the market in total, at least when you talk to Pros, they're busier
than they were a year ago. So the market growth is certainly there. And when we look at the strength in our Pro
categories, we believe based on all the data that we have that we're taking share in those categories as well.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: If you think about it, Laura, based on the census data, which is the [indiscernible] (56:14), we
grew share year-on-year. And since Pro outpaced DIY growth, that had to be share coming from – in the Pro space. So
clearly the market is growing, but we're taking share at the same time.
<Q - Laura Champine>: Got it. And any comments on the strength of the smaller Pro versus the larger Pro?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, what we've seen is a narrowing between the large-spend Pro and
the high-spend Pro in terms of the rate of growth. And that is a very healthy sign.
