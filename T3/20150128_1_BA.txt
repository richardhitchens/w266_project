As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today's press release, and you can follow this broadcast
and slide presentation through our website at Boeing.com.
Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely
to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement
disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for
disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin today with a brief review of some recent strategic
achievements followed by comments on our strong 2014 operating performance then an overview of the business
environment. After that Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail.
Now, let's move to slide two please. Boeing is entering 2015 stronger, healthier and better positioned in its markets
than any time in recent memory. Our strategic accomplishments over the past 24 months alone provide a compelling
picture of the progress we've made to enable sustained growth and improving profitability as we near the start of our
second century in business.
During that timeframe we captured more than 2,700 net new commercial airplane orders, grew our market share and
deliveries with six successful production rate increases including reaching our target ten per month on the 787 with
more than three per month flowing steadily from our capacity expansion in South Carolina.
We completed a comprehensive refresh of our commercial airplane product line with the highly successful launches of
the twin-aisle 787-10 and the 777X on a combined 400 orders and commitments and the launch of the single-aisle 737
MAX 200 with a 100 airplane order from Ryanair.
Starting with the hard-fought technology gains of 787 we have built a substantial technological lead in commercial
aviation, particularly in the high value twin-aisle market. And by listening to our customers and applying our proven
technologies and lessons learned, in summary, we had derisked a decade of new product development while expanding
our edge in the performance and efficiency of our airplanes.
Turning to Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Despite a tough domestic budget environment, BDS continued to
strengthen its relative market position and competitiveness. We have accomplished this by driving significant new
efficiencies in response to the environment in order to meet government customer needs and fund investments in
technology and innovation including in space programs where we have restored our technological lead and market
position in satellites, autonomous spacecraft, missile-defense and human space flight.
To the benefit of both businesses we also secured unprecedented production continuity and improved economics with
long-term labor agreements at our major production sites in Puget Sound, St. Louis and Philadelphia and we retired
significant and outstanding legal and financial risks from billions in potential liability on matters such as the A-12
program to the short-term threat to our balance sheet from defined benefit pensions. As you know, by the end of next
year approximately 90% of our workforce will participate in defined contribution plans which provide attractive and
competitive benefits to employees without the risks to our balance sheet.
Going forward, we remain ever focused on driving productivity and executing on our growth initiatives, which are
fundamental to our success. To meet customer demand for our market-leading commercial airplanes, we have five
more rate increases ahead of us over the remainder of the decade. These higher production volumes will provide
additional opportunities for driving step function gains in productivity for us and our suppliers through Lean Plus
capturing the value of quality at our Partnering for Success efforts.
We are equally committed to breaking the cost curve on our new development programs and delivering them on time
with performance as advertised. To that end, we have focused our engineering teams on designs that are more

producible, common systems and parts across airplane families and our disciplined gated development process. We've
also increased our investment in manufacturing and production innovations, including automation, to increase quality
and safety in the work place and reduce flow times.
Overall for 2015 and throughout the remainder of the decade, these recent achievements in the marketplace, in our
operations and in our financial performance set the stage for expected significant cash generation, the flexibility to
invest for growth in support of our customers, and the increasing return of cash to shareholders.
With that as perspective, let's discuss our 2014 results on slide three, please. Strong fourth quarter results driven by
higher commercial deliveries and solid operating performance capped an outstanding year. We continued to deliver on
our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the
company.
For the full-year, we reported record revenue and core earnings per share, solid operating margins and strong cash flow,
much of which was returned to shareholders. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $60 billion for
the year on higher production rates and an industry-record 723 deliveries, which expanded our global market share
leadership in deliveries for the third consecutive year.
2014 was also an exceptional year for new bookings as we captured commercial gross orders of 1,550 airplanes and
record net orders of 1,432 airplanes, which increased our backlog to nearly 5,800 airplanes. When combined with
strong orders from our Defense business, total company backlog grew to a record $502 billion.
Other Commercial Airplane's key milestones in 2014 included successfully reaching the 42 per month production rate
on the 737 and announcing plans to increase to 52 in 2018. Model certification and delivery of the first ten 787-9s,
completing preliminary design review on the 787-10 and breaking ground on the new 777X composite centers in Puget
Sound and St. Louis.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security also had a very strong year with solid revenue, healthy margins and significant new
business wins and program milestones. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter included an order for
two 702 high-powered satellites, multiple long-term international service contracts including a 25-year order from the
Australian government to train rotary wing aircrews valued at approximately $500 million and finalization of the
NASA Commercial Crew award announced in the third quarter.
Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included the first flight of the 767-2C test aircraft or the KC-46 tanker
program, the selection of the V-22 by Japan to fulfill their tilt rotor aircraft requirements and U.S. government funding
for EA-18G Growler production.
Finally, our strong operational performance trend, significant cash flow and confidence in the future all supported by
our December announcement of the new share repurchase authorization totaling $12 billion and a 25% increase in the
quarterly dividend.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide four. Our view of the business environment remains positive,
given favorable global air traffic trends, improving airline profitability and the continuing need for efficient and value
creating products we provide. Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that
supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade.
Net new orders for 2014 that I mentioned earlier were essentially twice our 2014 output and our record backlog of
5,800 airplanes represents approximately eight years of production at current rates. Replacement demand remains an
important market driver with airlines continuing to introduce new or more efficient airplanes with superior economics
and a rapid return on investment in place of older, less efficient models in service. Notwithstanding a fuel price
environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling
one.
Historically, we have seen aircraft orders more correlated to airline profits and as many of you may recall, we closed
the business case for and launched the 787 when oil was at $40 a barrel. Furthermore, based on discussions with our
customers, lower oil prices have not substantially changed their views on fleet planning or their commitment to existing

delivery schedules.
Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, but
also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience
and greater range allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value
to our customers over the life of the aircraft.
Overall, we see low fuel prices and positive traffic trends as beneficial to our industry and growth prospects. Our
long-term outlook also remains strong as we expect the combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for
nearly 37,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. In the twin-aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the
777 and the 777X, which are outselling the competition by a wide margin giving us confidence in our ability to
efficiently transition production between the two airplanes.
In 2014 we captured 63 new orders for current 777 models giving us 217 firm orders in backlog. We expect demand for
the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60
airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X. With the new airplanes – for the new airplanes scheduled to
enter final assembly in the 2018 timeframe, this transition will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies
being proven on the current 777 to optimize the 777X production system.
On the 787 program, which delivered a twin-aisle industry record 114 airplanes in 2014, we remain focused on
continued production efficiencies and support future planned rate increases to match a strong market demand for the
airplane. Since the first customer flight, 787 fleet has now safely flown approximately 30 million passengers, more than
400 million miles while saving one billion pounds of fuel, providing game changing efficiencies and capabilities to 29
customers worldwide. In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX also remains high with
cumulative orders totaling more than 2,660 airplanes from 57 customers. Development of the MAX remains on track
for the first delivery in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, we continue to see solid support among U.S. customers and Congress for our
major programs. In addition to the Growler funding I mentioned earlier, the FY 2015 budget signed into law in
December fully funds other core Boeing production programs such as the Apache helicopter and the P-8A Poseidon.
Key development programs like tanker and long-range strike also were fully funded and additional funds were added
for the Space Launch System.
We continue to see strong international demand for our offerings as well, particularly in the Middle East and the
Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, international customers for the Defense, Space & Security represented 28% of revenue,
and 36% of our current backlog. While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international Defense backlog also
comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio, and the geographic mix of its customer base.
Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives,
space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, and the critical few large-scale future programs
that are priorities for our customers like Long-Range Strike, UClass and the T-X Trainer. The relative strength of our
Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable; supported by our
ongoing market-based affordability initiative which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $2 billion to
ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.
In summary, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets and our teams are
executing them well to deliver top line and bottom line performance, and capture new business to sustain our growth
and profitability for the decades to come.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?

Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to slide five to discuss our full-year results. Revenue for the year was a
record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year driven by higher deliveries in our commercial airplane business.
Core earnings per share totaled $8.60 for the year representing a 22% increase, the increase in core EPS was driven by
strong operational performance across the company. Adjusting for the tax items in the A-12 litigation settlement 2013,
core earnings per share increased 14%. Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $8.9 billion, the robust
cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and
expenditures and capturing the early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives.
Let's now move to our quarterly results on slide six. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $24.5 billion driven by
strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margins increased to 9.6% reflecting solid productivity gains in
both businesses. Fourth quarter core earnings per share increased 23% to $2.31 on higher volume and continued strong
operating performance. Fourth quarter 2013 included, again, $0.34 for the A-12 litigation settlement.
Let's now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide seven. For the fourth quarter our Commercial Airplanes business
increased revenue 15% to $16.8 billion on a record 195 airplane deliveries and solid operating margins of 9.3%. The
margin benefit from the higher volume and mature programs was offset by the impact of higher 787 deliveries and the
anticipated increase in period costs primarily for investments to support future growth and productivity.
Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $60 billion, an increase of 13% as we successfully executed
on our planned production rate increases resulting again in record deliveries totaling 723 aircraft. Commercial
Airplanes captured $27 billion in net orders during the quarter and backlog grew to a new record of $440 billion and
nearly 5,800 aircraft.
Specifically on the 787, we exceeded our delivery guidance for the full year as the team worked hard to deliver 114
787s and in total we've now delivered 228 787s to 29 customers, 14 of which were new customers in 2014. We
continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we further implement production efficiencies and
stabilize the overall 787 production system.
On the 787-8 we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 175 deliveries and on 787-9, we've
seen declines of 20% since first delivery. Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity
investments, we continue to expect the 787 to be cash positive during 2015 and we still anticipate deferred production
to decline shortly after we've achieved the 12 per month production rate in 2016, no change to these fundamental
milestones.
In the fourth quarter, the 787 deferred production increased $960 million to $26.1 billion and we now anticipate 787
deferred production to grow at moderate levels for the next several quarters as productivity improvements on both
models offset timing of supplier negotiations, further investments to optimize the production system and our decision to
maintain higher employment levels to ensure the continued smooth introduction of the 787-9 and further incorporate
additional productivity and reliability investments.
These focused decisions and efforts are expected to continue to drive long-term efficiencies, margin improvement and
cash generation on the 787 program. Overall, our focus and priorities remain unchanged for the 787 program. Solid
day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward while
continuing to have smooth ramp up on the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month rate introducing the 787-10
while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.
Let's turn now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide eight. Fourth quarter revenue for our Defense business was
$7.6 billion and operating margins increased to 12.1% due to strong business across the portfolio. Revenue for Boeing
Military Aircraft declined to $3 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from lower planned C-17 and F-15 deliveries.
Operating margins increased to 12.3% in the quarter driven by solid operating performance.
Network & Space Systems revenue declined to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower government satellite volume.
Operating margin at NS&S (sic) [N&SS] was 8.8% in the quarter. Global Services & Support reported a 2% increase in
the fourth quarter revenue to $2.4 billion on higher MM&U volume and generated strong operating margins of 14.9%
driven by higher operating performance.

Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $62 billion with 36% of our current backlog now representing
from customers outside the United States.
Let's now turn to slide nine. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5 billion. The strength of our cash flow
was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and, again,
early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives.
With regard to capital deployment, we paid $519 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 7.8 million
shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 2014 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6 billion.
And as Jim mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase
authorization to $12 billion and increased the dividend 25%, up 88% in the last two years. We expect to complete the
repurchase authorization over approximately the next two years to three years.
Our capital deployment to-date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and backlog and our commitment
and confidence in the business performing well going forward, returning cash to shareholders along with continued
investment to support future growth remains priorities for us.
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of cash and marketable
securities and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Again, our
financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of the business, return cash to shareholders and
execute our cash deployment strategies going forward.
Turning now to slide 11, we'll discuss our outlook for 2015. Our guidance for 2015 reflects solid core operating
performance, higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business, while reflecting the near-term investments needed to
support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity.
Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is set to be between $8.20 and $8.40 per share and excluding the 2014 tax
settlements totaling $0.71 per share, 2015 earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% and 6% . Revenue for
2015 is forecast to increase to be between $94.5 and $96.5 billion representing growth of between 4% and 6%. Our
2015 commercial airplane revenue guidance is between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion reflecting 8% to 9% growth as
we execute on our record backlog.
The 2015 commercial delivery forecast is now between 750 and 755 airplanes and 787 deliveries for 2015 are expected
to be essentially in line with the ten-per-month production rate plus a few early-build deliveries. Commercial Airplanes
operating margin guidance is set to be between 9.5% and 10% on improved operating performance offset by greater
dilution impact of higher planned research and development spending, higher 787 deliveries and further investment to
support future growth.
Defense, Space & Security revenue guidance for 2015 is between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion reflecting the
continued challenging defense environment particularly offset – partially offset, excuse me, by the ongoing
international growth. Operating margin guidance of the Defense business is now between 9.75% and 10% reflecting
continued productivity efforts offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.
Supporting our long-term growth plans, we expect research and development spending for 2015 to be approximately
$3.5 billion with about 70% related to 787, particularly driven by the planned increase in 777X and 787-10
development, while at BDS we continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities going forward.
We expect operating cash flow for 2015 to be greater than $9 billion reflecting higher deliveries, strong operating
performance, continued 787 productivity and capturing final C-17 orders. This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax
payments and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures benefited 2014 results.
As we look forward, we expect further growth in operating cash flow in 2016 as we continue to execute on our
backlog, capture additional productivity gains and improve 787 cash performance. Capital spending guidance for 2015
is approximately $2.8 billion driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, Charleston expansion to support the 787
rate increase and other investments to support continued growth and productivity.

Our required pension contributions in 2015 will be minimal, as a result of legislative pension changes we are now
foregoing discretionary pension funding in 2015.
As we look into the next quarter, we expect first quarter revenue, core EPS and cash flow to be the lowest during the
year based on timing of deliveries, phasing the expenditures and advances. First quarter EPS is estimated to be
approximately 20% of our full earnings.
So in summary, Boeing's 2014 financial performance and the 2015 financial guidance reflects the strong demand for
our products and services, the strength of our backlog and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the
entire enterprise.
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Greg. 2014 was another year of strong operating performance and significant cash generation as we
successfully executed on our record backlog that allowed us to return cash to our shareholders while still prudently
investing to sustain our growth and competitive advantage.
Built upon an underlying foundation, 2014 was a very strong year for Boeing as we continued to deliver on the
significant and sustained growth and increasing profitability and cash flow that our strategies were designed to produce.
Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees, our partners and customers around the world, we achieved critical
strategic milestones in both businesses, continued focus and execution on production and development programs that
are important to our customers, and maintained our relentless focus on productivity to enable continued investment in
our future, all of which sets the stage for further growth and sustained business performance for customers and
shareholders in the years ahead.
Now we'd be delighted to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just some quick clarifications about your comments on deferred production, Greg, and a
question. Did that change result in any negative margin impact on the program? And how far rightward did it shift the
cash breakeven point you had talked about in the past?
And then just from a high-level, does it change? Does the difference in the profile of deferred production here represent
a change in how you're managing the program or thinking about the long-term risk profile or return profile on the
program? Is it reactive in any way? Just from a high level, is there something more we should read into that and how
you're approaching risk and return there?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, no. I think there's – you shouldn't look at it any differently, Carter. I think when you
step back and you look at how this program has performed, it's performed very well. 114 deliveries last year and
obviously we reached the record production rate higher than any wide-body in aviation history and we're planning to go
up. The fundamental milestones that you talked about, whether with regards to cash positive, we still expect that in

2015, and we still expect deferred to decline shortly after we hit that 12 a month that we're planning for in 2016. So
those things have not changed.
We obviously – we as I discussed, we see the next two to three quarters similar growth in what we've seen and then
later in 2015 to decline at a healthier rate. But all of that is anticipated in the guidance we gave on cash flow and at the
end of the day that's what matters. You've seen our results in 2014, you see our guidance for 2015 on cash, all that is
again taken into consideration.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: And the program margin?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Program margin was just down slightly in the quarter, but not significant.

more than $9 billion in operating cash in 2015. And then I was surprised to see deferred continuing to rise. Could you
walk through, really two things here, the puts and takes of getting of your cash, operating cash flow in 2014 to 2015?
And then when you look at how much you've got on the balance sheet, you've got now cash and STI of over $13
billion, and you're going to generate more than $6 billion in free cash flow. How do you expect to deploy that? You
should have declining risk here. This is a lot of cash and it seems like it's a lot more than you would really need to
manage the company on the balance sheet today.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, as you know, Doug, one of the strategies we had in place was to de-risk the decade
and we've certainly done that, the risk profile going forward is very different than it was in the past. And so continuing
to execute on delivering on the backlog, focusing on the core operating performance, again improving the 787 cash
profile and, of course, capturing those final C-17 orders, that's the biggest driver from 2014 to 2015. We are going to
have higher cash taxes because we're improving unit cost on 787, and we have again slightly higher R&D, all planned
out, 777X and 10X. So those are kind of the moving pieces from 2014 to 2015.
With regards to deployment, you've seen what we did last year. You see the authorization we have in place. It's in place
to utilize it, and we plan to do that.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Thanks, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: One question related to the 787 and sort of orders related. As I look at it, this year is more of
a year to fill in some holes and demonstrate that the products you have have extended legs. Could you address some of
the opportunities with some specificity on 777? And then also on what you're finding from customer feedback on the
787 and what kind of movement there is to 787-9s?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Let me take a swing at that one, Howard. On the 777, the gut issue there obviously is the
bridge – transition to the bridge because I think the market is focused on the launch of the 777X, a very robust launch.
As to the bridge, there's 63 orders this year that Ray and his team secured. It bodes well for the 40 to 60 we need over
the next few years to get to the bridge. So I'm feeling increasingly comfortable there. Long-term demand for the
airplane, there is no competition for the airplane, so I feel very good about the long-term demand for the airplane.
I think on the 787, I think what you're going to see is a mix from 787-8s to 787-9s to 787-10s, and there will be some
moving around to the skyline as that's accommodated. That's all goodness for The Boeing Company in the sense that
we are usually selling more capability for a higher price. And that dynamic I don't see changing.
I think we're still – we're a little bit hampered by the number of orders we have. We're out to 20, 21-ish. I would
anticipate toward the end of this year and into next year a rekindling of orders on the 787 as we get a little closer to the
end of the decade. People begin to pick up options, the moving around of the skyline will have subsided a little bit, and
the airplane's performance, quite frankly I cited it in my remarks, the airplane's performance, to be candid, is better, I
think, by and large than we sold it at.
And we're very pleased with the operating cost, the fuel savings, obviously. And the thing that is often left unnoticed
here is that this grows the market. This airplane enables wide-body or any kind of body, quite frankly, city pairs that
have never been enabled before. And so I'm sort of making up the number, but it's 20% of the demand for this thing is
opening up capacity between city pairs that was not available before because of the performance of the airplane. So it's
a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but that's my dump on the subject.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Thanks, Howard.

And we'll go to Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Joe.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Greg, I had a couple for you on just deferred. I was wondering if you could, as you've done in
the last couple quarters, quantify if there was any pull forward from building 787-9 inventory, if you could give us a
sense sequentially if 787-8 and 787-9 unit costs declined, and if this was just mix related that you didn't see any
deferred reduction sequentially?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. There was no pull forward in the quarter, Joe. There was more 787-9. There was
about 30% more 787-9 mix in third quarter versus fourth quarter, so that obviously had an impact. And then we had
more reliability enhancements in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. And, again, that's something that we're
really trying to be proactive and get those embedded into the production system so they're there when we deliver the
airplane. But those are really the big moving pieces between 3Q and 4Q.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So the unit costs on both models did decline sequentially? Or they were flat?

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: They did. They did come down in the quarter.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And then just one final clarification, when you say you expect the program to be cash
flow positive in 2015, that's deferred building, but you deliver a few of the early production aircraft and you're also
including advances in advance of that production rate increase to help to get you to cash flow positive. Is that right?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. That's right, Joe. No change.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you.

And we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much. So you're talking about the deferred going up another, sounds like $2.5
billion over the next three quarters. That's a pretty big change. Could you give us a little bit more granularity in terms
of how much of that is inventory pull-forward, how much of that is buffer stock, and how much of that is other items?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I guess, Cai, I'd put it into three categories. First of all, let me just backup. The things
we're doing on this program every day are all about driving cash and profitability over the long-term. So there's going
to be decisions we make quarter-over-quarter or frankly between last year and this year that are enhancements to the
production system over the long-term that are proven, we've done them on other programs, and now it's about
implementing them on 787. So there's some of that in there that's really, again, focused on investments over the
long-term of the program.
On – as far as labor, we are coming down on unit costs, but we're coming down at a lower rate than what we expected
or anticipated and again we're doing that at these higher labor levels to really achieve the stability, incorporate those
reliability enhancements I talked about and then these productivity initiatives, again, they're going to take folks to work
through each one of those at every sequence of the build and we're working that and we're working that at an enterprise
level. We're leveraging across Boeing. So we know where the bottlenecks are, or some of the challenges are, so now it's
about reaching – when we reach the ten-a-month, capturing that and improving upon that.
On the supply chain side, we've talked about the timing of some of our discussions and negotiations, and some of those
have moved out to the right. And I think I've mentioned before that we've seen a benefit in doing that. These guys are
still coming down the learning curve. We are helping them encapsulate productivity enhancements that we're seeing or
able to achieve in Charleston and Everett. We want to get that back into the supply chain and then from there we'll
mature our negotiations. So, again, a near-term sacrifice, but much long-term benefit frankly, for us and our supplier.
But those are really the three main categories that we're faced with over the next kind of year and to the end of 2015.
But very focused, again, on the long-term, and very focused on improving cash in the program and none of those
fundamentals have changed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Can you quantify any of those three items?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No, I can't, Cai. I mean, those are the main three categories, those are the ones we're
working on. There's no, I'd say significant split between the three of them.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I just wanted to see if you could help me out on two things. One is on the C-17, can you talk
about how many were on the balance sheet at the end of the year of 2014 and how many you're assuming will be there
at the end of 2015. And then just looking at the share count assumption you have embedded in your guidance, that
would seem to imply a pretty sizable buyback in order to get 40 million shares down on average over the course of the
year. Can you try and size at all your thinking around that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, one C-17 we've got seven that remain unsold, Sam. We delivered seven last year and
we'll deliver four in 2015 and four in 2016 and then probably about two in 2017. So we're in active discussions with
customers for the balance of those aircrafts remaining and we're highly confident that we'll sell those and be able to
deliver them over that timeframe. On the share count, like I said earlier, you saw what we did in 2014, we upped the
reauthorization, so we're focused on that and we'll continue to execute and utilize that authorization.

<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Hey, Greg, if I kind of look at the last three years, you've been running, if you
correct for the 787 after-tax, $14 a share, pretty consistently over that period of time or about $10 billion. As you level
off on the 787, any reason we shouldn't think about that as a starting point of discussion?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I'm sorry, Myles. I wasn't tracking exactly what you're focused on.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: If over the last three years you correct for all the 787 inventory build, you've been
doing a consistent level of $10 billion or about $14 a share in free cash flow.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Any reason that shouldn't be the starting point of discussion once you do level out on
the 787 inventory?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No. I think that's fair.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: That's fair. I mean, obviously you've seen it. It's a significant focus area for us, and all
elements around working capital and we're going to continue that effort going forward.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Just one clarification. Were there any adjustments on the accounting blocks in the

And next we'll go to Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Greg, I was wondering if we could just talk a little bit about the trajectory of CapEx and
R&D. As we move out into 2016, 2017, maybe even into 2018, just kind of relative to where we're going to be in 2015,
is it going up, down, sideways on those items?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: CapEx this year obviously is just tied to the growth, right, it's on the successful launch of
this 777X, the 787-10 and then of course 787 rate combined with 737. So those are the real I'll say fundamental drivers
of the growth in CapEx. This year it'll be increased because of preparing for the entry into service of those aircraft and
we'll probably have a similar year next year and then it'll start to decline from there. And again, all tied to growth, all
tied to the successful launches of those programs, combined with productivity, we've got additional productivity
initiatives in here including the automation that Jim talked about.
And so that's kind of the profile on CapEx. For R&D, again, 777X and 10X as 787-9 certainly winds down, and 737,
I'll say MAX continues at a similar spend rate. If you look at the entry into service on 777X, you're going to see a
profile from here but, again, you're going to see 10X declining. So we're continuing to manage it and look at further
ways to optimize the R&D spend as Jim has talked about a lot. But for this year, we're seeing it at about $3.5 billion,
and I'd say managing it very efficiently and taking advantage of a lot of the things again that Jim highlighted in doing it
in a more efficient and effective manner.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: And just one quick follow up on the 777. Can you talk a little bit about what the impact is
going to be on your ability to deliver aircraft late in the decade as you feather-in the 777X? Will that be coming in at a
slower flow time and will your ability to deliver come under some pressure as we move out late into the decade?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I don't think our ability to deliver will come under pressure, but you'll have very
similar to what you've seen on the 787. You'll have some additional flow time associated with those early introductory
units, and that will get feathered into the current 777s as we deliver those. So, yeah, I'd say that it's well planned out
phasing in strategy that was really leveraged off the success of the 787, and that's the plan going forward.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey. Jim, Greg's getting all the work here. Let me give you one. Jim, does book-to-bill ever
go down again, another strong year, how are you thinking about 2015? And your comment on the 777 bridge, you're
getting increasingly comfortable there. The 63 new, would you characterize that as just replacement for the 777-200s or
could you give a little more color there. Thanks.
<A - W. James McNerney>: No. I mean, I think the – I mean, two examples would be ANA and Qatar where there
was a blended order of both the new airplane, the X as well as one of the current models. I think in both cases the 300
ERs, I may be forgetting exactly the model type in one of those cases. But I think it is a sign that the capability is an
enduring capability, and the competition is, you hate to say it this way, but there is not much competition for this
capability. So versus any alternative, both the old and the new makes sense and it's more a matter of satisfying demand
and running a competitive airline that drives them to buy both types. And so we're in a fortunate position here and it's
one that we will shamelessly take advantage of.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: And on book-to-bill for 2015?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Book-to-bill. It's early in the year, I think it will at least be one-to-one would be – is the
way it looks now, and we'll see as the year goes forward.

Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: You've obviously done a fantastic job getting airplanes out the door. Just wanted to follow up on
profitability, however, one would think, unless I'm thinking about it wrong, that given the volume of airplanes that the
company has delivered, that profitability in the quarter would have been better at Boeing Commercial. Defense seemed
to do wonderful, and then as we go into next year, with that volume of airplanes going out the door and given overhead
absorption, that again margins would be higher than what you guys are projecting them to be.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. In the quarter, Ron, 737 and 777 unchanged from quarter-over-quarter so no change
in margins there. And as I mentioned we did have a block extension on the 737 – this is really associated with period
costs. As you know we're seasonably high in fourth quarter around taxes and fleet support and just the amount of
deliveries we have and then some investments we've made across the business whether it's 787 reliability, or in some of
the fleet management efforts. So I'd say high in the quarter, but not something that I would take forward from here.
<Q - Ron Epstein>: Okay. One then follow on if I may. In the Defense business we haven't talked a heck of a lot about
that, were there any contact closeouts, one-time types of things in the quarter that boosted margins there?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Nothing significant.

And that'll be from Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Greg, just on the improvement in cost on the 787, I think you said that you took costs
down about 30% over the last 170-odd airplanes ,something like that.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, 175.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Right. So now I'm guessing with the unit deferred as it stands a little over $30 million,
and I know there's some puts and takes and some things in that number that probably aren't aircraft specific, but I'm
guessing airplanes are costing you these days somewhere around $130 million. To get down to a breakeven level, I
would imagine you need about another 20% cost reduction from here, give or take back of the envelope. Can that be
done inside of a year with the volume of airplanes we're talking about?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, we continue to have plans to reduce the unit costs on the program, Ron, whether it's
through our own internal efforts or working with the supply chain. So those initiatives are all laid out, and now we've
got to go execute those, and we have plans in place to do them. Again, this is stuff we know how to do. We've done it
on other programs, and we're putting obviously additional focus on that and this again remains a priority for us. So, at
the same time we're continuing to invest in productivity, as I talked about. As we get more mature with the production
system, we see more opportunities to do things better and more efficiently, but they take an investment, it's a short-term
investment – or a short-term challenge, but long-term significant gains for the program and that's really where we've
got everybody focused.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. And then just a clarification from earlier, the guidance embeds the buyback that
you've talked about?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, it embeds some form of buyback, yeah.

<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Just a bit of clarity on the math that you guys have presented on the 787 deferred production.
Obviously, you're passing $26 billion on deferred costs with 1,100 airplanes to go in your accounting block. You say
you're booking a positive margin on each 787, just really flat out, I mean, to zero out those deferred costs just really
simple back of the envelope, you need to be generating $25 million in profit per plane starting today. And obviously
there's a curve in there, and you guys haven't hit the unit break even yet. So the $25 million figure is even higher than
that. So at what point are the assumptions that you're putting into your accounting estimates that are generating your
record earnings, ultimately do they reflect the reality of the 787's program cost reductions while ultimately keeping the
program stable?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, Jon, I guess I would start with as I said, the fundamental milestones around the 787
being cash positive and the deferred declining after we reach 12 a month in 2016 haven't changed. And the focus on the
program hasn't changed. It's all around, again, being more efficient on each unit and capturing additional unit cost.
There's initiatives within the supply chain. Obviously, there's initiatives within our factory, and we're working to
capture those and continue the journey on the successful productivity we've had in the program to-date. That's what
everybody is focused on, ultimately leading to again cash positive in 2015.

<A - W. James McNerney>: Thank you.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: I just wanted to follow up on something that we saw late in 2014. Zodiac had some issues with
seat deliveries and certification, and I know it affected some 787 deliveries. And they had cautioned that it's taking
longer than they had anticipated to straighten some of those issues out. Just wondering if you see any trickle over into
Q1, and if this is a potential warning sign or red flag as you prepare to ramp up 737 and 787 production.
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think there is no question that seat supply did impact some deliveries and some fall in
our production system. We're working through it now. We see it being resolved this year. We regret any impact it has
had on our customers, but it's all been within our plans and within our guidance as we work through it. I think the
supply base is adjusting to these higher volumes, both 787 and anticipated higher volumes in other programs, and I

timing for the future of the St. Louis line? And does it depend at all on what happens with the long-range strike contest,
which is upcoming?

<A - W. James McNerney>: I think the status is we're too close to the end of the decade on F-15s, which is a big piece
of St. Louis. We've regained momentum on F-18s. I think in the minds of many, there remains a need beyond that
order. So there is a good chance that that line could continue at least to the end of the decade, although we do not yet
have firm orders, that's an assessment. And there is no question that when we win a long-range strike, and I'm sounding
as confident as I can because I do believe we will, that it will solidify the future of St. Louis for many, many years to
come.

Our next question is from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Hello, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Dominic.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: A question for Greg. You mentioned delivering some early 787s this year, early build 787s.
There are something like 11 airplanes, mostly the terrible teens, as they're called, that have been sitting there for four
years and more. And about a year ago, a couple of customers that those were earmarked for a pulled out. Transaero was
one of them. So two questions about – or two parts to a question about that. First of all, is there any chance those have
to be written off or sold so cheaply that it's almost the same thing and we get some accounting charges for those
planes? And then secondly, it looks like you want to deliver maybe three this year, maybe three next year, a very slow
output, is that a deliberate strategy because of the hefty unit cost every time one of them enters the delivery stream?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Not at all. The timing of the deliveries is really solely tied to when we finish the work on the
aircraft, and frankly, it's a matter of prioritizing the teams of taking them off the production line and moving them over
on the early build. So that is the only thing tied into that. It's really just about finishing up the aircraft for the customers.
With regard to the aircraft themselves, we continue to see a viable market and we're in active discussions with many
customers related to those airplanes. So that is fundamentally how we're handling the EMC airplanes. And you're right,
I mean we're working through them in a prudent fashion, and we do expect to deliver there or four this year.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.
Operator
And that will be from Christopher Drew with The New York Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Good morning. Jim, you mentioned space and I was just wondering if you could talk a
minute about what it's like to compete with SpaceX with their lower cost and aggressive lobbying and political cloud in
Washington in various ways that you, Boeing and the United Launch Alliance compete with them and what you see
happening in the long run in some of these areas?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I have respect for SpaceX, I think they offer more limited mission types than we do at
this stage and – but their combination of focus on gaining capability at improved costs is going to benefit the market. It
will make us a better competitor in some segments where cost has become more important. I suspect that we will retain
the lead in those segments where often manned type missions that go a long way into many places we've never been
before, I see the advantage we have there. We'll sustain itself for a long period of time.
