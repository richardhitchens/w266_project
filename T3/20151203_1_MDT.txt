MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have
been placed in a listen-only mode. The call will be open for a question-and-answer session following the speakers'
prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ryan Weispfenning
Thank you, Maria. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief
Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 second quarter, which ended October
2015. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue by division summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien – Medtronic financial statement
presentation, which is posted to our Investor Relations website. This presentation now contains FY 2015 quarterly
P&Ls stated on a month-aligned basis instead of the prior quarter-aligned basis. Comparisons made today will be
against the month-aligned P&L.
Next, you should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking
statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports
filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.

In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our
website at medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in
comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, and our year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable
constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc
in the prior-year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior-year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These
adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar?
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second
quarter revenue of $7.1 billion, representing growth of 6% at the upper end of our mid-single-digit expectations. Q2
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.03, growing at 11% on a comparable constant currency basis and
reflecting 480 basis points of leverage above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points.
Q2 was a strong quarter. Our operational performance remains consistent and we believe sustainable across all our
functions, groups and regions. At the same time, we're outperforming the overall market and delivering operating
leverage. We're also executing on our value capture programs from the Covidien integration and realizing the targeted
cost synergies. This combination of solid top line growth and leverage is generating significant accessible free cash
flow, which provides us enormous flexibility to deploy through strong returns to our shareholders, paying off debt, and
pursuing targeted acquisitions.
Despite our strong performance, however, we recognize foreign currency translation is a significant pressure to our
bottom line on a reported basis, as it is for most multinationals, but we're attempting to offset this as much as possible
by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs.
As we look ahead, though, our confidence continues to grow around our ability to develop the right mindset, business
models and offerings to lead and compete in the emerging value-based healthcare models around the world. I am
pleased with our organization's willingness and aptitude to explore new and novel ways for Medtronic to not only
deliver better clinical and patient outcomes but to tie our success to these outcomes with providers, payers, and
governments.
Our strong revenue growth is resulting from crisp execution on three growth strategies: therapy innovation,
globalization, and economic value. These strategies are designed to create competitive advantage for Medtronic by
capitalizing on three long-term trends that we see playing out in healthcare, namely: the continued desire to improve
clinical and economic outcomes; the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare; and the optimization of cost
and efficiency within healthcare systems. We have translated each of our strategies into three independent growth
vectors and we continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals.
In therapy innovation, we're seeing very strong adoption of our new products. Our new therapies growth vectors
accounted for nearly three-quarters of our total company growth, contributing approximately 420 basis points. This
remains well above our goal of 150 to 350 basis points. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 8%, we
continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important, rapidly growing
new med tech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, drug-coated balloons, AF ablation, and insertable
diagnostics.
CVG is also seeing new therapies drive growth in the space businesses such as our recently launched Evera MRI ICD,
which is helping to drive both sequential and year-over-year global high-powered market share gains. Over the coming
quarters, we expect to launch a number of additional exciting new products that will continue to differentiate us in the
market and help protect and grow our leadership position.

For example, we continue to make progress on bringing our revolutionary Micra transcatheter pacing system to the
U.S. Last month, we had a very successful late-breaking data presentation at AHA, and a simultaneous New England
Journal of Medicine publication. This data form the basis for our FDA submission, which we filed in Q2.
In addition, CVG continues to invest in key intermediate to long-term technology programs. Building on our success in
transcatheter aortic valves, we are particularly enthusiastic about our recent acquisition of Twelve. This company has a
differentiated transcatheter micro-valve, which has the potential to create a new multi-billion dollar end market. We're
also making progress in enrolling our SPYRAL HTN clinical program for renal denervation, an important therapy that
we are pioneering. Renal denervation has the potential to help fulfill the huge unmet need in treatment-resistant
hypertension.
Overall, I feel that our strategy has positioned us exceptionally well in the global cardiovascular device market. The
team is executing consistently, gaining share, developing new markets, and effectively leveraging its breadth of therapy
innovations to positively affect the lives of thousands of patients around the globe.
In our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which grew 3%, new therapies such as our differentiated Endo GIA
reinforced reload stapling system and LigaSure Maryland jaw laparoscopic sealer and divider are growing – are driving
strong growth. MITG has a full therapy innovation pipeline with a specific focus on four areas: the transition from open
surgery to minimally invasive surgery; respiratory compromise; lung cancer; and gastrointestinal cancer. Across these
growth drivers, we're developing solutions that span the entire continuum of care, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis,
better treatment, faster [ph] recomplication (8:11) for your recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through
less-invasive solutions.
I'm pleased with the current strategic roadmap the MITG team has developed from a very complex mix of products and
capabilities. The strategy supports the outcome space Medtronic mission and will serve as the foundation against which
we are assessing our entire MITG portfolio.
In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 5%, we have a number of new products driving growth. In surgical
technologies, we recently launched our O-arm II surgical imaging system and NuVent sinus balloons. In neurovascular,
our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. In spine, our business outside
the United States performed well and grew above the market. In the U.S., while our performance was below market, we
did see sequential improvement after adjusting for the extra week in Q1. In neuromodulation, while we continue to
make progress against our FDA [indiscernible] (9:12) commitments and are focused in resolving this matter, our
[indiscernible] (9:18) revenue has been somewhat affected by the situation.
We also are facing increased competition in Pain Stim, where our sales were flat compared to last year. Our Restorative
Therapies Group is urgently addressing these specific issues as well as leveraging the breadth and scale of the group
through the commercial implementation of surgical synergies. One example is a program that combines O-arm
placements with increased spine implant commitments. Under our new integrated RTG sales management structure,
we've already finalized several of these contracts in the first half of this fiscal year and have seen notable increases in
our spine implant sales in these accounts. While still early, our expectation is that strategies like this will result in
improved performance.
Our Diabetes group, which grew 11%, also has new products driving growth, including the MiniMed 530G and 640G
systems, as well as MiniMed Connect which provides convenient and discreet access to patient data and remote
monitoring from the user's smartphone. In our non-intensive Diabetes Therapies Division, we recently launched Pattern
Snapshot for iPro Professional CGM, which uses new algorithms to streamline data interpretation for healthcare
professionals. These advancements, along with a full pipeline of new products and solutions, are aimed at creating an
annual cadence of innovation that can extend our leadership position globally.
As a result of the products that are currently launching as well as our robust pipeline and the potential of new markets
across all of our groups, we believe we can sustain our new therapy growth vector at the upper end of the 150 to 350
basis point range.

Now, let's turn to our globalization strategy. In Q2, emerging markets grew 11%, a sequential improvement over the
prior quarter and contributed approximately 140 basis points to our Q2 total company growth. This was just below our
baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points, but we are encouraged by a relatively consistent above-market performance in
countries that are under significant macroeconomic pressure. We continue to see increased diversification of our
emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency of any single market.
In Q2, Greater China, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, India and Southeast Asia all grew double digits. In
mainland China, we grew 13% and improved sequentially with balanced contributions from each of our core groups.
We continued to implement our channel optimization strategy in China, which is focused on transitioning our
distribution channel to include consolidated platform distributors. We're also leveraging the breadth of our therapies to
establish expanded multi-line selling presence in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
Another priority is to develop deep partnerships with the Chinese government, such as the one that we have already
forged with the Chengdu government in Sichuan province and are looking to further broaden. Recently, our entire
executive committee spent a week in China meeting with several provincial and central government officials to discuss
the creation of more partnerships across all of our businesses. Although complex, China will become the largest
healthcare market over the long term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country. We can never lose
sight of this potential.
In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 10%, driven by our newly-formed joint venture with our largest Saudi
distributor. Despite political instability in the region, our team continues to deliver strong growth, reflecting the fact
that governments in this region continue to prioritize healthcare investments.
In Latin America, we grew 11%, driven by Mexico, Chile and Argentina. In Brazil we significantly outperformed the
market, with strength in MITG, neurovascular and neuromodulation. While the outlook in Brazil remains uncertain,
given the macroeconomic and healthcare challenges in the country, we believe we can outperform the market by
continuing to partner with healthcare stakeholders to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes.
We did experience some weakness this quarter in Eastern Europe and Russia, which together account for less than 10%
of our emerging market revenue. This was a result of a planned distributor changeover in Eastern Europe, continued
weakness in the Ukraine and Belarus, and year-end procedure delays affecting our MITG business in Russia. We
continue to make progress in pursuing potential opportunities, such as government partnerships, to improve growth in
this region.
Across the emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities, as well as our differentiated
approach of local channel optimization in China, India, and Saudi Arabia, and establishing government partnerships
like the one in Chengdu. In addition, we are developing unique partnerships with private entities such as The Abraaj
Group. In Q2, we made a commitment to The Abraaj Group's growth market's health fund, which is focused on
improving access to healthcare in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as other developing markets. Abraaj
purchases or builds hub hospitals, surrounded by networks of referring hospitals and clinics.
We are strategic partners in this market development effort, with a commitment to improve patient access, healthcare
delivery outcomes and efficiency, and product supply within these Abraaj hospital networks. In, summary we believe
that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech
over the long term.
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy. Our Services & Solutions growth sector contributed
approximately 20 basis points to our Medtronic growth. While this overall result is below our goal of 40 to 60 basis
points, it represents strong mid-30%s growth, almost all organic. We expect to further improve our growth as Services
& Solutions is adopted and expanded across all our business groups.
In Care Management services, formally known as Cardiocom, we have high-teens growth in Q2, driven by a strong
performance within the U.S. VA healthcare system. This business represents an important platform for us, especially as
post-acute care services become even more critical in the bundled payment models of the future for different disease
states.

In Cath Lab Managed Services, or CLMS, where we provide the administration operational efficiency expertise and
daily management of cath labs within hospitals, we continue to generate rapid growth. In Q2, we expanded our CLMS
business into Latin America by purchasing a majority stake and option to acquire Cardiored, a privately held Chilean
Cath Lab Managed Services provider. Cardiored already has a presence in Chile, with long-term agreements to operate
10 cath labs at 9 private clinics throughout the country. We expect that Medtronic's scale will help to quickly expand
Cardiored's presence, both within Chile and throughout Latin America.
We also continue to expand our operating room managed services, our ORMS offering, which applies our Cath Lab
business model to an operating room setting, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and expertise. We've now
signed 6 ORMS deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue, with an average life of seven
years.
Since starting hospital solutions two years ago, we have now completed a total of 66 long-term CLMS and ORMS
agreements with hospital systems, representing over $1.5 billion in revenue over an average span of six years. And we
have a large number of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world.
We also continue to expand our solutions offerings into diabetes care delivery with Diabeter, a Netherlands-based
diabetes clinic and research center that has developed a unique care model that incorporates standardized and scalable
protocols. As we continue to grow the number of Diabeter patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond the
Netherlands to other countries around the globe, as we transform our diabetes group from a market-leading pump and
sensor company to a holistic diabetes management company.
All of these activities are expected to serve as building blocks for value-based healthcare, where payment is based on
actual outcomes over a specific time horizon. Specifically, we are creating unique offerings that combine bundled
solutions across the care continuum to target specific patient populations or cohorts within a particular disease.
This is consistent with the direction of CMS's bundled payments initiative, which we fully support and are encouraging
expansion into other disease states where we participate. In the end, we remain convinced that there is an incredible
amount of value to be realized in healthcare. And we believe our technologies and services can play a central role with
providers, payers, and governments to make the shift to value-based healthcare successful.
Turning now to the P&L. And as I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage in Q2 of 480 basis points on a
comparable constant currency basis, which exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. All areas of
our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year as we deliver on our
productivity improvements and cost synergy expectations. We also executed below the operating income line,
delivering above planned financial performance through higher interest income, a lower tax rate, and fewer shares
outstanding.
It is also worth noting that the strong performance was against a difficult comparison due to legacy Covidien's fiscal
year-end in the prior year. For the back half of this fiscal year, we expect to significantly exceed our baseline EPS
leverage expectation of 200 to 400 basis points. As we communicated, this overperformance will be driven by planned
cost synergies from the Covidien integration.
The integration of Covidien is, in fact, going very well. We are executing on our priorities to preserve, optimize,
accelerate and transform. Our cultures continue to come together. Talent retention and employee satisfaction, which we
monitor and quantify through frequent employee surveys and focus groups, remain strong.
Our cost synergy efforts thus far have been focused in the following areas: indirect sourcing, where we are using
best-case contracts and improved purchasing power to achieve meaningful savings; common expense policies, which
we're driving across the organization; real estate, where we have now closed over 80 redundant sites, mostly back
office and field distribution centers; and SAP, where we are bringing legacy Covidien entities onto Medtronic's
common enterprise system, leveraging our internal expertise from having orchestrated similar system-wide
implementation within legacy Medtronic.

In addition to executing on the promised cost synergies, every function is uncovering additional opportunities for
savings. The Covidien acquisition is truly serving as a catalyst to re-examine and redefine our overall operating models
and cost structures.
Another key element of the Covidien acquisition that we're just beginning to execute on is unlocking our trapped cash.
We were able to free a significant amount of our trapped cash in Q2, transferring $9.3 billion into accessible cash
through an internal reorganization as part of the Covidien legal entity integration. The ability to deploy this cash in the
U.S. gives us increased flexibility and options. We're working quickly and diligently to determine the best way to
utilize this cash with the priority of creating long-term shareholder value and we will communicate our strategy in the
very near term.
This is just one more example of the benefit of the Covidien acquisition, perhaps even more meaningful than the cost
synergies that we're delivering. The improved financial flexibility and our ability to invest in U.S. technologies and
products, as well as return additional cash to shareholders is and is expected to continue to be a significant
differentiator for Medtronic shareholders.
Our strong revenue growth and focus on operating leverage is generating significant free cash flow. In Q2, we
generated $1.1 billion and are expecting to generate nearly $40 billion of free cash flow over the next five years. We
are deploying our capital with a focus on M&A investments, providing strong returns to our shareholders, and meeting
our debt commitments.
Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25% and we expect to grow our dividend rate faster than earnings,
with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis within the next few years. As an S&P Dividend
Aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth.
This quarter, we also accelerated our share repurchase activity from our prior plans and are committed to returning a
minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share purchases. Regarding
investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we must make must
be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while at the same time offer
high-return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution.
In summary, I'm extremely pleased with how our team is executing. And Gary will now take you through a more
detailed look at our second quarter results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $7.058 billion increased 62% as reported, or 6% on a comparable constant
currency basis, which excludes the $452 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures
contributed a net 30 basis points to Q2 revenue growth. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, an increase of 1% versus the
$1.02 delivered by Medtronic, Inc. last year, or an increase of 11% on a comparable constant currency basis after
adjusting for the $0.12 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.36, a decrease of 57%.
This quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were: a $442 million certain tax adjustment
primarily related to the internal reorganization that resulted in approximately $9.3 billion of previously trapped cash
becoming accessible, and a $29 million loss of foreign interest rate swaps related to the same internal reorganization; a
$373 million amortization charge; a $56 million net restructuring charge; and a $32 million acquisition-related items
charge primarily related to the Covidien integration; and a $17 million certain litigation charge related to introduced
product liability.
Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company revenue, grew revenue by 8%. CVG
had strong performances in all three of its divisions with each growing above the company average. Cardiac Rhythm &
Heart Failure, or CRHF, had another strong quarter with 7% revenue growth, which included mid-single-digit growth
in both High Power and Low Power, high 20%s growth in AF Solutions, and low 30%s growth in Services &

Solutions. We estimate CRHF implantables market is growing in the low-single-digits and we continue to take share,
both year-over-year and sequentially.
High Power had a particularly strong quarter in U.S. ICDs, driven by the launch of the Evera MRI ICD, the only
FDA-approved MR-conditional ICD system. We also continue to see strong customer acceptance of our differentiated
CRT-D technology, including our AdaptivCRT algorithm, quadripolar leads, VectorExpress programming, and
improved device longevity.
In Low Power, we are seeing strong demand for Reveal LINQ, which resulted in robust diagnostic growth in the
mid-20%s. Pacemaker sales also had solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. where we gained over 400 basis points
of share due to strong pacing pull-through generated by Reveal LINQ and increasing customer preference for MRI safe
technology, including our recently FDA-approved Advisa SR MRI single chamber device.
Looking ahead, we're expecting to receive the FDA and CE Mark approvals for both our Amplia MRI and Compia
MRI CRT-Ds, along with our Visia AF MRI single chamber ICD by end of the fiscal year.
Our Coronary & Structural Heart division grew 10%, with mid-20%s growth in Heart Valve Therapies,
mid-single-digit growth in Coronary, and low-single-digit-growth in Extracorporeal Therapies.
In Heart Valve Therapies, transcatheter valves grew in the high 30%s globally and over 50% the U.S., our first full
quarter of U.S. commercial launch of the CoreValve Evolut R. We estimate the global TAVR market is growing nearly
30%. In Japan, we are expecting reimbursement and launch of CoreValve in Q3.
Regarding the intermediate risk, we expect to meet our SURTAVI trial enrollment target this winter and submit to the
FDA by the middle of FY 2017 with data expected at ACC 2017.
In our Coronary business, drug-eluting stents grew mid-single-digits globally, including high-single-digit growth
outside the U.S. on the strength of Resolute Onyx and mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. from the continued
acceptance of Resolute Integrity. In balloons, we grew low-double-digits as we continue to gain share with our
differentiated Euphora PTCA product family.
In the Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division, revenue grew 10% including mid-single-digit growth in Aortic,
low-double-digit growth in Peripheral, and mid-teens growth in endoVenous.
In Aortic, while we face increased competitive pressure outside the U.S. and felt the impact of market reimbursement
cuts in Japan, the business grew in the high-single-digits in the U.S., driven by the continued market adoption of our
Endurant IIs AAA stent graft. We also are seeing strong adoption of Aptus EndoAnchor technology, which is resulting
in competitive comp conversion and AAA device pull-through.
In Peripheral, we continue to execute on our U.S. launch of the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon and maintain
our leading market position on the strength of our exceptional clinical and economic data. Data presented at TCT and
published in JACC showed sustained superiority in primary patency and re-intervention rates over balloon angioplasty
at two years, and cost-effectiveness data released at VIVA showed IN.PACT Admiral lowers the overall cost of
treatment.
In endoVenous, we've launched VenaSeal closure system in the U.S. last month and expected to drive growth in this
business going forward.
Across CVG, the use of wrap-around programs, services and solution bundles, and multi-line contracting strategies
continue to drive growth, with a number of cross-business multi-line contracts growing over 20% in the U.S.
Now, turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, revenue grew 3% and accounted for 33% of total company
revenues. MITG's revenue performance was driven by mid-single-digit growth in Surgical Solutions and
low-single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. It is worth noting that MITG's growth this quarter was
slightly slower than its historical run rate as a result of a difficult comparison due to the legacy Covidien fiscal year-end
in the year-ago period.

Surgical Solutions growth of 5% included mid-single-digit growth in the Advanced Surgical and Early Technologies
and low-single-digit growth in General Surgical. Advanced Surgical continue to benefit from new products and a
continued shift from open to minimally invasive surgery. The business had solid growth in endostapling, driven by the
Endo GIA Reinforced Reload stapling system, as well as in vessel sealing as a result of the continued exceptions of the
LigaSure Maryland Jaw. We estimate that surgical volume market growth in U.S., while still growing, has normalized.
General Surgical benefited from the RF Surgical acquisition, which closed in Q2.
Early Technologies delivered strong results, particularly in the U.S. from growth in gastrointestinal diagnostics.
The Patient Monitoring & Recovering division grew 1%, in line with its markets. Respiratory & Patient Monitoring, as
well as Patient Care & Safety grew in the low-single-digits with Nursing Care declining in the low-single-digits.
Respiratory & Patient Monitoring results were driven by growth in sensors and acute ventilators. Patient Care & Safety
results were driven by strength in electrode sales, particularly in the U.S. While Nursing Care declined, it had strength
in enteral feeding.
Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue grew 5% and accounted for 25% of the total company
revenue. Results were driven by low 30%s growth in Neurovascular and high-single-digit growth in Surgical
Technologies, with low-single-digit growth in Neuromodulation and flat results in Spine.
In Spine, our overall international sales grew 5% and Core Spine business grew 6%, which was significantly above the
market. Spine had strong double-digit growth in Japan and the Middle East and Africa and solid mid-single-digit
growth in Canada and Latin America.
Offsetting Core Spine strong international performance was BMP, which had flat international sales in the quarter due
to the INDUCTOS stopped shipment in Europe. This issue is limited to a third-party manufacturing facility that only
supplies the European market. While the supplier has identified a remediation plan, we do expect to be off the market
for the remainder of the fiscal year, reducing our expected international BMP revenue by approximately $7 million per
quarter.
In the U.S., Spine declined 2% and the Core Spine business declined 4%, underperforming the market which grew in
the low-single-digits. We expect our U.S. Core Spine performance to improve as we realize the results from our
recently realigned RTG commercial sales management, as well as the implementation of the Surgical Synergy
programs that Omar mentioned earlier.
In addition, we expect Core Spine results to improve as numerous, recent and upcoming product launches reach scale,
including our Elevate Expandable Cage and SOLERA VOYAGER System in thoracolumbar, as well as our
DIVERGENCE Stand Alone Interbody Cage, ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System, PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and
ANATOMIC PEEK PTC interbody spacer and cervical.
Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue increased 2%. We continue to face challenges in our drug pump business as a
result of the FDA consent decree. The division had strong growth in Deep Brain Stimulation driven by referral
development, emerging market expansion, and a commercial focus on surgical synergy, which combines Activa DBS
implants with our PEAK Surgery System, TYRX Antibacterial Envelope and O-arm Imaging.
In Pain Stim, while we are facing competitive pressure, we are receiving good reception of our AdaptiveStim HD
programming options. In Gastro/Uro, we continue to see solid growth of our InterStim System for bladder and bowel
control, and we expect the recently launched Verify Evaluation System to result in increased implants going forward.
In Surgical Technologies, revenue grew 8%, driven by mid-teens growth in Advanced Energy and strong sales of the
PEAK Surgery System and Aquamantys System. ENT growth was driven by growth of the NuVent sinus balloon and a
backorder release of the powered ENT blade.
The Neurosurgery business also had a strong quarter, driven by the U.S. launch of the O-arm [ph] II (34:34) surgical
imaging system.

Our Neurovascular division had another strong performance in Q2, with revenue growth of 32%. Growth was driven by
stent retrievers for treating acute ischemic stroke, where recent clinical data in AHA/ASA Stroke Treatment Guidelines
are driving rapid adoption of our Solitaire FR revascularization device. The division also had very strong results in flow
diversion led by continued adoption of the Pipeline Flex device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
During Q2, the Neurovascular division announced two technology acquisitions. Medina Medical with its aneurysm
embolization mesh technology for hemorrhagic stroke, which we believe can disrupt the core markets, as well as
Lazarus Effect in its mesh cover technology that is complementary to our Solitaire stent retriever platform.
Now, moving to Diabetes Group, revenue grew 11% and accounted for 6% of total company sales. The Intensive
Insulin Management division grew in the mid-teens, including growth of nearly 40% in Europe as a result of the strong
sales of our MiniMed 640G insulin pump system with the Enhanced Enlite CGM sensor. This next-generation system
features SmartGuard predictive low glucose management technology, as well as a new insulin pump design featuring a
full-color screen. We continue to make progress in bringing this technology to the U.S. as we have completed the
clinical trials and are on track for an early calendar 2016 submission to the FDA.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies division, revenue doubled on strong sales of the iPro2 Professional CGM
technology. In addition to Professional CGM, the NDT division continues to focus on market access and integrated
patient care solutions for people with type 2 diabetes.
In our Diabetes Services and Solutions division, revenue grew in the mid-single-digits, driven by strong growth in the
consumables, new Diabeter service revenue, as well as sales from the recently launch of the MiniMed Connect. The
uptake and user feedback on MiniMed Connect have been extremely positive and it is currently the highest rated
connected glucose monitoring app in the U.S.
We also continue to partner with IBM Watson, combining our clinical expertise, closed-loop algorithm development,
and CareLink data analytics with IBM's Watson Cloud and Watson analytics and machine learning capabilities. An
early pilot run using the database of 100 [ph] randomized (37:17) patients was able to predict some near-term
hyperglycemic events, demonstrating the potential possibility of applying cognitive computing to support diabetes
management.
Now turning to the P&L. As I discuss the opening operating items, it is worth clarifying again that my comments will
be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise.
The Q2 operating margin was 28.4%, which excludes a 100 basis point negative impact from foreign currency and
represented a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year. This operating margin improvement included a
60-basis-point improvement in SG&A offset by a 20-basis-point decline in gross margin, a 5-basis-point decline in
R&D, and a 20-basis-point decline in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of 6.4%, or operating
leverage of approximately 60 basis points over revenue growth. In the coming quarters, we expect this leverage
contribution to grow and be a majority contributor to our overall EPS leverage.
In line with our expectations, the amount of Q2 operating leverage was lower due to the difficult comparison against
legacy Covidien's fiscal year-end quarter, which included strong fiscal year-end sales. We estimate that the total benefit
in the prior year was approximately $50 million on an operating profit line. Adjusting for this, operating profit growth
would have been approximately 9% in Q2, representing operating leverage of approximately 300 basis points.
Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.2%, SG&A of 33.0% and R&D of 7.4%. Also included in our Q2
operating margin was net other expense of $57 million, which included net gains from our currency hedging program
of $71 million. We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in
our earnings from foreign exchange. However, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging
market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings.
Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which includes a $1.06 euro and ¥123, we expect
FY 2016 net other expense to be in the range of $100 million to $130 million, which includes an expected impact for
the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $210 million.

For Q3 FY 2016, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $10 million in income to $10 million in expense,
based on the previously mentioned exchange rates. We expect our operating margin for the second half of FY 2016 to
be in the range of 29% to 31% on as-reported basis, including 28% to 28.5% on an as-reported basis in Q3. This
forecast implies over 100-basis-point improvement in our full fiscal year operating margin on a comparable constant
currency basis, which on a reported basis is almost completely offset by a similar amount of negative FX based on
current rates.
This strong operating margin improvement supports the significantly greater than 400 basis points of – in earnings per
share leverage we intend to generate in the back half of the year, primarily a result of the Covidien cost synergy
programs. We continue to expect these value capture programs to result in $300 million to $350 million in FY 2016
savings, and a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY 2018, spread roughly equally across the three fiscal years.
Below the operating profit line, Q2 non-GAAP net interest expense was $172 million, which was an improvement to
our forecast due to modest outperformance in certain investment income classes. Based on current rates, we would
expect FY 2016 net interest expense to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million, including $160 million to $180
million in Q3.
At the end of Q2, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.2 billion in cash and investments,
of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. This cash mix is a significant improvement from prior quarters due to
the $9.3 billion internal reorganization we executed in Q2 as part of our Covidien integration. We expect to announce
our strategy on how we intend to use these proceeds in the very near term, with a likely focus on share repurchases and
accelerated debt pay-down while preserving financial flexibility. These potential actions are not contemplated in our
current outlooks.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q2 was 16.5%, which was an improvement from our forecast as a
result of operational tax adjustments and the allocation of profits among jurisdictions in which we operate. On a
full-year basis, we continue to expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to
18%. We expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated.
In Q2, free cash flow was $1.1 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow,
excluding the cash impact of non-GAAP adjustments to shareholders, and also continue to target an A credit profile. In
Q2, we paid $537 million in dividends and accelerated our share repurchase activity, repurchasing $710 million of our
ordinary shares.
As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 90 million shares. Second quarter
average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.429 billion shares. For FY 2016, we now expect diluted
weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.430 billion shares, including approximately 1.427 billion
shares in Q3.
Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We now expect
revenue growth for the back half of the fiscal year to be in the upper half of our mid-single-digit baseline range on a
comparable constant currency basis. Our second half revenue outlook assumes that MITG growth in the low to
mid-single-digits, RTG growth in mid-single-digits, CVG growth in the mid to high-single-digits, and Diabetes growth
in the high-single to low-double-digits.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates
were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our full fiscal year 2016 revenue would be
negatively affected by approximately $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion, including a negative $330 million to $390 million
impact in Q3.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line; based on our first half performance, we now expect non-GAAP cash earnings
per share in the range of $4.33 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact
based on current exchange rates, and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies
from the Covidien acquisition.

As we look at the back half of our fiscal year, it's worth pointing out the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. R&D tax
credit, which expired at the end of 2014. If Congress retroactively renews the credit for 2015, we would see a $0.03
benefit in FY 2016, and both renewal and non-renewal scenarios are reflected in our earnings per share guidance.
While we don't give quarterly earnings per share guidance, when looking at the [ph] gain in (45:14) earnings per share
consensus, we would not be surprised to see approximately $0.04 to $0.05 shifted from Q3 to Q4, which assumes that
the R&D tax credit is renewed in Q3.
Finally, I want to point out that the updated historical Covidien/Medtronic financial presentations that Ryan mentioned
earlier reflect a lower FY 2015 comparable earnings per share. However, this has no impact on our FY 2016
expectations. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are
recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
Before turning the call back over to Omar, I would like to note that we plan to hold our Q3 earnings call on March 1
and our Q4 earnings call on May 31. In addition, we plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held again
in New York City.

Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, I'd like to reflect on our overall performance. Our team has come
a long way, executing quarter after quarter. We're building a business with solid and diversified growth drivers,
operational excellence, strong cash flow generation, and disciplined capital allocation. But it is also important for us to
remember that we have a long journey ahead of us, and our work of fulfilling the Medtronic mission goes on. I'm
confident this team can execute consistently, balancing trade-offs and offsetting pressures to create long-term
dependable value in healthcare.
With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our
Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha,
President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We
are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If
you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.
Operator, first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Hey, good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, we can, Mike.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: We can, Mike.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Perfect. Well, first off, congratulations on another nice quarter. Let me, Gary, just circle
back on your commentary on repatriated cash. My first question is really – it sounds like there's some commentary
forthcoming in terms of exactly what you're doing with that cash. Any reason you're not being more explicit today
other than the comments you made about potentially accelerating share repurchase and paying down debt?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, Mike. I mean, as we indicated in our comments, obviously, we're still looking at this.
We're excited about the opportunity that we were able to get access to this cash and make it available. We're looking at

different options and as we indicated in our comments, obviously, the main focus of that will be we did take on a lot of
debt related to the transaction. We have a commitment on the debt side that we want to look at, but obviously the other
opportunity for us is to take a look at share repurchases and accelerate that as a potential.
We're looking at those options. We're evaluating that. We're having conversations with our board, and as we make
decisions, once we make those decisions, then we will communicate what our plans are. But we just don't want to get
ahead of ourselves in communicating before again we've had a full dialogue and discussion with the board.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask you about a couple of different businesses that, to me, stood out this
quarter. I mean, there's a whole bunch of them, but let me just target a couple of them. One was your Diabetes business,
and you've commented on the growth you're seeing in Diabetes, particularly in Europe, where you've got newer
technologies available. Can you talk about the growth there, number one?
And number two, your Neurovascular business continues extremely well. We're seeing that obviously because of the
ischemic stroke trials and what's happening in that market. But could you just give us your own thoughts on
sustainability and what you want to do with that business going forward?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay, Mike. I'm going to let Hooman and Geoff answer both these questions. So, Hooman,
why don't you go ahead first?
<A - Hooman Hakami>: Hey, Mike. Yeah. We saw great growth in Diabetes; 11%, overall. The European growth was
really, I think, something that stood out. We had just incredibly strong growth in 640. We saw that not only in Europe,
but also in Asia Pacific. And I think what it shows is that new innovation here matters and this is something that we're
going to continue to drive.
We've got a plan to launch this product in the United States. You heard for the commentary that the trial is done and we
are going to release it to the FDA in early 2016, so we're excited about that. And I think what you're also seeing that I
think is worth noting is that the 530G is doing incredibly well in the United States, and we are seeing very, very good
performance there on tough comps. So, when you take a look at those two things, I think we're seeing great
performance within the group and we expect this to continue.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Geoff?
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: Yeah. On the stroke side, it's a huge opportunity not just for Restorative Therapies
Group, but for Medtronic. First of all, you saw we did – these guys have done – our team and everyone has done a great
job developing technologies and the clinical evidence and we want to maintain that leadership so – to tuck-in
acquisitions we did last quarter I think take our technology road map out several years to maintain on leadership there.
So that's one.
And then two, we're looking at the broader stroke care continuum. From diagnostics, working with Mike Coyle's group
here in the LINQ technology into patient management and referral system. So, we think beyond the technology, if you
look across the care continuum, there's several waves of innovation here and this is a top priority for not just my group,
but for Medtronic.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And then maybe this last question [ph] wanted to just jump in (51:23). So, Omar,
one of the questions we talked about last call, you remember I think the industry was a little bit frustrated on the pace of
margin improvement and, in part, it was tough to see because of the FX headwind you guys were seeing.
But one of the questions was the degree to which some of the Covidien synergies and effectively some of the upside to
the synergy targets might get reinvested back in the business versus shown down to the bottom line to shareholders.
Why don't you just give us your own updated thoughts on that and how investors should be kind of expecting Covidien
synergies to play through here?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: We've already said, and as I said in my commentary, they were expecting some significant
upside to 200-basis-point to 400-basis-point range and we will show that in the coming quarters. So that's where we
stand; it's pretty straightforward. Most of these synergies will fall through and we'll go from there.

But I don't want to minimize our operational performance outside of the synergies as well because there is good work
going on in productivity improvements in our products, in SG&A. Some of it is using some of the new structures we're
creating under the integration. But across the board, we are delivering productivity and to the extent, especially this
year with the Covidien synergies, we really expect by the end of the year, we'll be above our – the range that we've
talked about as we've actually already done to a small extent in the first two quarters, but that amount will increase in
the coming quarters.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Perfect. Thank you, Omar.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Omar, I just wanted to come back to revenue for a second. I think your
guidance for the upper hand of 4% to 6% is consistently – you said last quarter, but it's probably the most bullish
component of the report this morning. So, what is giving you the confidence in the accelerations sort of in the back half
of the year? And not only the acceleration because the comps get so dramatically harder as you anniversary the
acceleration last year. So what gives you the confidence you still can sustain that momentum in the upper half of
revenue in the back half as those comparables get harder?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think the direct answer there is our new product momentum. I don't think we've been in a
position in this company today with the products we've already launched and the upcoming pipeline that we have
across the board in virtually every group. The cadence of product innovation across the board has increased
significantly and when you sort of combine all of that together, it makes quite a difference. That is our goal after all.
We're, in the end, a technology company striving to sort of change outcomes.
Now, in addition to that, we're completely cognizant of the fact that one of our main growth strategies is to diversify the
sources of growth. And so, we see emerging markets actually steadily improving into the back half of the year. And
service and solution again starts to keep growing because the programs that we're implementing across the board are
gaining traction across multiple regions. So those are fairly slow. It takes a little time for them to come through. But in
aggregate, they do come through and they all contribute.
So when you add all of that up together, we feel pretty confident to be in the upper half of the range. And again, for this
to be sustainable, good year doesn't mean that the next year will be bad. It has to continue to improve. So that's the
outlook that we have on this.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. Very helpful. I just had a quick follow-up for Gary and maybe one for Geoff. Gary,
our math implies 12% to 15% constant currency earnings in the back half of the year. That's an acceleration from the
first half. Does that jive with your math and how are you feeling about the $850 million number?
And then for Geoff, I know it hasn't been very long that you've been at the helm in RTG, but I wonder if you could just
briefly comment on the ability to achieve the type of network effects in RTG that have been so successful in
accelerating Medtronic Cardio? Thank you.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Well, David, to your first comment about the earnings per share, the answer on the constant
currency would be yes, that's what we would expect to see in the back half of the year. If you look at the first half of the
year, basically we've seen between 11% and 12% kind of constant currency comparable growth, overall. And so we
expect that to accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year, as we talked about, primarily because of more of the
benefits of the Covidien integration and all the integration efforts coming through.
And so, in total, related to the $850 million comment that we've committed to by FY 2018, we are right in line, in fact,
maybe slightly ahead of our plans to deliver $300 million to $350 million in the current year and right in line with the

expectations on doing that for the full $850 million by FY 2018. So, we feel very confident about that. We feel
confident about that in our earnings per share guidance we're providing to the organization – or to the investors. But in
general, yes, that's right in line with our expectation. But foreign exchange does continue to be a negative headwind for
us, obviously, but on a comparable constant currency basis, we're seeing acceleration [ph] in our result (56:40).
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Geoff.
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: David, on – good question. I'd answer it. Three parts of the answer. One, from a
market perspective, one thing that's helped the cardiovascular space is the emergence of the cardiovascular service line
globally, and we're seeing that not to the same effect yet. We're, I don't know, 10-plus years behind as the Neuro
service lines – Neuroscience service lines emerge, but we are definitely seeing that trend emerge. And the more that
happens, the more it plays to our hand because we have by far the best rep to cover those Neuroscience service lines.
So that's one and that is a tailwind for us.
The second is our internal capabilities of taking – and this is different than actually cardiovascular. We have implants
that work with intraoperative imaging and navigation and we have both platforms and that gives us some flexibility.
Now, we have to integrate those better and take them to market, selling benefits versus features and we're working on
that, but that's another tailwind. And the intraoperative imaging and navigation is a key driver to us getting this network
effect so that we can sell, like I said, solutions versus features.
And then thirdly, which we're copying the playbook from our cardiovascular group, is changing the way our operating
principles and our operating mechanisms so that our businesses, the silos come down to a certain extent and they're
incented to drive these [ph] cross-business team (58:18) to deal sort of where it makes sense.
So when you're bundling, if you will, intraoperative imaging and navigation with some of our implants, you need to
have the incentives and the operating mechanisms and the analytics to do that. And so we're in the process of doing
that. So those three things are the things that are driving it, but one thing that's gating it is the Neuroscience service line
evolution in the marketplace.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Omar, I was hoping to go back to one of
the things you referenced in your prepared remarks towards the contribution from new products I think being above the
sort of historical level or your target level. Can you maybe sort of talk about what specifically influenced that and why
that wouldn't translate into better overall top line growth? Is there any part of the new product story that is at all
cannibalistic of the base business or something that's happening in the end market that would not have led that 400-plus
basis point of new product to drive better overall top line growth? That's obviously not to throw any water on the
results here, but just for some perspective.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well, a number of things. First of all, the new product growth includes the baseline product
line, so that's inclusive of all of that. So, the only answer if you do the math is that the emerging markets and services
and solutions have to pick up. Remember, service and solutions because of the integration together with Covidien, the
baseline has changed. And so therefore, it's a 20 basis points where our number is like 40 to 60. There is one aspect that
will drag it down. Those numbers are small, but in the context in which you are talking about, you're talking about
ranges at the upper end here. So we're talking about tens of basis points rather than hundreds. So they do make a
difference. And then emerging markets also as we climb up into the range probably will help.
And outside of that, it's a matter of how much above the 350 we actually get. And again, like I've said before, we just
want to be a little cautious, not so much because of our product launch activities but because of the environment around
us, which you just never know. We just have to be a little cautious about macroeconomic pressures, political

instabilities, those things – or some healthcare rule changes. So we've – given our past experience of these things
surprising us, we just got to be a little cautious.
And so, that's really the best way I can answer this. But I'd really like to see all three of our growth vectors above our
projections before we're really confident that we can extend the range, so that we get that level of diversification. But in
no way am I any sort of less confident about our new products execution just because of the breadth of our pipeline. I
think that's going to happen. I just think macroeconomic circumstances, we just want to be a little cautious about that
and, therefore, I went to see the other growth vectors also climb to the same range before we can get more bullish.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Gary on the P&L and cash flow
side. As we think about the underlying operating profit of the business, obviously FY 2016 is a sort of a tale of two
halves. As we think about the sort of normalized run rate of the business, should we think about that 30% number that
you're talking about exiting the year as sort of the right underlying profit of the business off of which to think about
forward forecasts. And then on the free cash flow side, the $1.1 billion you're talking about to this quarter, if you
annualize that, that's pretty close to what you were generating as an independent company pre-Covidien. So when do
we start to see the benefit flow through to free cash flow and move toward that target you've put out there for FY 2019?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. Well, with respect to the profit margin, I mean, you can't take our Q4 number and
annualize that because if you look historically the same way that you had with Covidien that we just talked about as far
as the tough comparison, our Q4, the profit margin is always much, much higher than the previous three quarters.
That's just historical because we have a strong close and so you have a lower rate. So you can't annualize the fourth
quarter.
But obviously, we're in the 28%, 29% range for the full year that we've been talking about, then we would obviously
continue to build on that number. So that's kind of the, I think, the average for the year and then build on that
standpoint of the incremental improvement that we would see from value capture going forward is what you should
assume. But my only point is, just don't take the fourth quarter and annualize it, because it's unusual. It's by far – the
best profit operating margin tends to be in the fourth quarter. But we would obviously expect it to continue to improve.
The cash flow in the quarter, that $1.1 billion includes some restructuring costs and charges and stuff like that. So if we
pull that out, you're probably closer to $1.3 billion. And the point is, if you look historically at Medtronic and Covidien,
the cash flow also, similar to the profits, grows as you go through the year. So it's always – actually, that $1.2 billion or
$1.3 billion is kind of [indiscernible] (1:03:42) 40% or 50% versus where Medtronic Inc. itself was a year ago in the
quarter. So it's – we would expect still, for the current year, that we're going to be somewhere around $6.2 billion to
$6.5 billion in free cash flow. And similar to what we've talked about on the profits, the cash flow also improves in the
back half of the year, which is normal, because first half of the year, we're paying off bonuses and things like that from
the prior year, and the cash flow is just – by its historical nature, it's just lower. But in the back half, that will accelerate.
So we're still very confident that, for the current year, we'll be in that $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. And similar to what
we've been talking about, earnings growing close to double digits on that cash flow going forward over the next several
years and generating, as we talked about, close to $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years. We're still very
confident about that.

Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with the Puerto Rico tax issue. I
think in September at our conference, you said there would be a briefing in October. Did that happen? And do you still
expect a decision in late fiscal 2016? I think in the past, you said most of these cases settle before a decision. Do you

still feel that a settlement is more likely here as well? And I had a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Well, as far as the trial process, yes. The – there was a process where there were some briefings
that had to be provided by both parties, like the government and Medtronic that occurred, I believe, in October. That's
all taken – has been done, from what I understand. And now we're in a situation that it's in the judge's purview, the
judge has the option to take as long as she would like in this case. We are assuming that towards the end of late – our
fiscal 2016 early into FY 2017 is what she will – she'll make a decision. [indiscernible] (1:05:46). But it can go longer,
too. This is her decision on how quickly she moves in making that decision. As far as settlement discussions, again, I
can't say anything on that because obviously, settlement discussions require two parties to come together, and at this
point in time, I can't say anything about that at all. If it happens it happens, but in the meantime, we're just waiting to
see what the decision is from the court case.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks. And then on emerging markets, Omar, you bounced back this quarter, plus 11%, and
based on your earlier comments, it sounds like you expect that to – I just wanted to be clear, it sounds like you expect
that to actually improve in the second half, and I'm asking because, we do look across med tech, emerging market
growth does appear to have slowed. So I just wanted to be clear that you think you can kind of, in the second half of
this year, build off of the 11% and actually accelerate. And is that mid-teens growth that you've talked about in the past
still realistic? Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah, first, yes, we expect this growth to increase. The words I like to use, and that I think I
used in the commentary, was that we'd like to see steady increase and improved consistency. So I don't want us to like
bounce back and forth between 15% and 8% or whatever. This thing has to grow steadily, and our diversification
across the emerging markets helps with that. And I think we'll see that. I think the mid-teens goal is completely realistic
over a period of time. And that's what we're aiming to get to. The market opportunity is massive, and it's really up to us
to execute our variety of strategies and get the benefits from them. So in short, I expect this to steadily improve quarter
after quarter.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: [indiscernible] (1:07:41). Yeah, thanks, Larry.
Operator
Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Oh, thanks. And can you hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Oh, great. Good morning. So a couple quick things. First, for Gary, the synergy that
predicted, the $300 million to $350 million for this year, can you just give us a sense as to how much has been realized
here in the first half? And also, Gary, if you wouldn't mind just walking through in a little more detail why you think
the Street sort of needs to shift a little bit from – in terms of earnings from Q3 to Q4?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Well, as far as the synergy number of the $300 million to $350 million, I would say right now,
we probably have already achieved about 40% of that, 35% to 40% of it has already been incurred. We've indicated
previously that a bigger portion would be in the back half of the year, and that's kind of what we're still expecting, so I
would expect that 60% plus of the benefit will occur in the back half of the year. And we're right in line with our plans
and our targets. In fact, slightly ahead of where they're at. But approximately 40% we've already realized up to this
point.
With respect to the guidance, just as far as taking a look at the quarters and stuff, all we're looking at is, if you look
historically, our Q2 and Q3 historically, both revenue and bottom line, are relatively consistent. There's not a big
change overall between those two. We did $1.03 here in the current quarter. We're assuming that there will be an R&D
tax growth that's there's a benefit for in the third quarter. So overall, that would get you more in the $1.05, $1.06 range.

And all we're saying is, that's – versus where the Street's at, I think they're a little bit higher than that number.
On the other hand, I would tell you I think the Street's a little lower in Q4, versus what we would historically see as far
as an uplift. So all we're saying is, if you look at our historical modeling, Q2 to Q3 are usually relatively consistent and
it's Q4 where you see the big jump. I think there's been too much weighting put in Q3 right now. But again, these are
your models. You guys can put together how you like, but that's – if you look at history, I think you're going to see that
you're a little bit -probably a little high in Q3.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: And then for Mike or Omar – and thanks for that, Gary – can you guys put in
perspective the MRI-safe ICD launch in the United States, maybe relative to the MRI-safe pacer launch? How should
we think about this launch in terms of the ability of this product to take share while you're the only one in the market
with such a product? And then Omar, I was wondering if you could just give some broad thoughts on the state of med
tech right now, in terms of what you're seeing across your businesses in terms of surgical procedure volumes, pricing,
just a broad look at the current point in time, if you don't mind?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Mike, do you want to go first?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yeah, Bob, maybe the best way to think about it is some statistics around mix. If you look at
dual chamber pacemakers right now, probably two-thirds of our product is MRI-safe as we sell into initial implants.
And with the recently – two quarters ago, we launched the single chamber. We're probably now up to somewhere
around 40% mix in single chamber for MRI safe. We just launched the MRI-safe ICD, and our mix in the quarter
would be probably somewhere around 20%, so there's still a lot of room to run there. And obviously, we have not yet
released the MRI-safe CRT-D, which we expect to do by the end of the year. So I think that might give you some sense
of sort of how we see the mix change taking place within our business.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: With respect to the overall med tech market, look, we've had – the med tech industry has
actually had a pretty good year, and I think a lot of that is [indiscernible] (1:11:37) driven by U.S. growth. So the U.S.
has been stronger than I can remember for a long time. And that's not only the med tech companies, but also hospitals.
Now, as we go into calendar year 2016, there will be some anniversary-ing that's happening, and also, some of the
hospitals have reported slightly lower growth rates. So we're watching this carefully. I don't know to what extent the
procedure growth will continue at the same rate of growth. I don't think it'll slow down, per se, but the growth rate
might well slow down. So that's what we're watching very carefully and I think coming after the next couple of months
it's pretty crucial to see how procedures go.
But again, really at the end of the day, this is a U.S. story. And to a certain degree, emerging markets – med tech has
been resilient in emerging markets compared to other industries simply because of the nature of the industry itself. And
governments continue to invest there. So that hasn't – the bottom really hasn't fallen out of that at all. And although I
think we've outperformed the overall market, the market in general has been pretty resilient. So those things holding,
U.S. growth is what's driven the med tech industry. I think U.S. growth will anniversary probably steady a little bit. On
the other hand, med tech in emerging markets might well start to improve. I don't know. I know our projections are that
we'll start to improve. Overall, we'll have to see.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I hope that helps.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Very much. Thank you.

<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Just wanted to – Omar, start with the
first one. Although it's relatively early since the close of the Covidien transaction, you've had three quarters of
combined [ph] entity (1:13:41) experience, and just wondering how you're evaluating the entire product portfolio, and
whether or not you feel like you have increased flexibility now that – to prune the portfolio or weed out lower growth,
lower margin products and business units, and whether we should be expecting that?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think I kind of alluded to that a little bit. First of all, since the acquisition, we have set up the
Minimally Invasive Therapies Group under Bryan. And Bryan and his team have really charted a very clear and
compelling vision for the future, which is outcomes-based and very aligned with the Medtronic mission. So that was a
first step and then I think I talked about the four areas of focus within MITG.
Now we are looking at the entire range of assets that we have within MITG and kind of assessing that against the
strategy. As we go through that process, which we are in the middle of doing, in the next six months or so, we will have
– we will take action as necessary. But that's the way in which we're gauging it. So the first step was to decide clearly
and get full sort of excitement with the team and agreement with the team that this is where we should go, which I think
the team has put in place. And understand what the core product technologies are that drive that, and solutions are
necessary for that. Next is to look at the breadth of everything else and see what fits and what doesn't. Now, some
things clearly don't. And we'll have to see how we monetize those assets as we move forward. But by and large, that's
the way in which we are looking at this.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Great. And a follow-up for Omar and Gary. Any updated views on potential revenue
synergies outside of peripheral and neurovascular? Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. That is an area that is pretty active. I mean, one thing that you just heard about was in
stroke where the linked product feeding into the stroke care and neurovascular channel is one that is pretty high on our
list. I can tell you that as a business, we work – as a leadership team, we work to figure out methodologies where
internally we can have our selling group sell multiple products and do it in a way that's scalable and sustainable, and
then in organized way [indiscernible] (1:16:08). I think that first step was pretty important.
So that area certainly is a big sort of enabler for us to move products around various sales channels and we've done that.
And we'll look see how these things go forward, because a lot of discussion between sales teams using those principles
without getting distracted from their main focus as to how to accelerate their growth. So we're optimistic that we'll start
to see those. But the specifics of those right now are still sort of being generated.
The other area that I'll point out is the transition of the operating room managed services from Cath Lab. I mean, that's
a big step for us. And the acceleration there is pretty exciting. As you can see like I've said, we've already closed six of
those deals. $140 million in cumulative revenue. That's much faster than anything that Covidien was original planning
for, and we're only beginning there. So those are the ways in which we're looking at this right now.
And over time, we're creating a structure where we can use the combined nature and assets of our company to address
many different problems, both from a technology perspective and from a comorbidity perspective, which will be an
increasing problem in healthcare where we think we have the breadth of assets that we can address very effectively.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. So with that, thank you all very much for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like
to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our
progress in our Q3 call in March 1. Thank you, and all of you, please have a great day. Thank you.
