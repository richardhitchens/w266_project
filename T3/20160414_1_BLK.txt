Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated First Quarter 2016 Earnings Teleconference.
Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed
on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.

Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Unverified Participant
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to
remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your
attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.
So with that, let's begin.

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I
turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance, and business results. As
usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.
In the context of continued market challenges over the last 12 months, including global equity markets down high
single digits, emerging markets and natural resources each down over 20% and a continuation of a low and in many
cases negative rate environment. The differentiation and strength of Blackrock's broad global investment platform
enabled us to deliver another quarter of positive organic asset growth.
While we are not immune to market headwinds, consistent organic growth and prudent expense discipline allowed us to
deliver relatively stable base fees and increase margins from a year ago and continue to consistently return capital to
shareholders.
Our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest offering
of active and indexed investment products and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions to our clients.
The diversity of our platform positions us to serve our clients' needs in a variety of market environments, helping to
drive consistent and differentiated organic growth.
As we stated last quarter, we remain committed to investing in a number of strategic initiatives that will further enhance
our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. Doing so, requires us to make smarter – to
be smarter about reallocating resources in challenging markets.
With that in mind, this quarter we undertook restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization with a goal to
efficiently optimizing growth. It will also create new opportunities for our strongest people. This resulted in a
restructuring charge of $76 million during the quarter, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization
expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 400 impacted employees, this charge
appears as a single line expense item on our GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as adjusted
results.
First quarter revenue of $2.6 billion was 4% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1 billion was down 3%.
Earnings per share of $4.25 declined more significantly versus the prior year quarter driven by a one-time
non-operating gain and a lower effective tax rate a year ago. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $8 million
of net investment gains and decreased from the first quarter of 2015 due to lower marks in the current quarter and a $40
million one-time non-cash gain related to the acquisition of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors in last year's first
quarter.
Our as adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 23.7% a year ago reflecting several favorable
non-recurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of
2016, so the effective actual tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the
year.
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $36 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic
growth rate of 3% and demonstrated the continued resilience of BlackRock's differentiated business model. Flows were
positive across both active and indexed and across regions as positive momentum in March more than offset a slow
start to the year. While organic base fee growth for the quarter was 2%, lagging organic asset growth, strong fixed
income flows were offset by outflows from higher fee equity products. Over the last 12 months BlackRock's organic
base fee growth still remains above our long-term organic AUM growth.
First quarter base fees were down 1% year-over-year. As organic AUM growth of $118 billion over the last 12 months
partially offset the impact of $148 billion of negative market and FX movement. Sequentially, base fees were down
4%, despite positive organic growth in the quarter, as first quarter average AUM declined from fourth quarter level, due
to significant market declines in January and early February. Market improvements that occurred at the end of the
quarter had a limited impact on first quarter base fees, but should act as a tailwind as we move into the second quarter.

In a difficult period for the hedge fund industry, with the HFRX Index down 2% in the quarter, performance fees of
$34 million decreased significantly from a year ago, driven by declines in the fees associated with single-strategy hedge
funds, fund of hedge funds and certain long-only equity products. Underperformance during the first quarter may have
a negative impact on performance fees for the full year as certain quarterly locking funds are below high watermarks,
while other lock based on trailing 12-month performance period.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 16% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business,
which represented 82% of BRS revenue for the quarter, grew 12% year-over-year driven by several sizeable clients
going live on the Aladdin platform in 2015. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset
managers and owners, as they look to consolidate global investment platforms, understand risks across multi asset class
portfolios. Additionally, a rapidly changing regulatory and technology environment is driving accelerated conversations
with retail intermediaries about leveraging both Aladdin and FutureAdvisor capabilities in the wealth management
space.
Non-Aladdin BRS revenue was up $9 million year-over-year though down $3 million sequentially due to completion of
a number of assignments in last year's fourth quarter. Our Financial Markets Advisory business continues to reflect a
more stable revenue profile, driven by a higher level of repeat engagements and is well positioned to benefit from
changes in a regulatory landscape affecting financial institutions and official sector clients worldwide. Other revenue
was down $12 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower earnings from equity method investments.
Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially driven primarily by lower compensation and G&A
expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $32 million, or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower
incentive compensation, driven primarily by lower performance fees, partially offset by a higher head count.
Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense down 4% reflecting lower incentive compensation, partially offset by
higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related grants of prior year awards.
Looking forward, despite the first quarter restructuring, and assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate ending the
year with higher total head count than we have today. But with a compensation to revenue ratio modestly lower than
2015. G&A expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional
spend, and an increased benefit from the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement. Sequentially, G&A expense
decreased $92 million, primarily reflecting the seasonal and discretionary impact of lower marketing and promotional
expense, reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense, and $23 million of deal related expense associated with
strategic transactions executed in last year's fourth quarter.
As discussed last quarter, we remain extremely expense aware in the current market environment, and we'll continue to
be prudent with our discretionary G&A spend. At present and, again, assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate
full year 2016 G&A expense to be approximately in line with 2015 results.
Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 41.6% was up 40 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially.
BlackRock's ability to generate positive year-over-year operating leverage in a negative beta environment, highlights
our commitment in prudently managing expense while continuing to invest for future growth. We remain committed to
using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to
shareholders. In line with that commitment, we anticipate closing the Bank of America Global Capital Management
transaction later this month, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of related
cash and liquidity AUM.
We previously announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.29 per share of common stock and also we
purchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We saw an opportunity to modestly increase
our level of share repurchases during the quarter, a sizable market moves and changes in the relative valuation of our
stock in January and February created an attractive buying opportunity. We stand by the guidance we've previously
provided in last year's fourth quarter as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.
First quarter long-term net inflows of $36 billion reflected the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive in both
active and indexed and across all region. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw minor long-term net outflows as

positive flows in the United States were broadly offset by international outflows. BlackRock's U.S. retail business
generated long-term net inflows of $1 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the
domestic fund industry with U.S. Active Mutual Funds experiencing negative flows during the first quarter for the first
time, since the financial crisis.
BlackRock's flows were drive by strong long-term investment performance across our fixed income platform, including
flows into our total return, high yield, and strategic municipal opportunities funds, all of which are performing in the
top quartile for the trailing five-year period.
International retail net outflows of $1 billion were primarily related to outflows in international equities, and
multi-asset funds, amid market uncertainty and industry-wide derisking. These flows were partially offset by inflows
into our natural resources franchise, which benefited from commodities re-risking during the quarter. Global iShares
generated over $24 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 9% annualized organic growth with
record fixed income net inflows of $27 billion, partially offset by outflows from developed market equities.
Our institutional business generated $12 billion in long-term net inflows in the first quarter driven by higher fee active
offerings. Institutional active net inflows of $11 billion represented the eighth consecutive quarter of positive active
flows for the business, and reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top performing fixed income
platform.
Multi-asset inflows reflected solutions based fundings, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space, and demand for
our LifePath target-date [ph] securities (13:09). Fixed income net inflows were led by flows into investment grade
strategies. Institutional active equity outflows of $2 billion reflected outflows in our fundamental equities business,
partially offset by inflows into our scientific active equity business where 98% of assets are continuing to perform
above benchmark on a trailing five-year period.
In addition, we had another strong fund raising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1.5 billion in new
commitments and now have $12 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients. Illiquid alternatives remain a key
area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and
uncorrelated returns. Institutional index saw $1 billion of net inflows as strong inflows into LDI strategies were
partially offset by outflows from indexed equities.
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a differentiated global
business model and our ability to effectively navigate expenses in a challenging beta environment. Diversification
across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of the
market environment or investment performance.
We will continue to be mindful of the trade-off between growth and margin, looking to strike the right balance between
investing in key strategic initiatives and optimizing expenses. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated
organic AUM growth over time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates
that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in an uncertain market environment as we manage risk and deliver
investment solutions to achieve our clients' long-term investment goals.
Economic, social and geopolitical instability drove dramatic market swings in the first quarter. Fears of global
recession and the risk of Chinese currency devaluation drove stocks lower to start the year. Investors continued to
struggle to digest lower energy prices, negative rate spreads in Europe and Japan. And uncertainty grew from political
developments in countries including the United States, Germany, Spain, Brazil and the pending vote in the UK on
whether to leave the European Union, pushing global markets down more than double digit percentages in the opening

weeks of the year.
In February, stabilizing commodity prices and more dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve helped spark a
risk-on rotation despite continued policy uncertainties and questions surrounding global growth.
As Gary mentioned, given the fact that we earn fees on average AUM, we did not realize much of the financial benefit
of the market upswing in the first quarter, but we are positioned to benefit from the tailwinds going into the second
quarter. It is especially in times like this, marked by volatility and investor uncertainty, that more clients are looking to
BlackRock for their investment guidance.
Our goal is not to just sell them individual products, but rather to understand the client's objectives, their needs, and to
fashion a cohesive solution that helps achieve those goals. While many firms claim to do the same, no other asset
manager draws on the same breadth of active, index and alternative strategies, investment styles across asset classes
and regions, risk management and technology and focus on long-term solutions.
These capabilities combined with the talent and fiduciary culture of the BlackRock team enables us to have a deeper
conversation with our clients as they make important decisions around portfolio construction and asset allocation.
This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth with $36 billion of long-term net new
flows in the quarter representing 3% organic growth, driven by our strength in iShares and institutional active. The fact
that we are again seeing such diverse inflows in this very volatile market speaks to the power of our platform we've
built over time. We've consistently invested in capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients, and we will
continue to invest to helping our clients, so we could show future growth in the quarters to come.
As clients increasingly look to ETFs as alternatives to individual stocks and bonds, derivatives and mutual funds, we
continue to grow our iShare business to meet their needs. Investors turned to iShares in the first quarter as they
navigated heightened volatility and our ETF business saw $24 billion of net flows. As was the case for the full-year in
2015, BlackRock captured the number one market share of net new business globally in the United States and in
Europe, and the number one market share in fixed-income.
Two global iShare priorities drove our inflows, first was fixed income. BlackRock has been building our fixed-income
ETF capabilities for several years. We now manage more than $290 billion in fixed-income iShares which, as a
standalone franchise, would represent the fourth largest ETF player in the industry.
After seeing $50 billion in fixed-income inflows for the full-year 2015, this quarter we generated record quarterly net
inflows of $27 billion. Risk sentiment initially drove demand for U.S. treasuries, and as the market conditions
improved, clients added to their U.S., European credit exposures.
We see significant growth ahead for fixed income iShares, a widening range of clients are adopting fixed income
iShares as diversified, efficient investment tool and as a substitute for cash and derivatives as bank balance sheets
continue to be shrunk.
Despite rapid growth, fixed income ETFs currently only have one-tenth of the share of global bond market assets, that
equity ETFs have, in the global equity markets, offering a significant opportunity to increase the penetration in the
$100 trillion global fixed income market.
The second priority is smart beta. BlackRock is investing in factors and factor products, that we believe will become
increasingly important as asset allocation tools and alternatives to traditional beta or lower alpha capture active strategy
and BlackRock now manages more than $125 billion across a range of factor based solutions.
Our iShares minimum volatility products raised nearly $7 billion globally in the quarter, leading the ETF industry's
smart beta category and increasing our smart beta ETF AUM to $67 billion. Additionally, our newer single factors
product have started to achieve scale at $5 billion and we are now bringing multifactor iShares to market to complete
our offering.

In our institutional business, first quarter net inflows of $12 billion were driven by strong active fixed income and
multi-asset flows. As the investments we made to diversify our institutional platform are generating results. As we
strengthened the diversity of our institutional platform over time, we are deepening our existing client relationships.
And more than 50% of BlackRock's largest institutional clients now have five or more products managed by
BlackRock. For those who have been our investors since 2009, when we did the BGI merger, we talked about this in
great detail as one of the merits of why we thought the merger would work. At that time, we had less than 20% of our
clients having more than one product. And so, one of the great results and why I truly believe our positioning, our
penetration with the clients is through this metric of how many products we have in terms of positioning ourselves with
our clients and once again, I will repeat it again because I am very proud of it, that more than 50% of our largest
institutional clients have more than five or more products managed by BlackRock.
We saw institutional active fixed income net inflows of nearly $11 billion, driven by flows from financial institutional
clients, as we further expand our relationships with these clients through our solution oriented approach. BlackRock's
Financial Institutions team continues to deliver differentiated investment strategies for these financial institutions,
especially in this extended low and negative rate environment. In alternatives where we invested to strengthen the
diversity and quality of our platform, we generated more than $1.5 billion of additional illiquid commitments.
In the last several years, we have expanded our capabilities in our real estate platform, including infrastructure and real
estate. Real estate – real assets, especially infrastructure provide clients with the ability to achieve long-term financial
goals, while helping to creating more further long-term investment environment.
Hopefully by generating jobs and aligning the longer time horizon afforded by greater longevity. BlackRock currently
manages more than $30 billion in real assets across our global multi-product platform. BlackRock Solutions revenues
grew 16% year-over-year, led by Aladdin, our unifying technology platform.
We are seeing growing demand from clients as asset owners and managers are focusing on risk management. And they
are now learning to utilize more risk management as they adapt to the regulatory changes.
As the retail marketplace evolves, we are also seeing increase in the opportunities to provide our distribution partners
with institutional quality asset allocation, risk management and digital advice capabilities.
BlackRock is also intensifying our efforts to leverage the industry's most advanced technologies to enhance client
service to build better investment products and portfolios, and importantly to identify new and better sources of alpha.
On the distribution side FutureAdvisor, which operates within BlackRock Solutions allows us to strengthen
relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality technology enabled advise backed by
BlackRock's broad investment platform. Our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology and our
long-standing experience as an enterprise technology partner to other financial institutions.
We're seeing growing demand from our intermediary partners for BlackRock FutureAdvisor solution including our
latest partnership we announced yesterday.
On the investment side, BlackRock's investment team including our active equity, our model based fixed income and
our multi-asset strategy teams continue to expand their use of technology based tools and research methodologies to
produce investment insights that contribute to sustainable, consistent alpha generation. These tools include things such
as machine learning, natural language processing, and scientific data visualization.
In these challenging beta environments, our clients look to us more than ever to deliver the investment performance
they need to meet their liabilities and their financial goals. We maintain a constant focus on enhancing alpha generation
across our platforms, ended the quarter with 89% of our fixed income, 97% of our scientific active equity and 52% of
our fundamental active equity products above market [ph] or peer median (26:30) for the five-year period.
The investments that we're making to leverage technology across our platform, a part of BlackRock's focus on
continuously solving our clients' long-term challenges. As I discussed in my annual letter to shareholders earlier this
week and a letter I sent in January to CEOs of companies we invest in on behalf of our clients, it is critical that

companies focus their strategy on the long-term and clearly articulate their plans for long-term growth and in the
context of the environment and the ecosystem in which they operate.
Just as we continued to invest for the long run, we are constantly evaluating our ecosystem in which we operate,
including the markets, regulatory environment, the competitive landscape to identify the changes that might require us
to pivot our strategy.
Last week, the Department of Labor published their fiduciary rule, which has implications for both our clients in our
own business, while we are currently reviewing the final rule to thoroughly assess its implications, we are likely to see
changes in our distribution partners' accounts, and fee structures, their product preferences and importantly their use of
technology to both build portfolios for clients and to manage their increased risk and most importantly, their
compliance needs.
BlackRock believes in the importance of always acting as a fiduciary to our clients, and doing so is one of the core
principles that we've founded our firm up on. BlackRock has also an extensive experience with adapting and helping
our clients adapt. The change in the regulatory environment, most recently through RDR, MiFID in Europe, we're
leveraging this experience directly with our distribution partners in the U.S., as we listen to and work with them to
address the challenges and the opportunities that the DOL rule presents.
This is another example where the combination of the breadth and depth of BlackRock's investment platform, our
global footprint and experience, our focus on technology and risk management solutions, and our strong fiduciary
culture, differentiates the value proposition that we can deliver to our clients.
We have always embraced change, and we will always be looking for ways to better serve our clients, to operate more
efficiently, to focus resources on strategic priorities, and to create new opportunities for our strongest employees. We
began 2016 by enhancing our investment platform by increasing connectivity among our investors by aligning with the
evolving needs of our clients and positioning talented investment leaders to drive our success and these changes are
working well. Most recently, we initiated a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization, driving
efficiencies across our platform to better serve our clients, to deliver returns for our shareholders, it will also create
opportunities for our strongest employees.
Over the last three years, we have grown our employee base by more than 20%. We added 2,500 employees to support
improvements in client service, in technology and enhancing alpha generation. We remain committed to investing in
our business to leverage the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth despite current market volatility,
doing so requires making smart and unfortunately difficult decisions about allocating resources, which we must always
do.
While the uncertain environment we face is unsettling at times, it is also an opportunity to look out in the future, to
capture new alpha generating opportunities, to use technology in innovating ways and to build on our platform to serve
our clients' evolving needs, create a continued opportunity for our employees to deliver consistent returns for our
shareholders.

<Q - Daniel Thomas Fannon>: Good morning. I guess, Larry, if you could expand on your DOL comments and
maybe discuss in more detail what some of the changes and preferences that your distribution partners, as you
highlighted, might be undertaking and maybe just kind of characterize how well prepared you think the industry is for
these changes coming forth.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let's start off with the context for a second. Probably most importantly, BlackRock
has supported the changes to the financial ecosystem. If we could enhance confidence with investors, I believe through
that mechanism is going to increase and promote more investing, less savings in their bank accounts. So the more
investing and the more money clients are putting to work with greater confidence, then it's a benefit actually for the
entire industry. And I think that's one of the big points that have not been part of the dialog, and I think that's an
important – a really important point.
We need to have more investor confidence. So I think one of the great problems we have with longevity, we have and
human process and importantly, with the inability of so many people investing what I would call properly too much
cash, [ph] albeit (32:59) overemphasis in bonds. If they believe the deal will – rules will give them better transparency,
better certainty that they're being treated right, and they invest more money for the long run, it's better for the country,
it's better for their financial future and it's really very good for the entire industry. And I think that message is totally
lost in the conversation.
Directly to the issue around how this is going to play out, first of all, it's a very lengthy rule, it's going to take quite
some time for everyone to determine how it meets their business model. But I would say the position of BlackRock,
given the breadth of our product platform in both active and index and the investments we've made in technology, and I
really want to underscore technology and risk management, we're having really deep conversations with more of our
distribution partners and helping them work on solutions for them and their clients.
It's still too early to determine the outcome for the DOL rule more broadly, but I think we're as better positioned than
any organization. I do believe it's going to require much greater compliance and risk management. So it's very powerful
for Aladdin platform. We believe it's going to be very powerful for our entire BlackRock Solutions product suite,
including FutureAdvisor. And I think if it means more business in passive, we'll be benefited, if it means more business
in active, we're going to be benefiting too, so I'll just leave it at that. And I actually have a happy General Counsel with
that answer. Sorry, Chris.

Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Good morning. BlackRock has been in the press with the layoffs indicated and also
some of the hiring that you're pursuing and you mentioned in the prepared remarks asset or resource allocation changes.
From a higher level perspective, can you give us a sense of maybe what's getting less and what's getting more in terms
of resources? And in particular, I'm interested in the resource increases you're making to technology which I think you
highlighted in your letter to shareholders. So, both as it relates to how Aladdin is going to evolve, as well as how you're
thinking about expanding other technology related services to clients.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me allow Gary to answer that and then I will give a little color after that.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Great. Ken, thanks so much. So, Ken, I think as you started out, as we stated last quarter, we
are really – we're maintaining our commitment to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance
our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. And obviously we're all mindful of the new
challenging markets, as Larry and both I have said that we need to make tougher and smarter decisions, especially
when it comes to reallocating those investment dollars.
And one thing I want to make very clear is this restructuring was not about cost-cutting, it was about streamlining and
simplifying the organization so that we could use those savings to reinvest more efficiently in those strategic growth
areas. And as mentioned, also to create new stretch opportunities for our strongest people.

It's important to understand that we're really not deemphasizing any particular business, rather I'd say we're looking to
ensure that the foundation of our businesses are really running as efficiently as possible so we can take those
reallocated resources and maximize our investment in the higher growth areas that you mentioned. I'd say there are
probably four or five of those and I'll let Larry and Rob in particular chime in, and many of those have been mentioned
in some of the remarks today. Illiquid alternatives, in particular the real asset platform which includes our infrastructure
business. Factor-based, Larry mentioned over $125 billion there across smart beta and enhanced factor products.
Sustainable investing, where we have [ph] $200 billion (37:11) across exclusionary screens, ESG factors and impact of
that. Obviously, continuing to invest in our iShares business, which we believe continues to have significant runway in
growth from both new users and importantly fixed income, which Larry also mentioned in his comments.
And then you mentioned technology as well, and I think before I'll let Larry comment, the issue there on technology is
it really impacts everything we do across the organization. It impacts how we invest, in particular big data and machine
learning language and the like that Larry mentioned, which is critically important for improvements in our active
platform as well as technology to enhance serving our clients whether it be through Aladdin, Aladdin for Wealth,
FutureAdvisor and the others.
So, I think those are the number of the areas that we're really looking to make sure that we're continuing to see because
we think there is incremental and differentiated growth available to us.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I would just add one more point, because I think Gary said it pretty clearly and
probably said it better than I could that is, I can't underscore enough, how the ecosystem is changing, that's going to
require more of capital market participants, although they are insurance companies or asset managers, they are going to
– the need for better risk management technology is slowly increasing.
The need for better interfacing with clients is only going to be more and more important and I do believe, we have great
solutions at BlackRock to help and assist these organizations for them to raise their bar to be a stronger fiduciary
towards our clients. And so we believe our Aladdin system, our FutureAdvisor's products are going to be, we'll see
even more accelerated growth, if we could handle the growth, but importantly also, as we are – we believe, there is a
great need to develop better information flows for better investment insights. And so these are the areas where we are
really emphasizing where we're growing alongside the areas that Gary discussed.

Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. You had mentioned
twice now focus on smart beta. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on that, maybe take it down a level in terms of
product, geography and even pricing? And then just anecdotally, we've been hearing that some distributors have been
anticipating invoking a revshare ETFs. I was wondering if you could comment on what you might be seeing there as
well.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Sure. I'm going to let Rob talk about it.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Well, when there are – when we have this type of volatility, people are looking to add alpha
in other ways and the smart beta category is one of these ways. We have made some very substantial hires in this area.
We hired the person that wrote the book in this area and this is Dr. Andrew Ang and he is the Head of our factor-based
strategies group and he is going to help us to grow our presence in this group. And he has already had significant
experience with some of our largest clients in the portfolio construction, using a very established model-based
investment skill.
And when we combine what he has done with the analytical power that we have with Aladdin, we think that we're able
to offer some of the best solutions to our clients. So this is a way of breaking down the performance within an active

category to areas that can provide that additional performance. And we currently manage about $125 billion in these
factor-based strategies and within that about $115 billion is smart beta. So we think this is going to grow. BlackRock's
iShares, smart beta ETFs are leading the industry now with about $8.5 billion of net inflows in the first quarter
including about $7 billion into the iShares minimum volatility strategies.
So these are an asset strategies that take advantage of various sectors and factors in the marketplace to add additional
value. So we're adding a lot of people in this category, adding a lot of technology. And we think that it's going to be a
very good way, a successful way for our active managers to add additional alpha.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Bill to add one more point, you asked about geography. We've had dialogs, in
probably every region in the world the demand for information of connectivity and help related to this is beyond our
imagination, it's from Asia to all throughout Europe, Middle East and all throughout the Americas. It is so much on the
minds with our investors as the way of rethinking how they invest. I think this will become a larger component of the
landscape of investing and investors are going to utilize this with separate accounts, we're going to utilize these type of
products through ETFs, but the application, understanding the analysis is really shocking how much people are
interested in studying this and hopefully, the enormity of our meetings is going to translate into future flows.

Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Cyprys>: Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk a little bit about how you see negative rates
around the world impacting asset allocations and also touch upon how you're managing your bond funds and vehicles
or negative rates and the opportunity set for BlackRock here, in particular on the multi-asset front?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, I did write quite a bit about it this week in my annual letter, which is getting
beyond what I thought would've, in terms of commentary by any publications worldwide. Well, negative interest – if
you think about 70% of our clients or more are pension funds, [ph] high risk (44:35), some form of retirement and
insurance companies. We hear worldwide how negative interest rates or low interest rates have been impactful and how
they are actually harming their objectives of attaining an asset base to meet their liability needs.
In fact last week, we were with one of the largest New York state funds, U.S. state funds, not New York state fund, one
of the largest U.S. state funds that happen to be in New York City, for a meeting we had and they were in the top
deciles of performance last year and because of lower negative interest rates than their discounting rate they actually
deteriorated their asset and liability gap.
We're hearing this worldwide. We're hearing from savers worldwide they're not going to meet the needs of building
their pool of savings to meet the needs of retirement. We're hearing from insurance companies that they're going to
have a really hard time meeting their liabilities. And so what has – so they're looking for more advice. Importantly,
what we saw especially in the first six weeks of the year when you had major selling pressure in many components of
the world, we saw huge insurance company interest in buying. We saw widening of spreads.
We talk about infrastructure. If we could find large opportunities for infrastructure globally, we have the demand. So
clients are looking for more opportunities. They're looking to invest in different types of products. I believe our
platform is giving us more connectivity with our clients. And I do believe as my shareholder letter stated, I believe low
and negative interest rates have served a great purpose in the short run, but I don't believe low and negative interest
rates was supposed to be a permanent feature of the investment landscape.
We are now entering the eighth year, and I believe if we're going to have a stronger more robust economy and the IMF
has lowered their forecast even more, right, I think the fifth time in a row. We are going to need policy responses by
governments and I think, the dependency on Central Bank behavior is one of the problems that we have in the world
and we need policy response by governments related to fiscal policy.

Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Brennan. You're welcome.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: So just wanted to touch base quickly on how much momentum you guys are
seeing in some of the structural changes that you all have spoken in the past about as far as bond ETFs and allowing
owners to treat them, not just as equity, but rather as fixed income. Are you guys seeing any momentum there, are you
getting in roads not only from the customer base, but potential regulatory, getting over potential regulatory hurdles,
what's the outlook there?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So this is probably the largest growth area that we are experiencing right now and what we
expect to experience going forward, it's actually quite incredible the amount of cash that's sitting in banks today,
earning zero. And that money has typically banished in the fixed income market. And in order to have access to fixed
income, our clients are using more and more ETFs because of all the features that they see which is the liquidity, the
low cost of tax efficiency and it's just easier access and this is where the money is going to flow first and most people
have more of their money in fixed income than they do in equities anyway.
So this has been the growth in the first quarter. We are set by having a wide variety of types of fixed income ETFs that
they can invest in. And we do see a lot more secondary trading that's going on in these, but we're seeing investment
grade and high yield, corporate bond ETFs, assets under management grow from about $5 billion to $165 billion and
that's from 2007 to 2015 and this is going to be a very strategic growth area for us. And as Larry cited in his opening,
we saw a record $27 billion of net inflows into the fixed income ETFs in the first quarter.
So this is really I think the big growth area. We have a very long-term history of BlackRock in fixed income and we are
using that historical background, the technology that we've built to even enhance our reputation more in this business.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I would just add one more thing. As the ecosystem of bond and secondary bond
liquidity continues to be changing and we're seeing periods of more illiquidity, the utilization of ETFs as a mechanism
to find liquidity and to have the ability to navigate the factors that impact the valuations of fixed income, whether that's
duration or convexity or credit and navigation with the utilization of ETFs is going to – it enhances the opportunities
for returns. And so we believe, as I said in my prepared remarks, the utilization, the implementation of fixed income as
a – fixed income ETFs as a component of the fixed income strategies that clients are employing are going to be larger
and larger in the coming years.

Your next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Good morning, Larry. So just on the back of the BRS FutureAdvisor win this week, I'm
just wondering if you can help us think about the underlying economics for the business-to-business robo-advisor
platform and then also think about what type of products they'll be using in this platform.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I will let Gary answer that then I'll do the color coordinator.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So there is a variety of different drivers of momentum behind this, Craig. We talked about
technology having an increasingly significant impact on the retail space. And obviously, we are enhancing our
technology for our retail clients. FutureAdvisor is just one where we're seeing the digital – [ph] this is not in (52:12) the
digital end, but we're also using and leveraging Aladdin to bring portfolio construction and risk analytics tools to
financial advisors as well as private bankers. And we're doing that with a number of different areas of growth, whether

it be Aladdin portfolio [indiscernible] [ph] forward (52:30) portfolio construction services or Aladdin for Wealth
importantly. And we are streamlining our sales processes with technology and to enhance yielding greater efficiency
and effectiveness through doing that.
FutureAdvisor, in particular, which as you know operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen
relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high quality technology enabled advice. And most
importantly, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform or Aladdin risk analytics or our proprietary retirement
technology and obviously our longstanding experience as enterprise technology partners to other financial institutions. I
think that is probably the key differentiating factor for us at the moment because what we're noticing, whether it's the
commercial arrangement announced this week or some others that frankly we have signed, but haven't probably
announced – this looks like a very long long-term and complicated implementation that frankly is exactly what we've
been doing with Aladdin over the last couple of decades.
And so, while there are certain competitors I think who are trying to mimic or follow or in many cases replicate the
type of strategy that we're doing here, the real difference is that we've been involved in client implementations, very
complex client implementations for a significant period of time, and I think that is really going to be the differentiating
factor.
As it relates to the economics, the economics on these things are frankly very much customized in some respects. There
are platform fees, there are implementation fees, in some cases there are minimum fees, there will be underlying
management fees to the extent that the client chooses to either use our own models or populate those models with
iShares. But importantly, we're looking to customize as much as we can to meet our intermediary partners' objectives.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: So we've signed, which we haven't announced [ph] all of them (54:38), we signed four
contracts already, but we are in dialog with many more, without citing the number, many more institutions are
interested. I think Gary, Craig, said it very clearly, think of this as an Aladdin implementation, margins are quite low
for the first – during the implementation stage. In some cases, there is more expenses than revenues in the early years,
early year, and as it's been implemented, then – and the utilization and then we have all the other service fees, it starts
throwing off and generating, depending on the utilization, we hope large fee increases.
But more importantly, we also believe having this linkage creates a deeper connection with our clients and our
distribution partners. So it's not just the singularity of having more products through these types of channels, but it is
also deeper, more consistent connection with these clients. And so this is one of the reasons why we saw earlier than
anyone related to the connectivity that digital advice can give for us with our distribution partners.
And so we're very excited about it. I would also say that it's the desire, the demand, the interest, the request for
presentations is far greater than we ever imagined.

Your last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Larry, just maybe if we can zero in on the defined
contribution business. You have I think about a 9% plus market share of that and organic growth was very strong for
you last year with a 6% pace. Maybe if you can elaborate on whether you think the Department of Labor rules
longer-term will accelerate the shift to DCIO and how you think behaviors will change among plan sponsors and how
you're positioned in attacking that.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, first of all, we are just interpreting what the DOL says related to DC and I'm
going to let Rob answer it, but more importantly, it looks to us that you're not going to see rollovers as fast and people
are going to stay within their defined contribution plan longer. So this an initial view, we're studying this more and
more, but obviously as you suggested DC is a very important component of where we are, and we believe we're well
positioned, but I'll let Rob.

<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yeah. I think, Larry said it here, I mean the big issue with DC and you know that we're the
number one DCIO player in the industry, we have about $639 billion in assets under management. And what we're
seeing is the increasing need to our open architecture or seeing the increasing need for indexed target date, and also
high performing active strategies, and these are really big trends that are driving the market share changes in the DC
space. And that's why we've been building that infrastructure to try to meet this. And now, once we got a better view of
the changes that are going to happen with the DOL and interpret these, I think that it really plays into that infrastructure
very, very well. But how soon the movement of assets takes place is something that we're still trying to figure out
[indiscernible] (58:36).
Laurence Douglas Fink
So let me thank all of you for joining us this morning, and for your continued interest in BlackRock. I think our first
quarter result once again highlights the investments we made to enhance and differentiate BlackRock's diverse global
platform. We're continuing to take a long-term view, we're trying to stay ahead of our clients' needs, we're trying to stay
ahead of our competition, we're trying to navigate these near-term developments in the financial economic landscape,
but we're doing this on behalf of our clients to making sure that we are providing them with the service that they
require from us.
A more volatile world plays to our advantage that clients are looking for BlackRock by providing more information, by
helping them navigate the complexities that we're living in a world of low and negative interest rates, and we're trying
to help them navigate the balance between investing in more illiquid products to achieve the yields and the returns that
they need and the balance of how to build a better financial future for all our clients. I think we have done that in the
first quarter and we're doing that again in the second quarter. And I look forward to seeing and hearing from all of you
at the end of the second quarter. Have a good April, May, June.
