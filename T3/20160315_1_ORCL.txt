MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Oracle's third quarter 2016 earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call.

Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. Then I'll review guidance for Q4 and I'll provide
some color even on Q1, and then I'll turn the call to Larry and Mark for their comments.
As you can imagine, we are pleased with this quarter. Total revenue was inside my guidance, driven by the fantastic
performance of our SaaS/PaaS business, which was well beyond the high end of my guidance. Earnings per share was
$0.01 above the high end of my guidance, even with the currency headwinds being $0.01 worse than expected. Q3
currency headwinds were largely as expected, around 4% in most categories, including total revenue. But as I just said,
the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.01 worse than expected at $0.04 instead of the $0.03 I guided to. We
will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls so we can have some measure of consistency
across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business.
I'm going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business, where we continued to see excellent momentum. Bookings grew
77% this quarter, and that's on top of the 129% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $585 million, up
60% from last year. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 21%, with PaaS up more than 150% sequentially and
our data-as-a-service business continuing to take off.
Our sustained SaaS/PaaS bookings growth is now translating into significant acceleration of our SaaS/PaaS revenue
growth. And in Q4, we could see double-digit sequential revenue growth again.
You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred
revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.1 billion and was up 96% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS
billings grew 32% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website so you can see the
detail.
The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, which was up 2% to $152 million.
While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect infrastructure-as-a-service revenue growth
will be more moderate for now, as it is currently dominated by our hosting business. Total cloud revenues, which is
SaaS and PaaS revenue as well as infrastructure-as-a-service revenue, was $737 million, up 43% from last year.
As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The
Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 51%, up from 43% last quarter. And we will see further improvement in Q4,
and from there we will be targeting 80% over time.
On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license updates and product support, was
unchanged at $6.3 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year.
Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high levels. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down
from last year, as customers continued to direct new spend to Oracle cloud services. Over this fiscal year, I expect
constant currency on-premise software revenue will be positive, comprised of continued growth in software support
that offsets declines in new software license.
Finally, total hardware revenue was down 8%, which included hardware products revenue of $604 million and
hardware support revenue of $531 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 1% at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating
income was $3.8 billion, and the operating margin was 42%. I continue to believe, assuming no more wild currency
swings, that this fiscal year, that's FY 2016, the one we're in, will turn out to have been the trough year for operating
income.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, and the GAAP tax rate was 21.6%, as we saw some catch-up
benefits largely related to the U.S. R&D tax credit.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 in USD, and GAAP EPS was $0.50 in USD. As I mentioned before, had the dollar not
strengthened, the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.04 higher.
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.1 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $368
million, with just a bit over 15% being cloud-related. And I expect that cloud-related CapEx for the full year will be

dramatically lower than last year, as we utilize the investments that have been made. Now the non-cloud CapEx was
dominated by real estate, led by the Austin, Texas campus we are building to support our cloud sales organization as
well as moving and consolidating teams and other lines of business currently in other locations.
Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.5 billion. We now have nearly $51 billion in cash and marketable
securities. Net of debt, our cash position is nearly $11 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.9 billion,
up 11% in constant currency.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly 61 million shares for a total of $2.2 billion. And over the last four years, we have
reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share
repurchases by $10 billion. The board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months,
share repurchases have totaled $10.5 billion and we have paid out $2.6 billion in dividends, for a total that is nearly
120% of our free cash flow.
Now before I turn the guidance, as many of you know, the move to cloud is a generational shift in technology that is
the biggest and most important opportunity in our company's history. We embarked on this transformation over 10
years ago when we began rewriting all of our software to enable our customers to leverage our solutions as cloud
solutions. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry, with more than 11,000 of our
customers around the world already using these cloud services to help run their business.
We ourselves have been going through an operational transformation, which I'll actually be sharing more of in our
in-house town hall that we'll be having for our own employees later today. But we are really aiming to be the easiest
company in the business to do business with, and you're going to see some very good positive changes that we think
our customers will love.
Now as I said, we're not quite at the end of the beginning, as we're actively working to transform our entire business,
but I think you're going to see the results. And we are far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show
our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time leading to very solid EPS growth.
We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition, and clearly customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. My
guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.
Now to the guidance. I'm going to give you the guidance for Q4 and then some preliminary comments for Q1. All of
my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange
rates, but I'm going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are
right now, we expect to see currency headwind of about 2% on revenue and about $0.02 on EPS.
So on to the guidance. For Q4, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 57% to 61%. Cloud IaaS revenue is
expected to grow negative 1% to positive 3%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 1%
and 2%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from negative 2% to positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant
currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.82 and $0.85, up from $0.78 last Q4, depending on the mix of the
revenues and tax rates.
Looking further out for Q1, SaaS and PaaS revenue growth should be higher than the 59% midpoint of my Q4
guidance. SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to be higher than Q4 gross margins. Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth
should be very solid. I will revisit Q1 with you as part of the Q4 earnings call in June.
With that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Safra, and hi, everybody. Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue
than any other company in the world, including salesforce.com. We're growing much faster than salesforce.com, more
than twice as fast, because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS markets than they do.

We compete directly with salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS customer experience market, including sales,
service, and market. But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets where salesforce.com does not compete at all,
such as ERP and HCM. It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud, including
Fusion financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing, and much, much more.
That long effort is now paying off. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the enterprise cloud ERP market.
We have more than 10 times the number of customers then Workday – I should say we have more than 10 times the
number of ERP customers than Workday. And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM. Salesforce.com
is missing all of that ERP market opportunity.
The breadth of our ERP, HCM, and CRM SaaS product portfolio combined with the technical superiority of our
underlying SaaS cloud services should enable us to sustain our rapid cloud growth for a long period of time. And that in
turn should make it easy for Oracle to pass salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS cloud company in the
world.
With that, I'll pass it on to Mark.
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks, Larry. First, I apologize for my voice today. I'm going to do my best to get some information out to you, even
with my voice as it is.
SaaS/PaaS deferred revenue up 96% that Safra mentioned is growing three times the rate of Salesforce and twice the
rate of Workday. We booked $310 million in ARR in the quarter, 77% CE growth in Q3, up sequentially from 75%.
Our PaaS bookings were $106 million in USD.
Our pipeline is huge in SaaS/PaaS. We are on track for $1.5 billion of ARR bookings.
Customer counts, SaaS, we had 942 new SaaS customers in the quarter. Over half were Fusion wins. We had 783
customer expansions in the quarter, an all-time high. Our installed base of SaaS customers is now 11,000. CX, we had
465 customer wins in Q3, more than 500 extensions; HCM, 213 new customers in Q3. Over the past two years, we
have nearly doubled the number of customers of Workday, and we are seeing lots of Workday defections.
In ERP, 334 customers in Q3; 175 did not have Oracle on-prem apps before they bought. We are clearly taking share.
Our installed base is now well over 1,800 customers.
Together, Fusion HCM and ERP had more go-lives in the last six quarters then Workday's lifetime total. And I would
like to use the word in the competition for ERP customers, between us and Workday, it is a slaughter. Go-lives in the
quarter, we are closing in on 1,500 customers that are now live on Fusion. Our Q3 was our best go-live quarter ever.
In PaaS, we had 1,143 new PaaS customers. Our installed base now has nearly 5,000 customers. While that's a big
number from starting from zero, it's still an enormous opportunity with 310,000 on-prem database customers. This
business is going to be extremely large for us.
Our renewals continue to improve. Our renewal rates were higher than previous year.
Now I'm going to give you a few customer wins so you have some context of names and brands in the quarter that
committed to our solutions. In Fusion HCM cloud, I'm going to read off some names: Acosta, Adventist Health, Blue
Shield of California, Cooperative Group, Generali, RealNetworks, Sisters of Charity Health System, SUPERVALU,
Technip, Vanderbilt University. Yum! Brands.
ERP: Adventist Health, American Institute of Physics, Bluebird Bio, Boston Market, Culinary Institute of America, Cal
State University, Dresser-Rand, Harvard Medical Facility, Japan Airlines, Orange in France, SUPERVALU,
Scholastic, SunEdison, Vanderbilt University, the University of Kansas, Velcro, Yum! Brands.

Now I only named those for you and you heard many names mentioned multiple times, and I did that on purpose so
you understand some of the cross-pillar opportunities that exist as we go forward that when we see the connection rate
between – we see the connection rate between ERP and HCM, sales cloud and marketing cloud, which we think are
amazing opportunities going forward. As Larry described, we are the only one in the market with the breadth of
portfolio that we have today.
With that, we'll take your questions.
Kenneth Bond
Operator, you can begin the Q&A portion, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great, thank you, guys, for taking my question. Mark, I was wondering if you could share with
us your new cloud ARR goal of $1.5 billion that you have for this current fiscal year. I believe you're at close to $800
million now, which would mean obviously you need to sell about $700 million or sign about $700 million in Q4.
Notwithstanding you just gave us a lot of good data points on customer wins in the quarter, but can you give us, walk
us through what gives you confidence in obtaining that number?
And then my follow-up would just be to that, any early thoughts on what ARR could look like next year. Could it be
above the $1.5 billion for this year? Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure. First, I feel, Heather, no different than I did maybe a year and a half or so ago when we
talked about the leading indicators for our growth in SaaS/PaaS, and it starts with our pipeline. The fact that we have –
our pipeline going into Q4 is the biggest we have ever had. As I said in my prepared comments, I think I used the term
huge. It's a big pipeline. Second for us is our ability to convert that and our conversion rate. And what you really have
to track is the relative growth rates in each quarter and obviously our expectation that we'll have a strong Q4.
As I said before and I'm going to reiterate again, we're going to do nothing but just get better and better at this business.
We have obviously a large quantity of people on the sales force. We staffed our sales force two or three years ago. We
have trained them. We've now trained them multiple times. We now have references, not only deals that we have
closed, but as I mentioned, our go-lives are now scaled out. And so the ability for us now with the breadth of references
and the fact, as I mentioned, that we sell across multiple pillars all give us we just think a tremendous opportunity. So
we're very, very encouraged.
To next year, I'm not going to give you next year guidance other than to your point of should it be higher, I think the
answer is absolutely yes.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Thank you very much.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?

And your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Hey, guys, and perhaps Safra in particular, thanks for taking the question. This is a follow-up
really in some ways with what Heather was talking about the bookings side but maybe on the revenue side. Given that
SaaS and PaaS bookings have been so strong in 2016, any early thoughts on what SaaS/PaaS revenue growth could be
like in 2017, and could be it higher than it was in 2016?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I think what you're obviously seeing – I've already given you a little bit of guidance on Q4
SaaS and PaaS revenue and telling you that Q1 will be even higher. I think that this is – we are in an extremely virtuous
cycle with the business now because success breeds even more success. We have so many customers live. We have so
much interest from our customer base and from prospects, et cetera, that as we deliver on our orders that we already
have and get even more orders, we're very, very upbeat on the growth rate.
Additionally, I think as we work through some of our metered purchases over the years, those are all going to be
turning into revenue as utilization continues to go up. So we have both the subscription business, which just continues
to grow, but we also are working our way through metered bookings, which turn into revenue when they're utilized. So
we're very, very upbeat about our position in the cycle.
<Q - Michael Turits>: I just have a follow-up.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: By the way, metered revenue was a highlight in the quarter for us. The usage, I guess I should
say the incline in usage was even higher than what we've modeled. It was very encouraging.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Did you ask a two-part question, or was that it? Did I cover it?
<Q - Michael Turits>: That was half of the two parts. The other half of it would be on the margin side. On cloud, I
think you said you were still working toward 80% gross margin.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Turits>: You talked about – so is that really what's contributing to this being the trough year for EBIT
on a dollar basis, and what kind of dynamic do we see going forward?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: It's really everything coming together. So revenue is going up. Spending, as you could tell, our
in-the-cloud capital expenditure is really, really tailed off, and we are using all of that infrastructure that we put in. So
when you're not spending more but your revenues are coming in at these kind of levels, and the whole business also, we
also have a situation where the revenue for the whole company is starting to go up, then operating income is going to
improve. But our SaaS and PaaS margins are on their way up. They have been really flying high, as we said they
would, over the last two quarters. And we expect that to continue as revenue continues to go up and expenses do not go
up as much. And that's what going to happen and it's happening.
<Q - Michael Turits>: Great, Safra. Thanks very much.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hi. This is [indiscernible] (26:18), Safra. You said back in September that op income would
trough this year, and six months later you seem to be delivering, so congratulations on making that commitment real.

Larry, a question for you on the database side. When you look at today the market landscape, there is AWS that wants
to go after your business. Microsoft just announced SQL Server running on Linux, and everybody seems to be offering
trade-up programs, swapping out your Oracle license for their license. Why are they doing this, Larry? Is it just because
they feel that the industry views Oracle as this big giant that is less flexible with pricing? Is that why the industry feels
like they need to take you guys on? I just wanted to see the comparative there when you – to see how you look at this
and how do you – how should we be thinking of Oracle's presence in the database market a few years from now given
these threats.
I guess if there's a follow-up, Safra, if there's a database-as-a-service model transition happening how worried are you
or not that licenses and databases could continue to move on the cloud like the Adobe RS model? That's it for me,
thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Our PaaS business grew at 150% this past quarter. So our customer – it's interesting that
Microsoft is now offering SQL Server on Linux, but people want Oracle in the cloud. People have a huge investment in
Oracle products. People are coming after us because we are by far the market leader in database. If you're in the
database business, the only one you can come after is us. So of course, Amazon if they're going to be in the database
business is coming after us. And of course, if Microsoft wants to be bigger in the database business, they have to come
after us. We're the biggest player.
We see our customers with literally of millions of applications and millions of users on those applications built on top
of the Oracle database wanting to move those applications into the cloud, and we do that very well. Our PaaS service is
even easier to use and better than Oracle is on-premise. So we see the next generation of our database business
predominantly in the cloud, though we'll still sell an awful lot of that software on-premise.
The beauty of what we offer is the same exact database experience on-premise and in the cloud and the ability for our
customers to move a workload from on-premise into the cloud and move data from on-premise into the cloud with a
push of a button. That's something that Microsoft can't offer. We have a huge installed base that wants to migrate to the
cloud but still wants to have an on-premise infrastructure. And we provide graceful compatibility and co-existence with
what's in your data center and what's in the cloud as you begin that decade-long migration to the cloud.
We've made a bunch of – sorry for the long answer – we've made a bunch of enhancements to our database, including
multi-tenancy in memory, a lot of advanced security to make it easier and safer to go to the cloud. We think that gives
us a huge competitive advantage and that our customers aren't going to leave us. Quite the contrary, our customers are
going to move a lot of what they have to the Oracle cloud.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: And the one for Safra, please, on the model transition and databases? Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: The way I guess you should think about it is we would be thrilled if every one of our Oracle
database customers came over to our cloud instead of running it on-premise. That would be fabulous. Now do we
expect many of them? Many of them clearly aren't doing it, but we have such an enormous installed base that some of
them will put new applications in the cloud or different test and development in the cloud or a combination or a hybrid,
but we would be delighted.
You should think about it as if our customers move to the cloud, that means that they not only of course pay us for the
software, but we also offer them a service where we own the hardware and we manage and we do all the labor. And so
even though they end up paying us more than they would have historically just for a support license, a support fee, but
they themselves, our customers, end up spending a lot less in total because of the massive economies of scale we have
in running the Oracle database for them that they would not have on their own. So it would be delightful if they'd all
move, and some are moving and many are moving, which is wonderful. But I think this will take quite a long time. And
some will stay on-premise indefinitely, and that's entirely their choice.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Thank you very much. Let me add one more thing, which is a lot of people over the years
have come after us in database. The problem is if you want to move to SAP HANA, you have to rewrite your
application. If you want to move to the Amazon database, and they have a couple, you have to rewrite your application.

That is just a huge barrier for our customers. Our customers want to run their existing applications faster and more
securely in the cloud. They want to make an easy transition. We're very comfortable that we can defend our leading
position in the database market.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Thank you, Larry. Next question, please?

Your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. I know there are a lot of moving parts at this point in your model, and I'd like to ask a
two-part question on each side of it, and I think these both go to Mark. First of all, license was a little shy of what the
Street was looking for. I realize that, Safra, you don't guide license, but the cloud was a lot stronger. So is it fair to
assume that cannibalization is happening at a more aggressive rate than when Mark last gave us some numbers on it? I
think, Mark, at Oracle OpenWorld, you said that I think at that point 0.8% of the maintenance for SaaS, just SaaS, that
transition to cloud.
And then on the cloud side, I believe you're seeing some of your first renewals of deals that were likely signed early on
amid significant promotions at attractive rates. So I think the consensus is, or at least my assumption would be that
those renewal rates would be pretty low. But I think you just said that you're seeing good renewal rates, even better
than you had seen. So I was wondering if you can comment on that, so one, cannibalization, and second, cloud
renewals.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. So first on the renewal rate, what I said in my comments were renewal rates were up year
over year. They were up – I think I made the statement last quarter that they were up almost 500 basis points, so that
would just give you some idea of our year-to-year improvement in renewals.
John, I would tell you that as good as our renewal rates are, they will get materially better. So the first sets of Fusion
HCM, Fusion ERP, those numbers, while you're right, they are all promotions, they are not yet to a renewal stage. So
our sticky, think of it as our stickiest applications, which will drive very, very, very high renewal rates, are not yet
baked into the now very high and improving renewal numbers that we've got. So that's your second question.
To your first question, listen, to your point, we're making that trade every day. If we can trade license for cloud, that's
what we're doing. And so to your point, yes, you saw more momentum in the cloud business then probably you have
modeled. And we look at that as great, and so that's what we're continuing to focus on. It's continuing to drive
movement to the cloud. And if we do, we get as we model this out again at OpenWorld, that means more money for us,
more revenue for us long run. So when we can get a booking, a choice of a booking, I think it's good to just go through
this one more time. If we get a dollar of booking in cloud and a dollar of booking in license, and next year we get the
support on the license, the next year that dollar we get as a booking, we get another dollar of revenue. So the fact that
you see those dollars shift, that is an absolute good thing for us, John.
<Q - John DiFucci>: But, Mark, are you seeing more people that are on existing maintenance move to the cloud,
existing customer versus new workloads?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Let's be clear. Safra said that in her prepared comments that our support renewal rates were as
high as ever. So this really is the point that we talked about earlier, but let's say it again. When people are thinking
about dev-test as an example, there is a movement of dev-test to the cloud, particularly dev-test of new applications.
Am I going to now get a new license for dev-test for that new application, or am I going to do it in the cloud? And the
opportunity to now do it in the cloud is where you're seeing a lot of those new jobs go, and that's certainly to our
benefit.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thanks, John.

Your next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a really strong quarter. A lot of focus has obviously been on
the database side of the house so far. I wanted to focus in on the SaaS side of the cloud. Mark, you rattled off some
pretty impressive customer win counts and also just names, particularly on the HCM and the ERP side. And if you just
look at the ERP/EPM customer win rate, it was a huge quarter it looked like year over year. If you look into some of
your competitors' call, they've talked about displacements of Fusion and some of your cloud applications, which seems
obviously to go against what our checks are saying and what these numbers say. So hopefully you can clear the air
here. What are you seeing competitively in particularly ERP, HCM, and the cloud?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I don't know on ERP. I could keep giving you these counts. I've heard the Workday guys say
they got 200. This reminds me of when I was originally looking for HANAs many years ago when I couldn't find the
HANAs. I don't know where there are 200 ERPs from Workday, but let me just take their number. We're 10X bigger
than they are.
Now in HCM, I don't know what to tell you. I can give you a few brands. There's Southwestern Energy, they had
Workday and stopped their Workday implementation and used Oracle. Fannie Mae used Workday, no longer does, and
now uses Oracle. Arcadis, they used Workday and they used Workday in the U.S. They went to a global decision for
HR, decided on Oracle and replaced their Workday implementation in the U.S. MoneyGram started off implementing
Workday. It didn't go well, reevaluated it, and now have Oracle HCM cloud as their core HR for their enterprise. Same
thing shows at Molina Healthcare.
One of the first implementations of Workday I think that was in Asia-Pacific was at [indiscernible] (38:28) in Australia.
They now stopped their Workday implementation and removed it and installed Oracle HCM. Genesys, who's a
technology provider here in the Valley, they implemented Workday, stopped, threw it out, and are implementing Oracle
HCM. BrightSource switched to Oracle upon a renewal opportunity for HCM with Workday. So California Physicians,
Safra is giving me the...
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Stop.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Stop. But listen, this is just – I get all this stuff. I hear all this rhetoric, and I'm just trying to give
you, these are real companies that said we're going to stop and we're going to go implement Oracle HCM. And so that's
what I see going into the market, and that's why I continue to read off brand names so we can get away from words and
rhetoric and get down to what's really happening.
So, Phil, the numbers in ERP are what they are. The names in HCM, let's just go – let's go back to customer counts, real
customers. You can do the extrapolation. I know you do of how many customers that they're getting new in the
marketplace versus how many new we're getting in the marketplace. And so again, I like to just let the names and the
numbers speak for themselves. So that's my answer, Phil.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to shift gears a little bit. The market, like the
global macro is where everyone is a little bit nervous, and I'm just looking down at your geographic performance. I see
Asia coming back nicely this quarter and then stable in Europe and in the U.S. Can you just comment a little bit what
you're seeing out there? And I'm sorry, Mark, to stress your voice a little bit longer, but it's probably you. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. I think what you say is right. I think that Asia-Pacific, I don't think we want to call that a
macro or make any macro discussions other than I think our performance in Asia-Pacific is much improved. I think we

took one of our really experienced leaders in the company, and I think he's done a marvelous job in rebuilding our
Asia-Pacific team, and I think it shows in the numbers. So I think our Asia-Pacific performance isn't necessarily a
macro statement. It's a statement about the improvement in our execution in Asia.
I do think that your comments about the stability in the U.S., we've had very strong performance in many of our SaaS
businesses in the United States. Our ERP performance here, our HCM performance here have really been very, very
strong. The same thing would hold true in Europe as well.
I will say that if there's anything I would comment on in the macro that we do see is we do see the issues in Brazil
probably more than anything else. We don't generally make macro comments, but I would say we have a, my opinion,
you all don't happen to be aware of, but we have a marvelous team in Latin America. If you looked over the past
several years. But the amount – this is on my chart of market shares, they have gained market share in virtually every
single category that we compete in virtually every year for the last five years. Their performance in cloud, SaaS/PaaS
has been superb, but we do see what's gone on in Brazil. Save that, I think the rest of your statements are correct,
Raimo.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks very much. Mark, just to follow on a little bit on the geographic question, could you just
talk about cloud momentum outside the U.S. and what the competitive environment is for some of your SaaS/PaaS
products? It would seem that you guys have somewhat of a distribution advantage against some of your competitors
there. I was just curious about the maturity of the markets to accept SaaS and PaaS now, and then just who you're going
up against in deals. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: What was the last thing you said, where we're going up against? Where did you mention?
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Just competition internationally for some of the SaaS/PaaS customers.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think the maturation of the cloud market or, if you will, the acceptance of the cloud market, is
global, and I think we've seen that over the past couple of years. It used to be three or four years ago when I was talking
about cloud in Europe, I would get incredible amounts of resistance to issues around security, data sovereignty, et
cetera. Many of those are beginning to go away. Now certainly some of that has been the fact that we now have built
out over the past couple of years data center infrastructure in now so many locations.
We have an incredible – by the way, I can tell you, Kirk, you realize quickly why you don't want to get into this cloud
business because the barriers to entry are extreme when you want to go global. Many of these customers want to know
their data is in their country, and that's much of the CapEx we invested a couple of years ago that we put in, and that's a
big advantage for us. Most of our competitors don't have that infrastructure deployed around the world that we now do.
To your point, we also have a very scaled distribution capability in all of those countries, and I think you have this
growing acceptance of cloud at both the SaaS and PaaS layer that – I don't have a metric on it. I can just tell you that
the acceptance level of I'm now going to do my dev-test in the cloud, and I'm talking about this happening in Korea, in
Australia, in Brazil, is now a regular conversation on all of our customer bids. So I would say acceptance is at this point
extremely high, but added to the fact that our distribution and our breadth of delivery capability on a local basis, at least
in the SaaS market, is unmatched today.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks a lot, Mark.

Our final question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. For Larry and Mark, just on Platform-as-a-Service. It's early days, but you're showing
really good momentum here. Could you just maybe give us a sense of some of the next milestones you'd like to hit here
over the short term with PaaS? And, Mark, you made a comment about 5,000 of the 310,000 database customers are
running PaaS. I would assume that your belief is that all of those database customers are legitimate candidates to be
running PaaS over time. So maybe walk through the dynamics there.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Let me go first, and then I'll let Larry follow up. First, as I said at OpenWorld and I'll reiterate
again, if you look at the IT market, the IT market is 30% dev-test. And I actually believe all of that dev-test over the
course of the next several years will move to the cloud. I think people will be looking for the most advanced tools, the
most modern tools, the most advanced capabilities, and I think that's us. Our ability to deliver Java, to deliver Database
12c, to deliver all of the capabilities that we can today makes the PaaS market an exciting market that's, frankly, if you
look at numbers, more exciting and bigger in scale and opportunity than even the SaaS market, and you know how well
we're doing in the SaaS market.
So I think – I will not give you milestones, Brent, today. As I committed to you and I'll stick to it, I want to wait until
we get a full year under our belt here. And at OpenWorld, the next financial analyst meeting, I'll go into the same sort
of modeling that we did for SaaS. But make no mistake about it, we're extremely excited about the scale of the
opportunity. The pipeline is huge, and I think you're going to see this dev-test thing – I almost think it's entirely as a
segment going to move to the cloud, and there's nobody with a better stack of capabilities than Oracle has today. I'll let
Larry follow up.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay, I'm sorry. I dropped off for one second. Could you repeat the question?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: The question was about the PaaS market and about the ability for it to be a very attractive
market long run for Oracle.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Definitely we expect that, just like the majority of our applications businesses, well on its
way to moving towards the cloud. That's the majority of our database business to move to the cloud. And along with
that, that should drag a lot of infrastructure business, where infrastructure-as-a-service, compute-as-a-service will run
the application, really can run any application on top of our database, which will be delivered via platform-as-a-service.
So we are just entering the pure infrastructure-as-a-service market, which opens up another huge PaaS play for us.
So you really can think there are two markets. There's the SaaS/PaaS market which we're in now, where people are
running our applications on top of our database. And then there is, if you will, the infrastructure-as-a-service PaaS
market, where they're running virtually any custom application they wrote on top of our database platform-as-a-service.
Those are both enormous markets, and we're really strongly in the first competing with people like Workday and
salesforce.com. You will see us, and fortunately our database customers are simply moving over.
You'll see a bunch more database customers moving over when they compare our platform-as-a-service with our
compute, which allows them to run virtually any application in our cloud much more efficiently, much more securely
than anyplace else. And there, our big competitor will be the Saleforces and the Workdays. The big competitor will be
Amazon.com. But we're going to play – we're playing in both of those markets. And PaaS will grow, driven by SaaS,
and PaaS will also grow, driven by infrastructure-as-a-service, huge opportunities.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay.
