President of Coca-Cola North America; and Irial Finan, Executive Vice President and President of Bottling
Investments, will also be available for our Q&A session.
Now, I will turn the call over to Muhtar.
Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First, apologies for the state of my voice, I have a cold, so please bear
with me.
I'm going to start with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then review the progress we've made
against our five strategic actions we laid out last October to reignite growth. Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the
remainder of the year before I turn the call over to Kathy to take you through more details on the financial results.
Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the
company. We delivered promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility in
many regions around the world and the productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year.
For those of you following our webcast, you can see our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance
was largely driven by the strength of our global brand portfolio and the strong distribution capabilities of our bottling
partners, as evidenced by our continued global value share gains in NARTD, sparkling beverages, as well as still
beverages in the quarter. While certain markets face significant currency devaluation, economic slowdown or political
unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top-line and
bottom-line, due to initial improvements in the underlying business, the timing of Easter, and six extra days in our
fiscal quarter.
Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on an organic basis, driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price/mix
globally. While it's still early in the year, we are pleased with the 3% global price/mix and the 2% price/mix in North
America, both ahead of full-year 2014 results. This price/mix is the result of disciplined implementation of our
price/pack channel strategies, which is a key and consistent portion of our long-term approach to creating value for
consumers, customers, bottlers, and ourselves.
Productivity initiatives, benign commodity costs and favorable product mix in key markets drove gross and operating
margin improvement. And we continue to invest substantially behind advertising, leading to double digit increase in
marketing spend. The bottom-line result was double digit growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax.
Now, turning to the five strategic actions we laid out for this year, one of our key strategic initiatives is making
disciplined brand and growth investments. As mentioned earlier, we increased our media investments double digits in
the quarter as we work towards fully-funded brand plans in markets around the world, while, at the same time,
enhancing the quality of our advertising. Great example of this is the new Coca-Cola marketing campaign during the
Chinese New Year, which helped our China business grow brand Coca-Cola volume 9%, despite slowing economic
conditions.

As we said previously, media investments take about 12 to 24 months to realize their full value. So while we are seeing
initial positive results, we're even more encouraged by the knowledge that it is still early in the process and we have
tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top-line growth.
We remain resolutely focused on driving cost out of the business and embedding a culture of productivity into our
DNA, which is enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in
incorporating zero-based work processes into all phases of our annual planning cycles. We remain on track across all
spend areas to deliver more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019.
The difficult, but necessary, changes made during the end of 2014 are now accounted for in our budgets and tied to our
objectives and goals. The initial implementation of our new operating model is on track. And the previously-announced
head count reductions associated with this change are well underway.
We're continuing to work through the rewiring of business processes within the entire organization. So, for example,
we've eliminated a layer in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies and linked our corporate
center directly to our business units. In R&D, this means connecting our corporate R&D efforts directly to our global
development centers and linking both of these to service our business across business units across the world. So this
allows us to scale our efforts in innovation, share new developments faster, and accelerate development of new
products.
In addition, we're also rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency
and effectiveness. This will allow us to better leverage learnings from similar markets, regardless of the geographic
location, and improve the quality of our advertising through our networked marketing model. A great example of this is
how we are strategically leveraging the 100th anniversary of our contour Coca-Cola bottle to drive our business
forward through integrating marketing, commercial, and innovation under one umbrella to reach approximately 140
markets.
This campaign centers on the magic of drinking a Coke with the emphasis on the experience as much as the bottle.
And, as such, it's focused on driving profitable immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And as
part of this campaign, our system is investing in glass bottles all around the world, while introducing the next
generation contour PET bottle and expanding the supply of our premium aluminum bottles in key developed markets.
Importantly, this is not simply a global campaign. Rather, it's a new way of networked marketing that has led to the
creation of 20 marketing assets that markets can use, leverage, in a more cost-effective modular manner. Some of our
markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year, while others quarter-by-quarter. As a result, we have
significantly been able to reduce our production and development costs per gross rating point, allowing more dollars to
be focused against the consumer.
We're seeing initial positive results for the markets that have already launched the campaign, such as South Africa,
Australia, and Latin Center. And across the entire company, our deeper market segmentation strategy is also starting to
yield early results. Two examples are North America and India here. In North America, we're focused on generating
revenue through a greater reliance on price realization.
Increased media investments, coupled with our segmented price/pack strategies, drove revenue growth in our sparkling
portfolio through a strong 3% price/mix and a 1% increase in transactions. Simply put, more consumers are enjoying
our products more often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages, including our iconic contour bottle.
Whereas in India, where our revenue growth strategies focus on expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers,
we drove double-digit unit case volume growth in both our sparkling, as well as still portfolio.
Turning to our focus on our core business model, we continue to make progress on our North America re-franchising
efforts in the quarter. First, we remain on track with our previously-announced territory transfers to existing partners.
During the quarter, we transitioned four territories to Coca-Cola Consolidated and are on track to transfer additional
territories in Kentucky and Tennessee to Consolidated and [ph] Coca-Cola current (12:25) this year.

We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously-announced transactions with new entrants into our bottling
network. So territory transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in Chicago are slated to close
in the second quarter. Together, the territories pending to transition to these two new partners will represent
approximately 5% of U.S. bottle/can volume.
Finally, just this morning, we announced the signing of new Letters of Intent with existing bottling partners for
territories covering more than 5% of bottle/can volume. In aggregate, territories transitioned to-date and those covered
by definitive agreements or Letters of Intent, represent a little over 15% of total U.S. bottle/can volume. Further, as we
continue to transition territories, we're getting better and faster, which is why we are confident that our
previously-stated timeline to have two-thirds of bottle/can volume distributed by our independent bottling partners by
2017 is very much on track.
Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia in early April. I was in
Jakarta earlier this year with the Indonesian bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help us capture
the growth opportunity in one of the largest and most dynamic countries in the world, as we enable our system to be
even more responsive to consumer and customer needs.
So we are off to a solid start in 2015. And we are on track to deliver against our full-year currency neutral EPS
expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made, and we remain
confident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable shareholder value. However, there is still much
work ahead of us. We continue to expect that the benefits from the announced initiatives will take time to fully
materialize.
Further, we're operating in a very challenging environment. The cautious recovery in the U.S. is offset by a relatively
sluggish expansion in Europe and Japan, as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia, as well
as China, slowing down. Therefore, we remain cautious in our outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can
control and execute against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better-positioned to capture growth in the
global nonalcoholic beverage industry.
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed
look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook of our business for 2015.
Kathy N. Waller
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and then
our outlook for 2015, as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and
encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing continues, as we focus on driving revenue in the
marketplace and our reinvestment in brand Coca-Cola is starting to yield results.
Focusing on the quarter, organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in concentrate shipments and three points of
positive price/mix. The concentrate shipment growth benefited from the six extra days in the period. These extra days
will reverse in the fourth quarter, so you will see a corresponding impact in that period. After adjusting for the six extra
days in this quarter, concentrate shipments lagged unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in our
international markets. For the full year, we expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases.
Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our
markets. In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix, as markets where shipments lagged recorded unit
cases were in lower revenue per CSD markets.
As we move through the year, I would like to remind you of a couple of points. First, we move again to cycle better
underlying pricing. And second, as we catch up from the timing of shipments in international markets, we will see
negative pressure from geographic mix at the consolidated levels. Therefore, while we remain resolutely focused on
driving revenue in our markets, we do expect price/mix to moderate from the current level.

Our comparable gross margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This increase was driven
primarily by better margins in North America, due to positive pricing and business mix, as well as moderately lower
commodity costs. As you think about the remainder of the year, we would also expect many of these drivers to
moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons. Therefore, our full-year outlook on gross margins has not
changed from our prior guidance.
Comparable currency neutral operating leverage came in better than anticipated in the quarter, primarily due to the
stronger growth in gross profit driven by the factors just mentioned. Comparable currency neutral income before tax
grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the provision in Venezuela resulted in a three point headwind
on income before tax, which was consistent with our previous outlook.
Our first quarter comparable EPS was $0.48, which included a six point currency headwind. On a comparable currency
neutral basis, our EPS grew 15% in the quarter. The six point currency headwind was slightly less than our original
expectations, primarily due to the benefit from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt
issued during the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the early
extinguishment of certain long-term debt, costs associated with our previously-announced $3 billion productivity
program, and charges related to our Venezuelan operations.
As many of you know, the Venezuela Government introduced a new floating exchange rate mechanism called SIMADI
in mid-February. We re-measured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the first quarter using the
new SIMADI floating exchange rate of approximately 193 bolivars to the dollar and translated our Venezuelan
subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate.
We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital, the
impact of six additional days, and the timing of capital expenditures. And it's partially offset by an unfavorable impact
from currency exchange rates.
We returned $1.8 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the quarter, which is
reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareowners. For 2015, we increased our annual dividend by 8% to
$1.32 per share and it's worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year for more than half a century.
Turning to outlook, while we are encouraged by some of the early signs of success, it is still early in the year, and
global economic growth remains constrained by challenges in many markets as evidenced in regions like Brazil,
Russia, and China. Therefore, we are maintaining our underlying full-year currency neutral growth expectations as
previously provided. However, we are updating the expected impact from structural items and currency.
During our last call, we said we expected the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to close in early Q2. We
now expect closing to happen in the latter half of the second quarter, as the parties work to satisfy contractual closing
considerations. However, distribution of Monster products in the U.S. has already begun transitioning to the KO
system.
Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on closing the U.S. territory transfers to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings.
We now estimate that the net impact of structural items on full-year 2015 results will be a slight headwind on net
revenue growth, with no material change to our prior outlook on income before tax. Therefore, consistent with what we
said in February, for the full-year 2015, we continue to expect mid-single-digit comparable currency neutral EPS
growth. However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange rates. After considering our hedge
positions, current spot rates, and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an approximate six point currency
headwind on net revenue, an approximate 10 point currency headwind on operating income, and an approximate seven
point headwind on income before tax for the full-year 2015.
The currency impact on income before tax remains roughly the same as our previous outlook, as the foreign exchange
gains associated with our euro-denominated debt issued this quarter is offset by the effect from translating our
bolivar-denominated profits at the SIMADI exchange rate, as well as the continued decline in several emerging and
developing market currencies.

So when modeling the second quarter, there are a couple of phasing items you should consider. The timing of Easter
benefited the first quarter this year, while it benefited the second quarter of last year. We expect structural items to be
roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a one to two point headwind on income before tax. And then finally, we
currently expect currency will be the an approximate seven point headwind on net revenues and approximate 10 point
headwind on operating income and five to six point headwind on income before tax in the second quarter, as we cycle
more favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind in operating income and in
income before tax is primarily due to that foreign exchange gains associated with our euro debt.
In closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the business, which gives us increased confidence
that our strategies and actions are working. With that said, it is still early days in a transition year, as we implement
significant change in our company amidst a volatile and challenging operating environment. But we absolutely believe
that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver
long-term value to our shareholders.
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning
<A - Timothy K. Leveridge>: Good morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So just, I guess, as we look at this quarter, it just seems like some of those things that you
laid out at the beginning of the year that were within your control have tracked in line, maybe even a little bit better
than expected, sounds like the re-franchising in North America is pacing maybe a little faster, closing the Monster
transaction is taking a little bit longer. And it sounds like you're sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and
redeploying or spending more on marketing.
I guess when we think about the factors that are outside of your control, which would be, I guess, some of the macro
factors, the change in the Venezuela exchange rate, how some of the markets are moving, I'm not sure if we have a
great sense for maybe what's worse or what's better. So if you can maybe just sort of lay out for us versus where you
were earlier this year when you initially gave us guidance, kind of what's better and what's worse, especially focusing
on some of the things that are outside of your control.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Sure, Bryan. It's Muhtar here. Good morning again. So in North America, I'll start with North
America. I'd say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential wage growth and
lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. In Latin America, Mexico is, the best way I would say is,
relatively stable and continues to track closer to the United States because they're so closely linked.
Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected. I'll say that. Venezuela continues to increase as a concern, given
the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the marketplace. And Argentina just continues to be challenging. And
Columbia is, again, kind of a star in Latin America in terms of performance and macro conditions.
So in Europe, I think there are also some green shoots on the back of monetary easing, but it's early days. That just
started. But deflation still remains a concern this year. And overall, consumer spending in Europe, I'd say, is still
sluggish, as it will take time for, I think, monetary easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate into increased
consumer spending. And then risks to recovery remain a still volatile environment. And then, of course, you've got the

possible Greece exit issues lingering on.
In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see significant challenges, the Russian consumer. And we expect it to
continue to remain challenging throughout the year this year. Sub-Saharan Africa is a strong bright spot and we're
seeing that in our results. And then Middle East, we've got some pockets where it's defying the geopolitical
environment, but overall obviously increased geopolitical risks there.
And then in Asia and Pacific, China, the disposable incomes, consumer spending, CSD in China continues to
decelerate. We saw that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%. Japan remains sluggish, I'd say, similar to
Europe, although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy. And finally in Asia Pacific, India continues
to be a bright spot, I'd say, inside the BRIC markets, the four BRIC markets.
So that's a sort of walk through in terms of – and then the commodity environment, again talking about what we can
control and what we can't, remains fairly benign compared to previous years, stable and benign. And so given that
value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE growth, I hope I've been able to give you a sort of quick walk through
of what's good and what's not so good and what's more stable.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: That's very helpful, Muhtar. Thank you. And didn't mean to have you talk so long; your
voice is definitely under some pressure this morning. Kathy, if I could, just one follow-up on the commodity piece, the
comparisons were a little bit better in the first quarter. Just looking forward, is there anything that we should be looking
at that could make it maybe more favorable as the year goes on? Like, how much of it is locked in, I guess, and how
much of it might move based on commodity movements? Thank you.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Well, Bryan, as Muhtar just said, commodities for us will be benign this year [ph] as we, in
this quarter and first half, were cycling higher prices from the back half – (29:20) the first half of last year. And
thinking about something like oil, oil doesn't really impact us. So for our commodities, we are hedged. So we basically
are not going to see specific benefit there and they're going to be basically benign.
<A - Timothy K. Leveridge>: Operator?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is John Faucher of JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. Wanted to follow-up on two questions related to the price/mix number, which is,
I guess, one, if we look at the gallon variances you mentioned, it skews a little bit more towards high revenue per case.
So can you give us an idea in the quarter in terms of how much of that benefit in geographic concentrate shipments –
how much we'll need to take out over the balance of the year?
And then, going back to some of the comments that you guys made, I think, back in December about sort of the
different global pricing strategy in terms of really trying to find the right balance region-by-region, can you talk about
the outlook for pricing in Europe? It was obviously – price/mix was flat this quarter, but that's one where it seems like
there's some opportunities going forward. So what's sort of the medium to longer-term view on pricing in Europe?
Thanks.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Okay, John. So I'll take the first part of that question. So the gallons and the cases definitely
when you make the adjustment for days, gallons are behind cases. And that will moderate, but that will be based on, as
you just said, what we see the first quarter is the higher revenue per CSD. And so, we did benefit from positive
geographic mix in our price/mix.
That will moderate and we will start to see, when that catches up, more of the geographies that provides a lower
revenue per CSDs coming through, which will then give us the negative geographic mix coming through as well in the
balance of the year.

And I think the second part of your question on the outlook of pricing, I will – or, Sandy, do you want to talk about at
all North America pricing, specifically?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.>: Sure, Kathy. Good morning, John. The North America pricing situation is really
the continuation of the strategy that we've been talking about for the last year and a half. Irial and I talked about this, I
think, six calls ago, that we were going to focus our business on the sustaining strategy of disciplined price and volume
mix to maximize revenue, with an emphasis on price as a driver in the U.S. business. And that's exactly what we've
been doing and what we continue to plan to do with a lot of discipline and focus.
As you look at the first quarter, if you look at each business by themselves, we met our pricing objectives in the first
quarter. We saw a little bit faster growth in our fountain business, which created a little bit of negative business mix.
But net-net, the year started according to plan and we see the outlook as being rational, and our strategy remains very
consistent.
Ahmet, you want to talk about Europe?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Sandy. Hey, John. Just a couple of comments in general and then Europe, we're
following exactly the same strategy of managing our product mix and price versus volume around markets in
International. In fact, we're getting some pretty good results in many of our big markets. Specifically in Europe, one
must remember that last year, we've had some fairly aggressive pricing, which resulted in, in our view, somewhat of an
imbalanced progression of our business, where we have lost some market share but got great pricing. So we were
saying before that we will be moderating that somewhat this year, so that we have a more balanced growth of volume
and revenue.
So what you saw in the first quarter is a result of that sort of moderation, but we do believe that we would be achieving
reasonable price/mix in Europe in the course of this year.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: And, John, this is Muhtar. I'll just add one other point, which is related to what I already
mentioned, that we're reorganizing and have reorganized our marketing around the different clusters of developed,
emerging and developing markets. And I think that's also working, beginning to yield some early results. And I think
our new marketing leadership is very committed and very much part of this new reorganization of our marketing
around the clusters. And I can say very clearly that marketing is playing an important role in how we are generating
enhanced revenue in our business. That's really an important takeaway, I think.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Great. Thank you. Feel better, Muhtar.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Thanks. I feel good. It's just my voice.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi, guys. So I'll give Muhtar's voice a break and maybe start with Kathy. You know, the
quarter came in better than expected from a margin perspective, clearly, versus consensus. But with the extra shipping
days and Easter shift, it's kind of tough to judge your margin performance. So I was just hoping you could give us some
perspective on where margins and profit came in this quarter versus your original expectations and some of the key
puts and takes in the quarter, again, versus those original expectations.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So, hi, Dara. So the price/mix, obviously, at three points, as I just spoke about. Excuse me.
We did benefit from positive geographic mix in the first quarter. And as we will get – as concentrate shipments and
timing starts to catch up, we will have the impact of negative geographic mix, which, for us, is not a surprise in that that
is kind of normal run rate for several of our geographies.
So we did get the pricing in the quarter and the benefit. And then, you know, the other side of that would be the costs,
and when you adjust for structural and you adjust for currencies, cost of goods is really in line with concentrate

shipments. And then the other issue would then just be commodities. And then, as we've said, the commodities are
basically going to be benign for us. And in the quarter, we are cycling higher costs from last year, so that was a slight
benefit.
But for the most part, as I'm looking into the rest of the year, commodities are going to be benign. So it's really,
basically, the pricing that we got this quarter, offset by the costs that were better than prior year because we cycled
better costs.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And then net-net, when you put everything together, would you say from a profit
standpoint or margin standpoint, where did the quarter come in versus original expectations at the corporate level?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So I also would add one other thing in addition. In North America, specifically, you know, we
had better business mix, which basically was around our foodservice business. So for the first quarter in a transition
year, we are obviously very pleased with our results. And I would say that I would expect pricing to moderate for the
back half of the year and the cost of goods sold continue to be in line with concentrate shipments. So we were,
basically, given the quarter, in line with our expectations, and we expect to be in line with our full-year expectations
that we have provided.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Steve Powers of UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Thanks. Muhtar, feel free to weigh in, but I'll also try to give you a break and direct questions
to Sandy and Kathy. So, guys, on North America, the price realization was solid, but it was actually a little lower than I,
at least, had expected, just based on market data. And I know you were lapping some fairly intense retailer promotions,
so maybe that played a role. Maybe there was, again, negative mix from stills. I know you mentioned fountain
dynamics, Sandy. But I was hoping you could just expand on the trends there and whether you think 2% is a
representative number for the year, at least in terms of kind of the way you're targeting it.
And then on a related note, I was wondering if you'd also dimension for us the profit contribution to this price/mix
you're getting because clearly if it was all rate, pure rate, then it would sort of flow through 100% to profit, all else
equal. But given that a lot of what we're seeing is category mix and the introduction of new package types, I'm
wondering how to think about that profit contribution. Should we be assuming 50% as a rule of thumb roughly or are
there reasons to be more optimistic or cautious related to extrapolating price/mix to profit flow-through?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.>: Steve, the comments I'd make about overall pricing are to reiterate what I said
earlier, which is that on a business-by-business basis, our pricing results in the first quarter were solid. You saw in
Nielsen, very strong price growth. Some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our
customers. Some of it was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happened in the end of February
and early March. And some of it was our customers making more money in the category. So the net effect of it was a
really good start to the year, in line with our plan. If you cross our business over into our chilled Minute Maid business,
we saw price realization there. We launched some new items that drove some incremental revenue. And then, as I
mentioned, the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year, which creates a business
mix drag overall.
What I'd say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations,
but I'd also point out that as we get into the second half of the year, you're going to see more difficult pricing
comparisons. And we will continue our strategy of rigorous and disciplined and focused price volume management, but
we'll be lapping ourselves and we'll be continuing to do so, but against a little bit tougher comparison. So net-net, off to
the start we had hoped to.
Irial, any additional dimension?

<A - Irial Finan>: [ph] At times, I'll be (40:29) repeating what you said, but I'd go back and I've said this for six calls,
we're being very disciplined and rational about our pricing. And what we achieved in the first quarter is pretty well in
line. Sandy has mentioned there's maybe some channel mix impacts in there, but, generally speaking, very much in
line. We intend to stay disciplined [ph] and dare – I would use the word, nearly be boring, (40:52) in terms of how we
approach the business. We want to remain disciplined and focused and doing the right things for the business. And we
believe we are on a good track. We intend to stay on that track. And I think as each quarter goes by, you'll see positive
momentum in the business.
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.>: Can I just add one more thing, Dara (sic) [Steve]? That, what Irial just said, then
creates the environment for our small packages to grow. And the consumer is moving strongly to small packages. And
we're continuing to see low to mid-teens growth in those packages. And all of which is supported by the impact of a
step-up in marketing, which gives the whole thing more sustainability as we work through the more challenging comps.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Okay. Maybe if I could just follow-up, sort of related theme, different angle and maybe this is
for Kathy. But I noticed you changed the reporting of regional profit before tax, so regional operating profit to profit
before tax, consistent with the incentive changes you made. North American PBT was up like 180 basis points or so,
but I was wondering if you could comment: A, if there was any material benefit from sub bottling payments in the
quarter; and B, if OI margin trends would have mirrored PBT? And then assuming so, how much of that 180 basis
points improvement was driven by some of the better pricing realization, the better productivity, commodities, that can
kind of continue as a run rate versus timing benefits in the quarter related to the Easter and the calendar shift? So if 180
is representative of sort of the underlying OI trends and then what's the real run rate that we should be thinking about as
sort of expected margin improvement on the year? Thanks.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So the expected margin improvement over the balance of the year, as Sandy just said, so we
got good pricing in the quarter, and Irial said we are very focused on continuing to rationally price. We had higher
comps in the back half of the year for pricing that we have to cycle, so and as far as re-franchising is concerned, I
wouldn't expect to see much benefit at this point from the sub bottling payments.
And, as you know, if you look at it from a structural perspective, we structurally adjust those. We pulled them out. We
pulled out the benefit so that we put it back on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year. So there is not a big difference
at operating versus PBT in our North American operations at this point. And so the margin expansion, that is basically
because had really good pricing, as we had really good pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, they're very focused on
pricing. That will continue. But we are cycling higher prices in the back half of this year.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Bill Chappell of Suntrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Good morning, Bill.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Morning.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: I guess two questions, I'll lump them together. One, on Diet Coke in the U.S., it did look
like, most recently, the Nielsen's looked like actually a positive number and we haven't seen that in a while. I just
wanted to see if maybe the trends you feel like you've gotten behind that where we could see some growth going
forward or at least stabilization. And then the second question, on the re-franchising, I mean, anything you have seen
thus far – I know it's early – where it may be accelerated even further in terms of the bottler network or it's just maybe
have more of an update later as we move through the year.
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr.>: Bill, on Diet Coke, I would describe Diet Coke still as a work in progress. We
have done a number of things on the basics of marketing, graphics, advertising, packaging. We have some very
advanced sort of big data-driven customer relationship programs going on with consumers who love Diet Coke. And

we are seeing some improvement in the year-over-year revenue. But, you know, we're still very much focused on that
as a work in progress and expect to. But I would say this. The team and I and our whole system believe that, in fact,
we'll return Diet Coke to growth in the long-term, but recent improvement, but still work in progress.
On re-franchising, the re-franchising is going according to plan. It is a, as we've said before, a massive project. We're
putting the entire system in on a common ERP system, and re-franchising the territories one sales center at a time to
make sure that the capability that we build continues to grow and that our customers are well served in the process. And
we're pleased with the progress. We have a plan in place that we expect to meet or beat. And we're always looking for
opportunities to accelerate it, but not at the expense of really high quality customer service and capability.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So throughout the press release and your commentary, we pleasingly had heard and read
about kind of marketing increases, so that's a good thing. That's very much on plan. However, we didn't really see or
hear much reference to cost cutting benefits offsetting or funding some of those at this point. The only thing you said
was, look, we're on track for $500 million of cost savings this year. But we're not hearing or seeing a lot of that flowing
through, even offsetting things. I'm not saying all the way to the bottom-line, but at least offsetting some of your
investments. So when can we start hearing more about that savings offsetting your investments?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Well, Ali, this is Muhtar. First, if it wasn't for the savings, we would not be able to do what you
see us doing in terms of generating that increased marketing, generating all the other things that basically are part of
our five point strategy of: focusing on revenue; focusing on productivity; focusing on better and more marketing;
rewiring the organization for better impact; and focusing on our core, which is the franchising that we talked about. So
I'd just say to you, had it not been for the productivity, we certainly would not be able to enable our organization to
generate the kind of momentum that you see beginning to come back in. That's clear. There's no question about that.
And so this is not a four or five sequential kind of compartments. These are very integrated sort of approach to how we
bring more momentum into our business. And everything that I mentioned that's happening at the same time, better
wired organization, better marketing, marketing that works around clusters, more effective marketing linked to social
media as well as into a better cost per GRP, all of that funded by incremental productivity. And so, I think that's how
you need to see our entire sort of different buckets of our strategy coming to life.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So a follow-up on that and a separate question for Irial, just to follow-up on that, Muhtar, if you
could, is particularly in terms of the head count reduction and the savings thereof, should we see that ramping up
throughout the year? And at risk of being cut off, let me put in my second question here on a separate topic is, you
know, we do keep hearing Germany, India, Vietnam bottlers in BIG continue to do actually quite well. And I always
pause whenever I see that, and obviously there's been controversy about some of those names, including, obviously,
Germany, but when is the right time to divest those and get them out of the hospital ward? And what are you looking
for to make sure that happens, or potential buyers are looking for at this point to commit to buying them?
<A - Muhtar Kent>: First, I mean, I'll just say that I agree with you that those bottlers are doing really well. Germany
is certainly a star in Europe. Southeast Asian bottlers are doing well, particularly Vietnam, the big one that we are
running. And I think it's important to keep in mind for you that Germany was not in a position to be re-franchised until
after 2012, because the consolidation was still taking place. So it's really been ready for the last sort of, if you like, 18,
24 months. And it has been the real bright spot in Europe last couple of years. It's profitable, and we need to ensure that
we find the right home and the right structure and the right value. And so, I can be clear with you that Germany is not a
strategic long-term holding, and the right home will be found.
None of our, if you like, BIG operations are, in a way, long-term strategic holds. So that's what I would say about your
question.

Irial, you want to add anything to that?
<A - Irial Finan>: Yeah, I guess the only add I'd give is the three markets you mentioned actually are not in a hospital
ward. To Muhtar's point, actually, they're all performing very well now. And we've been very transparent about
re-franchising. I've said this many times at conferences that we would re-franchise at the right time. Germany, we
clearly said, is ready for re-franchising. In the meantime, it continues to perform exceptionally well. We have a
fantastic group of associates and management in Germany and feel very good about it. But I've also said we expect to
get a fair price, not get overpaid, but get a fair price for territories, because we owe that to our shareholders. And then,
we take it from there, but...
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Just to build on what Irial said, we are looking for three things in terms of the right partner –
description of the right partner: one, proven management team; two, strong financial capabilities; and, three, willing to
invest in the business and grow the business. So those are the three things, and I'm confident that we will reach that
goal.
Finally, on your question regarding head count reduction, I think you've heard about our previously-announced plans.
And we are sticking to that plan, simply said.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Ian Shackleton of Nomura.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: Yeah, good morning. You announced a deal in China last week, and I was just keen to get a
little bit more detail of quite how that fits in. It's obviously a very different structure to what we've seen with more
recent deals, a la Monster or Keurig.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Ian, it's Muhtar. It fits right into the strategy of what we said is bolt-on acquisitions where they
make sense. And we will look at them with – and where we believe that they fit into our portfolio, where they actually
add value. We can generate value for our bottling partners through that acquisition, and it fits right in there. And so,
that's all I would say about that, Ian.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: Okay. Thank you. Just as a follow-up for Kathy, I know it can be quite volatile, but equity
income this time has almost gone to zero. Is there something specific in that that's causing that?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yeah, our equity income is impacted by currency, so we actually don't pull out all of the
currency that impacts that, because if you think about some of our locations, they have – their geography – they have
many geographies. So when we report, we take the main currency and translate that into U.S. dollars. That means that
there is still often a lot of currency impact in those numbers. So I would read into it that it's a very, very difficult
currency environment out there at the moment.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: Okay. So this is not a case of there being some big one-offs in some of the equity holdings
there?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: No. There's nothing one-off that I'm aware of in the equity holdings.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: Excellent. Thanks for clarifying. Thank you.

<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Morning.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Is there any way to sort of strip out what the benefit in the quarter was on the operating
profit side from the extra days?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So I guess the way I'd think about it is if you take our unit case sales of [ph] 1% (54:47) and
use that as a surrogate, because that doesn't have the extra days in it and you take pricing of [ph] 3% for the (54:55)
pricing and then I would say that did benefit from positive geographic mix that will moderate over the back half of the
year. So I guess I would think of it using just price/mix and average daily sales unit cases.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay. So – but there's no fixed cost levers or anything with the extra days that might have
helped the gross and operating margin?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So the operating expenses, I would say no. There was nothing specific in operating expenses
that was helped by the six days. And then, you know, the sales and distribution expenses are impacted by the six days,
so they kind of wash out; so I would say there was nothing there.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And then, just on BIG, I mean, the year-over-year margin
expansion was awesome, I mean, massive. What's driving that and how sustainable is it?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Well, so, again, I keep repeating myself, but then we did benefit from this positive geographic
mix, so I think the only thing I would say in terms of it, it will moderate in the back half of the year, as we'll get more
of our normal run rate of negative geographic mix from concentrate shipments.
And then Sandy talked about the impact of the business mix with the foodservice business in North America, so I think
those are the things that basically would say that that number will moderate over the back half of the year, as we are
still in a transition year.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay, great. And then, just lastly very quickly, the delay in the Monster transaction, is
there any more color you can give us on why it – because I think it was supposed to close like maybe late 2014, early
2015? Then you guys said March. And now it's kind of towards the end of the quarter. You know, is there still a high
probability that it's going to close then?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yes. So there's no issue there. It was going to close – we always expected it to close in the
first quarter. Then basically just the regulatory process that we have to go through that is delaying the close. We fully
anticipate that it will close.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks very much for the time.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Certainly.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning.
<A - Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I guess most of my questions were answered, so just a couple of P&L questions, Kathy. One,
just in terms of the structural items impact this year, it sounds like a slight negative on revenues now, as opposed to the

Page 14 of 15
prior call. So just a little bit of clarification on sort of the puts and takes on the revenue impact, sounds like the impact
on bottom-line is pretty minimal. And then on the FX, you had the remeasurement gain in Q1. That was about a little
bit more than $0.01. Is that really what's the difference in terms of your full year outlook for PBT impact being at the
low end of that 7% to 8% that you had called out last time?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yeah, hi, Judy. So on the structural – the structural is impacted by the timing of the Monster
transaction. And then, any time we accelerate into the re-franchising, that is also going to impact our numbers. So that's
why we gave you different structural guidance [indiscernible] (58:19) structural guidance.
And then on the gain, remeasurement gain, yeah, that's basically when we remeasured that euro debt, that impacted
currency positively, so that is what changed the outlook for currency over the back half of the year. And also then, there
was the impact of Venezuela and change using the SIMADI rate going forward.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: The timing of the Monster transaction, though, I mean, the deal itself is delayed, but you are
getting the distribution into your bottling in this quarter. So that would speak to a positive in terms of the revenue
benefit, but is the re-franchising pacing really what's dragging down in terms of the revenue impact?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So the distribution is starting to transition. It has not fully transitioned. So that transition will
take place over the year and at various times. And that's not something that's really under our control. That's really
under Monster's control as they transition that. So we can't – we put in an estimate of how we think it's going to
transition, but so it's not something that's already into our number and that's what's slowing up. So it's slower than
expected because we expected it to start earlier.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: I see. Okay. That's clear. All right. Thank you.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Sure.

Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.
Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim. In summary, we're seeing initial progress in our plan to reinvigorate
top-line growth; however, we still have much to do. And the full benefits from the announced initiatives are going to
take time to materialize. 2015 is a transition year, as we transform our operating model for sustainable growth amidst a
challenging global consumer environment.
While the macro environment remains challenging in the near-term, we're confident in our ability to return to
sustainable growth. And the long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our brands and our global system
are unparalleled. We are fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company. As
always, thank you for your interest. Thank you for your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
