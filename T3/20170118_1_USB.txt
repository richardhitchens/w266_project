SEC.
I will now turn the call over to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Jen, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call. While the economy was challenging, and
often unfavorable in 2016, it was a good year for U.S. Bank. As you can see on slide three of the presentation, we
reported record net income of $5.9 billion, and record earnings per diluted share of $3.24 for the full year.
Our 2016 return on common equity was 13.4% and our efficiency ratio was an industry-leading, 54.9%. We reported
strong loan growth and strong deposit growth and we returned 79% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and
buybacks. I'm also pleased with our fourth quarter results, which are highlighted on slide four. In the fourth quarter, we
reported net income of $1.5 billion, or $0.82 per diluted share. Healthy balance sheet growth supported 2.1% sequential
growth in net interest income, and strengthened fee businesses, such as Payments and Trust, drove 3.9% non-interest
income growth compared with the year earlier. Credit quality remained stable in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide five, our profitability metrics continue to be among the best in the industry. In the fourth quarter, our
return on average common equity was 13.1%, and our efficiency ratio was 55.3%. Terry will now provide more details
about our fourth quarter results. Following Terry's remarks, Andy, whom we announced yesterday, will assume the
CEO role at the April shareholder meeting this year, will provide some insight about our opportunities for growth in the
current environment. Terry?
Terrance R. Dolan
Thank you, Richard. I'll start with a balance sheet review and then discuss our fourth quarter earnings trends. Turing to
slide six, you can see our loan and deposit growth trends. Average total loans outstanding grew 1.1% on a
linked-quarter basis, and increased 6.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, or 5.6%, excluding a credit card
portfolio acquisition at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. In this year's fourth quarter, the linked-quarter growth and
our increase in average loans was led by a rebound in growth in average total commercial loans of 1.6%, and strong
growth in several consumer categories.
As expected and in line with industry trends, residential mortgage loan growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting
both seasonal factors and a slowdown in refinancing activity driven by higher rates. Also, commercial real estate
mortgages were essentially flat compared with the third quarter of 2016 as customers paid down mortgages and
evaluate the potential of policy changes and the outlook for rising rates. Total average deposits increased 11.8%
compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, and were up 3.3% on a linked-quarter basis. The sequential growth was
highlighted by a 3.5% linked-quarter increase in non-interest bearing deposits.
Turning to slide seven, credit quality remained relatively stable for the third quarter. Net charge-offs, as a percentage of
average loans were 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, up 1 basis point compared with the third quarter, and flat with
a year ago. A seasonal increase in our credit card net charge-off ratio, offset declines in commercial and commercial
real estate net charge-offs. Non-performing assets decreased by 3.7% compared with the third quarter. The
improvement was driven by commercial loans, residential mortgages, and other real estate.
And while NPA's increased 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2015, NPA's as a percentage of loans, plus other real
estate, rose just one basis point to 59 basis points. We continue to add to the allowance for loan losses in the fourth
quarter to support loan growth. I'll now move to earnings results. Slide eight provides highlights of fourth quarter
results versus comparable periods. Fourth quarter net income of $1.5 billion was down 1.6% compared to the third
quarter. The fourth quarter is seasonally lower from a fee revenue perspective each year, and this year was no different.

On slide nine, you can see that total revenue increased by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter compared with the
third quarter, and grew 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our year-over-year revenue growth was primarily driven by
solid loan growth, funded by strong deposit growth, and strength across our fee businesses.
Turning to slide 10, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by 2.1% compared with the
linked-quarter, and was up 4.6% compared with the prior year. Linked-quarter growth reflected 2.1% average earning
asset growth and a stable net interest margin. The benefit of higher rates to loan yields was offset by higher average
cash balances and lower yields on security purchases and reinvestment rates on existing securities. Slide 11 highlights
trends in non-interest income, which declined by 0.6% versus the third quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns and
a 24% decrease in mortgage banking revenue. The mortgage banking revenue decline was in line with our December
guidance and reflects both seasonality and a drop in refinancing activity due to higher interest rates.
On a year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased by 3.9%, driven by strength in payment services revenue,
trust and investment management fees, and mortgage banking revenue. I'll highlight a couple of items within
non-interest income. Merchant processing revenue grew 5.6% on a year-over-year basis, adjusting for the impact of
currency rate changes. Trust and investment management fees increased 9.5% year-over-year, reflecting lower money
market fee waivers, along with account growth, an increase in assets under management, and improved market
conditions. Given the recent increase in the short-term rates, the impact of fee waivers in 2017 will be minimal.
Turning to slide 12, non-interest expense increased 2.5% compared with the third quarter in line with our – in line with
our expectation. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense increased 6.9%. The primary drivers for the increase
on both a quarterly and year-over-year basis were higher compensation expense, professional services expenses, and
other non-interest expense. Compensation expense reflects hiring for business growth and compliance programs,
including addressing the AML consent order, and DOL implementation. We believe the trajectory of costs for these
programs is stabilizing. As a reminder, professional fees and other expense are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter.
In the fourth quarter, other non-interest expense was driven by higher costs related to investments and tax-advantage
projects, which abates somewhat in the first quarter of 2017. I'll finish with a look at our capital position. Turning to
slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach, as if fully
implemented at December 31, was 9.1%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement, and our internal
target of 8.5%. Our tangible book value per share was $18.70 at December 31, up 7.2% from a year ago. In the fourth
quarter, we returned 81% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We expect to remain
in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.
I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Terry. I'd like to provide some insights into our thoughts on how we are positioned for growth in the current
environment. For the full year 2016, average loans increased by 6.9%, and we think for the full year 2017, a 6% to 8%
growth rate is very achievable. We expect the pace of growth is likely to be more weighted towards the later part of the
year as customers become more comfortable with the economic future post inauguration. In the first quarter, we
expected loan growth to be similar to the linked-quarter growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2016, as customers
consider the implications of potential policy decisions and tax decisions of the new administration.
We also expect relatively flat growth in residential and commercial mortgage loans, as seasonally slower growth in
credit card balances. Coming out of the first quarter, we are optimistic that an improving economy will spur more
consumer activity, which will help both our payments businesses and our consumer lending businesses. An improved
economic backdrop should also result in increased business spending on development and capital investments, and we
are well-positioned to capture our fair share of that lending and fee activity.
Given the improving interest rate environment, including the current shape of the yield curve, we expect that the net
interest margin, or the NIM, will expand modestly in the first quarter. We look for mortgage revenue to decrease 10%

to 15% in the first quarter, in line with an expectation for lower refinancing activity reflecting both seasonal trends and
the impact of higher market rates. We expect expenses to decline slightly on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by
seasonally lower professional fees and the decline in tax credit amortization expense, resulting in a relatively stable
efficiency ratio. Finally, given the underlying mix and quality of the overall portfolio, we expect credit quality to
remain relatively stable.
I'll now turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy; and I'm proud of our record fourth quarter and our full year 2016 results. We maintained our
industry-leading performance measures and reported a 17.7% return on tangible common equity in the quarter, and an
18% return for the full year.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Terry, and Bill Parker and I would now be happy to answer any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question is from John McDonald with Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Good morning, Richard and Andy. Congratulations to both of you
on yesterday's announcement.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Just wondering, Richard, if you have any additional color to share on what drove the
timing of the decision to do the transition now? Obviously, it's been well planned, but just what drove the exact timing?
And then, also, what exactly will be entailed in the role of Executive Chairman for you going forward?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, John. I know you all will be disappointed you can't kick me around anymore; and
that's the number one goal. Hey, first of all, this was very well telegraphed, and I want to thank you for setting it up that
way. I hit my 10-year anniversary as the CEO of the bank last month, and many years before that I conferred with the
board and our senior leaders and told them that – a couple of thoughts that tended to that notion that, at 10 years, I think
it's the right time for a transition. I think that for any company of any type, and it seemed that we were about three
years away.
Second point, John, was that our success was sitting right here. Andy was clearly becoming the perfect person to lead
the company based on his talents and his skills. I had worked with him for seven years as a partner at that point. And I
wanted to make sure that, as a board and as a CEO, we telegraphed him, first of all, that he was a candidate and it was
up to them to make that final decision, and that the candidacy wouldn't come eight years from now when I'm 65 and
he's 62. And it seemed appropriate that we locked down that succession as soon as we could and, at least, started that
process privately back then.
And then, equally important to me, and it's just a personal thing for me, I want to do something else in my life that is
entirely different. I call it a calling, if you will. I don't exactly know how to explain it, and I know it's a little odd to
have a 58-year-old healthy CEO leaving to go nowhere, but that's really what it is. Because I'm not leaving this
company; I'm handing it over to a great management team and a great leader, and I'm looking forward to being
successfully part of it into the future as an advocate and an exclusive partner in this part of the banking environment.
So, I'm really going off to do something uniquely different and I'll see what comes about in the next few months. As
you know, I'll be the CEO for another 90 days, until April 18, and I will be full in on that job until which time at our
shareholder meeting in Nashville I will hand over the reins. I'll then step up to be the Executive Chair. And what that

means, John, is really what I am now.
So, think of it this way. I had three titles two years ago. I gave Andy one of them last year. I'm giving him another one
in April, and I'm keeping the last one because I'm selfish. And I'm going to be Chairman for a while, until the transition
is ensconced and complete and both the board and The Street, you guys, are comfortable that we've made that
transition. And it's my hope that there is a lot of continuity and sustainability in what we did, and yet, I also hope Andy
feels the permissions to do what he needs to do and make adjustments into the future.
So, as Executive Chair, we're not telegraphing that we're separating the titles of Chair and CEO permanently. We're just
doing it, because we would do that in any succession. We think that's one of the best practices. And then, in the future,
whenever I move away and the board has the decision to either merge the two titles again or not, and that's a decision
we don't have to know or telegraph now because we don't have that decision afoot.
So, hopefully that's clear. And I'll be working with the Lead Director as a partner. And that's what happens when you
have an Executive Chair and a Lead Director. We'll work together with Andy to guide the board and to give him
guidance to manage the company.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, great. That's super helpful. Thank you, Richard. And just a follow-up, then, on
expenses. When you think about the year, it seemed like 2016 for U.S. Bank was a year of kind of a digesting maybe an
above average expense drag. You mentioned a few things like DOL, consent order; it seemed like there were some
compliance costs, maybe some stepped-up investments. Just wondering, as you look at the operating leverage dynamics
for 2017, does it get better from both ends with higher rates helping revenues and maybe easier comps on expenses?
Could you flesh that out a little bit?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep, I will. And then, I'll give it to Andy to color. The answer is, yes. You're right. It'll work
from both ends. Look, I'm more disappointed than anybody that we hit that 55% efficiency ever. It's a reality and
something that we needed to do. A big part of that is the AML consent order. And I think most banks are probably
dealing with some form, public or private, on the consent – on the issue for AML. It's a remarkably expensive process;
I mean, remarkably. And we underestimated that, but we were able to handle it as we go forward. As Terry said, that's
stabilizing now, only to mean that it's peaked; but, it also means we don't know when it starts to come back down, but it
will definitely come back down because it's got an endpoint. It's a consent order. I will say that that's a fair amount of
the number that's moved us from what might have been [ph] 53 or 54 into the 55 (16:59), and we'll see that come down.
DOL is also a time-vested event that will come and go by the middle of this year. And we said before, we're investing
heavily into it. We've got a great partner. We believe we've got the right solution. And no matter what happens in
Washington, we would do this anyway; so, it's not bound by any kind of regulation or changes that might occur.
So, those are two big enough issues that have taken our efficiency ratio, our expenses, up a little higher than we'd like,
but we think that they sustain and then start moving down. And then, you know as well as anybody the fact that the
interest rates are starting to move and that the curve has steepened, well, that's the other benefit. And so, from both
ends, let's call this, and probably this quarter, which will be pretty flat on efficiency, probably the high-water mark, and
then we'll get back to places you expect us to be.
The other thing that's sitting underneath those numbers is this remarkable cost of innovation and technology. And we
can talk about it until you guys stop listening, but it will only show itself in the future when you'll see which companies
really made those investments and were ready to jump to a new kind of real-time payments mobile environment, and
those that didn't; and we are one that is. And so, our capital expenditures are right now, and again this year, probably
twice what they were many years ago; and probably half again what they need to be in the future years, but we're
spending that kind of money to get this thing ready for this environment that's going to change pretty quickly. That is
also a time-bound issue where that CapEx starts to come down. Probably this will be another peak year, and then we'll
start moving down. So everything moves back to getting into the low 50s without a lot of work, but with just time
passing. Andy, do you want to...?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And I'd add, Richard – so, as you said, we expect two rate increases in 2017: mid-year, at
the end in December. Given that and the expectation for the stronger economy, plus the brand and innovation

investments we made, we expect accelerated revenue growth in 2017 and positive operating leverage.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. I just want to get a little bit more color on your – what you're seeing in terms of
loan demand and borrower appetite post the election? And where you seeing strengthening? Is it in certain markets, like
in some of the borrower appetite in the Midwest, given some of the manufacturing implications? Or is it in some of
your other markets? Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: John, I'll start and then I'll hand it to Bill for a little bit more detail. So first, I will tell you
that there's more optimism and positive commentary for a lot of our business customers. But we haven't seen a
significant change in utilization or actually takedown of credit yet. So, while the talk is there, the actual action has not
shown itself. We do see steady growth in middle market, small business, and the higher corporate loan growth. And
auto is strong, as is the mortgage activity. But again, because refinancings are down, we will expect that to diminish.
But, again, the key point I would make is we're not seeing huge changes. In fact, it's relatively flat in terms of the
overall utilization rate. And then there are a couple of areas that we're choosing not to be as active in, and I'm going to
let Bill comment on that.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, and what Andy is referring to there is commercial real estate. We do see some of those
markets as being sort of late-stage credit cycle. If you look back, we had fairly robust growth in our construction, real
estate construction book, and that's slowing now. It's even slowing with our client base. They are being more cautious.
Multi-family is an area that, if you look at the forecasts, there are forecasts pretty broad-based of potential rent declines
in a lot of the major cities. So we're being more cautious there. And then on commercial mortgages, sort of the term
portion, we've been fairly flat to down in that area. And there's very aggressive competition for long terms, fixed rates,
limited covenants to no covenants, non-recourse, and that's just not a market that we play in. So, that's one area where
we're just going to see lower growth based on what – the business we do.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: John, this is Richard. We've been here before 10 years ago, when we started to see the
bifurcation of loan growth by different appetites by different banks. And it always sounds a bit like the hollow victory
to say – we're just not going to be as aggressive. We're not going to fight on terms. We're not going to fight on [ph]
tenor (21:21). We're not going to do certain kinds of loans. And it might sound a little bit of an excuse, but it's really
part of the strategy and it's the thing we're going to stick with. We're not changing that approach.
I'll give you an example. Commercial real estate, $43 billion portfolio; $17 billion of it is in small communities.
Because remember, we're really kind of a community bank at heart. And there is a lot of smaller banks that are doing
some things that you guys aren't even writing about because you don't follow the small banks, but we're in the middle
of that and we're not going to play. And while it'd be easier to give you guys some loan growth in certain areas, it won't
be on terms or tenor or stretching or underwriting on any category. It will be on price, because we've got that cost
advantage. We're going to use that advantage where we can. But when you do price, you do it only for AAA kind of
customers, and then you have the higher quality customers who, by the way, in this last quarter, also had access to the
capital markets more than other customers.
And you'll see our capital market fees are much higher than they were expecting, while loan growth might have been
on the low end of our range, it's probably a good outcome, because it reflects quality of our customers. So we're going
to stick to that. That's not the kind of thing you won't see change. And while we might take a little heat, because I know
loan growth is a good proxy for a healthy bank, it's got to be at the right quality and at the right terms, and we're just
going to stick to our guns.

<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, that's helpful. And on that competitive point, I just want to get an update from you, a
comment you made, conference this past quarter, around the – how much of the tax benefit could ultimately accrete to
the bottom line. I think you had indicated that about 50% to 60% of any benefit that you do see from corporate tax
reform could accrete to EPS. Is that still your thinking? Do you have any update there or any additional color you can
give us on how do you come up with that general range? Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Sure, John, and this is Terry. Obviously, there is still a lot that has to happen with respect to
tax policy, both in terms of the amount of the rate, and what ends up continuing to be deductible, and all sorts of things.
But when you think about the tax credit business, the tax credits will still be worth 100%, and all the rest of that stuff.
But the area that we would see an impact, I think is really related to the tax benefit that you get on the investment that
you make in those assets. So basically, the tax benefit on the shield. But to keep it simple, if we saw a tax – a corporate
tax rate decline of 10%, we would expect our effective tax rate to benefit or go down by about half of that, or about
60% of that. So think about 5 percentage points to 6 percentage points in that range. That's essentially what we would
expect to see the change in our effective tax rate, and it's because of the various dynamics associated with how tax
credits work.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. So that's not any – that doesn't factor in anything competitively, like the expectation of
some of this benefit couldn't get – could get competed away?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: No, no, we're – that's – no. By the way you're talking about and we don't see that. That's not
– I'm not predicting that that's going to be given back by the banking industry as a form of competition. This is just a
singular event that could happen. By the way, I'm going to say tax benefits, unless you guys know something I don't. It
really has to go through the budget process, so this is probably more a late 2017, 2018 issue, much as we all want it to
be immediate. And I think that's one of the reasons customers were also a customer of others are holding back on some
final decisions until we see what and when things happen, and taxes is one of them. But we're quite efficient now.
We're proud of where we are. So I don't want to be punished for having been more tax efficient than others, but it also
means there's a little less benefit if the most aggressive tax benefits accrue, we'll get a little bit less of it, but it's still
benefit to a good starting point.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah.
<Q - John Pancari>: Got. All right. Thanks again. And Richard and Andy, congrats.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, John.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, John.

Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi. Hi, good morning. Thanks much. A couple of questions. Just one as a follow up
on the compete away question that's been coming up on a bunch of calls. The corporates that you work with, the larger
they get, the more I think they are aware of how much wallet share and what the value is that they're providing to you.
So, I guess the question is why do you think that it won't get competed away, given that it's – tends to be a pretty
dynamic process in those discussions?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'll go first, and then Andy can jump on. They do know their wallet share by the same token.
Part of it is by design, because they've learned over the years they don't want to be double or triple down with one
partner, right? So first of all, they need to have more than one partner in and above just good competition and rates.
Second thing is, if you look at the way the industry is handling the rate increases, it relates to the liability side of the
balance sheet, right? We're a little smarter this time. And we're not giving it all the way immediately, and we're not
colluding either, because we never talk. But we're also being very careful and thoughtful about protecting what needs to
be a wider range between the cost of liabilities and the cost of assets, and if that behavior continues, I think the same

action comes with taxes.
What we'll find is we do it pricing, and yet the world is still reasonable and aligned, and I think with taxes, it's going to
be the same thing. We're all going to want to do our very best to protect what benefits our companies and help our
customers do well. But this company, for one, would like to bank that and find it in other forms, particularly in credit
quality and cost of funds. So I'm not saying others won't try it, but we also have never really been competing on that
level. If somebody wants to compete on price, bring it on. Because we can beat them every day for the highest quality
customer.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: And to that point, Richard, we already have the advantage of the best-rated bank, which
gives us a funding advantage, which we already take advantage of in terms of getting new business and/or achieving
higher returns. So, that's the other component here.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. No, that's helpful. Maybe I could also ask a separate question on the NIM
outlook. I think, Andy, you mentioned expand modestly in – was it 1Q 2017 or 2017? But just wanted to tie that in with
the commentary on this deck, where you talked about how the reinvestment rate on securities was lower. Just
wondering if that's the angle of which, higher reinvestment rate on securities is going to drive that expand modestly,
maybe you could help me understand if that's the case, and how much expand means when you say expand modestly?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So Betsy, I'll start and then hand it over to Terry. On the expand modestly, it was a comment
specifically to the first quarter. It related to both the increase in LIBOR in the short-term end of the curve, as well as
long-term end of the curve and it's principally around loan pricing and deposit pricing. The investment security
portfolio sort of stabilization occurs a little about mid-year, and then that would be beneficial towards the end of the
year. Terry, anything you'd add to that?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, when we talk about the reinvestment rates, as Andy said, when we get to the end of
the first quarter, end of the second quarter, we start to see that inflexion point, so that will help the margin. And we, as
Andy said earlier, we plan for a rate hike December of last year, June and then December. And so, when we think about
the margin, first quarter, it'll expand modestly and then it will probably accelerate a bit from there.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then last question. On the impact of the stronger
dollar on your merchant processing business and elsewhere if it's material, but I think it's mostly there?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yes, it is mostly there. So our stated revenue growth, Betsy, was 2.8% year-over-year, and
that's excluding the FX impact, it was about 5.6%. So every 1% or whatever the currency is about a million dollars a
year.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. Thanks, Betty.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thank you.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Thank you.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: I guess first question on the expenses. I appreciate the commentary for the full year on
operating leverage and expenses. Just hoping you guys might be able to put a sort of the finer point on the slight drop in
costs you expected in the first quarter. I guess, as I look back over the last few years, the magnitude of drop in the 1Q

used to be much more significant, I'd say, but it's gotten lesser as we have gotten more recent. Just curious if you can
maybe give us a sense for order of magnitude of what you would expect that drop could be?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, so, this is Terry. So when we end up looking at the first quarter, we would expect
that drop to be about in the percentage point kind of range. But the drivers behind that is that professional services fees
are always seasonally high in the fourth quarter, and included in that are compliance costs related to DOL and other
things, which will start to abate in the second, third quarter. So some of those compliance costs, specifically related to
DOL, will start to go away. And then, of course, the tax credit amortization that we have in the fourth quarter is always
seasonally high in the fourth quarter and it comes back down to normal. And if you remember last quarter, we gave
some guidance around how much that might go up. I think it was above $60 million, and that won't all go away but
probably about 60% of that will abate in the first quarter. So those are the biggest drivers in terms of why we see
expenses going down.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears to the fee side. Terry, can you give
a sense for what the dollar level of the equity investment income was in the fourth quarter? And I guess just to the
extent possible, I know that's a volatile line, but your sense for what a typical level might be going forward?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. In terms of equity investments, when we think about fourth quarter, it's probably, I'm
going to say, $20 million to $30 million higher than what we had seen in the third quarter. Fourth quarter is probably
more of a, what I would say, normalized sort of level. So when you think about equity investments on a go-forward
basis, it's probably going to be comparable to the fourth quarter when we think about the first quarter.
<Q - R. Scott Siefers>: Okay. All right. That's good color. Thank you guys very much.

Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Hey, congratulations on the shift and the evolution of the management team there.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thank you.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And, Richard, what I want to ask you was as you take on the role solely of Chairman of the
Board and working with your lead director, will you still take on most of those responsibilities? Because that is a large
share of what you do when you have CEO and Chairman, is you have a lot of activities just working with the board,
making sure that that process is going; so, that relieves a lot of burden from what Andy would have to do initially as he
takes his new responsibilities.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Marty, you nailed it. That's exactly why the transition is, we think, best practice, because it
affords me a chance to work with the board and make sure that Andy's got the time and energy to work with the
management team and to work on the issues. I will not be in the day-to-day management of the company, because that's
also a best practice is to stay out of running the company, but to help him with the board side of it. And I'll be an
ambassador to the company. I'll do whatever he needs me to do. I can go places for him if he needs me to. I am not
going to go on TV a lot. I'm not going to talk about as the ex-U.S. Bank CEO. I'm not going to do that because the
voice has to be his and the current management team, but you got it right. And when the transition is satisfactorily
complete and the board and I and Andy feel that we've made that successful transition, then we'll move it to the next
step and they can decide where the Chairman position lies; but, it will give Andy the time to get focused on all the right
things to run the whole company.

<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then, Andy and Terry, when you're – one of the things in the release that's been consistent
across all of the banks so far, which is to me the biggest surprise, is that deposit growth is continuing not just to be
relatively strong, but in your case is actually picking up as we've kind of gone into rates starting to move up a little bit,
and we would think some re-risking would be deploying some of this liquidity back into the system. I'm just trying to
figure out where all that deposit growth is coming from because, like you said, your deposit betas are going to be tied to
what's happening on your deposits; and right now, it's continuing to grow, which gives you a lot of flexibility on
pricing.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Marty, I'll start and Terry will add on. So, I'm going to say three areas are focused – why
we're growing deposits. First of all, on the wholesale side, and that's a continuation of us taking market share; and along
with that market share is new customers who have deposits. Secondly, is our corporate trust business. Corporate trust is
a great business. It's very high return, great fee business, but importantly is it also generates a tremendous level of
deposit activity; and we're growing that business, both domestically as well as in Europe, and that's very helpful. And,
thirdly, is the retail core base as we continue to take market share. And this is one of the things we've talked about
being very prudent around branches.
While it's true that we've consolidated 40 or 50 branches the last couple of years, we've done that very thoughtfully in a
manner that says we don't want to lose space. We want to optimize the footprint, but we don't want to lose customers or
deposits. And I think the deposit growth you're seeing is because of that manner of closure or consolidation, which is
very thoughtful. Terry, what else would you add?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. I would add maybe just two different things. One is that as corporates are kind of
waiting to see what happens from a policy perspective, as they have cash and they're waiting to figure out how to
deploy that, they're probably parking it a little bit. And then, as we talked about in the third quarter with money market
reform, there was a fairly strong inflow of deposits in the third quarter. I'm not sure that all of that has abated, yet, as
people kind of figure out what they're going to do from a money market standpoint in terms of government funds or
whatever. So, those are the other two things I would just add.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Thanks, Marty.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks, Marty.

<Q - Ricky Dodds>: It's Ricky Dodds from Matt's team.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hey, Ricky.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Just a quick question on the goal of positive operating leverage. And if we don't see those two
hikes that you guys have kind of built into your forecast, is the goal of positive operating leverage still achievable?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It's more challenging. This is Andy. It's more challenging, and we've always had great
balance around making sure we're investing for the future and recognizing our short-term objectives. And we believe
firmly we can get there with the two rate increases that I mentioned. It'll be more difficult. We'll have to continue to
measure that balance of short-term versus long-term, but it would be more difficult.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Ricky, they're not equal, because if we get the June one and not the December, we're
there; we get the December one and not the June, much harder. And I know there's a lot of forecasts that have a June,
September, December; we're just using the June, December projections right now.
<Q - Ricky Dodds>: Got it. And then, maybe a unrelated follow-up on deposit betas. Obviously, not a huge impact
with the first hike, but as you think about more hikes, what's your thinking there, both on the commercial and consumer
side?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, and that's a good way of looking at it, in terms of commercial and consumer. So in
terms of the December rate hike and kind of what we're seeing right now, it's very similar to what we experienced a
year ago in terms of the deposit betas. So kind of the middle teens to upper teens; kind of in that ballpark.
When we model it out, especially on a longer-term basis, and so as we see rate hikes and if we would see a June rate
hike or a December rate hike, or maybe even a September rate hike, that will start to normalize. We typically model it
in the 40% to 50% range in terms of deposit betas. And then, also, from a modeling perspective, we assume that there's
going to be some deposit disintermediation that would take place during that time because of economic growth. So
hopefully, that kind of gives you some perspective. And, of course, it'll be more sensitive with respect to the wholesale
deposits, corporate trust deposits, than it will be on the retail side.

Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and also congratulations to both of you. Can we talk a little
bit about fees? Understanding that the NII side looks to have a pretty good path to growth based on your loan and NIM
comments. Can you talk us through what you think would be the lead driving forces on the fee side, especially given
that it looks like mortgage might be a more difficult comparison looking ahead?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah, I'll start. This is Andy. The fees, as you said – three components I'd highlight: number
one is mortgage down 10% to 15%; number two, payments. So our payments revenue this quarter on a year-over-year
basis, up 4%, but actually about 5.5%, excluding FX, 5.3%. And we actually saw good growth in all three categories:
the merchant acquiring, the card issuing, as well as corporate. So we would expect to see that to continue to grow,
particularly as we see increased spend both from a personal standpoint as well as from a business standpoint. So that's
the second category. And the final category I'd mention is our trust and investment fees. That is going to be partially
leveraged to a growing economy and continuing to gather investment activity in our private client as well as our retail
base, overall. So those three categories, I think – those two categories offset that mortgage category and we'll see
growth in fees.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Andy. This is Richard, Ken. Why don't you also give a little color [indiscernible]
(39:04) it'll come up later, that on the payment side we don't chase volume or revenue and just like we don't chase loans
on quality.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. I should mention. So – and Elavon is the best example of that. So I mentioned that
our core growth stated is about 2.8%, and excluding FX it's about 5.6%, but what you see on volumes is actually a
decline in volumes and that's because we intentionally exited some very low margin large customers who were not
profitable. And we did that intentionally. You'll see that impacting volumes, but you did not see it impacting revenues.
And I think that is a great example. We're trying to do this in the smart way.

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: And that was actually going to be my follow-up. So, it looked like the credit and debit card
comped a little bit harder year-over-year, whereas corporate and merchant, to your last point, started to look better. Are
we near the point where you think that we can get all three of the individual lines of payments moving the right way on
a revenue growth perspective? And if not, what's still holding that back?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. Let me hit at them each. So Elavon as I mentioned, strong growth on the revenue,
same-store sales up just under 4% driven by airline and fuel. And that drove that 5.6% ex-FX revenue growth.
Corporate card is two stories. Number one is on the business side of the equation, we continue to see strong middle
market, virtual pay, commercial freight payment growth. And that's positive, but that was offset somewhat by
government spend being down a bit. Sometimes that happens in the fourth quarter. We saw that occur this time. I think
that'll come back or flatten out, but that's what drove some of the lower growth activity you saw in corporate.
And then finally, on the card side, on the issuing side our growth in fees was about 7.5%, less than that, excluding
Fidelity, but it was also impacted by one less processing day in the fourth quarter, which impacted growth about 1% or
1.5%. So those three things are what's driving the overall. And as I said, I think all these categories we would expect to
grow in 2017.

Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning, congratulations, Richard and Andy.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thank you.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thank you.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Richard, we'll sure miss you but we're looking forward to having Andy at the top.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: [indiscernible] (41:35).
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: So my first question, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the trajectory of regulatory
related costs are stabilizing and you mentioned how expensive the AML consent order was and DOL compliance. I'm
wondering if the stabilization seems like the natural trajectory of regulatory-related cost, but if we get some regulatory
relief from the new administration, is there an opportunity for reg cost to actually go down for U.S. Bank?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: The answer is yes. It wouldn't be this year, and I'll tell you I'm going to be a prognosticator
here but based on what I understand, the administration that's going to take office in the a few days, their number one
issues are health care reform, taxes, and infrastructure. And somewhere in the top five might be financial services, but
it's not the top three. A lot of financial services issues, I think, will be dealt with in the early part of the year, but with
some implications later. So, that's why I said earlier on DOL, for instance, we never made a bet on while there
something that would happen that would cause us the need to slow down because we want to be ready. We would do it
anyway. So I think, Erika, the best thinking is that the understanding of what implications and lower regulation might
happen will be known probably in the second half of the year and benefited sometime in 2018, but I'll also tell you both
for things like an unusual consent order or an event like DOL transition, I think this bank has peaked on those costs.
Our compliance costs in the entire company are now, in terms of [ph] FCE (42:53), there're over 7,000 people of our
70,000 and that's up more than twice what it was a few years ago. That's a little high, because of these issues I just
mentioned but it's not going to go back to where it was. It's going to stay much higher because that's the cost of running
a high-quality bank. We don't have issues, but the AML issue which has caused us that kind of extra expense and so

expecting that nothing else comes along. We will see that come down and whatever regulatory reform relief we do see,
but most of it, I got to tell you it's going to be on the margins because most of this stuff is burdened in. It's in the run
rate. It turns out a lot of it's good operating policy and good compliance review tactics for double and triple checking,
and we're not going to give up a lot of that. So at least for this bank, it's got a positive leaning toward improvement. It's
late in the year, if not, next year. And it's not going to be significant, but it'll be positive.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. My second question is for Andy. I mean it's pretty clear in terms of the 60% to 80%
capital return that you target every year. I'm wondering given the stock is trading close to three times tangible book, if
you think about future CCARs, whether you'll maybe prioritize the dividend heavier, as you think about dividend
growth going forward and maybe normalizing to pre-crisis payout ratios? And also, how you're thinking about
acquisitions, especially depository acquisitions in terms of your capital strategy going forward?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So Erika, as you know, our capital strategy is 30% to 40% on dividends, 30% to 40% on
buybacks. We're at the high end on buybacks and at the low end of dividends right now. And I would think about us
moving more toward balanced perspective on that as we move forward and as we continue to look at the future years in
CCAR. With regard to acquisitions, with the consent order in place right now we're precluded from traditional
depository acquisitions, but we are doing banks like you saw in the last year with the Fidelity and AIG card portfolio
acquisitions. We can do merchant acquisitions and trust payments businesses. So that does not preclude us and that's
actually an area of focus. So, I think that'll be our focus in the short-term. Once we're out of the consent order, we may
look at traditional depository but that's not a focus right now.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Mike.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Mike, you there?
Operator
You may be on mute on your end, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. Yeah Richard, the first question is why are you stepping down? I guess I'm a little confused.
I mean you're running a bank with best-in-class performance measures. You've been there 10 years. You're 58. I guess
almost 59, and you have many other banks, that sometimes run banks with worst-in-class performance measures had
been there over a decade and they're a lot older. What's going on? And also, what does it mean when it says you'll help
move the bank to new areas of business?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So Mike, I don't know if you heard the opening of the call, because I answered that question
for John McDonald, but basically the reasons are, I said in place three years ago that at the 10-year mark, assuming
nothing else has changed, that it would be appropriate for a change in leadership because I just feel that way. It's my
personal opinion. I indicated that Andy is the perfect candidate. He's sitting right here next to me, let's give him the
signal, let's give him the time table and let's keep him. And thirdly, I do have another calling in life to do something
entirely different, which I don't know what it is because I never felt permitted to look until the announcement was
passed and today would be my first day to look into the future along with my life with a very strong view that we want
one more thing in life to accomplish and it's going to be entirely outside of the banking industry. So that's the reason.

And the rumors of my bad health or early demise are greatly exaggerated, because I feel quite good today. And so that's
the timing for that. And I don't know why some people stay longer. I don't know what the issues are at other companies,
but mine was not to time it, mine was not to set this moment in time based on how the company is doing. It was three
years ago the set of timetable that if at the 10-year mark it seemed right, and it now does. We've got everything lined up
and the perfect guy to do it. And so, that's exactly what it was. And the board, of course, has all of those decisions. I
can't make any decision I want on my own without their complete endorsement and their very careful due diligence
which they did all of and they're quite excited about this transition as well.

changes or what degree of change might you implement, especially with Richard still as Chairman?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hanging around.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So Mike, Richard and I have been together for 10 years. And the strategies and the decisions
that we have made and the position of the bank is a combination of all of us, the management committee and the two of
us. So I don't expect major changes. We're continuing to focus on one bank from the perspective of the customer. The
technology and innovation will continue to be an area of focus, as it has been. As things move digitally, and you know I
would maintain that we are the best bank right now, and I'm certain that we have one of the best management teams out
there, so I couldn't be more honored and pleased to take this on.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. Well, thank you.

Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Saul.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the roles. I wanted to ask you about the longer-term
guidance you outlined at your Investor Day. And I think you guys have addressed it, I guess in a directional fashion
thus far, but sort of a broader question. You guys gave pretty expansive guidance on revenues, expenses through the
cycle provisions, business line growth. And obviously, the backdrop has changed, we're kind of at an inflection, in
terms of – potential inflection in terms of the economic backdrop, regulatory backdrop, and what not. But how are you
guys thinking about the longer-term guidance that you outlined today versus mid-September when you had your
Investor Day? And where are you feeling more comfortable? Where are you feeling less comfortable? If you could just
kind of give us a directional sense of that.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So Saul, as you know, that guidance was based on a three-year view, and it was a three-year
view of what we would call sort of a more normal rate and economic environment. I think as we sit today, we're
probably more comfortable about getting there in the three-year window that we talked about, certainly from a rate
perspective. What we predicted thus far is occurring, the economy seems to be at least steadier and slightly improving.
And so, I would say if we continue to feel good about those projections and our expectations are still to get there in that
three-year window.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Okay. That's helpful. I guess more of a specific follow-up. I think last quarter you talked about
utilization rates on commercial lines being around 25%, 26%. Any change there? Are you seeing any of the optimism
from companies starting to filter through in terms of borrowing, the pipeline for credit, and what not?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Saul, while the talk and optimism and discussion is more positive, the utilization rates are
flat. Still at 25%, as they have been for the past few quarters.

Your next question is from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Good morning. Congratulations on the new roles to both of you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: I just wanted to follow-up regarding some of your comments around the tax rates moving
down to 5% to 6% effective tax rate, and obviously, a reinvestment of some of those tax credits. Obviously, it's very
early in this discussion, we still have a ways to go before we figure it all out. Were there any specific line items around
possibly low-income housing tax credits, or probably that you expect to go away? And at what level do you expect to
have a – reinvest in those assets?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, so let me take a stab at it. And I think your question was really around tax policy and
tax credit, sort of investments and then where we might see either changes in the nature or type of investments. So, we
invest in really kind of four different areas. Affordable housing is a very significant part of it, new market or economic
development tax credits, is the second, a little bit of historical tax credit, but then also renewable energy.
When we end up talking to people that are kind of plugged into the tax credit, kind of market, we don't see a lot of
change coming with respect to affordable housing, because of all of the policy implications associated with that, or any
economic development, because when you think about what the administration is trying to do, they are trying to
stimulate economic development. So we don't see a lot of change to that. Probably where that change is going to occur
will be with respect to renewable energy type of credits. And to be quite frank, the law had already incorporated a
phase-out of those over the next four or five years anyway, so we didn't really anticipate a lot of impact to us with
respect to where we were going to invest and what the implications associated with were going to be.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: So, when you say the 5% to 6% decline in the effective tax rate on a 10% decline in the actual
rate with some reinvestment of tax credit, depending on how that all plays out. If you were to see a 10% decline in the
effective tax rate, would you believe that the decline in earnings would be close to, you know, 30% or 40%, or do you
expect – 30% to 40% of that 10%, or something closer to 10% or 20% of the tax?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, I mean, if in fact, got implemented, it isn't a decline in earnings, it's actually an
improvement in earnings because of the fact that we're paying less in tax expense as opposed to more. So, in my
example, our effective tax rate would go from 28%, 29% down from there, and that actually would be a positive from a
profitability standpoint.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: What I mean is, so with the tax credits – what I'm saying is, if you had a 10% decline, would
it be a 5% to 6% improvement in earnings? Or would it be more of a 7% to 8% improvement?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: It would be a – again, this is all simple math, et cetera, in terms of how I'm portraying it
right now, but it would be a 5% improvement in our effective tax rate. So you'd have to kind of do the math from there,
but it's not a 5% improvement in earnings or anything like that. It's a 5% reduction in our effective tax rate.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Okay.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Using the 10% example.
<Q - Kevin J. Barker>: Yeah. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Kevin.

Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, Richard. Hi, Andy; congratulations, again.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Thanks.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Let me add that. Couple of quick questions. Just one, just for Terry, just want to confirm that
when you said percentage drop in expenses in the first quarter, that I heard it correct that you're referring to 1% drop in
expenses, Terry?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, we would expect on a linked-quarter basis it would decline about the 1% rage.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Then the other line item that you said – I don't exactly remember if it was you, Andy. You
said equity investment gains should run at the fourth quarter level. What is the level of equity investment gains, and
also what is the amount of equity investments? And is that increasing because you've increased investments? Can you
talk a little – can you give us some color on those three items there?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah. You know, other income represents a whole variety of different things. It includes
trading income. It includes end of term and retail product revenue. It includes equity investments. It's just a whole
variety of different things. And they kind of move in – sometimes in different directions. So it's really hard to kind of
narrow it down to specifically equity investments, and I wouldn't want to kind of take you down that path or mislead
you with respect to that. I guess my point is that, when I end up looking at other income and the impact of equity
investments within other income, I think it's going to be fairly stable relative to the fourth quarter. That's what I would
tell you.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. And have you – what is the dollar amount of investments that you'll have made in equity
investments and has that increased recently?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: It hasn't increased, and it's not something we've kind of specifically disclosed in the past.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: One last quick one. AML, are you – can you just give us an update on timing of when you expect
to get out of that one?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, Vivek, this is Richard. We don't have timing on that. We're an OCC Bank, so there
they are really our binding constraint. We're making great progress. We're moving forward. There's a bifurcated view, I
think, on any Consent Order. One is you get to where you need to be, then you need to prove you can stay there for a
while; then they need to audit to confirm the sustainability. So, we're in the between stages one and two right now, so it
depends on how long that will take.
Back to Erika's question, I do think that as regulatory reform starts to maybe lighten a bit, I think those kinds of issues
move more swiftly. We might hope that there will be a faster conclusion from beginning to end on anything any bank
has been called out to improve, because I think part of the issue is we're just in these issues for a very long time and
maybe unnecessarily extended periods when the performance has actually been accomplished, the remedy has been
done, and it's sustained and it just needs too long to prove it.
So, I think we've talked about this year being that year to get all of those steps done. If I had to make a guess, we're
probably late this year, early into next year, but that's based on my own guess and we're not M&T. We're not another
bank that has this issue. We're U.S. Bank and we're dealing with our own issues, and we're moving swiftly with our key

Your next question is from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Winter>: Good morning. You guys have had nice growth in the other earning assets, the excess
liquidity, with all the deposit growth. Any thought with the move-up in rates to reinvest in securities? Or is it do you
want to hold on to it, just thinking that deposits will outflow, given the outlook for better loan growth?
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Yeah, it's really a couple of different things. We do expect it to really kind of abate, again.
Then, we'll see deposit outflows occurring, which is why, especially in the fourth quarter, we tend to hold the cash
balances. We see a run-up in deposits with respect to, for example, our corporate trust business, and then that ends up
getting deployed in terms of structures, et cetera. If the economy moves up or starts to improve, and businesses start to
make those business investments that we expect, we do – and we would see some disintermediation of deposits at that
particular point in time, because that's where they would start to – we would start to see outflow there.
<Q - Peter J. Winter>: Got it. And just a quick – just another question, housekeeping. You mentioned with the recent
increase in rates that the fee waivers on money market accounts will be minimal in 2017. Just what was that impact in
2016?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, two years ago, at its peak – this is Andy – the money market waivers were just about
$100 million. And we've received back, so to speak, about 75% or 80% of it in 2016. So that's why Terry says there's
limited amount remaining in 2017.
<Q - Peter J. Winter>: Right.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: And a vast majority of that we'll probably see in the first quarter and then it will be gone.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah.
<Q - Peter J. Winter>: Got it. Okay. Thanks.

Your final question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning.
<A - Terrance R. Dolan>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Question for you on your loan to deposit ratio, average loans to average deposits is about 82%.
What's the optimal level that you guys like to keep that ratio at?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: We don't strive for an optimal ratio, Gerard. It's a function of loan growth and demand, and
deposit growth and demand. So it's just an outcome. And if we have more than that, some of it goes into investment

securities or cash, as referenced by Terry. If we have less than that, we have plenty of funding opportunities of being a
very highly rated bank. So we're not ascribing to a specific ratio; it's just an outcome.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you. Richard, you mentioned earlier in the call that you're sensing that the banks
are smarter in terms of the deposit pricing. How much of an influence do you think that the industry's low loan to
deposit ratio may have on that, if at all?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I don't know the answer to that, Gerard, but I know that the temptation would already have
been present, if it was there. So, the first couple of moves a year ago, and now a month ago, I think they're based on a
hunger for the banks to do well, that probably would have been as heightened as an opportunity as possible. So, I'm just
of the mind that that temptation has passed and people are going to be thoughtful and smart as we move up. Obviously,
as rates get further and deeper beyond 25 basis points, things will start to pick up. But the arbitrage between deposit
and loan rates will start to get wider, which is good for banks, and that's why people are betting that banks will do
better, in part. And I think we've just gotten smarter. People are more thoughtful that their balance sheet makes more
sense to them, and there's other levers to pull, but I just don't think that's going to be one of them.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. And then just a final question. Again, Richard, you touched upon some of the
regulatory aspects of what's going on in the industry. And, of course, it's not the top priority of the incoming
administration, as you have identified. We hear a lot about relief for the banks under $250 billion in assets from a
regulatory standpoint. The so-called globals of these are not going to see as much relief. Can you point where you guys
are positioned, obviously above $250 billion but less than a global. What would be ideal relief for banks your size?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You know, that's a great question because – don't hate me for this answer, but we don't think
there'd be a lot of change, even if we were given relief. We're a very large company. And systemically important has a
lot to do with whether you would break the world if you fell apart. In our case, we're very important wherever we are.
And I think most of the practices that we have been performing, particularly stress testing and recognizing where the
risks are, those are better practices, and we're really good at it and we really keep a lot of those, Gerard. So a lot of
those would not go away.
I'd say some of the relief would be in the consumer enforcement area. I've long asked, I've pleaded with Rich Cordray
to consider making this CFPB an endorsement agency, not an enforcement agency. And I'm not being clever here. The
idea that they've put out, the basic tenets for the top-rated banks to be customer protective, plus customer supportive,
financial literacy, do the right thing, and they told us what those rules were, we would kill ourselves to be at that top
level every day.
We'd do all we could to be positively [indiscernible] (01:03:33) toward getting better every day, and instead there is
just this undue sense that the enforcement side of the spirit comes from trying to get you, and do something wrong, and
not instead work to get better, but try to find a mistake, many cases that we're human, err, and in many cases in rules
that weren't even there when they were done. So that would be my favorite. That would be beneficial to all of us.
We're $440 billion, or $450 billion. We're not a G-SIFI, but we're definitely a SIFI, and we're okay with that. And we
will come with it, all the responsibilities that be – that attend to being very, very thoughtful on your compliance, about
reproaching your customer, care and doing everything the right way as best you can, and if you don't get it right as soon
as you figure it out. So not a lot would change for us. And we've actually not enjoined with some of the smaller
regional banks in trying to reduce some of that relief, because we just don't think it would change the way we run our
bank.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Richard K. Davis
Yeah. Hey, before we close, since I get to the last question, I just – couple of thoughts on the bank and the
environment. We do believe that the rate environment, steeper yield curve than it was 90 days ago, likelihood of
interest rates, we think those are bankable. We think banks deserve that, long overdue, and it's going to get better.

That's part of our modeling, and we think that's important.
Economy being better is actually trumps all of that. A really good economy, we're a reflection of what our customers
feel. And when that economy kicks in, and we hope it does, that'll be more important than anything. But, we're
disappointing as you might be to hear it, we're like canaries in a mine. We can see balance sheets, we can see customer
behavior. Optimism is high, but actions are not present yet. So, we're going to wait and see on that one.
And then tax reform might be the big one that benefits us and our customers. As I said earlier, based on my
understanding of the budget process, it's probably going to be a late-year issue. So I think banks should bank, you
should bank on banks doing well by the interest rate environment. I think you should expect the economy and taxes to
be two of the best benefits that will occur, probably even bigger than rate, but I think those come later in the year. And
we're balancing the bank to manage through a slight beneficial quarter one and two, and a much more beneficial
probably quarter three and four.
And this is my last call, 41 of them. So I just want to tell you guys how much I appreciate – as a class of investors and
analysts, you have been fair and thoughtful and balanced. And you've treated this company very well, and I appreciate
that very much. We've also been kind and transparent. We've been very complete and thorough in our forecasting. And
I think we've been as candid as we know how to be, because we trust that the relationship that we have with you is part
based on transparency and clarity. So I want to thank you for that relationship. I want to encourage you to keep that
relationship with us. Terry and Andy will be a remarkable team, and despite the fact that I want things to change for the
betterment of this company, I think you'll be appreciative that they'll be thoughtful and measured and very well
telegraphed.
So to end on a sports note, because that's how I kind of think of my life, this is rather like a great relay race. And we're
on the back side of the track and Andy and I are running together now, because he is about to pick up the baton. He's
got the perfect cadence, I've got the perfect speed, our hands come together, the baton hands off and we're off to
another race. And that's exactly I hope you see it.
So, with that, operator, or Jen, I think you can close the call.
