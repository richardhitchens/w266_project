Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, thank you, Kaly, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we reported full year 2015
adjusted EPS of $6.30. That's at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you for last year. Sales were just north
of $56 billion and segment operating margins were a solid 16.7% for the year.
I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident in our full year 2016 adjusted
EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share. That's on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion.
As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress the team has made
on our strategic priorities. First of all, we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we
returned $12 billion to shareowners. And most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.
As you know, we announced and closed the sale of Sikorsky for a very good price, $9 billion, and that generated a $3.4
billion after-tax gain in the fourth quarter and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in
November.
As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses that's creating and supplying innovative
and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a
better organic growth profile, it will have higher operating margins, and will have stronger cash flows.
We've also simplified the organization. We eliminated the Propulsion & Aerospace Systems layer and the Building &
Industrial Systems layer. That creates a flatter, more efficient structure with greater visibility and, importantly, greater
accountability. And we now have four focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable
top and bottom line growth.
On the cost front, we announced a $1.5 billion multi-year restructuring plan, and that included $400 million of
restructuring we initiated in 2015. That restructuring's focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the
company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million in run rate savings by 2019.
We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividends and share repurchase, and that includes
the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR this year, we continue to expect to return
at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase, plus more than $2 billion of dividends for the year.
Clearly, the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock. We'll continue our share repurchase program as
long as we feel there's a significant discount between the intrinsic value of UTC and the share price.
Flawless program execution continues to be a top priority, and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt
[Pratt & Whitney] powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the Marines back in July. The
A320neo aircraft was certified, the C Series aircraft was certified, both with Pratt's Geared Turbofan engines and a
number of UTAS systems.
The Mitsubishi Regional Jet also had its first flight, and the Embraer engine began testing on our flying test bed. These
are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business
as well.
I'm proud to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality. The first Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo was delivered
last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday. And we're meeting our commitments on day
one for fuel burn, emissions and noise; one of the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it
was supposed to on day one. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus. And let me be crystal clear:
we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.
On the commercial side, we continue to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and
the world's largest hotel, the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. In Climate, Controls & Security, we secured the new Atlanta
Braves stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Culture Centre in Kuwait, to name just a few.

So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015. And as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that
we laid out a year ago. That is, first of all, flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost
reduction and, most importantly perhaps, disciplined capital allocation.
We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver
differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long-term. So despite this mixed
macro environment that we're all facing, UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term sustainable top and
bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.
Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full year results, and I'll be back with a
closing comments and Q&A. Akhil?
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. So, I'm on slide two. Adjusted EPS was $6.30. That's down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly,
excluding a $0.19 impact from adverse foreign exchange. Full year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included
restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items.
As we told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter, so let me walk through a few of the larger pieces
that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press
release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.
The largest item is a $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty
obligation at Pratt Canada [Pratt & Whitney Canada]. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax-related items. Roughly
75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will
happen over the next couple of years.
Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters. $0.21 of that was at Aerospace
Systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual
position on a key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination.
At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an
analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim trend data, and most importantly, recent agreements
reached with insurers.
On the other side of the ledger, you'll recall in Q1 we had a gain on a fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of
a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture. That was a $0.14 benefit.
Now, net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in free cash flow to net income of 126%. In that
number, the benefit from net non-cash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25
points.
Moving to slide three. Organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow
growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas,
driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2%, primarily from continued pressure in the
Otis service business. And Asia was down 1%, due to China, where sales were down 4%.
Growth in commercial aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket, both at Pratt and UTAS. Military aerospace
sales were down 11%, mainly due to tough prior-year compare on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was
down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS.
I'm pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain delays they experienced in Q3 at the New England Logistic
Center [Northeast Logistics Center], or NELC. They are back to their pre-NELC engine delivery cadence and were on
schedule with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of yearend.

Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide 4, and just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant
basis as we usually do.
Overall trends remained broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio. In our commercial businesses,
we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis where North America new equipment orders
were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging
trends here.
At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market
and tough compares in unitary. For the full year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the
quarter and up 5% for the full year.
EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter. Otis new equipment orders were strong, up 20%. At CCS, commercial
HVAC equipment orders were also up 4% while fire and security product orders were down 7%.
In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full year. On
the other hand, CCS fire and security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat, an improvement
compared to trends earlier in the year.
Moving to aerospace, revenue passenger miles continue to grow at slightly above the long-term trend rate and airline
profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter,
including a three-point benefit from sale of legacy engine hardware.
At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activity.
Now, before I let Paul take you through the additional details for 2015, let's [ph] talk (12:39) briefly about the first
quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economies as the year progresses and easier compares
in the second half, we expect 2016 to be back-end loaded.
Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings. Also, recall the
first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also
the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis
and lower negative engine margins at Pratt. Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.44 in
Q1 2015, and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of
2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in tension tailwind. As
Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60. With that, let me
hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul?
Paul Lundstrom
Okay, okay. Thanks, Akhil. So, turning to Otis on slide 5, in the quarter, sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant
currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure,
principally from China, and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in
China. Foreign exchange translation was an 8-point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from
foreign currency-related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter. New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26%
growth in North America and mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up
1% while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall, as mid single-digit growth in both Asia and the
Americas was offset by a 5% decline in EMEA. New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong
momentum in North America continued with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA,
new equipment orders were up 20% with strong growth in most major markets excluding Russia. New equipment
orders in China were down 14%, that's 8% on a unit basis, while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up
15%, excluding the impact of the Thomson Line metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.

For the full year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange
translation for the year had a nine-point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up
4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA, partially offset by a 10% decline in Asia, driven by the 13%
decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.
Moving to slide 6, Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 3% at constant currency with three points of tailwind from
net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from
restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five-point headwind to both sales and
earnings. During the quarter, we saw a continued sales growth in HVAC in North America where commercial HVAC
was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well, up 4% organically and Asia was down 7%, driven by a lower China.
Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and field
businesses globally. The fire and security business in China was up 9%. Our global refrigeration business was flat in
the quarter, with mid single-digit growth in Transicold, offset by mid single-digit decline in commercial refrigeration.
CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by last year's tough compare at Transicold. If
you recall last year Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter. In the fire and security business, we were
down mid single-digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector.
For the full year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency, driven by drop-through from the 3% organic sales
growth and productivity, including lower commodity costs. Shifting to Aerospace on slide 7, Pratt & Whitney's sales of
$4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter, supported by
low-teens growth in the commercial engines business, primarily from the V2500, up 26% in the quarter, and
approximately $60 million from a sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine
deliveries and large commercial OE sales were also down 15% primarily on engine mix as Pratt shipped more V2500
engines and fewer PW4000s than in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume along with higher negative
engine margin and pension headwind were largely offset by drop-through from the stronger commercial aftermarket,
continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience. For the full year, Pratt's sales were down 1%
organically, driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial
aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension,
negative engine margin, and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial
aftermarket and lower E&D spending.
Turning to slide eight, Aerospace Systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter. Consistent with the last three
quarters, sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales
with no margins. Excluding those pass-through sales, the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter with
growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in
the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished
the year with a book-to-bill of 1.0 times.
Military OE sales were down high single-digit in the quarter, driven by declines in the C-17 and other programs, and
the military aftermarket was down as well, about 1%. Aerospace Systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The
year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began
transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These
headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering
spending was essentially flat in the quarter.
For the full year, Aerospace Systems sales grew 3% organically with about two points of benefit from the pass-through
sales mentioned before. Profits for Aerospace Systems were down 3% for the year driven by adverse OE mix, lower
military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering
expense, income from licensing agreements, and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable
aftermarket contract adjustments.

So with that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Good. Thanks, Paul. You know, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, I am encouraged by the progress the team
is making. With the actions we've taken, we're much better positioned for the future. There is, of course, some
uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. If you think about the three biggest markets for UTX,
starting with the U.S., I think it's a relatively solid outlook for U.S.GDP growth, despite what we've seen in the equity
markets in January. China, as you know, is working through some structural challenges, and in Europe we're starting to
see signs that the recovery continues apace. Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American
markets and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit
the year.
China will be down for 2016, but let's keep China in perspective. While it's certainly experiencing some challenges as it
grapples with reform and rebalances its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer consumption economy,
its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see 100 million people urbanize in the next five years
or so in China, and by 2025 there are forecast to be 221 million cities [sic] in China with more than 1 million
inhabitants. Just to put that in perspective, today, in Europe there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants. so
urbanization will continue to be a powerful force and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses
going forward.
On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow. We saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth. And the
airlines are making money and the backlogs are there. Right now for UTC it's about program execution and program
costs. Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 to $58
billion.
Given the portfolio and the team we have today, I've never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our
long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry-leading franchises, global scale and solid market
fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth and the global expansion and continued
urbanization of the middle class, have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future. And all of
this will create long-term shareowner value.
It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people
rely on every single day. Our products enable modern life and are installed in service for decades, regardless of the
economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service, and
our balance geographically will help us weather these uncertain times.
Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition at Pratt. I'd like to first of all take a minute to welcome Bob
Ladue back to UTC. You'll recall Bob is the new President of Pratt Whitney, following the announcement of Paul
Adams' retirement earlier this month. As you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky, and Bob's leadership was
instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year. I'd also like to thank Paul Adams for his many
contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last six years in bringing all of these engines to the
marketplace. We wish Paul nothing but success in the future.
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kaly?
Q&A

[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Good morning. Just a question first on the organic sales trends. So should we expect organic
sales overall to be down a few points in Q1 and then sort of stable in Q2 and then up kind of low mid-single digit in the
back half to get to that 1% to 3% guide for the year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes, I think it's probably going to be more in the 0% to 1% range in the first quarter. It's not likely
to be negative. I think there were some tough compares but close to 0% to 1% I would say. And then, slowly improving
as the year progresses.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You got to keep in mind, Julian, we still see, despite what we saw in China for Otis, new
equipment orders continue to be up globally. And I would think that backlog will continue to play out. So, Otis should
have a very solid year outside of China. And Europe is recovering. So again, it's not all doom and gloom here.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Sure. And then on Otis, secondly, a tough margin performance in Q4. You guided in
December, I think, for about a $250 million price mix headwind this year. Just wanted to check how confident you feel
in that guidance for now and maybe explain a little bit when you think we should start to see some of those market
share improvements show up in orders or revenues.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So, I think the pricing pressure is continuing to be there, to the point you made. We did see
increased pricing pressure in China this quarter and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its
pricing environment as of now.
On the other hand, there is additional cost improvements that Otis is continuing to push for. A part of the commodity
tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side. Remember, they have 40,000
service vehicles, so the lower the gasoline prices are the better it is from a service cost point of view. So, we continue to
look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure. But net-net, pricing is probably slightly higher than what we
were thinking in December.
Now, with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian, keep in mind we took a significant mark-to-market FX hit
in the quarter which impacted margins by nearly 100 basis points, which is not normal for Otis. So just for that, Q4
margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Julian.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: ...very much. Just to talk about GTF, I realize it's quite an accomplishment, Greg, but
there's an enormous industrialization challenge. And we've clearly gotten some indications from Airbus that it's going
to be go slow before you go fast. So, could you articulate how you're going to move forward with the engine so that the
customer acceptance is flawless?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Howard, it's a great question. As I mentioned many times over the past year, the single
biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can
actually improve overall performance at Pratt.
You're exactly right, there is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year. No change to the full year,
however. We still expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines. Most of those, of course, will go to Airbus. There will be
some going to Bombardier for the C Series aircraft.

But I think, again, we're following the lead of Airbus on this, but we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping
up production, relatively slowly entry into service. And we want to have flawless entry into service across all of the
airline customers and this gives us the opportunity to ensure that exactly happens.
So far, it's been wonderful at Lufthansa this week since we put the engine into service and we expect that trend to
continue. The engine's in great shape technically and we will focus again on supply chain execution throughout the
year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there. He spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on
this. And this is going to be the game for Pratt this year.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: But just to follow up, you wouldn't have made this management change if execution
weren't part of the issue. And so, how do we think about the P&L impact? And also, the ramp in 2017 is stunningly
high and probably not achievable the way you've laid it out. I mean we're going to see a restructuring of some form,
because you're not going to get there, I think, under the old plan.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Howard, did you get cranky this morning and forget your coffee? Let me just, first of all...
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: No, but it's just like – no, but in all seriousness, Greg, I mean, you have a remarkable
optimism but I want you to plan for the downside so that we can – you see something that's a little bit better, but that
hill is huge.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Howard, I couldn't agree with you more. It is a huge hill to climb. Let me, first of all, just go
back to your first comment. Paul's retirement was sudden. It wasn't expected. But you got to give Paul credit. He is the
guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification. And working
non-stop for the last six years, you understand why Paul wanted to take a pause.
We're very fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of Sikorsky to hit the ground running over there,
and Bob knows the business. He was at Pratt for more than 30 years, he's been at UTC for more than 35 years. He
knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operations side. And the team is focused on it.
I think, again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us a chance to make sure the supply
chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. And I'll tell you, Howard, with all of the money that we have spent
on the capital and infrastructure within the UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These
engines don't take long to assemble. It's a question of just making sure all of the parts are there on time. And that's what
the focus is going to be at Pratt, as well as driving the cost down.
So just because Bob's coming in, there is no change to Pratt's guidance. Let me be clear on that; there's no change to the
ramp schedule. 2017 is, I'll remind you, 12 months away. I'm not going to give guidance on 2017, but we remain
confident along with Airbus that we'll be able to meet their requirements going into the next couple of years.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next
question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: A question for Akhil, actually. Akhil, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more
granularity on Q1 at the segment level. It sounded like you were highlighting more of a revenue growth challenge
against tough comparison, CCS and UTAS. Obviously, we know about the margin pressure at Pratt. Presumably, those
early deliveries have a very negative engine margin. Not just the sort of averages that you guys talk about, but you also

kind of called out negative mix impacts on UTAS on the OEM front.
I was just wondering if you could just help us a little bit more at the segment level in understanding those trends and
how we work through the year. I know you talked about E&D tailwinds as well. Where will we see those primarily at
Pratt? Any extra color would be helpful.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So, I think the trends, unfortunately, as you know, at the segment level, 2016 is a year where
only CCS is talking about a growth in earnings. So, the challenge with first quarter is a little more pronounced in the
case of UTAS, in the case of Pratt, and in the case of Otis, where they will recover as the year progresses but the first
quarter is going to be more than disproportionately down in earnings at those segments relative to their full year
guidance, right? It's the mix at UTAS that you talked about, Carter, it's the continuing pricing challenge at Otis, and the
lack of service recovery yet in Europe.
CCS continues to do well, although that has a tough compare in the first quarter based on just the strong organic growth
they had, 5% organic growth last year...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, 6%.
<A - Akhil Johri>: ...6%. So, I think as a result, CCS will have a little bit of a challenge. The good news will come, as
I said, on the pension side which will flow through all of the segments and then the share count reduction which is the
effect of capital deployment that we have been doing.
So again, no surprises here, Carter. I don't want to let anybody feel that this is new news. This is something we knew all
along when we put the plan and our guidance together. It is just the way the structure of the year is.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yeah. So, just trying to get the cadence right. So effectively, Q1 will mark the low point for
all four segments?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, on the GTF there was a comment in the release today about hitting all its key
performance requirements. But could you just update us on the cooling issue, where that stands getting a fix there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, David, we continue to make progress there. I think we talked about this in detail in
December. I will tell you that the Pratt team has identified the fixes. It's a software fix and a minor hardware fix.
Just to be clear, every next-generation commercial engine out there has to cool down to a uniform thermal before they
start the engine. So, this is not something endemic just to the GTF. The starting time of the cooling is a little longer
than what the customers would have liked. These changes that we're talking about on software and the hardware, again,
relatively simple to do. Not a big cost. And I think importantly, doesn't change any of the fuel burn or noise or
emissions on the engine. These are really pretty minor changes.
If you guys are looking for something to worry about, worry about things we don't control like FX. I wouldn't worry
about the technical aspects of this GTF. It is rock solid.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, when would you expect the fix to be in the market?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So we expect – the hardware comes in for the changes in our February build. We'll get those
out by – towards the end of the second quarter, you'll actually see those out there in deliveries.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay, great. And...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So again...
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Go ahead.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I was just going to say, given the slow ramp, it's actually beneficial. There's not going to be a
lot of engines out there with the old hardware. We'll retrofit those over the course of the next year. So again, we expect
the impact to the customers to be very minimal.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And a follow-up, on the aftermarket, pretty good numbers this quarter both at Pratt and
UTAS. How are you feeling relative to the forecast you've given for 2016? I think pretty much flat to low-single-digit
growth. Do you think maybe there could be upside or how do you feel overall? Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look, we're very encouraged by what we saw at the fourth quarter. We've been talking about
aftermarket growth. RPMs are up, as I said, 7%. We expect them to be up at least 5%, 5.5% this year. Airline
profitability remains very, very strong. So, we expect the guidance that we gave, clearly we have a very good shot at
that. And if there's upside, we'll talk about that at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning the year.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. That works, thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Ron.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Good morning, Ron.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: So, a big picture question for you. I think I've been covering you guys almost 15 years and
you've been doing restructuring for 15 years. When do we finally see a return on all this restructuring? It's like billions
a year. Like, when does that happen?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, Ron, we've been doing restructuring – I've been here 26 years and I think every year we
have done restructuring amongst those 26 years. The fact is we see the payoff all the time. As I think about the latest
big tranche of restructuring, that's 2009 to 2014, we did about $3 billion of restructuring. You saw a big payoff of that
restructuring, in fact almost $3 billion of run rate savings.
We'll continue to see savings on this next tranche of restructuring. It's about $1.5 billion over four years, from 2015
through 2018. By 2019, you should see about $900 million of run rate savings.
The fact of the matter is, you got to keep doing this. This is in the DNA of UTC, is to take cost out, to do more with
less, it's about productivity every day, because the world just gets more competitive. Had we not done the restructuring
in the past, we wouldn't be where we are today in terms of product cost and global scale. So it's real, it's necessary, and
it's things that we know how to do.
<A - Akhil Johri>: It's also, Ron, since you're talking big picture, I'll step back also on a big picture basis and remind
you of the operating margin that UTC had in mid-1990s when we started doing restructuring. It was 6% and it is 16.7%

now. And a lot of that margin expansion had been fueled by this continuous restructuring that we do, taking cost out.
I would also put our SG&A rates against any industrial company, and you'll see that our aerospace companies are
best-in-class in terms of SG&A as a percent of sales as are our commercial companies. So, all that has been fuelled.
Where we need to continue to work on is reducing our manufacturing footprint, as Greg talked about in December,
where we have 42 million square feet of which 22 million square feet are still in high cost locations, and we need to
continue to work on that. So, productivity is a way of life at UTC. As Greg said, it is part of the DNA and we just need
to keep doing that.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay. And then, just one quick detail. That $900 million to the Canadian government -- is
that the Bombardier tax? Can you give us more color -- what is that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Go ahead.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So, look, over the last several years, we've had these agreements, multiple agreements with the
Canadian government, through which they would provide reimbursement for portion of our E&D. We had, in turn,
promised certain jobs in Canada and certain supply chain related investments. And in return, we had to pay royalties for
several years.
So, where we stood at the end of last year was we had 20 years-plus of variable high royalty payments looking ahead
for us, and all we did was crystallize that liability into a certain payment at this point of time which we'll pay off in four
years.
Net-net, it's good news for both the Canadian government and for us. We've essentially given back the E&D funding
that they had given to us. We've also taken advantage of a good exchange rate in the process. Canadian dollar is at a
pretty decent rate right now, and so I think net-net it's a pretty good thing to do.
<Q - Ronald Jay Epstein>: Okay, that make sense, all right. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. And, once again, as a reminder, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next question
comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So, I joined a little bit late, but maybe tell us how many GTFs you
delivered in the fourth quarter. And you have mentioned that supplier issues kind of are a potential bottleneck. Where
are you on that? And are there any other kind of potential kind of restraints beyond the cooling issue? Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, Cai, I think total deliveries on GTF in the fourth quarter were only five. And keep in
mind that goes to 200 this year.
As I think about the technical aspects of the engine, as I said before, this cooling issue has really proved to be a
nonissue. We've got that issue behind us, I believe. And as far as the rest of the engine goes, so far it's been rock-solid.
You know, it's 15% better on fuel burn, it's 50% better on emissions, it's 75% better on noise than the engine it's
replacing, and it's been proven in both the development program and in flight tests to meet all of those criteria. And I
think you're going to see airlines lining up to get this. We've got orders for more than 7,000 of these engines, keep in
mind.
As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp-up. Again, we're ramping
down the V2500, ramping up the GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine. The fact is there's probably 5 or 10 that
cause us concern on a daily basis. Ladue and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis. We've
been putting a lot of resources in the supply chain. So there's no one supplier I would call out here other than to say that
we're on top of all of the suppliers, making sure that they meet their commits. Keep in mind that 80% of this engine

Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gents.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Mr. Sprague.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Good morning. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the commercial companies. Just couldn't
keep up with all the color on CCS. It was unclear to me the comment about commercial orders down. Did that include
Transicold in that commentary? Could you just speak to the actual commercial HVAC end market and what you're
seeing there in the quarter in sales and orders?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, sure, Jeff. So we talked about CCS equipment orders in the quarter being down 5%.
That was largely driven by declines in Transicold, which if you recall last year we talked about Transicold orders being
up more than 50%. So some of that's compare.
If you look at sort of the cross – some of the other product lines, global commercial HVAC was down about 2% driven
by a softer North America. And both the fire and security products business and the field businesses were down a little
bit as well. I guess one bright spot on the fire and security side was that China was actually up in the quarter about 8%
and that was driven by our fire detection and alarm business in [ph] Ching Wan Dau (44:38) that's the GST business,
which saw better order rates comings out of their – the commercial vertical.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And the comment about weakness in U.S. export-related -- was that also a Transicold
comment or is there something else?
<A - Akhil Johri>: It was commercial. It is largely to do with some of the projects in the Middle East, if you will, on
the export side where we've seen some weakness.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Commercial HVAC.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Commercial HVAC.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Right. And maybe just shifting gears. So you decided to take a charge and bite the bullet on
repatriation. Do you see more of that as we move forward or you just – kind of is that a one-time opportunity you're
taking, given the gain on Sikorsky and other dynamics in the quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, it was just – we were trying to be opportunistic. I think it will bring back about $1.4
billion as a result of that charge. I think the effective tax rate on that is about 17%. So we thought it made sense to do
that, given what we're trying to do this year in terms of another $3 billion of share buyback and $2 billion-plus of
dividends, it just seemed to be the most advantageous way to get at that cash. There are no further plans to take charges
like that. We bring back $500 million to $1 billion dollars a year anyways from overseas at typically a relatively low
tax cost, but this was just kind of a one-time item and probably won't be repeating in the future, or the near future at
least.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And if I can just sneak one more in. The Europe Otis service just doesn't seem to want to
totally stabilize. Can you give a little bit more color there? The end markets overall seem to be getting a little bit better.
Do you still think that traditional lag effect will kick in, that better tenor on equipment will feed back into service or is

there some other dynamic there?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. You're exactly right, Jeff. I think if you look at what makes the service revenue go up, it's
essentially conversion of new equipment coming out of warranty into service contracts and that has been anemic in
Europe, as you know. The fact that new equipment orders are starting to be up, new equipment sales in EMEA was up
in the fourth quarter as well. Those will translate into service contracts further down the line. The other aspect is also
that the modernization side of the service business has been hurt significantly as some of these regulations have worked
itself out, primarily in France. And I think we've hit bottom there. Modernization backlog is actually up so that should
start to turn around as well. So the combination of new equipment sales turning into service contracts and
modernization improving should start to turn that but it is going to be a slow process, as you said, Jeff, it's not going to
turn right away.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Jeff, just to put a couple data points around that, we talked about Europe new
equipment orders or EMEA new equipment orders being up 20%, they are also up better than 20% for the year
including Western Europe, which was also up double digits. So that's encouraging. And then to Akhil's points on the
mod side, if you look at the end of 2014, we finished the year with mod backlog down in the teens. It was essentially
flat in 2015, now flat, but we'd rather see up. But it's certainly a better starting point going into 2016 than what we saw
last year.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Great, thank you for that.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my call here. Just going back to China on the
commercial businesses and the comment that you made that there was a bit of a disconnect between HVAC and fire
and security orders relative to Otis. Can you just provide a little bit more color on why that disconnect has developed
and let us know whether you think one is a leading indicator over the other, meaning does HVAC and fire and security
begin to follow Otis or are we going to begin to see a reversal of Otis and see some better things to come, more in line
with what we've got at HVAC and fire and security?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As you think about Otis in China, 60%-plus of the Otis business relates to residential
construction. And that, of course, is the market that has been the most hurt by I would say the overbuilding and –
maybe some of the over-leverage that we've seen in the Chinese economy in the last five or six years. So it's not
surprising to see the Otis orders down a lot more than the rest of the business. On the commercial industrial side, you
see again orders were flattish on our commercial HVAC business. That's really what we see in the overall industrial
economy. There's not much growth, but it's not declining the same way the residential space is. And if you look at the
fire products, that is really more of a consumer-driven purchase as opposed to residential construction or even
industrial. And that was up 8%.
So as China makes this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more
of these trends continue. But urbanization's not done. As I said, you've still got a huge population of people moving to
the cities. We're not giving up on the residential elevator market, we still see growth there. We see a lot more growth, I
think, on the service side. Otis' service business, I think we were servicing 165,000 elevators at the end of the year,
that's up about 20%. We expect another 20% kind of growth as we go into 2016. So, the dynamics are not
unexplainable, I think you just need to peel it back a layer and understand the individual dynamics of the businesses.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. We covered a lot of ground, so just wanted to ask a couple quick cleanup questions here. So,
going back to the $1.5 billion of charges in the quarter. Is that all cash? And then, specifically on the Canadian R&D
reimbursement, does that have future implications for margins? It feels like the royalty payment that goes away in the
future years.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure. So, the second question first, Nigel. The Canadian royalty trade off would probably be a $30
million benefit in 2016, but it would result in about $100 million EBIT benefit four, five years out, when the E&D
reimbursements were expected to be there, which are going away now, and the royalty payments go away as well. So,
definitely benefit to Pratt four or five years out of about $100 million or so a year.
With regard to overall, the cash charges, a lot of these payments, the Canadian payment, which is the largest one of the
$1.5 billion charge that you referred to is cash. In 2016, we would probably have a $500 million cash outflow as a
result of these charges that we've taken in Q4 of this year. Roughly $250 million or so from Canada and another $250
million or so for this tax – tax-related cash repatriation, if you will, right? So, that's the impact. The rest of it will follow
over the course of the next few years.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, that's really helpful. And then, just quickly on the CCS. I know this question's been asked a
few times, but the down 5% orders, do you have the backlog number to hand? How did the backlog look
year-over-year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: The backlog, we can get you the exact number later on, but I do believe the backlog was – because
the full year was up for commercial HVAC. And the sales were up slightly more, so backlog may be slightly down is
what I am guessing. But we'll get you the exact number.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Don't have the number handy, but I would just remind you that on CCS it's a relatively
quick turn. Not relatively, very quick turn. So, on the HVAC side, you're going to turn orders in a few weeks up to as
high as maybe three months. And on the fire and security side, it's essentially a book and ship business. So, I would say
backlog's a lot more important on the Otis side than CCS.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

competitively positioned with this announced JCI-Tyco merger in commercial building services. We talked about
potential consolidation, so this is a big one here. Does that change the equation for you guys at all?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Not very much, Deane. I think Tyco's fire business, if you think about it, is primarily a field
business, it's about 75% field, 25% product. We obviously compete against them in both the field and the product.
We're actually more heavily weighted to the product side than the field side. And as far as JCI goes on their building
efficiency side, obviously we compete with them against -- with Carrier. But, again, they'll take some costs out, as I
think you saw in their press release, just similar to what Geraud and McDonough and Bill [ph] Pesch (53:42) did when
we put fire and security and Carrier together about three years ago. So, it's nice to see they're running our playbook

the asbestos liability? Have there been any changes, material changes, in your insurance coverage?
<A - Akhil Johri>: As I said earlier, I think we've looked at the potential from all the knowledge we have today of the
pending and future expected claims and adjusted that downward for the insurance agreements that we entered into in
Q4. So, net of those two is what you're seeing here. Hopefully we won't see any greater charges beyond this. But you
never know, right? But at this point, based on the best knowledge we had, Deane, we took that into account.
<Q - Deane Dray>: So just to clarify on the time horizon, we've seen companies take different approaches here. Did
you take what's called an end-of-life charge, which is as far as you can foresee? It sounds like that's in your answer. Or
did you do a ten-year reserve?
<A - Akhil Johri>: No, it's – end-of-life is the approach we took here.
<Q - Deane Dray>: That's great to hear, thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, [ph] Deane (55:03).

Thank you, and our last question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit about Pratt & Whitney? It looks like when you talked, I guess,
before you talked about -- I think it was $15 billion in revenues, looks like it came in a little bit less, even on an
adjusted basis, just with that military weakness, why was it a little bit light in the fourth quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sam, you're exactly right. If you think about the revenues in Q4, Pratt was a little short of
our expectations, even from December. While we hit on the earnings side, we were a little short – we're 100% on
contract at Pratt as we exited the year, both on the commercial and the military side, but we had expected to get a few
more engines out the door on the military side than what actually shipped. So there was a little bit of I'll say backlog
there that we had expected to get out.
<A - Akhil Johri>: The other one, Sam, there is the Pratt Canada business. As you know, the helicopter-related engine
shipments have been weak throughout the year. There's been also some weakness in the general aviation market,
particularly related to engines for the agricultural segment, et cetera. So I think Pratt Canada and military engines, those
were the two shortfalls versus a few months ago.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: And just on Otis, can you just talk a little bit sequentially from the third quarter to the
fourth quarter, there's over a 200-basis-point shrink in the margin on an adjusted basis. Is that foreign exchange, is that
the R&D stuff that you've talked about? I mean, what, what [indiscernible] (56:33).
<A - Akhil Johri>: I know – yes, Sam, it's largely due to the foreign exchange. Because as you recall, Q3 had a
positive roughly $30 million benefit from mark-to-market adjustments and that almost entirely reversed in Q4. So if
you adjust for those things, I think the adjusted margins are not that far off quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Great, thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks.
