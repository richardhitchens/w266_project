Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This quarter was a good start to another important year for Entergy.
We accomplished what we set out to do by successfully executing on our to-do list. We closed the acquisition of Union
Power Station, finalized our Arkansas rate case, received a final order in our Distribution Cost Recovery Factor filing
in Texas, filed our first FRP with forward-looking features in Mississippi, completed the ANO NRC inspection,
received confirmation from the New York ISO that the shutdown at Fitzpatrick will not affect reliability in the region,
saw over 6% industrial sales growth versus last year, and today we are reporting first quarter operational earnings per
share of a $1.35, above what we expected. Well, that's a good start. We are also aware that it's early in the year and we
face challenges ahead, but we are confident that we can manage these and deliver on our earnings commitments for the
year as well as our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other long-term outlook.
Our results for this quarter are the outcome of the strategy we have been pursuing for some time to create sustainable
value for all of our stakeholders in 2016 and beyond. At the Utility, investing to benefit customers, while maintaining
competitive rates with ready access to capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, which provides the
financial flexibility we need to make these investments. And at EWC, continuing to reduce our footprint to limit
exposure from assets not supported by the market. We've already materially reduced our size, risk, and volatility
through the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center and the shutdown of Vermont Yankee. This trend will only
accelerate as Pilgrim and FitzPatrick come offline. We will continue to emphasize safe operations, regulatory
compliance, and commercial diligence at all sites.
If you turn your attention to our to-do list on slide three. On March 3, we closed the acquisition of Union Power
Station. This acquisition is both an important driver in achieving our 2016 earnings expectation and also one more
important step in our broader plan to modernize our fleet and provide lower-cost reliable generation for our customers.
Recovery of the cost of this investment in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans effectively began simultaneously with the
transaction's close, thanks to a collaborative agreement between our team, our regulators and other participants who
recognized the benefits of this investment for our customers. Another important component of our supply plan is
building the St. Charles Power Station. The hearing at the LPSC began April 18 and is expected to conclude today.
Thus, we expect that the LPSC will be able to take up the certification decision in August.
This is an important investment to serve our customers in Louisiana and is an example of the infrastructure
development that we are undertaking to position the utility for the future. Beyond generation, we also continue to make
significant progress in providing benefits to our customers through our transmission investments.
We officially kicked off Entergy Louisiana's Lake Charles transmission project, with a wire cutting ceremony in
March. Once completed, this $159 million project will support continued reliability and service to a rapidly growing
area in our service territory.
On the regulatory front, we've also made progress towards better aligning the timing of our investments with the needs
of our customers going forward. This will improve access to the capital needed to make the investments required to
enhance the reliability and capability of our system and provide lower costs, more environmentally-friendly sources of
generation for the benefit of our customers. This ultimately supports economic development in our service territory,
which strengthens communities, creates jobs, and brings more financial stability to the regions we support.
This quarter, we filed or concluded several major proceedings. First, we received the final order in our Arkansas rate
case, and rate adjustments became effective on February 24. We'll make our first formula rate plan filing in July under
the new framework using a future test year, which will bring more predictability and strength to Entergy Arkansas'
financial profile. This new regulatory structure is the result of collaboration among a broad group of stakeholders and
will help us be a stronger partner to attract jobs and economic expansion to Arkansas.
Last month, Moody's acknowledged this view with an upgrade to Entergy Arkansas' long-term rating. Entergy
Mississippi has also begun to utilize its new formula rate plan with forward-looking features. We made its first filing in
March 15. The filing reflects an anticipated earned ROE for the 2016 test year that is below the FRP bandwidth,
indicating a $32.6 million rate increase to a point within the FRP bandwidth that reflects a 9.96% earned ROE.

A final order on that filing is expected before the end of the second quarter with the resulting rate adjustments to
become effective around midyear. And in February, the administrative law judge issued a proposal for decision with
the Public Utility Commission of Texas on our transmission cost recovery filing.
Based on the proposal for decision, we estimate $10 million to $11 million annual recovery on transmission spend
incremental to base rates. Use of this rider, along with the distribution cost rider we've been utilizing since January of
2016 will bring us greater financial flexibility to support the needs of our customers in Texas.
The Louisiana Commission also recently opened two generic dockets on the income tax and corporate structure
questions. The dockets were initiated in response to specific commissioner concerns regarding the Cleco transaction
and the implications of that transaction's structure on taxes and ratemaking. While the dockets are generic and affect all
LPSC jurisdiction utilities, we believe that the scope of the documents will be narrowly focused on those types of
structures that gave rise to the dockets, and not on broader policy issues like tax normalization or tax-related matters
previously approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.
Furthermore, we've worked constructively and transparently with the LPSC on tax-related matters. The LPSC is
familiar with our tax positions, which have resulted in significant benefits to our customers. The commission has two
items regarding the Cleco transaction on its business and Executive Session Agenda on April 28, and we are hopeful
they will take that opportunity to clarify the scope of these dockets. We do not expect significant effects for ELL as a
result of these dockets.
Finally, we carefully monitor the effects of investments and rate actions on our customers' bills, which today remain on
average 20% to 25% below the national average. In fact, our average residential rates remain below $0.10 per kilowatt
hour.
Looking forward, we continue to explore solutions that will meet our customers' changing expectations and the
evolving landscape of the utility industry. By introducing new technologies in renewable energy resources, we can
build a grid that is cleaner, more resilient, and affordable and provides innovative opportunities in the way we interact
and generate power for the benefit of all of our customers.
We are active on the renewables front with solar pilot programs underway in Mississippi, New Orleans, and Arkansas.
Entergy Mississippi has completed three solar installations in three different locations, each capable of generating 500
kilowatts. Entergy New Orleans has begun construction of the one megawatt solar generation project with
state-of-the-art battery storage technology and Entergy Arkansas has entered into a power purchase agreement to
facilitate construction of an 81 megawatt solar generating facility, which could be online as early as 2018.
These are the first steps towards assessing feasibility of utility scale solar generation, a resource that provides one way
to help meet our voluntary commitment, to stabilize our carbon dioxide emissions and reduce our environmental
footprint. At the same time, in 2015, our existing generating fleet continue to produce electricity at one of the lowest
carbon dioxide emission rates in United States. We are building on these pilot programs and we've initiated three new
requests for proposals for renewable side generation resources to help meet long-term resource planning objectives in
our service territory.
These RFPs are seeking up to 200 megawatts of capacity for Louisiana, 100 megawatts for Arkansas, and 20
megawatts for New Orleans. Beyond pilot programs, we've also created a commercial development and innovation
team dedicated to evaluating and integrating other new technologies in our operating model. That team focuses on
addressing customer needs and expectations through product and service innovation, technology deployment, and
alternative service models and will also research and develop enabling technologies that enhance the distribution grid
and provide higher service and reliability to all of our customers.
For example, as I mentioned last quarter, we are moving forward with the process to install advanced meters in our
distribution system. At our Analyst Day in June, we'll give you more details around the next steps for deployment of
advanced meters, and similar to our approach for our supply plan back in 2014, we will provide the initial strokes
around broader plans for other potential grid modernization efforts to be followed with more details over time.

I'll take a moment now to talk about initiatives to improve our nuclear operations. First of all, our plants are safe. If
they weren't, they would not be running. But this past year, the performance of our nuclear fleet as a whole was not in
line with our standards. Operational excellence is integral to our business model and a core competency we must
maintain to maximize value for all of our stakeholders.
We've made it a top priority in 2016 to strengthen the culture of operational excellence throughout our organization. I'd
like to extend my thanks to Tim Mitchell who started us down this path, is our Interim Chief Nuclear Officer, and
welcome Chris Bakken, who has officially joined us as Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. Reporting
directly to me, Chris will now lead these efforts in the nuclear organization.
In January as part of a comprehensive fleet wide performance improvement plan, we formed a corporate event response
team with industry assistance around best practices and increased engagement with all stakeholders. We are evaluating
nuclear operations across our fleet from top to bottom and we continue to evaluate the need for process changes at each
individual plant. And it's not just about column four; our main long-term objective is sustained operational excellence
across our fleet. This could result in incremental nuclear spending and we are working hard to mitigate any financial
implications.
At ANO, the NRC completed its supplemental inspection and announced those results at a public meeting earlier this
month. The NRC is confident that the problems have been identified, and a comprehensive plan is being implemented
to correct them. The NRC is expected to issue a confirmatory action letter in the next several weeks and we plan to give
you an update at Analyst Day.
Finally, it's important to emphasize that the NRC did recognize that the plant is safe to continue power operations and
that the actions taken to date have further improved the margin of safety, not only at ANO, but at all of our other
nuclear facilities.
Pilgrim is also working toward process improvements and the NRC will complete a supplementary inspection of that
plant that will focus on the corrective action program weaknesses that resulted in entry into Column 4, and a safety
culture assessment. We will inform the NRC when we are ready for that inspection, which we expect to be in the
second half of this year.
Also, after careful consideration of the circumstances surrounding the plant's operations, we intend to refuel the plant in
spring of 2017 and run the plant safely through its current capacity market commitments with the ISO New England
until the planned shutdown date of May 31, 2019.
At Indian Point, we are committed to resolving performance deficiencies and ensuring recovery in plant performance.
We performed and completed comprehensive inspections during our planned refueling outage at Unit 2. We detected
additional work involving baffle bolts, which we will fully address before restarting the plant. Subject to the
completion of engineering analysis, we expect to be done with the additional work and have the plant back online
around late June.
Finally, we remain focused on safely operating the FitzPatrick plant through January 27, 2017, followed by a safe
shutdown and eventual decommissioning of the facility. The decisions to shut down assets are very difficult, and we are
proud of our employees who remain focused on safe operations and finishing strong. I reiterate our commitment to
support them and the communities affected by the difficult decisions we've made for these plants.
Speaking of the communities we serve, we recognize that we play an important role as a corporate citizen in every
region where we operate and our core values resonate in the ways we support our communities. Improving educational
and economic opportunities for customers and our communities is one way we demonstrate our commitment. As part of
a five-year $5 million initiative to support workforce development training, we made a $250,000 grant to Jobs for
America's Graduates. This program equips at-risk youth with the skills needed to transition successfully to careers or
college, addressing critical workforce needs, closing skill gaps and creating a competitive advantage for local
communities. The benefits of a program like this one are long-lasting, providing opportunities for those who might not
otherwise have some, and helping to raise the standard of living for a family for generations to come.

We've also made a two-year $450,000 grant to the Red Cross to support disaster response in our communities. Recent
floods damaged nearly 13,000 homes in Louisiana and damage is still being assessed from this month's floods in Texas,
highlighting the importance of a fast response in times of disaster. Through our partnership with the Red Cross, Entergy
is able to direct funds to communities following storms or other disasters as they are needed, allowing help to be
provided more quickly to those in need.
I'm also proud of our initiatives which help us maintain a diverse and engaged workforce. Veterans and active
Reservists make valuable contributions to our company and in recognition of our efforts to support the National Guard
and Reserve members, we've been selected as a finalist for the 2016 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom
Award. We are pleased to be considered for this honor and we appreciate the sacrifices these employees and their
families make in their service to our country, as well as the unique skills and experiences that they bring to Entergy.
These are just some of the efforts that got us ranked top quartile in Corporate Responsibility Magazine's annual list of
the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. This is the seventh time we've been included on this list, which recognizes companies
taking sustainable, responsible actions in areas such as employee relations, philanthropy and community support,
environment and climate change. Nowhere are these qualities more apparent than when our employees go above and
beyond to serve our customers during their most difficult times.
Many of you may have seen or read about the significant flooding in our service territory this quarter, though our
system withstood the conditions quite well. Our employees were also very diligent in safely restoring power to those
that needed it, repairing damaged infrastructure, and even saving lives.
I'm excited by all that we've done so far in 2016 to execute on our strategy. This quarter was a good start to the year.
The major undertakings we've completed will help drive our 2016 results. We're also aware of the challenges ahead and
more work needs to be done to deliver on our commitments for the year.
Everything we do is designed to support our objective to create value for each of our four stakeholders. We strive to
deliver top quartile returns for our owners, provide top quartile satisfaction for our customers, achieve top quartile
organizational health scores and top decile safety performance for our employees and maintain an active role in
supporting our communities by achieving top decile performance for corporate social responsibility.
With these objectives in minds, we remain focused on the strategy we've developed to achieve those objectives.
Steadily grow the utility by investing to benefit customers while maintaining competitive rates with ready access to
capital and timely and predictable investment recovery, providing the financial strength and flexibility we need to make
those investments and continue to reduce the EWC footprint, while ensuring safe operations, regulatory compliance,
and commercial due diligence for our assets. We're off to a good start and we'll continue to execute through the
remainder of the year on the plans that we've laid out.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo. Good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, this was a good start to the year. Let's get straight to the
results for the quarter.
Turning to slide four, our operational earnings, excluding special items, were $1.35 per share, higher than we expected.
This compares to $1.68 a year ago. This quarter's results varied from last year due to the effects of weather and a 2015
income tax item at Utility, Parent & Other and lower wholesale power prices at EWC.
These declines were partially offset by growth in the Utility business, in both periods, as reported results included
special items related to EWC nuclear plants that we've identified to close. These special items are for severance and
retention costs as well as capital spending, which is being expensed.
Turning to Utility, Parent & Other results on slide five. Operational earnings per share decreased $0.13
quarter-over-quarter. However, the adjusted view on slide six, which excludes the effects of weather and income tax

items, increased $0.19. The growth in our base business is the result of our efforts in the last year to execute on our
strategy to make productive investment, to benefit customers and improve returns in our operating companies.
Consistent with that strategy, Entergy Arkansas rate case is an important driver for the quarterly results.
Rate adjustments were effective starting February 24 and included recovery for the Union Power Station acquisition. In
addition, the final order allowed for deferral of $0.06 of previously expensed Fukushima and flood barrier compliance
costs, which we collected over 10 years. Combined, these items contributed about $0.15 to this quarter's earnings.
A second driver of note was improved efforts to manage non-fuel O&M expense, which decreased $0.07 after
excluding the deferral I just noted. The scope for possible outage spending and benefit, costs including pension were
lower, while nuclear spending increased. This quarter, we also recorded a charge of approximately $0.05 associated
with [indiscernible] (20:53) in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales proceeding, which came out last Thursday.
Charge represents proportionate EAI's estimated liability that would be attributable to its wholesale business and is not
recoverable. This is a complex and technical case that continues on at the FERC and the ultimate outcome is uncertain.
We'll provide additional details in our Form 10-Q.
Turning to sales, we also saw earnings contribution from over 6% industrial sales growth. Slide seven provides a
breakdown of the increase. About 70% of this quarter's increase came from new and expansion customers across
several sectors as they continue to ramp and come online. Higher sales to existing customers were driven by petroleum
refiners as fewer and shorter outages drove industrial sales growth in the quarter. This is expected to continue into 2Q.
Growth in new and expansion customers are also expected to continue through the rest of the year. However, given
how strong refiners ran in the second half of last year and expected outages and changes in operational level later this
year, we expect industrial growth to be weighted towards the first half of 2016.
Turning to EWC's first quarter results summarized on slide eight, operational earnings were $0.51 in the current
quarter, $0.20 lower than the prior year. The single most significant factor was lower wholesale prices. The nuclear
fleet average price was down more than $8 per megawatt hour or nearly 13%.
In addition, realized earnings on decommissioning trusts declined due to last year's rebalancing activity for VY's trust,
which resulted in higher interest income in 2015. On the other hand, the effect of last year's impairments reduced
nuclear refueling outage and depreciation expenses which benefited earnings approximately $0.16 this quarter.
Slide nine shows operating cash flow for this quarter of $533 million, about $80 million lower than the same quarter in
2015. The largest driver was reduced net revenue at EWC.
Our 2016 earnings guidance is summarized on slide 10.
As of today, we see adjusted Utility, Parent & Other earnings at our guidance midpoint. Recall, this excludes the effects
of the any weather or tax items.
For our consolidated guidance, we must also consider negative weather to date, EWC price declines since yearend and
the extended outages at Indian Point Unit 2. For IP2, we have not yet completed our engineering analysis, but based on
information to date, our preliminary estimate is that the extended outage will reduce earnings by approximately $0.20.
This is primarily from lost revenue, but also includes higher refueling outage costs, which we currently estimate to be
around $20 million. The higher outage costs will be amortized over the life of the outage for the bulk of the earnings
effect in 2017.
Looking at the balance of the year, there are additional risks and opportunities that could apply to both Utility, Parent &
Other as well as to Entergy overall. As we have mentioned, we have the potential for higher nuclear spending as we
execute on our nuclear performance improvement plan. And as always, there are potential risks to our sales forecast.
We also see opportunities to mitigate these challenges or provide upside, starting with management of our spending,
some of which began in the first quarter. In addition, as we mentioned in our last quarterly call, there is potential for
income tax items, possibly as early as the second quarter of this year. Considering all these factors, we are affirming
our guidance for the year.

Moving to the longer-term view, slide 11 shows our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other outlook, which is unchanged.
Some of the challenges and opportunities that we've noted for 2016 exist on an ongoing basis, with an added
uncertainty for pension expenses, but also, with the added benefit of efficient regulatory mechanisms.
Our strategy to realize these results remains the same as we focus on making productive investment to benefit
customers, while maintaining competitive rates with timely and predictable investment recovery.
Slide 12 provides EWC's EBITDA outlook assuming market prices as of March 31. One thing to note is the root cause
analysis of the Indian Point 2 bolt issues could prompt an accelerated inspection scheduled for Unit 3 at Indian Point.
This is not reflected in our current estimates and we plan to provide more information once our analysis is complete.
Before closing, I'd like to give you a little more detail on our Analyst Day on June 9 in New York City in Midtown.
We'll talk about what's next for Entergy and the utility growth opportunities before us. We'll also provide some
longer-term five year views and more detail on our nuclear performance improvement plan. Our extended management
team including our new Chief Nuclear Officer, Chris Bakken, will be there to give you an opportunity to talk with them
about their areas of responsibility.
We look forward to seeing you there. And now the Entergy team is available to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rose-Lynn Armstrong from Barclays. Your question,
please.
<Q - Rose-Lynn Armstrong>: Hi. Could you go back to the Indian Point 2 discussion, and just clarify, is the
additional $0.20 of outage-related expenses, is that included in the $4.20 to $4.50 of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted
earnings or is that outside of it? And then separately, could you talk a little bit about where you are in that process, have
you identified the number of bolts that need to be replaced, is equipment onsite, when will the replacements begin, et
cetera, whatever color you can add.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. Good morning, Rose-Lynn, this is Drew, I'll take the first part of the question and I'll
turn it over to Bill. So, first part of the question was, is the $0.20 of IP2 included in the affirmation of the outlook. In
the overall consolidated number, it is included and we do believe there are things that will get us back into the range.
For Utility, Parent & Other, of course that's separate from EWC, so we wouldn't include IP2 within that.
<Q - Rose-Lynn Armstrong>: Right. Fair enough. Yes. Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It is included in the overall guidance range.
<Q - Rose-Lynn Armstrong>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah. As it relates to the number of bolts and the timing of the return of the unit, we are still in
the process of completing the engineering analysis as to the specific number of bolts. However, we do have the
equipment onsite and are in fact replacing bolts as we speak. That was a little bit of a long-lead-time item, but we are in
the process of doing that right now and obviously are working very closely with the NRC so we get concurrence on our
analysis and final repairs.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your question please
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Yeah. Hey, guys. One follow-up in Indian Point and then over to the regulated side. On
Indian Point, on the IP2 issues, is the bulk of that an issue that impacts second quarter of 2016 in terms of that $0.20 or
does this drag throughout 2016 and even into 2017?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's Drew, again. So it's going to be the bulk of it in the second quarter, because most of it, as
I said in my remarks, is net revenue and we are not expecting that plant to come on until near the end of June. So that's
basically the entire quarter is going to be lost from that revenue perspective.
The outage, the refueling outage expenses are going to move across the new fuel cycle and it's a little shorter than it
typically is, it's usually I guess 23 months or so, and now it's going to be probably I guess 20 months. So, it's, I don't
know, $0.07 or so with that, most of that, maybe $0.05 will show up in 2017 as amortization. So, maybe a $0.01 this
year and maybe a $0.01 in 2018.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thank you. And over on the regulated side, you talked a little bit about smart meters,
you've talked a little bit – and it's been awhile since you've done so about natural gas, reserves and rate base. Outside of
adding new generation to the fleet, can you talk a little bit about what other items could have the biggest impact over
the next three years to five years to potential rate base growth and just kind of walk us through high level, where you
see the greatest opportunities that may not actually be in your current CapEx forecast?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, Michael, that's – I guess I was giving you little bit of a teaser of what we wanted to talk a
little bit about at Analyst Day. So, if I let Theo go off on that now, I'll take away that surprise, but the fact of the matter
is, we're in the process of evaluating a lot of that right now, certainly getting the meter technology on to the system is
the first step along with all the back office systems and meter data management systems and the like to go with that. So
in the near term, that's what we're talking about, some of this too will extend out beyond the 2018 timeframe that we're
talking about.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thanks, Leo. Much appreciated.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just curious we could talk a little to what it was that drove the quarter so much higher
than the $1.10 you were speaking to on, I guess, the Q4 call. Yeah, it sounds like weather continued to be mild; were
you not counting on the Arkansas decision perhaps, or just trying to understand what surprised you in that sort of back
half for the quarter?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. This is Drew. So, there were a couple of things that broke our way
in the quarter and some of the things that were determined and some of the things were timing. So, in EWC, there were
some mark-to-market elements that came in about $0.04 of that, and then about $0.03 of volume as we actually ran
better in the quarter before the planned outages took over.
So, we actually were about $0.07, $0.08 ahead at EWC versus our previous expectation. The balance of it was at
Utility, some of it was – or the bulk of the O&M savings that we saw above expectation were in the fossil area. As we
came through the outage season, we actually did much better than we have historically. And then the balance of it, as
you referenced, there was some conservatism built into the Arkansas rate case.

So, that was justified. Right at the very end, we did lose $5 million of comp, but that's spread out differently than we
built the conservatism into our case. Some of those Fukushima and flood barrier costs were not part of our expectations
for the quarter, but they were able to stay in in that final order and then some timing elements were – for the period
between February 24 and April 1 went in our favor, but they were in our overall expectations. So that's more of a
timing shift between periods. So that's really the bulk of those items. So, hopefully, that helps close the gap for you a
little bit.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: That's really helpful. Thank you. And could I, just similar vein, you made a comment
about I think, you're hinting that there could be tax items as early as the second quarter, and you made that comment in
the context of having maintained guidance. Are you maintaining guidance because of that item or you see that more as
an upside?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think, it's a big piece of how we're able to maintain guidance on the Entergy overall. As
you know, on the utilities side, our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other doesn't include taxes or weather. And so, for that
part of the business, we're solidly saying we're right at the midpoint. But, when we go back to the overall consolidated
business, we had the big one-time outage at IP2, we have the negative weather and then of course the prices at EWC.
Those put us down near or below the bottom of our range, but with the expectation that we would get some benefit out
of taxes. Possibly like I said as early as next quarter, we think we're going to get back into the range. So it's too early to
make that call now.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. But those are the moving pieces, directionally. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Wanted to get your view on the commercial and residential low growth numbers that we
saw for the quarter, they were weather-adjusted, fairly weak. Is this something that's just sort of a quarterly fluctuation
or are there drivers that you see there, any color you can provide on that?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Sure, Stephen. This is Theo. I would think when we think about those two particular
classes, we continue to see impacts from energy efficiency, as we've talked about on previous calls both at federal type
programs as well as some of our local energy efficiency programs that we see within our jurisdictions. In terms of what
we expected, I mean, given some of the economic data that we were utilizing to try and forecast sales, we did see some
economic weakening in the first quarter and somewhat expected that.
So while I do agree it was fairly low for the first quarter, it was a little bit below our expectations, but it wasn't
necessarily a big surprise to us. And as we go forward throughout the year, we expect to see that to come back. As we
look at gross state products and the regions that we serve, particularly Louisiana and Texas, we see that starting to kind
of settle out and begin to trend upward, and we think that will help move those growth rates back to a more typical
level. But again, energy efficiency will continue to have an impact on our residential and commercial sectors.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. And can you remind me just as you've thought about guidance for 2016 and
where you're headed, what your expectations are for full year low growth for commercial and residential?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I think as we go forward, we continue to monitor the various variables and inputs
relative to that, and we'll talk more about that at our Analyst Day. But clearly with what we saw in the first quarter,
we're going to continue to monitor what we expect for the remainder of the year and make adjustments as necessary.
But what I'll also say is given where we are as it relates to sales growth, we did consider that in are reaffirming of our
guidance. And so we feel like we'll continue to evaluate it, but feel like we will still from a – as it affects us going
forward it will not take us outside of our guidance range at this point.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your question, please.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Thank you. Hi, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Hey, Praful.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: On the strategic side, given your transition now to become more of a utility pure play, there
clearly are right now M&A opportunities in this space. On the utility side, there are utilities coming out of bankruptcy
potentially. How are you seeing strategically where Entergy should be going and areas that you think from an M&A
perspective, or strategic direction perspective, you would like to go more broadly?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Praful. The main thing to keep in mind is the same three criteria exist today that have
always existed. Anything we do we need to be consistent with the internal plan that we have right now, and as you
know we have a lot of organic growth that is happening because of the modernization of our infrastructure in both
transmission and generation and then some of the things that we've talked about as it relates to new technologies that
we can deploy whether it's the solar RFPs et cetera that I talked about or the advanced metering or what's to come next.
So we've got a significant organic growth opportunity in working through the investment plan, the financing plan and
the regulatory structure around that to make it beneficial to our customers, first and foremost on our mind. So anything
we do would have to be consistent with that objective, or with that strategy. So that's the first screen we go through is
what would help us in that, whether it's cash flow balance sheet, other growth opportunities, technological synergies et
cetera.
Secondly, we would want it to be transactable, something that we know we can have a really good chance of getting
done, both through counterparty engagement, price that makes sense to us on whatever side of the table we would sit
on, and regulatory execution.
And three, it cannot distract us from doing number one. We don't want to have a couple of years of not doing the
organic growth that we have today while we try to do something that's supposed to help us get that done.
So those three criteria continue and to be the way we look at it. As you know, we evaluate this kind of thing on a
regular ongoing basis. If anything comes up, we'll obviously let you know. But we still look at it that way; nothing's
changed in regard to that.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Fair enough. Thank you. And secondly, just on EWC, I saw that you brought down your
guidance for the EBITDA for EWC in 2018. Is that more commodity curves or is there something else that's driving it?
And secondly, as more plants retire, do you expect the O&M per megawatt hour to go up, given there is now less
synergy, given you have a smaller fleet and is there any impact of that flowing into the reduced EBITDA guidance for
2018?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, I'll take – I guess I'll try to answer and then Bill can cover with any color. So it is
primarily energy-driven. Fossil. There is some capacity element that actually is pushing back against that a little bit.
Our capacity price expectations are a little higher in 2017 and 2018 in New York, but it's primarily energy-price-driven.
I don't think there is any big changes in O&M or fueling outage expenses; a little bit obviously some of that too, but not
a whole lot when you're talking about 2018.
And then the second question was ...
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah. On the overhead, we've been looking at that very closely. So, we are implementing a
plan to decrease the associated overhead consistent with the downsizing of EWC. I couldn't tell you at this point in time
exactly where that stands in terms of what may – how that may be split because we run as a fleet. But I can assure that

we've been looking at that very closely and setting up a plan where we will reduce those costs over time commensurate
with the downsizing of the fleet in the Northeast.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. Thank you. And just to clarify, Drew, the underlying gas price that's driving 2018
EBITDA, have you put that out or do you know what that is?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I mean, I think, it's consistent with whatever the market is.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: So I don't know, a little bit below $3.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: A little bit below $3 is correct.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Just a follow-up to your answer to Jon Arnold's question. I think you said that part of the beat for
the quarter was based on some conservatism that was built into the numbers from the Entergy Arkansas recent decision.
Could you just remind me or say one more time what was that amount and when did that benefit begin in the first
quarter?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. So, the effective date of the quarter was February 24. And bills – and I guess bills
went into effect on April 1. So we had modeled it so that we would start collecting revenues on April 1, but the
accounting ultimately allowed us to accrue it during the first quarter. So I think there was a little bit of timing switch
there. That was maybe $0.05. And then... I'm sorry?
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: That was $0.05 from the order date till the end of the quarter, is that right?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. Yes. And then the other big piece was the $0.06 of the regulatory asset that we got
from Fukushima and flood barrier pieces, and that's kind of a one-time deal. That's the bulk of it.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Understood. And then going back to that $0.05 for Arkansas, should we assume a similar
run-rate of conservatism if we pro rata that out that is embedded in the remaining quarters of 2016?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No, no. I think we were expecting to collect that over the remaining quarters. So I don't
think there is going to be any extra sticky – extra opportunity there from the rate case on an annual basis.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Got you. Got you. And then – I'm sorry, go ahead.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No, I was trying to see if that answered your question. Sounds like it did.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Yeah. No, it did. And then I guess in your prepared remarks, you made reference to the
Louisiana Commission's next meeting I guess on April 28th here, and the thought is to kind of narrow the scope of the
dockets. Could you just give a little bit more color on what's your expectations of how they are going to narrow that
scope there?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your question, please.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So just wanted to follow a little bit up on some of the last questions here. As you
transition your portfolio back towards a more regulated outlook, can you comment a bit on the opportunity eventually
to buy yourself out of some of the existing contracts, for instance, Palisades, if that's been an opportunity you've
explored or you had conversations around?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: You do have the – the objective we have is, as is stated in our – in my remarks around strategy
is to reduce the footprint of EWC and we've done that at RISE, Vermont Yankee and told them with FitzPatrick to
follow the plans that aren't supported by the market or that are – no longer fit the portfolio. As far as the operating
plans, you just lump I think Indian Point and Palisades in together. Certainly, concurrently today, they are not in the
same situation necessarily as the other plants as far as being cash flow positive if they are not operating versus cash
flow positive if they are.
Remember, when we made these decisions around those facilities, we looked at three different things. One, what's the
NPV of the facilities, if negative or positive? Two, what's the near-term cash flow burn rate, positive or negative? And
three, how does it change the risk profile of the company. I think we achieved our objectives with all of those,
including the RISE sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in a similar manner, the difference
being obviously the PPA supports the cost structure at Palisades and the market supports cost structure at Indian Point.
As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities outside of the decisions we've already
made, I can't really comment and wouldn't comment on that just because once we start down that path, our strategy or
our policy is to just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we are looking at those in the same way from
an NPV, cash flow, and risk standpoint what are our options with those facilities and we will pick the one that we
believe creates the best value for our stakeholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus whatever alternative
we come, that will be a major driver. If cash flow positive or negative, particularly in the near-term for one of those
alternatives to run – or to run the plant.
And third, is the – does it change the risk profile? And obviously, our view is that making that footprint smaller does
improve the risk profile of the company. And then the last thing we always need to look at is the execution opportunity.
Is it something similar to what I've discussed on the question around M&A. There's a lot of things we could do, but we
have to make sure anything we do is executable, both with the counterparty, our own point of view and through the
regulatory process.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you. As a follow up to a prior question here, just wanted to be a little
explicit. Are you guys expecting to participate and submit a self-build option into the renewable RFP outstanding in
Louisiana?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: We can't comment on that one way or the other, Julien, at this point.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Okay. But perhaps generically, would you be open to participating in generation
opportunities outside of gas?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, we are already – as I mentioned, we are building the 1 megawatt plant with battery
storage here in New Orleans. We built the three facilities in Mississippi. We're not building the plant in Arkansas, but
we are having it supported by our contract for the power out of that. So we already participate in that – in that arena and
we would continue to look at those sorts of things going forward because we think that's a – again, as I said in my
prepared remarks, that's a way for us to continue to add resiliency, a way for us to continue to add good service to our
customers, high reliability, more beneficial environmental footprint, as well as we get the cost right because we do
value the fact that our pricing is lower than the majority of the rest of the companies the United States and we want to
stay there.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Paz from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Hey, David.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Just a couple of quick ones. Why did your 2017 EWC EBITDA outlook remain unchanged from
$510 million? What were the drivers for that?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: The big driver is, we've seen an uplift in LHV pricing, so approximately a couple dollars of
KW month, so that's probably about a $48 million on the positive side. So that's offset some of the commodity – energy
price decrease we've seen.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That's really the main driver.
<Q - David A. Paz>: That's a big one. Okay. And then just on AMI and grid month, are those plans already in your –
were those already in your rate based outlook that you give us at EEI?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Some of the costs associated with the metering is in there, yes.
<Q - David A. Paz>: But the bulk if it is outside that, outside your 2016, 2018 plan?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Correct.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Okay. Great. And then just on the nuclear spending, how should we – how can we think about
what ongoing nuke spend will be going forward at the Utility segment, at EWC or just both? How should we think
about that?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's Drew, and I'll just say that's going to be a big topic at the Analyst Day here in a few
weeks, and we'll try to give you some framework around that. But we're still getting our hand around our performance
improvement plan. And of course, as you know, Chris has just been here for a couple of weeks, so he is getting his
hands around it as well. But I think important thing for us is that at the same time we are doing that we're also looking
for opportunities to mitigate that in the business.

And some of them you've already seen show up, things like insurance rebates or lower interest cost because the interest
rate environment, we have some O&M opportunities that we've found that we've – in the first quarter, like the fossil
outage management and stuff like that. So there are opportunities that we have identified to begin to offset that.
Obviously, we're not done looking for those. But at this point, we think we can manage those costs within the
framework of the expectations that we have for guidance and outlooks right now.
<Q - David A. Paz>: Okay. All right. And are your full year 2016 impacts for ANO and Pilgrim still the same? So in
other words, I think $50 million for ANO and $30 million for Pilgrim?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: They are currently the same. We just got the report – the initial report out I guess on ANO,
and we're looking, as we have mentioned, for the letter from the NRC. Once we get that, we'll have a better idea if
there's any incremental risks associated with ANO. And Pilgrim's inspection, we expect to be some time second half
this year, and we'll have better information then. So as of now, those costs are staying pat.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi. How are you doing?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Paul.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just everything has pretty much been asked and answered. I'm sorry if I missed this, but you
mentioned the generic stuff in Louisiana and what you think might be unfolding there. Do you have any picture at this
point on what might be happening in Texas? Was sort of a similar issue. Or is it just too early?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: The Encore and the REIT assessments?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. And I guess it's doing a little bit more generically as well, right?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Paul, I mean at this point, we may have to get back with you and follow up. I mean, I'm not
sure it's moved forward enough for us to get I think a perspective as to how it may impact us. I mean, we don't see that
having a major impact on us at this point. But again, we will follow up with you if in fact that is different. But again,
it's fairly generic and until we get more specificity relative to that, we don't necessarily see it having an impact on us.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then just, in terms of FitzPatrick, there's constant discussions about New
York coming up with some sort of plan to rescue the nukes and what have you. And I know that you guys have
basically been indicating, at least from what I've read, that it's really too far along. But again, you keep on hearing that
the Governor is hopeful that he's going to be able to keep it open. Is there sort of a point of no return at all in terms of,
have we crossed it already with respect FitzPatrick, or how should we think about that when we keep on hearing that he
wants to do something for the nuclear plants?

<A - Leo P. Denault>: So the first thing I'd say, Paul, is that obviously from an economic standpoint, closure of
FitzPatrick is the right thing to do; and we would have loved for there to be a way around that, if economics could have
been different. For example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York that would include nuclear
plants for several years. And the reason obviously that we'd do that is, one, it's the right thing to do from a public policy
standpoint, it's certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint to
support the market's reliability, the whole nine yards.
And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously these things must take their course in the
regulatory arena, and then in the legislative, regulatory, or the courts, and obviously you can always expect there to be
intervention, if anything that comes up and these things just take a long time to develop. And so right now there is no –
nothing in place.
We don't know if there was something in place what it would be. We don't know – if we knew how it was structured,
what it would provide. We don't know if what it provided would be enough to support the economics of a plant. And
we don't know that the timing of it could ever be done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel,
which then we're committing to several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time.
It's not that we're against any of those proposals on their face, other than I would say that obviously we believe there's a
clean energy standard in New York that includes nuclear it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we commend
them for their efforts, because we think that's the right thing to do or we wouldn't have been proposing it for the last
couple of years. But I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point-of-no-return aspect. It's not in place, we don't
know what it is, we don't know what it would provide, we don't know what the economics would be for it to run its
course.
Again, we get to the point where unfortunately we're likely out of time. So anything that says, we are opposed to a
clean energy standard and the like, we're not; we've been for those along. Again, we do think they should incorporate
all plants in the state. We would be for it all plants in the country actually to be consistent, but right now there is
nothing in place that we could look at that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thank you very much.
