MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please stand by, we are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second
quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation. It's available on our
website. And please, if you could, refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the
presentation.
So starting off on page one, the firm delivered strong performance this quarter, net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of
$1.54, and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.5 billion. The quarter's performance was
characterized by strong underlying fundamentals across each of our businesses, with stable NIM and NII, good growth
in fee drivers as well as strong IB fees, good expense discipline with adjusted expenses flat quarter on quarter at $14.2

billion and an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%, and low levels of charge-offs and core loans up 12% year on year. We
also made significant progress on our balance sheet and we've delivered on our non-operating deposit commitment.
While there were no significant items this quarter, there were some smaller items that are worth calling out. On the
positive side, we had consumer loan loss reserve releases of a little over $300 million as well as a little under $300
million of a benefit in DVA/FVA on wider spreads. Against that, we saw reserve builds across wholesale of $250
million, of which approximately $140 million related to oil and gas, as well as firm-wide legal expense of a little less
than $300 million. If you take those four items and net them, together they contributed zero to net income. So finally,
included in the result is $330 million of a benefit from tax discrete items. If you adjust for all of those, our net income
is strong at $6 billion.
Skipping over page two and on to page three, we continued to make progress against our capital targets, with the firm's
advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio reaching 11%, up 35 basis points quarter on quarter, and standardized fully
phased-in was 11.2%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation along with an overall
reduction to risk-weighted assets, primarily from lower risk across market and counterparty credit as well as some data
enhancements, with loan growth offsetting runoff. We continued to build Tier 1 capital, adding $3.4 billion of preferred
stock this quarter. And we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of net repurchases
and dividends of $0.44 a share. Preferred issuance together with our reduction in average assets drove the firm's SLR to
reach 6%.
For more details on our balance sheet reductions, turn to page four. The last quarter I told you that you should expect us
to make meaningful progress on our balance sheet in this quarter, and we did just that. Year to date, our balance sheet is
down over $120 billion on a spot basis, driven by a reduction of over $100 billion of non-operating deposits across our
wholesale businesses, partially offset by continued growth in consumer deposits. We also saw a $36 billion reduction in
trading assets and secured financing, as we continued to make progress simplifying our balance sheet.
On the previous page, you may have seen that HQLA was down $82 billion this quarter, primarily reflecting those
lower levels of cash. However, the firm remains LCR-compliant given the significant outflow assumptions that was
associated with those deposits. In addition, the reduction in deposits together with strong core loan growth resulted in
an improved loan-to-deposit ratio, up 5% since year end. These balance sheet actions translated to relatively flat NIM,
up two basis points quarter on quarter, and NII. Quarter on quarter, the reduction in cash drove a four basis point
improvement, which was partially offset by lower yields. And as I said, firm NII was flat.
Turning to page five and Consumer & Community Banking, the performance for the combined Consumer businesses
was characterized by sequential revenue growth on stronger fee revenue and positive operating leverage, generating
$2.5 billion of net income, an ROE of 19%, and an overhead ratio of 56%. Revenue of $11 billion was down 4% year
on year, driven by mortgage, but up 3% quarter on quarter on seasonally higher credit and debit sales volume as well as
higher MSR revenue.
Our focus on customer experience continues to drive growth broadly. And we had 19% core loan growth, driven by
mortgage. Also, our active mobile customer base is up 22% to over 21 million customers. And we are the largest and
fastest growing among major U.S. banks, reflecting our strategic objective to have a best-in-class mobile offering. We
remain focused on our commitment to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014 while continuing to
self-fund investments in the business. In the first half of this year, expenses were down approximately $0.5 billion
versus the same period last year, and our head-count down roughly 6,000 year to date.
Moving to Consumer & Business Banking on page six, CBB generated net income of $831 million, flat quarter on
quarter and down 8% year on year, with an ROE of 28%. Net interest income was flat sequentially, with modest spread
compression offset by deposit growth. And NIR was up 7% seasonally and 2% year on year on continued strong client
investment and debit revenue. Expenses were up 1% year on year, largely due to increased legal costs. Excluding these,
expenses were down 2% due to continued improvements in branch efficiency.
We continued to see robust performance across our drivers, with attrition well below industry averages, average deposit
balances up 9% or $41 billion year on year. And we are pleased to see that 30% of this growth is driven by our

investments in Business Banking and CPC and new builds. Client investment assets were a record, up 8% or $16
billion. And in Business Banking, average loan balances were up 6%, with loan originations flat against a record last
year and in a highly competitive environment. Stepping back and looking forward to the second half, our NII is stable
and will increase when rates rise. Non-interest revenue is growing solidly and expenses will decrease, so we expect
positive operating leverage.
Mortgage Banking on page seven, mortgage net income was $584 million for the quarter. Originations were $29
billion, up 19% quarter on quarter on seasonal increases in the purchase markets. We continued to execute our strategy
of adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter, and the origination pipeline
continues to look strong. Total revenue increased sequentially, primarily driven by higher MSR revenue. But as you
can see, if you look, our non-interest revenue is down $500 million year on year. We still expect non-interest revenue
to be down about $1 billion for the full year, in line with previous guidance. Expenses of $1.1 billion were down $200
million or 15% year on year and down 9% quarter on quarter despite higher volumes, as we continued to manage down
our costs. On credit, we continued to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies. And as a result, we released
$300 million of NCI reserves this quarter. And you can see our charge-off rate was 21 basis points.
Moving on to page eight, Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto, overall net income of $1.1 billion up 30% year on year
and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year on year on card sales volume and auto loan and lease
growth, partially offset by spread compression. The card revenue rate for the quarter at 12.4% was up quarter on
quarter seasonally. Expense was down 4% year on year, driven by lower legal expense, with the recent settlement
regarding debt sale and collection practices having previously been reserved. And in card, we saw core loan growth of
3% and sales growth of 7%, with delinquency rates and charge-offs remaining low.
Commerce Solutions continued to experience strong growth with volumes up 12% year on year, driven by continued
strong spend and the addition of new merchants. We've recently signed several new strategic clients, including
Chevron, Cinemark, Gap Inc., Marriott, and Rite Aid. Together, they represent an incremental 5% to our volume, and
the majority have signed up for ChaseNet. Lastly in Auto, results continued to reflect steady growth in new vehicle
sales and stable used car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 8% year on year, and the pipeline is
healthy.
Moving to page nine and the Corporate & Investment Bank, before I dig into the numbers, we did make some reporting
changes this quarter. If you look at the top of the table, Investment banking fees is now named Investment banking
revenue. And principally this now incorporates the revenue share with the Commercial Bank here in this line rather
than in the Markets revenues where it was previously being reported. Additionally, trade finance revenue, which was
previously reported in Treasury Services, is now being reported in Lending.
So digging into the numbers, the CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $8.7 billion and an ROE of
14%, reflecting a strong result in a mixed environment. In Banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion is up 4% year on year.
This quarter we continued to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.2% wallet share and widening the gap to number
two. We rank number one in fees in North America and EMEA; and gained share, improving to number two in Asia.
Another strong quarter for Advisory, up 17% year on year, as activity levels remained high. We maintained our number
two ranking and grew share by over 100 basis points from last quarter. Equity underwriting fees were down 5% from a
strong prior year for IPOs in EMEA, with lower wallet share as we gave back some of the outsized share gain we had
in the first quarter. This quarter we ranked two globally, with strong performance in the U.S. on acquisition finance and
follow-ons. Debt underwriting up 1%, and we maintained our number one ranking with strength in high-grade, also on
the back of the healthy M&A market. Treasury Services was down 2% year on year on lower net interest income, and
the lending item of $302 million was down 32% year on year, primarily driven by losses on restructured securities.
Given the reporting changes we've made, going forward you should expect for Treasury Services revenues would be
about $875 million plus or minus per quarter and lending approximately $350 million, and that's given the trade finance
transfer.

Moving on to Markets, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 1% year on year, excluding business simplification and the
gain in the prior year on the IPO of Markit, which we previously disclosed, but with strong relative performance in
rates and in equity markets. Fixed income revenue was $2.9 billion, down 10% year on year similarly adjusted. In
macro products, the quarter was dominated by EMEA with a bond sell-off and economic and political uncertainty,
including Greece. This uncertainty slowed the momentum we saw in the first quarter and kept clients on the sidelines in
currencies and emerging markets but drove strong performance in rates. Credit and securitized products were down on
a continuation of general weakness in the markets.
And as I mentioned, equity markets had another strong quarter, up 27% year on year on revenue of $1.6 billion, with
strong performance in all three regions relative to last year and outperformance in Asia, particularly China and Hong
Kong, on the back of client interest first to participate in the rally and later to hedge.
Looking forward, business simplification would drive a 9% decline year on year in third quarter Markets revenues,
with a corresponding decline in expenses. And as I look into the third quarter in analyst models, I see relative to our
Markets results this quarter you have revenues in Markets going up sequentially. We're fully expecting to see normal
seasonal declines in the third quarter Markets revenues.
Securities Service revenues of $1 billion was in line with guidance, up seasonally on the European dividend season.
And moving on to expense, total expense was down 15% year on year at $5.1 billion and an overhead ratio of 59%.
And we successfully executed the expense reduction associated with business simplification and with lower legal
expense. Compensation expense down 4% year on year, comp-to-revenue ratio for the second quarter 30%, flat year on
year.
Moving on to the Commercial Bank, in Commercial Banking the underlying businesses continued to perform well,
with strong loan growth, up $6 billion quarter on quarter, and record end-of-period loan balances, with good credit
fundamentals and low non-performing loans. We also saw continued momentum in IB revenue off of a record last
quarter, which was driven by a large transaction. However, we added $187 million to reserves in the quarter, reflecting
select downgrades including oil and gas. Despite this, BAU credit performance of the portfolio, as I said, remains very
strong. This drove net income of $525 million on revenue of $1.7 billion and an ROE of 14%.
Revenue was flat year on year, driven by continued spread compression in loans and deposits, partially offset by
growth in loans, and flat sequentially despite the record Investment Banking performance in the first quarter. Expenses
were up 4% year on year on increased control related staffing and down slightly quarter on quarter. For the rest of the
year, for each quarter we expect expenses to remain around $720 million.
Loan balances increased 12% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter. C&I loans grew 3% sequentially, in line with the
industry, with middle market growth being somewhat challenged by strong competition, but with more strength in
corporate client banking, driven by short-term financing activity and new facilities for our existing client base. CRE
loans grew 5% and continued to exceed the industry on strong activity in both commercial term lending, which had
record originations in the quarter, and in real estate banking.
Moving on to page 11 and Asset Management, net income of $451 million on revenue of $3.2 billion reflected solid
growth, up 6% year on year and 6% quarter on quarter, driven by continued net long-term inflows, marking the 25th
consecutive quarter at $13 billion, with strength in North America and multi-asset flows; driving record AUM of $1.8
trillion, up 4% year on year, and client assets of $2.4 trillion. In addition, we had record loan balances, which were up
9% year on year.
Expense of $2.4 billion was up 17% year on year, primarily driven by legal expense and to a lesser extent the impact of
moving an asset to held-for-sale. Adjusting for those two items, expense would have been up more in line with revenue
and margins in line with our targets. Lastly, we reported strong investment performance, with 78% of mutual fund
AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.
Turning to page 12 and Corporate, Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of a little over $100 million. And Other
Corporate reported net income of $552 million, which included a benefit from discrete tax items I previously
mentioned.

So on page 13 is our outlook page. Any guidance that I was going to give I've made through the presentation. The page
is here for your reference.
So to wrap up, strong reported and strong underlying results this quarter across our businesses in an environment that
continues to remain somewhat challenging, with double-digit core loan growth, with broad-based strength in our
underlying drivers, and with continued execution and excellent progress against our capital, our balance sheet, and
expense commitments.
So with that, operator, we'll open up the line now for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Great. And your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: My first question is the capital progress has clearly been solid this quarter. Last week,
however, there seems to have been more support in the Fed in terms of including the SIFI surcharge in the CCAR test. I
guess the question is in two parts. One, what do you think the chances are of any or all of the CCAR surcharge – or the
CET1 surcharge – to be included in CCAR? And two, what are the next steps in terms of business model adjustments if
that did pass?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So obviously, we don't have any particular insights. I think the comments you're referring to
were comments about the support for evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of that. And so really it hasn't
changed relative to previous comments. And the door has clearly been left open for that, but we have no further
information. And so far it's evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of the surcharge. So we're just going to have
to I suppose wait and see. Meanwhile, as you know, and by the way, if it happens for us, it would happen for everyone
and we've shown you before, not without good outcome, but we've shown you before that we think that regardless, the
competitive peer set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels. And so if everybody has to
increase their minimum, it's going to be a similar position for everyone.
Meanwhile, we're continuing to execute on everything that we've already told you we're going to do to optimize our
capital. And our commitment is to go firmly within the 4.5% bucket for the surcharge. And if we believe we can do it
and it's economic and it's not going to hurt our clients, we may go further. So look, we'll respond when we see the rules,
and we're not going to stop continuing to do the best we can to optimize our returns based on scarce resources.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Just the second question is you've clearly made also progress in terms of your deposit
mix. As we potentially anticipate a rising rate environment for the back half of the year, given what the regulators have
done in terms of saying okay, here are the good deposits, here are the not-so-good deposits, how should we expect the
pace and magnitude of retail deposit repricing or pass-through if the Fed does raise rates in the second half of this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we actually haven't really changed our point of view since Investor Day and previously
about the fact that we're expecting retail deposit – and there are other people who have slightly different views, but
we're expecting retail deposits to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles given the
competition for good, high-quality, LCR-compliant retail deposits given the advancements in mobile banking, given
the awareness in the general environment around low rates, and the desire to participate in rising rates. So when we
think about our sensitivity and our repricing, we model in an assumption that it's going to be higher, somewhat higher.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I see your Markets revenue are down 1% year over year the way you look at this. But I'm
trying to reconcile that with Jamie's comments two months ago at a New York conference where you said there's
repricing in rates, derivatives, prime brokerage, clearing, and trade finance. I'm guessing it's just risk-off. So can you
shed more light on what type of repricing you're seeing with any specific examples because the transparency for us on
the outside is pretty weak?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So obviously, when you talk about trading, when you have two months to go in a quarter, you
don't know the exact number, and repricing is a complex issue. I'll give you some very specific things and then I'll tell
you why it's hard to figure out exactly how it shows up. Clearing, we've definitely seen people start to charge for
clearing and effectively charge the balance sheet 25 basis points, 50 basis points. It's a small business, so I don't think
it's going to dramatically affect those lines. Prime broker, we've seen a similar type of thing. Repo, it seems that people
are charging pretty much for repo. We need to get a return on it. Exotic derivatives, which are again very small, are
being repriced to I would say full capital and liquidity. Muni credit has probably been repriced a little bit against a
small market.
If you go to credit and trading, so credit we've really not seen any repricing effectively in commercial credit. You've
seen a little bit in mortgage to make up for the extra costs in mortgage. You've seen a little bit in auto got more
aggressive, not less aggressive. Trade finance you've seen a little bit of repricing. And I know these are not all trading
numbers.
What you don't see, Mike, is that in a lot of cases where you may have repriced a little bit, you're also shedding
business so that you have – in other words, you're protecting your margins because AML costs, you're not doing certain
types of business anymore. In FHA the lifetime cost of servicing you've cut back on FHA volumes, et cetera. So you're
protecting your margins but you're actually shrinking your revenues in some cases. That's happening a little bit with
clearing and prime broker and stuff like that. You want your best clients.
In other categories, clients are – like deposits, we haven't seen repricing effectively, I don't think, of non-operating
deposits. On the other hand, some clients are saying let's restructure our relationship that makes more sense for you,
JPMorgan, and they're willing to give you other business which is not credit sensitive, et cetera. So it's a whole amount
of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return on your capital, not necessarily to show revenue
growth on that line item. It's very easy to show revenue growth.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And just one follow-up. When you think...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think most of what you see in trading is just volume related and spread related, et cetera. And
even in trading, spreads are narrow but breadth is also very low, which means spreads get gapped out pretty quickly,
which eventually could be good for trading. So it's unclear...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So when you say a little repricing, is it bigger than a bread box? Are we talking about basis
points or 1% or 5%? What are you talking about here?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I'm talking about basis points, 20 basis points, 15 basis points, 10 basis points. That's all you
need in some of these things to get an adequate return on capital as we currently look at capital.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Question on the deposit shrinkage. You obviously finished the program you
announced at Investor Day. I'm just wondering if you're going to take it further, what the impact on revenues has been.
And do you expect that the full benefit to NIM is already in 2Q or in the 2Q numbers, or we're going to see more
benefit in 3Q from the actions you took?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hey, Betsy. So what I said, and hopefully it was clear, is that we actually exceeded our
commitment. So we actually shrunk our non-operating deposits by more than $100 billion, and not just grew our
consumer deposits but were also able to grow wholesale operating deposits. So we had a good mix shift both in
consumer versus wholesale but also within wholesale. And so we feel really great about that.
There are two priorities after that. The first is protecting that position and making sure that we're able to not have
inflows of those deposits as the industry continues to absorb them. But the second is we will likely look to potentially
push a little farther. But it gets harder and harder to each marginal mix of $5 billion or $10 billion as you get more and
more closely aligned to operating accounts and operating business. And we've always said that we want to do this for
the right reasons, for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that's going to materially harm our clients. So that's the
lense...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And positive results have been made in Level 3 assets, derivative receivables, certain balance
sheet items, RWA. So the effort to optimize the balance sheet for G-SIFI, et cetera, is not going to stop. That we're
going to continue to do.
<A - Marianne Lake>: But I don't anticipate us launching another and announcing another program. We've already
done a little better. We'll continue to try and do a little better.
In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now, as you might very well know, because you can see that the
balance is much more on a spot basis than on an average basis. But the equation looking forward will be much the same
math we said at Investor Day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for half a
year, but there would be some expense benefit on FDIC costs, et cetera, so not a very big number. I think that was the
question.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: and the NIM benefit should flow into 3Q as well?
<A - Marianne Lake>: A little bit, yes.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us about the timing of
your expense reduction targets in the Consumer & Investment Bank. Specifically, if you hit the $57 billion in adjusted
expenses for 2015, how much of the ultimate cost saves does that $57 billion target for this year incorporate? How
much would you have achieved already in 2015, and any thoughts on the trajectory for remaining saves after this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So let me do this in two parts. I'm going to start with the consumer businesses, where the
commitment is actually a couple of years old and we're well, well on our way to delivering against that, the
commitment of $2 billion in 2017 versus 2014. It's not exactly linear but you can consider it to flow through time. And
if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year, our expenses
are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion, so that gives you a sense how we're tracking.
On the CIB, obviously the commitment is somewhat newer, at Investor Day this year $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014.
I would characterize that in two parts. $1.5 billion is business simplification. The majority is business simplification,
not all, but the majority will come out of our run rate in 2015, and you've already seen that in the first and second

quarter when you've seen the $300 million – $400 million expense reductions in each of the quarters on business
simplification. The other $1.3 billion, which is all the reductions in technology and operations and head-count, is going
to be things we're working on actively. We have programs, we have people, but it's going to be more of a 2016 and
2017 benefit. So if I were to look at the first half of 2015 versus the first half of 2014, take the $500 million in
consumer and business simplification in the CIB space, that's probably the right way to size it, about a quarter so far
this year.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: A quarter of the total?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up is on RWA. Any update to your year-end RWA
targets and thoughts about how we should think about potential RWA levels longer term?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So advanced RWA is down $36 billion – $37 billion, $1.536 trillion. We said a little greater
than $1.5 trillion. We're still on track to be $1.5 trillion or a little greater than $1.5 trillion advanced at the end of the
year. Standardized right now is at $1.515 trillion, so pretty close to $1.5 trillion, again, against the target at the end of
year of $1.55 trillion, so that's a little better. But obviously on the standardized, you have some upward pressure as we
continue to grow those really great loans that we're growing. So if you look to our Investor Day targets, we're still
hoping to maintain the discipline around both of those at approximately $1.5 trillion through time.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning. I'm just curious in terms of your core loan growth. You mentioned that
that's up about 12% year over year. Can you give us a sense as to where that's growing the strongest and where you're
seeing – perhaps where you're seeing a bit more weakness within the core loan growth specifically.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, of course. I'll do it in three parts. First of all, it's growing pretty solidly or strongly, so
either in line or in many cases better than the industry across most of the product categories. The one that's growing the
most strongly because of the way we're portfolio-ing loans is mortgage, so that's driving some of that outperformance.
And the one that is most challenging but still growing is the middle market. It's fiercely competitive. Everybody is
chasing that sector. But you can go through the businesses. So we had 6% loan growth, 6% to 8% loan and lease
growth in auto, 6% in business banking, 19% core in consumer, 4% in commercial. So 3% core in card. So it's solid to
strong pretty much across the board, most competitive in middle market and flattered by portfolio and mortgages.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, Marianne. And for my follow-up, I noticed I guess you were quoted in an earlier
meeting today suggesting that there could be further provisions for the oil and gas portfolio. There have been some
media reports prior to this week about regulators potentially looking a bit more carefully at your portfolio as well as a
number of other banks. Can you give us a little more color as to how you're thinking about the potential trends there
and any comment you might want to give in terms of where the regulators are focusing?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So what I said earlier is not inconsistent. It's entirely consistent with what we said last quarter.
We built reserves modestly for oil and gas last quarter on the back of the spring redetermination of borrowing base.
We've built another modest reserve this quarter, and we said we might expect more reserves in the second half of the
year. There's another redetermination cycle in the fall. And I'm not going to say likely but it's possible we'll be
selectively downgrading some clients. None of that is out of our expectations. It's completely normal levels considering
the cycle. And how we think about the credits, we're still very happy, and we're not going to make any comments on
regulators.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: By the way, those reserves do not mean we're going to have losses.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct. So we're reserving for – downgrade doesn't necessarily mean that there are going to be
cash losses.

Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Thanks. Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on that last point. Your commentary
about credit for the second half is in line, $4 billion-plus, and you had $1 billion of charge-offs this quarter again, so on
that point, just one question about where you continue to see underlying improvements. Card obviously is still above
your guidance, but can you give us some thoughts about where any existing improvement can come from?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So credit, charge-offs have been very benign across the wholesale space. They've reverted to
somewhat more normal levels in auto, so I'm not expecting there to be big step changes in the underlying charge-offs in
the wholesale space. We'll continue to see improvements at a slower pace in mortgage, but at 21 basis points we're
getting down there. And card, while it's slightly above 2.6%, above our 2.5%, it's also pretty much getting there. So it's
one of the reasons why we've said expect the second half to look like the first half in terms of order of magnitude and
expect net-net low for long.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: And then to your point about not expecting to be much loss from the energy
provisioning in that we could see energy provisioning, plus this quarter you had a nice $300 million release from the
NCI portfolio, is this a reserve release, and can you talk about your outlook there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so I would say in the non-credit – sorry, just to clarify the comment on oil and gas, we
said they would not necessarily translate into losses. We're not going to predict which ones will or won't.
On the reserves, for non-credit impaired portfolio we are continuing to see improvements in charge-offs as well as
home prices, albeit a little bit more gradually. So I would still expect there to be more reserve releases over the course
of the next 18 months in hundreds of millions of dollars in total, not billions any longer of course. We have $1.8 billion
reserved right now. In the non-credit – in the purchased credit impaired space, clearly that's a life-of-loan model, and so
we'll continue to evaluate that model against parameters that we have and expectations. So that will be what it is at the
time. And in card, we're not expecting any significant reserve actions.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. Maybe we can just ask a question on card fees. That's been an area
where growth in card fees have been pretty flat for a while as you ramp up. Reward spending, we saw a pretty nice
jump quarter over quarter, some of that's seasonal, but it was a little stronger than what we saw the last couple of years.
Are we getting to a point where you're lapping some of these higher reward costs and growth in new accounts and we
should start to see that revenue line track more closely with spending, or is there something unusual this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you're absolutely right. All the underlying phenomena are still there. We're still seeing
spread compression, but we're seeing very strong growth in spend. We aren't quite lapped yet on new accounts going
through the revenue rate. We will eventually be, but it's a good thing to be adding these new accounts that will drive
strong spend in the future. So I would say our near-term guidance is that we're expecting our revenue rate to be at the
lower end of that 12% to 12.5% range. And yes, over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive
strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships, we would expect that to start to edge up.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And on the card loan side, it seemed like you saw a decent uptick this quarter. Are
you starting to get past some of the runoff and seeing more of a core driver?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so we told you we would hope to drive core loan growth in the card space low single
digits, and this quarter it was 3%.

seen really good growth, probably 50% faster than the industry, but we're also signing people with Chase Paymentech
combined with ChaseNet. We're running real volume across it and we're signing up a lot of folks for that, for ChasePay,

Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So first question on capital, I just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about
preferred issuance plans going forward now that you have met the 150 basis point RWA target.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So obviously, we don't give you lots of details on our issuance plans. You're right. One of the
drivers for us to issue in part, not exclusively – as you know, we were Tier 1 leverage constrained in CCAR. So as a
result of issuing this, we not only helped TLAC but we help our CCAR stress capacity. And we're at about 160 spot
RWA. So we're not going to talk about forward issuance, but we've made progress.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And then just a follow-up regarding, Marianne, your comments about the trading
outlook for at least in the near term. Recognizing it's still very early days in the quarter, since the very start we've seen,
or at least we've experienced a number of global shocks. And on the regulatory front we do have the Volcker
implementation deadline which is looming. So taking all those factors into consideration, how should we be thinking
about the near-term trading outlook?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So to start with Volcker, we aren't expecting Volcker to have an impact in the near-term
trading outlook. We've been talking very consistently over an extended period of time about the fact that we've
reshaped our business through time to be compliant in substance and in form with Volcker. And so while that was real
reshaping of the business, the last 18 months have been really focused on getting operationally ready around the
reporting and the metrics, and it's been hard work and we are ready. So I don't expect it to have a direct impact on
near-term trading. Clearly over time, we need to continue to evolve the feedback loop with regulators, but that will be
entirely gradual.
With respect to the trading, it is too early for us to say anything specific about the third quarter, except to say we are, all
other things equal, we would expect to see normal seasonality from the markets definitely. Nothing has changed that
fundamentally wouldn't have us expecting normal seasonality in the third quarter.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time has been – we've
become very consistent. I think in 2014 we had no trading loss days, and even this year there was only a handful of
trading loss days. Obviously, some areas are up and some are down, but our shares are high. I think we're doing a great
job servicing clients. We're adapting all the new rules like 50% of interest rate swaps are on SEFs today, and I think
95% of FX trading by transaction is electronic. You can do a lot of that on your mobile phone or iPad now. So the
business is actually doing fine. The returns on risk are very good. We used to report that but return on VaR are very
good. So it's become a much more stable business that clients need over time.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. And just to add to that, I would say that we also talked about in the period of transition
towards more a normal economy and rising rates you might see some shocks like this. We've weathered both the
EMEA bond sell-off in China well, and it just speaks about the strength of our risk management discipline. And we

Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. You guys had a very decent mortgage banking quarter in the second
quarter with rates going up. We know that the refis have started to come down, but the purchase market has been
stronger I think than people expected in the second quarter. What do you see going into the third and fourth quarter,
especially with the new regulations coming out with the disclosures with TILA-RESPA?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So with respect to – we saw a stronger seasonal purchase market. We actually gained a little
share in the purchase market in the quarter. And refi held up pretty well when you consider the pipelines coming into
the quarter, but we are expecting that to both seasonally in purchase and in refi to fall back down to smaller levels in
the third, seasonally, and no direct impact from the disclosure requirements.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And part of the quarter was the reserve takedown, so don't double count that. That may not be
there next quarter.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the tax – my follow-up question on the tax rate? Should
we be modeling in 28% to 30% going forward? Is that 25% just an outlier?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So the way I think about it is our normal tax rate for the year is 30% plus or minus. Just given
the way tax reserving is, it's usually biased to being fairly conservative. And so as you know, we have seen discrete tax
gains periodically, some of them not insignificant, resulting from completion of settlements and audits with tax
authorities. So not to say that you should necessarily model in directly 30%, but we don't predict or forecast the tax
benefits.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: The equity trading has been very strong the last couple quarters both for you and
for others, assuming it continues the rest of this earnings season. As you step back and think about some of the drivers
there, you mentioned some repricing. We've obviously seen some deepening of some markets, increased volatility. Can
we think about there being potentially a long-term secular recovery in the equities trading, or do you think it's more just
stocks are going up, there's global QE, or too early to tell?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's definitely the latter, and I think it's perhaps a little too early to tell on the former.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, what type of mortgage loans are you adding? Are
these jumbo? Are they fixed rate?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Jumbo.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And I guess are you choosing to add some mortgage loans instead of
securities because you've got a smaller securities book than a lot of peers and it seems like there's capacity to add there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we have a fairly large securities portfolio, and our decisions around that are in part driven
by our overall interest rate risk positioning. But with respect to the mortgages, it's fundamentally a better execution
decision for us. We will portfolio a loan where it makes economic sense to do it relative to distributing it other than
jumbo, where clearly they will always go on our balance sheet.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And if you can put a jumbo on a higher ROE than a Fannie or Freddie, you would do that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And part of the investment portfolio is for liquidity. And obviously because non-operating
deposits are down, portions of that can come down too.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the conversation in fixed income. And I agree with
you, it seems like you weathered the whole Greece and China storm pretty well. The thought on the lack of liquidity in
fixed income markets gets a lot of attention. You guys have the most market share, have the lowest standard deviation
in the business as a liquidity provider. That's a good thing for you. But I'm curious on how you're thinking about
preparing for what seems to be a pretty serious issue and how serious of an issue do you think it is in terms of the
potential disruption?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So there have been a lot of press and reports, including recently on market liquidity, and there
are a number of factors playing into it. It's true that liquidity in some cases has dried up quite quickly when there has
been extreme volatility and it's fed on itself. But the reality is that we talked about the fact that that was likely to be a
phenomenon that happened more frequently as we transitioned to a more normal environment. And we are very
disciplined about how we trade and support our clients, and generally we've been able to weather them very well, as
has generally the community. Not that we know, but we haven't got any horror stories around there being a bond
sell-off or other things this quarter. So I think it's definitely an issue, one that we need to watch, one that has multiple
root causes, and one that we're generally taking in our stride.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And if you take a look at the big picture, as we pointed out, the financial system, like in the
United States banks are much more sound. Trading books have more capital liquidity. The whole system is better off.
So you can't look at one piece and say what will that do. The second is obviously there's less liquidity in the
marketplace, and it's a whole bunch of factors. It's hard to tease out exactly which ones. But trading books have more
capital and more liquidity. I think people are a little worried about a potential Volcker Rule violation, so they're being a
little more cautious. There are obviously structural changes in electronic trading, HFT, and each business is slightly
different. So I wouldn't say everyone is affected exactly the same.
It's also true that the system is pretty resilient to what happened with currencies and Treasury, and that's a good sign. I
think what we are going to be really cautious about is when markets aren't that good. So JPMorgan is fine. We're not
talking about whether JPMorgan is going to have a hard time with liquidity. We are not. The question I really would
have is when markets are tough, will there be a feedback from these violent markets? Will it be more violent or less
violent? Someone was quoted as saying markets always pull back when there are tough times, and that is true. The
question is will it be harder or worse, will it feed back into the real economy. It's not will there be lack of liquidity.
During the crisis, there were two market makers out there, and we were one of them. And so you need them a little bit.
But it doesn't stop markets from gapping out. So we're not saying it's a terrible thing. Just be very cautious about it, and
we are always trying to be very cautious.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Speaking of cautious, the last one I have is on living wills. I know we have a little bit of time
before we hear anything. But if you look at the comments from the previous year, what they wanted you all to address,
it seems like there was a massive amount of progress made. I'm not sure what you can tell us, but I'm curious of your
thoughts on progress made and then maybe timing on when we might hear the regulators' thoughts.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I can tell you that obviously we took the feedback from the regulators as the industry did
exactly as you would expect, entirely seriously, put loads of resources and effort to bear in making as much progress as
we thought was humanly possible over the course of the period. And we feel that we made very, very significant – I
would agree with you. The industry, but JPMorgan specifically, made very, very significant progress in addressing the
feedback between getting it and the July submission date. And obviously, we feel like we have a credible plan. That's
not to say that we won't continue in some of our plans, and you saw it in some others' disclosures. We're going to
continue to work very hard at simplifying our legal entity structure over the next few years and interconnectedness and
operational resiliency and all the things – and reporting readiness, all the things that are going to make it even better. So
we think we made very, very significant progress. We think our plan is credible. We don't know exactly when we'll get
feedback, probably in the fall.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And we respond to every single thing regulators raise with huge resources to meet their needs.
And it will probably be iterative over time. They'll make more demands this year, et cetera. I think it's a 50-page public
part that you can actually read and it shows you. That's a 50-page summary of I think a 200,000-page detailed report.

Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning. Marianne, you mentioned a couple times about the
competitiveness in the middle market lending space. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing, whether it's
underwriting standards, and what kind of product type in the middle market that is most competitive?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Look, it's very broadly competitive, and we compete obviously with big banks, regional banks,
and non-banks. And it's not that we are losing loans and deals most often on price. It's normally on size of holds or
non-banks taking whole deals or on structures. But it's very, very competitive, and everybody likes the sector for
growth. And everybody likes – so everybody's trying to make progress, and we're being very, very disciplined. And as
a result of that, slightly lower growth than the industry average. And you might not want us...
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: ...to always grow at the industry average. You want us...
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Right.
<A - Marianne Lake>: ...to hold true to discipline.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And remember, we look at the whole relationship side. I don't have the exact number, but if you
look at middle market relationships, I think something like half, maybe even a little bit less of the revenues are from
lending.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You guys have made great progress with the penetration of the mobile banking app that
you've created as well as online banking. And you showed us that your branch count is down over 100 branches on a
year-over-year basis. What do you see for the branches as you go forward? Is that trend line likely to continue as you
continue with the increased penetration from the mobile app?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The way I would characterize it is we had a period of time following the WaMu merger where
we were in new markets and we didn't have the right distribution footprint where we were building. We said about a
year and a half ago that we felt like we had the right footprint as a macro matter of about 5,600 branches, and that now
we're around perfecting that, which is about consolidating certain branches where it makes sense, building new ones

where it makes sense, consolidating them together where it makes sense.
So you would see, I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years, and that's
probably still the right way to look at it. But it's really perfecting the network, moving branches to the areas we like
where there's a high density of affluence, and then as you know, really looking at the nature of branches; so the
footprint, the way we're using them, the way we're staffing them importantly, moving them to more advice and less
transaction, more automation, so definitely responsive to the evolution in customer preferences.
And mobile and online is not only a fantastic customer experience, evidenced in our experience sat, but it's also a lower
cost to serve. So we're also improving the profitability of the very highly transactional customers. So I think Gordon
[Smith] used the word omni-channel. We have a place for everything in our suite, and branches are very important.
And we're just going to be evolving them to continue to meet customer needs.

Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Hi. I was just curious about the reduction of the non-operating deposits. And I
would have expected that to come mainly out of the Corporate & Investment Bank. But when you look at the
disclosures on your average asset level, it's essentially been $850 billion plus/minus each of the last five quarters. So
where is the shrink really happening, or how do we see it?
<A - Marianne Lake>: In the non-operating deposits within the wholesale deposits, the majority is the CIB, but not
quite two-thirds.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The Commercial Bank.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And then you've got the Commercial Bank and you've got a little bit in Asset Management. So
it is the majority of the number, but there are still sizable numbers, particularly in the Commercial Bank in the financial
institutions space. And then when you look at our overall balance sheet, you see cash going down because of the
deposits. You see securities going down but strong loan growth offsetting, and then small reductions in trading and
secured financing.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: But when I look at total assets in the CIB, it's $845 billion this quarter versus $846
billion last year. It just doesn't look like a whole bunch came out of there. It looks like it all came out of the...

<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: If you go linked quarter, it's $865 billion to $845 billion. I'm just curious. It doesn't
seem to mesh up to...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're adding more operating deposits too.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we talked about the deposit reduction is overachieving in non-op and improving mix in
operating. So trust me, and I'm not looking at what you're looking at, so I do trust you. But trust me that 60% of it is
CIB.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay. No, I mean where you see it in your public disclosures, it all looks like it's
coming out of Corporate & Other, which is down more than $100 billion linked quarter. So I was just curious how it all
works because it didn't...

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Hi, good morning. Just following up on the Markets discussion, I'm curious
whether or not you've seen some of the drama around Greece impact M&A discussions in Europe this quarter, and
maybe an update on the IB Bank backlog at this point.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The M&A, we don't think Greece has affected the M&A dialogue very much because it's been
very active pretty much around the world. And when I say around the world, there are also European companies going
to America and American companies going to Europe, et cetera, and those conversations continue.
<A - Marianne Lake>: There's a lot to Europe, yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A lot to Europe, yes, so Greece had no real effect on that. Remember, Greece is a very, very
small percent of the Eurozone in total, so economically it's not a driving factor for most of the companies there.
Psychologically, maybe it's going to affect some people, but I don't see why a company that has its own ambitions is
going to change them because of Greece.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I would just, with respect to the backlog, I would say it's very good.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We did see a tremendous amount of something that we've almost never seen before of American
companies financing in euro because it's cheaper to do that even if you swap back to dollars, so you saw a lot of
American companies going to Europe to do that.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, thanks for that. And then on Securities Services, I know that you all
highlighted that it's up quarter over quarter on the seasonal strength for the dividend season, but it was down year over
year. Can you help us reconcile the year-over-year decline?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think if you go back to last quarter, Brennan, and take a look at the remarks from last quarter,
we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business that drove a
reduction, but just a classification issue. And then in addition, we did lose a large client at the end of last year, and that
is having an impact. So I think if you go back and look at the second quarter, hopefully that will make it clear.
And so the guidance when we made that presentational change, and obviously we talked about the client exit a few
quarters ago, the guidance was, given those, we would expect the revenues to run between $950 million seasonally, and
this is obviously a strong season and therefore it's at between $950 million and $1 billion seasonally, and therefore it's
at the $1 billion.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines, which we don't normally do, on Treasury
Services, Investor Services, and expenses in the Commercial Bank because a lot of you have your models wrong. And

Sarah [Youngwood] finds it very frustrating that she can't get it corrected quarter after quarter. So we said here is the
number that is actually our best guess, so please put it in your third and fourth quarter models. And mortgage revenue is
another one which has been ongoing for us. What's the other one? We should get it on the table, whatever it is.

Your next question is from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. Jamie, you made a comment about attacking new markets, and that tags on
to what I was going to ask, which is whether there are any of the old WaMu markets where you've not been able to
expand as aggressively as you've wanted to and that you might be thinking about exiting, so I'm just wondering. Can
you just tell us how you feel about individual markets right now?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, Nancy, it's really important. When we talk about these numbers, by the way, RWA and
branches, we are not making commitments to anybody. That's our best guess knowing what we know today, but we
reserve the right to change that on a moment's notice for whatever reason that makes sense to the company and clients.
And so branches, it is very important that you look at branches city by city and do you have the right footprint. So if
you remember the old A&P, which never changed its locations and it never changed its sizes, and it failed.
So any retail business should always be adding in new communities, subtracting in some, having the branches adjust to
the new reality, whether it's getting bigger or getting smaller. In our case it was getting smaller. But we're not getting
smaller because we're guessing at this stuff. We're getting smaller because there's less need for operations in branches
now, and people are doing far more on mobile phones like that.
So we actually do it city by city. We don't set an overall guideline and say you have to do X, Y, or Z. It's city by city.
And so for the most part in the WaMu footprint, I think Florida and California for the most part, city by city we went in
and added what we thought we should have. WaMu, remember we also added on top of that small business, private
banking, some middle market, other businesses that WaMu wasn't even in. And those are part of the expansion of those
businesses too. And so when I said a new city, I'm talking about what we've never really done. I was talking about way
back on Bank One when we stopped and did the merger of JPMorgan is going into a city de novo that we've never been
in, and there you've got to look at how many branches you're going to open, how long it's going to take. So we do want
to do one of those, and it will have nothing to do with WaMu because those are places that WaMu wasn't.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, another geographic question. I get that Greece is not that important to the Eurozone,
and the events of the past couple weeks seem to have been a lot of theater frankly. But the events in China in the last
couple of weeks have been somewhat worrisome. So have your plans for China changed at all given what seems to be a
retreat from open markets there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No, I don't think there has been a retreat from open markets there either. So remember, we've
always said about China, you've got to look and plan for the long run, which we do in all businesses. So McKinsey has
a report that shows that they've been having 25% of some of the Fortune 1000 in – I forgot if it was 10 or 12 years,
enormous growth in their companies. Their companies are going overseas. Their companies are doing more M&A. We
did that one unique transaction where ChemChina bought Pirelli in Italy. Obviously, when we have a unique network,
we can help a Chinese company and an Italian company at the same time. So we're building there for the long run.
As a risk management tool, we've always said that the way we treat that is we will be prepared for very tough times.
And I think it's a mistake not to grow because you're going to have tough times. I've never seen an economy that didn't
have tough times. So if you went back to United States when J.P. Morgan was building JPMorgan back in 1850 and
1860, every single time that you panicked because America had a recession, there would be no JPMorgan. So we're not
going to change. What we've seen with the officials in China is that they are very responsive to changes. And you can
argue whether they should have gotten that involved in the stock market. You can't manipulate stock markets.
But they were very responsive to lending. They've changed their reserve policies, their RMB policies, the QFII policies,
the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect. Not everything they do is going to work, but they still seem very committed to more

and more market reform, more and more of taking SOE, rationalization of SOEs and then taking them public so there's
some market discipline there, creating more of a consumer society. And what we've always said and I think they have
the wherewithal to meet their short-term objectives and growth, but we expect that they will have bumps in the road.
We expect that, and we're going to look right through that.
And also remember, their market went from $4 trillion of value, so it's a $10 trillion economy. It went from $4 trillion
market value to $10 trillion. Now it's back to $6 trillion. I think those are the numbers. And the American stock market
has done that round trip a couple times itself. And so the American economy is $18 trillion. I think our stock market is
$25 trillion. And so there will still be huge opportunities there. If they ever completely reverse what they're talking
about doing, you'll see it in far more significant ways than them getting involved in the stock market.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, thanks, just a quick follow-up. Marianne, earlier on you were talking about
deposit betas and for a lot of very good reasons expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around.
But could you round out the conversation as to how you're thinking about how your NIM is going to traject in a rising
rate scenario? Because I've got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM
trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, Marianne, you showed a NIM thing that NIM would go back to 2.65% to 2.75%. And
remember, when we say deposit beta, it is by product, and it's got gamma. So the first 25 basis points are different than
the second 25 basis points and different than the third 25 basis points, and it's a pretty intensive analysis to try to get it
accurate. That's what we're trying to do. And it's all in that number that was presented, and we don't think that's
changed dramatically. As Marianne said, we are assuming that whatever happened the last cycle, this one will be
worse. In other words, you'll gather less of the benefit from rates going up than we have in the past.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, because the last time rates rose, your NIM didn't move up that much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Listen, there's a unique...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, it's...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's a unique circumstance when you're at zero. There are a lot of things that happen when rates
go to 25 basis points that you will pass very little of that on. And we also see that – we'll see that in money market
funds, we'll see that in some forms of deposits, et cetera. The beta gets much higher as rates go up. If I had to guess, I'd
say we're conservative, not aggressive.

Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Hi, this is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard, just two follow-ups. You had mentioned the
credit downgrades. I believe you'd said oil and gas. Were there any other sectors, and if there were, just some figures on
them?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The credit downgrades included oil and gas, and we called it out just because in total oil and
gas was $140 million of our total net $250 million reserve build.
<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Yes.
<A - Marianne Lake>: But also I said that there were select names, there are a dozen names. So it's not really like
there's another sector, just very discrete names.

<Q - Steven Tu Duong>: Okay, great. Thank you. And just a second follow-up, can you just give us your mortgage
duration and how far you're willing to take it?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No, we're not going to give you that. When you say mortgage duration, obviously we build into
all of our models mortgage duration. And you guys can calculate that yourself by looking at disclosures in the 10-K
that show mortgages at 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, et cetera. And obviously, we can change that at will with our investment
portfolio and things like that. It's all in the NIM already. So obviously, we have negative convexity in our portfolio.

And there are no further questions.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, everyone.
Jamie Dimon
Wait, before you all go, I just want to tell you one of these days I'm not going to come in on this call. I'm not doing it
because I want to avoid it, I don't like it. And obviously, if anything is important or really bad I'm not going to ever try
to avoid bad news here because we like to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, the good, bad, and the ugly. But
Marianne and Sarah do such a good job that I've become unnecessary to be on all of them, and I can obviously go do
other things. So don't be surprised one of these days I don't show up. Don't read anything into it. Thank you for being
here.
