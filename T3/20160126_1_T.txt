Randall L. Stephenson
Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everybody. Before John takes you through the results, I want to take just a
couple of minutes and just reiterate the strategy we're pursuing and that is to be the premier integrated communications
company in the world. And obviously that's a strategy that we are pursuing in every single market segment and it's from
our largest multinational customers to the most price-sensitive consumer.
And when you look at 2015, it was an eventful year where we put together a lot of the pieces that were required to
fulfill this objective. Primarily, we closed on the DIRECTV acquisition and we secured a very deep spectrum footprint
in the government auction, and that's giving us the network capacity for our TV Everywhere plans. And we acquired
two Mexican wireless companies with extensive spectrum holdings and distribution and this gives us access to one of
the very best emerging market economies in the world.
Now we financed the DIRECTV and spectrum purchases at very attractive rates and we did all of this, put it together
and exited 2015 with a very strong balance sheet and our dividend coverage has returned to a level that's very
consistent with our historic norm. As you look at our strategy, the core is getting the basic connectivity element right
because if you want to be an integrated solution provider, it requires more than anything else world-class, high-speed,
secured connectivity. And it can't be just wireless connectivity or broadband to the home or the business, but all
connectivity, wireless, broadband, satellite, VPN and it all has to be integrated.
So for example, TV Everywhere. DIRECTV is really accelerating our introduction of next-generation TV, and the
DIRECTV content agreements combined with our networks, is proving to be a very powerful combination. So, we can
now deliver the best entertainment packages over traditional linear TV or streamed over the Internet to essentially any
mobile device. A couple of weeks ago, we launched a nationwide solution that combines any of our TV entertainment
packages with unlimited mobile data, so our customers can now stream their video without incurring overage charges.
And this is only our first move. You're going to see the offers and the customer experience continue to get better and
better as we move through 2016.
We also launched a number of integrated solutions for businesses. And I think the best example of this is our Network
on Demand service, which lets customers dial their bandwidth up or down literally on demand. And our NetBond
service is also having a lot of success and I think this is a beautiful example of an integrated solution. It gives a
company the capability to securely access information from a mobile device over a VPN into virtually any major cloud
provider, and that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM or salesforce.com. The common thread to all of this is providing
our customers with a seamless integrated experience. And again, the core to making all this happen is the network. And
our LTE network now covers 355 million people and businesses in North America, and we expect to hit the 385 million
mark by the end of this year.
We're continuing to build out our GigaPower footprint and we can now deliver speeds up to one-gig to over 1 million
customer locations in 20 markets and we've announced plans to enter an additional 36 markets. We also continue to
expand our fiber network to more businesses, so we're really feeling good about our networks. And we believe we do
have the most comprehensive capabilities now in the industry. But to compete in today's market, the solutions do have
to be global solutions because at the end of the day, our customers are global. And that global focus is why we're the
leader in serving multinational businesses. In fact, we connect 3.5 million businesses and that includes nearly all the
Fortune 1000 and we do it in almost 200 countries and territories.
We've extended our wireless network into Mexico now and as you're going to see in a few minutes, our growth in
Mexico is exceeding all of our expectations. And also in 2015, we built on our global leadership position in the Internet
of Things. And our IoT solutions are not U.S. solutions, they are global solutions. We invested very early in this space
and it is paying off. We now have over 26 million devices connected to our network. We're also a leader in connected
cars. We added 1 million of them in the fourth quarter and recently we completed a deal with Ford that we believe is
going to connect at least 10 million cars over the next five years.
And finally we're investing aggressively in a network architecture that is going to give us a competitive advantage in
cost. We're driving the industry to software defined networks and I have seen few opportunities over my career to drive

down the cost to deliver service like this. We're also on track to deliver at least $2.5 billion in annual DIRECTV
synergies by 2018, and we continue to invest in spectrum. We began last year by investing $18 billion in the auction to
significantly deepen our spectrum footprint. And as a result, we now have 40 megahertz of fallow spectrum to deploy
over the next few years to support TV Everywhere. But just as important is the impact that such a deep spectrum
footprint will have on our cost to build and operate our networks.
So, as we look out over the next few years, we're convinced the software defined networks combined with the
DIRECTV synergies and our deep spectrum position are going to give us an industry-leading cost structure. And our
objective is really straightforward. We want to move the most traffic at the lowest cost per bit. Today, we think we're a
company with no obvious peer. We have a nationwide TV and wireless footprint. Our IP broadband footprint reaches
nearly 60 million customer locations. We have end-to-end capabilities in enterprise, world-class distribution and a
globally respected brand. And while all these transformative moves were taking place, we executed pretty well in 2015.
If you look at slide five, as you see adjusted EPS growth was solid, our cash flows were way up, margins continued to
expand and consolidated revenue growth was on track. We ended 2015 with 137 million mobility subscribers, 45
million video subscribers, 13 million IP broadband customers and an LTE network that's covering 355 million people.
And we're seeing nice growth across all of our key product categories. In the fourth quarter, we had really solid net
adds at wireless, satellite, video, and IP broadband.
So to wrap it up, strategy is working. We have the critical capabilities we need to execute the strategy. And I'm going to
hand it over to John now and then I'll come back later to give a full-year outlook for what we see in 2016.
So with that, John?
John J. Stephens
Thanks, Randall, and hello, everyone. It's great to have you on the call. Let's start by taking a look at the quarter in our
financial summary on slide six.
We finished the year strong. We had double-digit growth in consolidated revenues, adjusted earnings, and free cash
flow. At the same time, we continue to see margin expansion in every segment of our domestic business. In the fourth
quarter, reported EPS was $0.65 and adjusted EPS was $0.63. That's up more than 12% over last year's fourth quarter.
This included adjustments for merger and integration-related costs and the annual mark-to-market of our benefit plans.
This strong growth comes even with earnings pressure from our Mexico wireless operations and some deferral of
recognition of video revenue.
Consolidated revenues grew to $42.1 billion. That's up more than 22% year-over-year, mostly due to our acquisition of
DIRECTV. That growth comes even with lower equipment sales as customers chose to hold onto their smartphones for
a longer period of time. During the quarter, the company aligned DIRECTV's revenue recognition for new customer
promotional offers to AT&T's practices. The company will now recognize revenues from customers reflecting the
amounts billed over time. Recognition of expenses will not change. The fourth quarter impact of this change resulted in
lower booked revenues by about $300 million and it had a corresponding impact on income, margin and a $0.03 impact
on EPS as well.
Cash flows continue to be a great story. Free cash flow was more than $3 billion in the quarter and nearly $16 billion
for the full year. That brought our free cash flow dividend coverage to about 64% for the year.
Let's take a closer look at our operational highlights starting with Business Solutions on slide seven. The biggest news
here in our Business Solutions segment was our dramatic margin improvement. EBITDA margins improved 360 basis
points year-over-year as cost efficiencies far outpaced equipment revenue declines. Equipment sales were down
year-over-year as we sold fewer handsets and less wireline CPE to our business customers. But higher-margin service
revenues were essentially flat on a constant currency basis, with growing strategic services and wireless services
largely offsetting legacy wireline declines.

Page 4 of 16
We continue to see stabilization in our wireline data revenues. Total data revenues now comprise nearly 60% of
wireline business revenues. Growth in our most advanced data products is keeping pace with declines in legacy data
services. Strategic services revenues grew by more than 10% year-over-year and when you adjust for foreign exchange
pressure, growth was even stronger, coming in at more than 12%.
We serve the total connectivity needs of our customers and more and more that means mobility. Mobility and cloud
solutions are changing the way business gets done and AT&T is delivering this to customers. We're connecting people,
cars, homes, cities, devices, machines and businesses to the Internet and each other. We've established ourselves as the
world leader in IoT. We signed more than 300 new Internet of Things business agreements in 2015 alone. Our recently
announced new connected car agreements with Ford and BMW build on our industry leadership in that category, and
our new Smart Cities and Connected Health initiatives demonstrate how connected devices can help cut costs, grow
revenues, boost efficiency and satisfy customers' needs.
Let's now move to our Entertainment Group results on slide eight. This is our first full quarter reporting with
DIRECTV, and the results reflect the growing revenue and increased profitability that we expected to receive from
combining these operations. Reported revenues for the quarter more than doubled year-over-year, mostly due to the
DTV acquisition, but our U-verse revenues also showed solid growth. We also saw exceptional margin expansion,
which points directly to the benefits of the acquisition.
Our EBITDA margins came in at more than 22%. That's up more than 800 basis points year-over-year. We shifted our
marketing focus to driving satellite net adds, and you can see that in our subscriber results. Satellite net adds were
214,000 with our total video net adds for the quarter down just slightly. We've been really pleased with our growing
flow share with DIRECTV. Year-over-year gross adds have been up every month since the deal was closed, thanks in
large part to our wider distribution. And we are seeing an increase in satellite customers in our wireline footprint,
bundling broadband with their video service. Sales of satellite and IP broadband to new customers are up 60% from the
end of the third quarter this year. That helped drive an increase of more than 190,000 total IP broadband subscribers in
the fourth quarter.
It's still early, but we see a lot more opportunity to use video to drive sales and lower churn for all of our services. Our
new unlimited wireless data for combined wireless and TV customers has been very popular since we introduced it two
weeks ago. We've already had more than half a million wireless subscribers sign up for the unlimited data plan, and TV
net adds are going strong as well. And we expect to launch a variety of new video entertainment packages this year.
These offers definitely add some sizzle to our bundling offers. But the real impact is to build a strong relationship with
our customer base. Our goal is a TV Everywhere experience with broad viewer choice, both inside and outside the
home, that is simple and easy for our customers to use.
AT&T is already a leading provider of online video. Our DIRECTV app already allows live video streaming of more
than 100 different networks. And by the end of the first quarter, we expect to have nearly all of the top 25 cable
networks. We have already seen about a 50% increase in the number of customers using the DTV app since the second
quarter of the year. We are driving an OTT capability with our video services, one that provides great choices at a fair
price, and [ph] as (16:15) importantly, is also a win-win for the content providers in our integrated offerings.
Now let's move to our U.S. mobility results on slide nine. As a reminder, AT&T's domestic mobility operations are
now divided between the Business Solutions and Consumer Wireless segments. For comparison purposes, we're
providing supplemental information for our total U.S. wireless operations here. During the fourth quarter, total net adds
came in strong, with 2.2 million new subscribers and with gains in every customer category. That's the third
consecutive quarter where net adds have exceeded 2 million. Almost 1 million of those net adds were branded, which
includes both postpaid and prepaid, driving positive phone additions in the quarter.
We're putting a lot more focus on branded customers, and with good reason. Cricket has energized the prepaid space
for us. We added more prepaid subscribers than any other carrier in 2015. In fact, we added more subscribers than the
rest of the industry combined. And Cricket churn is coming in at industry-leading levels.

This helped drive an increase of 213,000 branded phone subscribers in the quarter. Compare that with our postpaid
pressure of about 250,000 phones, the vast majority of which were higher-churning feature phones with average
ARPUs at about $35. All the while, three quarters of our Cricket gross adds in the fourth quarter were on rate plans that
were $50 or higher. This points the overall strength of our business and our ability to operate an efficient smart
business in a competitive mature market.
We also continue to grow our high-value smartphone base, adding about 1 million branded smartphone subs during the
quarter. At the same time, we had another strong churn quarter. Total churn was down year-over-year, once again,
thanks to our great networks, our quality offers and our top-notch customer service. Postpaid churn came in at 1.18%
for the quarter, an improvement from the year-ago quarter. And full-year postpaid churn was 1.09%, one of our best
years ever. That's an impressive performance at a time when we focused on higher value subscribers in a heavily
competitive market.
And I need to add a point about the Cricket churn. We have seen improving churn throughout the year even as we shut
down the legacy CDMA network and moved subscribers to our 4G LTE network. Fourth quarter Cricket churn was the
best yet coming in at 3.8% or 170-point improvement over last year's fourth quarter, and about half when you look at
the comparable leap fourth quarter from two years ago. Cricket has become a powerful part of our wireless story and
we are very pleased at how it's performing and we expect it to do even more in 2016.
Wireless margins and ARPU are on slide 10. Our relentless efforts to drive efficiency and move our smartphone
customer base to the no-subsidy model once again drove record wireless EBITDA margins. You can see this clearly in
our operating expenses. While equipment revenues were down more than $700 million, mostly due to the low upgrade
volumes, total cash operating costs were down $1.8 billion, thanks to our sharp focus on cost management and
efficiency. That helped increase EBITDA by nearly $900 million in the quarter and drive our best ever fourth quarter
EBITDA service margin of 43.2%.
We also had our best ever full year service EBITDA margin coming in at 46.7%. By the way, if you exclude regulatory
and insurance fees and service revenues as some of our competitors do, our full year number is about 50%. Total
wireless revenue was impacted by lower smartphone sales, service revenues continued to stabilize. Equipment revenues
also were impacted by increasing number of bring-your-own-device subscribers. We had about 700,000 in the quarter
that includes those who purchase new smartphones through vendor leasing programs or vendor installment programs.
BYOD sales are our lowest-cost subscribers and we're happy to have them. They value our quality network coverage
and reliability as well as great selection of rate plans. Phone-only plus Next ARPU continued to grow at a steady pace,
up 4.6% even with the growing number of BYOD subs. The number of smartphone customers on no-device subsidy
plans continues to expand. More than two-thirds of smartphone subscribers, or nearly 70%, are on no-subsidy plans
with about 46% of that smartphone base on AT&T Next plans.
Now, let's look at our international operations. That information is on slide 11. The wireless team in Mexico is really
getting after it these days. First, we blew through our year-end 4G LTE deployment target by reaching 44 million
POPs. That puts us well on our way to our next benchmark of reaching 75 million POPs by the end of the year, and it
brings our North American LTE coverage to 355 million people, which is more than any other carrier. We also
launched our rebranding to the AT&T name in several areas beginning in markets where we deployed LTE; that
includes Guadalajara and Monterrey with Mexico City slated for April.
And we continue to expand our distribution network. We've added 1,000 new store locations since we acquired these
properties earlier in the year. All of this helped drive strong subscriber growth for the quarter with nearly 600,000 total
net adds with gains in both prepaid and postpaid. Mexico financials continue to reflect our operational investment and
strong subscriber growth. We expect comparable results for the first half of the year and the investment cycle to
continue through 2016.
In Latin America, our DIRECTV operations continued to show solid growth on a local currency basis, but foreign
exchange rates continued to pressure our results. Revenues, ARPUs and margins are all pressured by FX, and are being
hampered by challenging economies across Latin America. Subscriber pressures in Brazil impacted net adds. But even

with all of this, we generated modest positive cash flow from these operations in the quarter. All in all, we feel very
confident that we will be able to create value with this business and with these assets. We are more integrated with the
day-to-day operations, and we have solid local management teams that are adding stability in a very challenging
economic environment.
Now, let's move to the consolidated margins on slide 12. Consolidated margins reflect the overall strength of our
business. Adjusted consolidated income margin came in at 16.8% in the quarter. This was a 230-basis-point
improvement over the year-ago fourth quarter. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 160 basis points higher than a year
ago. Strong fourth quarter results helped drive 130-basis-point improvement in the full-year adjusted operating income
margin. That's a tremendous accomplishment for a company with $146 billion in revenue.
There were several reasons for this improvement. Strong margin expansion in our Entertainment Group and Business
Solutions and our focused sales approach and efficiencies in wireless drove strong Consumer Mobility margin gains as
well. We'll continue our laser focus on cost reductions. We have driven savings through greater efficiencies,
productivity gains, and expense savings. Project Agile continues to build momentum, as do our Digital First initiatives.
We're seeing cycle time reduction and lower call volumes. Software-defined networking will radically reshape not only
our cost, but also the flexibility of our network deployment. Our margin momentum continues to be strong. We're
confident we continue to expand [indiscernible] (25:23) margins and to cut costs to offset pressure while we're in the
investment cycle in Mexico.
Cash flows were outstanding in 2015. Let's take a look on slide 13. We improved our ability to generate cash in 2015,
and our ability to have strong free cash flow, even with strong capital investment. In the fourth quarter, cash from
operations were more than $9 billion, and we've generated more than $35 billion in operating cash flow in 2015.
Capital investment totaled $6.8 billion for the quarter. This includes about $700 million that we spent in Mexico where
we received equipment and are putting it into service in the normal course, but we had financing terms from our
vendors that don't require us to pay for it until the end of 2016 or a little bit later.
For the year we made capital investments of nearly $21 billion. Free cash flow was $3.1 billion. For the full year it was
nearly $16 billion, coming in higher than our increased guidance. We also continue to tap the securitization market to
manage working capital with Next. We received about $900 million in the fourth quarter. When you combine this with
the foregone payments from prior securitizations, the net impact is about $100 million of pressure on cash flow. So
cash flow, in and of itself, was very strong from operations.
In terms of uses of cash, dividends totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and about $10 billion for the year, which gave us
a payout ratio of 64%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.31. We ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and
short-term investments. We're proud of our ability to generate cash. This gives us the financial strength to invest in our
business, reduce debt and return substantial value to our shareholders.
Now I will turn it back to Randall to provide our 2016 outlook.
Randall L. Stephenson
Okay. Thank you, John. Last summer we provided a long-term guidance after we closed the DIRECTV deal. And look,
it really hasn't changed. We're tracking almost exactly on what we told you. And so when you look at 2016, what you
can expect is double-digit consolidated revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single digit range or better,
stable consolidated margins with a solid business plan to improve in each segment, even while we're investing in
Mexico. Capital spending will be in the $22 billion range with our focus on cost efficiencies and SDN creating a
downward bias to that forecast. And we expect our free cash flow dividend payout ratio to be in the 70%s, with a goal
of growing free cash flow this year.
So that kind of wraps it up, and with that John, and Mike and I are glad to stand for questions, so Tony, we'll turn it
back to you.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. John, maybe just comment on the service revenue in overall wireless
should be lapping the big mobile share value push last year, just trying to get a sense for the trajectory on the
year-over-year decline. It looks like it continues to get better; I'm assuming we should expect that throughout the year?
And then secondly in the entertainment segment, I guess looking at sequential margins versus year-over-year it looks
flatter sequentially, but there was the impact of the revenue recognition change just trying to get a sense for what we
should be thinking about with margin trajectory there, maybe particularly as you go in there and get more wireless
rights for content and maybe where those wireless right content costs flow through the model?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Mike. Let me give you a couple of insights there. First, into the service revenues in
wireless, we have to wait and see what 2016 brings, but we're expecting it to improve throughout the year, the
year-over-year trend. We continue to see real optimism in what we're seeing from the customers and demand, so we
expect to see improvement throughout the year in that service revenue. On the entertainment margins, the first point I'd
like to make is the $300 million revenue deferral did impact margins in this quarter. The margins would've been close
to a couple hundred basis points higher if we would've that recognition. That's the first point I wanted to make to you.
Second point, what we'll see is we will see the merger synergy savings starting to show up in margins in 2016. And
specifically, most of the $1.5 billion worth of run rate savings we expect to get to by the end of the year, we'll start
seeing coming through the entertainment group. As we go through the year, we'll see what happens with other
competing interests, but clearly those items are leaving us with the expectation that we will have improving margins in
the entertainment group.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: John, just as you sort of progress on getting more and more mobile rights for content,
how should we think about where those incremental costs for the rights should flow through? Is it entertainment? Or is
it on the mobility side?
<A - John J. Stephens>: I would expect they'd flow through in the entertainment group.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure. Next question?
Operator
Thank you. That will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Two things. First, a follow-up on Mike's question, can you just remind us, John,
what the deferral is and will that impact revenue any further? Or is this sort of the most you'll need to defer? And then
second, Randall, since 2009 you've been known as a bit of an economic savant. Can you give us an idea what you're
seeing from your customers in the U.S., both consumer and enterprise? And do you see any signs of economic
weakness? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Phil, on the revenue deferral, this has to do with one of our major contracts, and a lot of
customers sign up two-year contract. And so previously DTV had recognized it equally over each month of the
contract. We recognize it as we bill it. So we just came to a consistency, brought it to the AT&T methodology. So that
$300 million is not in any way, shape or form lost revenue, it's just deferred, doesn't change our customer contracts,
won't change our cash collection, it's just a deferral. And additionally, we didn't defer any expenses. We continue to

recognize any out-of-pocket expenses with regard to that in the same way we had done before.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Got it. And that's mostly only going to impact 4Q, right?
<A - John J. Stephens>: There will be some further impacts throughout next year. But by the end of next year we'll
get into the situation where the originating piece and the reversing piece of this will be offsetting. But that will take us
through next year.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Got it.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: And, Phil, this is Randall, your economic savant. I've never been called that before.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Exactly.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: So it won't surprise you what we're seeing. We are seeing some softness when you look
at enterprise business on anybody that has anything that touches oil and gas industry. All of those companies are a little
bit defensive right now as you might guess. Also, anybody – the big exporters, people who are exporting who have
exposure to foreign currencies, particularly the strong dollar, we're seeing weakness there. But I will tell you, we are
kind of netted out. Our revenues kind of held their own on the business side because we are taking share. And NetBond
and Network On Demand, we're having a lot of success in the marketplace. And so we're taking share and holding our
own, but we are seeing some softness in those areas. The consumer continues to spend money.
In fact, it was a decent holiday season in light of really aggressive competition, but the consumer continued to spend
money. I might have anticipated – in fact, I did anticipate a little more robust Christmas season, because you're seeing
energy prices at lows we haven't seen in a long time. And you didn't see the step up in consumer spending that you
might have expected in third quarter and fourth quarter. But the consumer did continue to spend.
As we look at 2016, we've built this plan around a 2% GDP growth rate in the U.S. roughly. And there's a lot of science
that goes into that, but you can basically turn around and look at the last few years and see it's been 2%. It's not really
hard to forecast it these days. We've been fairly tight in terms of hitting our estimates for the last few years. What I am
concerned about, I'll be honest with you, is as you look at 2015, there are a lot of things that went the consumers' way
and went the economy's way, not the least of which are energy prices, but even over the last few years, there's been
some benefit from 10 million people being put back to work.
And so as we get to the end of 2015, those benefits that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, as you look
forward, are you going to see those in the future? You know, probably not. And so I made a comment last week that got
picked up that we're assuming 2%. If you ask me to kind of handicap, is there downside, more downside or upside to
that? Probably downside, but it's probably within a tight range of 2% is what our estimate is right now, Phil.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks, Randall.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much. The first question I wanted to ask was around your strategy in the
mobile arena. As you mentioned, Randall, during the prepared remarks, you've unveiled what I assume is the first of
many plans integrating your mobile and video anywhere solutions. How should we think about your approach towards
the competitive landscape going forward in terms of your go to market strategy? I mean, it does seem as though on a
relative basis you probably weren't as promotional as some of your competitors, and would love to hear your thoughts
as we progress through 2016.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah, you bet, Amir. So, we closed DIRECTV on July 24 and immediately put in place
some plans that kind of are the first phase of integration. We dropped the TV capability into our retail stores and have
had nice lifts, as you heard John talk about going through his remarks. And then in January, we did the unlimited data

plan for our TV subscribers.
What you should expect is you're just going to continue to see, as we roll through 2016, capabilities and offers that take
advantage of putting the two together. And the customer experience is going to continue to get better. And you're going
to see offers that we think are unique in the marketplace. I'm not going to get very detailed with you right now, Amir,
because we're still in the process of getting some of the really critical content deals secured. But things are coming
together very nicely, and you're going to see this kind of a phased rollout over the next few days. And, in fact, within
the next 45 days, you'll get your first look at what one of these will look like.
And so stay tuned. But I think it will be an eventful year for the industry as we roll out new and different kind of
capabilities, new and different type programming options for the mobile device, and even new ways to think about how
you price in a mobile-centric environment. So actually I'm very energized; and the further we get into it and work with
our partners on the content side, the more energized I get about it.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much. And then maybe if I can switch gears to the video side. As you
mentioned, it seems as though you continue to benefit from healthy DIRECTV net adds. But on a net basis, if we look
at the total video adds, there's been a bit of a hold back on the U-verse side. How should we think about the opportunity
in the video arena going forward, specifically on how to think about the trajectory of your footprint and potential
subscriber opportunity there? As the integration has progressed, are you on the verge of rolling out more converged
offerings with broadband and video? And how should we think about that opportunity set for you folks?
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah, so, Amir, I'd tell you right now we are early in the process. The sales channel is
just really starting to get their legs underneath them on how to attach satellite and mobility together. This is a new
category. And so we're very, very new in this. And the performance continues to get better and better in the sales
channel. Also, keep in mind that we don't even have the installation workforce up to speed on provisioning this. And so
we're just getting the installation and workforce up. We just had the latest union contract gave us the rights we needed
to push this out across our entire footprint. And so you're going to see us continue to get better and better there as well.
As you pointed out, the satellite adds were strong in the fourth quarter, but U-verse churn offset that. So we're slightly
negative in total. You will see that relationship get better. And we're doing some things to shore up the U-verse base
because we are focused on the satellite product. And so as a result, you're seeing U-verse churn up. We're doing some
things to shore that up. It will improve, not the least of which we did some things on pricing to ensure that we can help
begin to mitigate the U-verse churn. The other thing we did, and it's early, but I think we're going to see some not
inconsequential impacts from this is the unlimited offer for all of our TV customers.
U-verse customers can now step into an unlimited data offer. And this is we think a hugely retentive offer. It's a great
value for our customers to have this type of offer put in front of them. So we think you'll see the U-verse churn get
better. You'll see the subscriber numbers continue to improve as we move through 2016 and the sales channel
improves, the provisioning channel improves. And then some of these offers I talked about, some unique offers that
will be mobile-centric offers and some unique content available, we think those are going to continue to add
momentum to this as well. So bottom line, we think the subscription numbers get better as we go through the course of
the year.

curious if that's factored into the guidance. If you can give us any help on how to think about cash taxes with deferred
bonus depreciation or extended bonus depreciation and anything else that we need to think about like pension that
would be very value-added. Thanks so much.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure. A couple of things. One, with regard to the deferred payment to Mexico, those have
been our plans all along. We continue to work on the cash flow opportunities that we've been doing for a number of
years. So those are all in already. That's not nothing new here. Secondly, with regard to bonus depreciation, as we had
told the community when we first gave our guidance that we were taking that into consideration, assuming that it would
get passed. But we would meet this guidance, even if it didn't get passed. It has gotten passed. The one point I would
make to everyone is that it's now 15 years our bonus depreciation has been in place. And so getting the bonus
depreciation extended for five years and giving us that certainty is really important. But the creation of benefits from
bonus depreciation is now being largely offset by the reversal of prior year's benefits that have been taken by taxpayers.
So it's much more of a balancing item there.
With regard to that pressures on cash flow, do not come from our pension. We have a pension contribution we'll make
this year in about $200 million. But that's already been in the plans. That's the only thing that's required. Our pension
plan is very well-funded. And then we do expect total tax payments to be up this year on a year-over-year basis. But as
you know from our prior-year filings, our tax payments were really modest last year. So we would expect those to go
up. But all in, we feel pretty comfortable about hitting our guidance, and we're certainly working very, very hard to do
better on that guidance.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Okay. And just to make sure I heard it correctly, and maybe I didn't, but I think you
said that this year's CapEx did include some of those deferred payments to Mexico, meaning that you will hit your free
cash flow next year, even though you've already recognized the CapEx early on your CapEx report?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, so, Brett, the way we'll talk about CapEx is like it was this year, that it was $20.7
billion. And we'll have about that 15% of service revenues, which is about – so it gets to be about $22 billion for this
year. That'll be our CapEx. The working capital impact of paying for some of last year's purchases this year is in our
working capital calculations. I think of it separately from my CapEx numbers, but yes, it's already in that guidance and
we won't be adjusting the guidance for that.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Great. Thank you for that color. I appreciate it.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question will come from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - David William Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe this one's for John or Randall. For
the first time in a while we're looking at some reasonably comfortable head room on the balance sheet at 2.3 times
leverage versus I think your kind of historical comfort level limit of 2.5 turns. And for a company of AT&T's size,
that's real money. Obviously we have the 600 megahertz auction coming up. New York Post tells us you're buying
Time Warner. There's obviously a lot of things that could be on the agenda here including just sticking to your
de-leveraging agenda. Could you kind of rank order some of the ways you want to use what headroom appears to be
there relative to the deleveraging priorities? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. With our strong cash flows we're going to continue to invest in that,
which as we've said, keeps this quality up and keep these product offerings moving on. And we feel comfortable about
doing that within that $22 billion range, but we do believe that positions us well. We do think that includes all of our
merger integration activities. We've got a lot of fallow spectrum out there that we bought over the last few years, so
we're in a very good position to be able to operate within those kind of parameters and still provide the highest quality
service.

With regard to the cash that's after we've done that investment we're going to pay our dividends and we're going to
continue to be, if you will, loyal and respectful of our shareholders in accordance with our Board's direction. Third,
we're going to focus on reducing debt levels, but with that as you do that you keep your balance sheet strong, you keep
opportunities available. But that's where we'll be focusing.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Right now I think we've been pretty clear that the next couple of years, we want to get
our debt levels back down to kind of more normal levels for us. We've spiked them a little bit to get the spectrum
bought last year and then also to do the DIRECTV deal. So we're going to spend the next couple of years working the
debt back down before we start talking about different capital allocations in terms of share buyback or anything of any
magnitude.
<Q - David William Barden>: And could we interpret that as being kind of a relative to historical comments of being
willing to bid, for instance, $9 billion in the 600 megahertz auction, would those comments, Randall, suggest that
maybe you're going to take a much more conservative tack as that comes up?
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: We'll see what the auction brings and then how everybody participates. But I mean I
haven't been bashful saying if there's an opportunity to get another 2X10 at that spectrum, we would pursue it. And so
we think we can do that within the guidance John has given here and execute on that. But we'll have to see, David. It's
not yet to us really clear what the spectrum footprints are going to look like, and whether you can piece together truly a
ubiquitous 2X10 type footprint, which is really important to us. To be bringing another band of spectrum into our
operation, it's going to be really important to have a ubiquitous broad footprint.
And so we'll have to look at that, and obviously we're going to have to look at the first net bid that the government has
just issued the RFP on. So there are a lot of ways we'll evaluate the spectrum scenario, but it's reasonable to assume that
we'll be active one place or the other.
<Q - David William Barden>: Got it. Thanks, guys
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research Group. Please go
ahead.
<Q - James M. Ratcliffe>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. First of all just diving a little more into
the DTV integration, any incremental thoughts on sizing what the revenue upside there is? I know it's early but now
that you have, for example, some track record regarding unlimited data and you've been able to share data across the
two operations? And secondly, any incremental thoughts on the status of sponsored data and how you expect to see that
roll out over the course of the year? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: On the DTV integration, the revenue upside, let me try it this way. We're pleased with what
we've seen so far, specifically the unlimited data and the wireless I mentioned. We've 500,000 customers sign up for it
already, so we're real pleased with it. We think there's great opportunities there. The timing of it though is going to give
us reason for some carefulness there for this reason. For example, Randall mentioned the training of our technicians to
do the installs. We're just going through the completion of that now. And that's really going to be more of a second half
of the year where we see how really effective that is. We have seen a lot more bundling of the satellite with broadband.
But we need some more time to make sure that we understand the momentum of that and the progress of that.
Additionally, we're still going through the sales process of training our reps who've never sold broadband, when they
sold satellite before, or who sold broadband but never sold satellite before, and as Randall pointed out, the guys who
sold wireless who have to increase all of their sales activities, whether in stores or in the call centers. So all of this is
going to take some time for us to really get a track record. I will tell you, we're optimistic and pleased with the initial
results. But giving any guidance on the revenue synergies from that perspective is a little premature.

<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: On your question on sponsored data, James, I think it's important to think about what
we have assembled here. And so between DIRECTV and our other media relationship, we think we have the best
premium set of content available to anybody anywhere. And we're getting the rights secured to allow us to begin
delivering this over whatever platform the customer wishes. If the customer wants it on a tablet or a smartphone or on a
TV, and we're getting to the place where we can do that.
Now, if you think about the most premium set of content, whether it be sports programming, whether it be binge-type
programming that has stacking rights and look back capabilities, whether it be movie libraries or whatnot, it's just a
very, very robust set of content that we're piecing together here to be delivered. I think one will just have to assume that
sponsored data would be a critical element on how the customer would take advantage of this. And so we haven't
developed or announced, I should say, we're doing a lot of work right now on how we come to market. We have not
announced any plans. But I think it would be reasonable to assume sponsored data would be a part of how our
customers would take advantage of this kind of content library.
<Q - James M. Ratcliffe>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thanks very much. John, perhaps you could give us some sense of what you're
including in 2016 guidance for realized synergies. And any kind of expectation around what integration costs might be
this year? And then Randall, following up on that content theme, maybe you can update us on the Otter Media and the
joint venture with Chernin. And any perspective on whether you want to get deeper into ownership of content more
broadly? Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Simon, I'd say it this way. By the end of the year, we'd expect to be on a run rate of $1.5
billion, which is going to be about $125 million a month. That's how we think about it. That's how we did our plans.
We certainly don't mean to imply we're at that level in January. I don't want to convey that we're not. I don't expect
that, but we expect it to grow throughout the year. We did have a very good first five months of getting costs aligned
and addressing a lot of the administrative or headquarters, some of the easier costs to start getting out. So we did well
with that, and we're making good progress on the content. And, quite frankly, shifting to a satellite-based customer base
is helping.
But from your question perspective, I would think of it in that way that we're going to hit and hopefully exceed the $1.5
billion run rate, which will be $125 million a month by the kind of December timeframe, fourth quarter timeframe.
With regard to any capital required for those integration costs, that's already included in the $22 billion of capital
guidance. And from the expectation of integration costs, while we have some, we haven't given guidance, I would
suggest to you this way. If you think about what makes up our integration savings, our merger savings, content
negotiation, staffing, supply chain, the costs to do that are not necessarily significant. It's just a matter of getting it done
and doing the business. So I wouldn't expect those types of merger integration costs to be significant. I will tell you
we're still going to have customer-based amortization, trademark, trade names amortization, those kinds of normal
merger integration. We're pretty explicit with those in the details we provide in our filings.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: On the content side, and specifically you asked about Otter Media, that's going well.
We're still early, but as everybody knows, we're partnered with Peter Chernin who I happen to think is probably the
best content talent on the planet and heavily leveraging the Fullscreen acquisition that we did out of Otter Media.
Fullscreen is obviously moving into a subscription model. We're really early to see how that progresses. But we're
using that platform to do a lot of work for developing what I will call mobile centric content, content designed for the
mobile device. And very optimistic about what the opportunities are there in terms of other or broader content
ownership.

There are a number of areas where we have what I'll call proprietary content. We own a number of regional sports
networks. Some of those we acquired through the DIRECTV acquisition. Others we've acquired over the course of the
last year. We also have a lot of what I will call exclusive content, content that is produced by us, everything from the
Dan Patrick Show to a particular network we have on DIRECTV and some series like Kingdom and so forth. And
Simon, you should expect us to continue to engage at that level, and as we have success, you'll see us invest more in the
areas where we have success. But right now I think our plate is full doing full-scale integration of DIRECTV and
bringing it into the mobility channel.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit more on the mobility side about deals with Ford
and so forth? Does that include getting just maybe beyond new cars but also getting into the used dealership networks?
And then on the Mexico side, can you comment on your aspirations for video with those customers there?
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah, so, yeah, the Ford deal is exclusively the cars coming off the manufacturing
floor. And so those are new cars coming out over now and 2020. Like we said, we're expecting 10 million automobiles
to roll off the floor between now and 2020 with our connectivity and just from Ford.
You bring up an interesting point and that is there is a massive used car fleet out there that is not connected. And there's
actually technologies that are now available. I have a sports car, an old sports car, that I now have connected to the
Internet. And it's actually a fairly elegant solution. And so there are some capabilities that we are putting into the
market. In fact, we are selling into the market today to connect the used car fleet that is out on the U.S. roads. And we
think that's important because the average age of a car on the road today is 11 years. So if you really want to grow this
business, you need to tap into the used car fleet and so that's a priority for us, and you'll see us pursue that.
On Mexico, and as it relates to the video opportunity, look, we're fairly convicted that mobile and video are going to be
a category that's very, very relevant in the U.S. And we're early on here in the U.S., but based on early success, we
continue to get more and more convicted that this is going to be an important category. Bringing the two together is
going to be important. And if it's going to be important in the U.S., we think it will be important in other markets. And
Mexico will be no different. As you know, we have a minority share position in the satellite company in Mexico, and
hopefully we'll be able to do some partnering there. But we do think the video combination with mobile is going to be
important in all geographies and all markets.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: At some point does it make sense to take a larger position in that ownership?
<A - John J. Stephens>: I don't know if our partner has any interest in selling that position, so time will tell. We'll just
have to see.

<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks. Just two, if I could. First, management in the past has discussed the investments in
broadband within the wireline footprint over the last few years. Is there a way you can size the footprint where you've
made the upgrades but you're under-penetrated for broadband share? And help us think about the gap you hope to close
given the speed that you are now offering? And if I could just throw in a second question, I was wondering if you could
share some of the segmentations of how you spent capital in 2015, capital expenditures specifically, and how those
allocations might change as you look at the 2016 budget? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, Mike, let me take a shot at this. With regard to our wireline footprint, we have about
60 million IP broadband-enabled customer locations [ph] filled out (58:37) from a consumer side. And we've got about
15 million IP broadband customers today. These are round numbers. The stat profile will give you the details. But with
that you can see that that's where our penetration right now is, about 25%. The key change here is the fact that we now
have a national video product in DIRECTV, a satellite product, and such that we didn't have that before.
So many of our, if you will, broadband-capable locations didn't have a video offering, now they do. And so as we
improve this single truck-roll capability, this sales channel capability, all of that, we expect to grow that share, and we
would expect that it would be a significant improvement over where we're at today.
With regard to the expansion that we're doing now with regard to fiber, we are seeing very good results and the ability
to always have video available with the satellite product is going to prove I think to be very beneficial for us. So we
will expand on that 60 million footprint over the next four years. And we will also get to some of it – some of it will
overlap but we will get to 14 million fiber-enabled. And, quite frankly, there's a likelihood that we may get to more
than that when we're finished. So that's the way to think about that footprint issue.
With regard to the capital spend, you're right, we don't go into great detail on the capital expense because in our
wireline and wireless footprint, [ph] and we're an (60:20) integrated carrier, the spends become overlapping, whether
you're taking high-speed backhaul to a cell site or whether you're shipping wireless traffic or wireline traffic onto an IP
backbone. But from a general perspective in 2015, we spent probably about half of our capital in the wireless area, the
other half in the wireline area in, if you will, the [ph] parent (1:00:48) or the shared services area. I will tell you the
pickup in the fourth quarter in part was due to Mexico and in part was due to the set-top box and the sales opportunities
in DIRECTV. So I'll give you that way to think about it. I think that'll be a kind of a consistent story as we go through
in the coming years.
We are investing at a rapid rate in all of our businesses. The one thing about our wireless business is when you've got
the tower network that we have today, the infrastructure that's been there, and you have the spectrum holdings that we
have today, you can do great things with quality service, or at least our network team can, do great service and continue
to meet all the needs, and you can be pretty effective with your capital spend. It's not a situation where there is an
investment. It's that much of this investment has been made over the last three years through the spectrum purchases,
through the VIP project putting extensive fiber into the ground and backhaul capabilities.
And we're going to continue that, quite frankly, with GigaPower as we put more fiber near other cell sites that we can
then get even better high-quality backhaul. So it's a really integrated process, but needless to say, we continue to be
very proud of the performance and continue to invest there.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: And don't forget software-defined networking continues to push capital requirements
down over the next three years or four years. We think it's going to be significant.
<A - Michael J. Viola>: Tony, we'll take one more question.
Operator
Thank you, sir. And that will come from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups. John, so maybe just on the cash tax rate, can you
give us maybe a little bit more color? I think Verizon said in the high 20% range. I know you've reported tax rate of

35% over the next few years. There's a lot of moving parts, but does kind of mid-20% range look pretty good? And
then a quick follow-up for Randall.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, Tim, we're not getting that specific yet, but let me say it this way, I can completely
understand how Verizon or it might be a similarly situated company could get to that level.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Got you. Randall, you clearly did unprecedented technological change of cloud and with
artificial intelligence and everything else going on, and you've had a lot of your peers slash CapEx and OpEx spending
and Sprint seems like they're really on the road to doing that right now, but we've had a lot of European carriers do the
same thing. I guess the question I get a lot is how much of a focus is it at AT&T? And do you have confidence that you
can kind of see some of these benefits? And I guess maybe in that regard, I know you have Project Agile out there. Any
kind of update on where you are in that process and ability to cut expenses, that would be great. Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yes, so when you think about software-defined networking, as you think about the
merger synergies from DIRECTV, $2.5 billion run rate synergies, you think about all that's going on in just the core
business you call Project Agile, John does, we're really just streamlining a lot of various operations, moving a lot of the
customer interaction at their request to digital. The opportunity is really impressive to continue taking expense out of
the business. I would tell you if you look at just this quarter's results, it ought to give you some degree of comfort in
terms of what's possible, even in a company of our size and our scale, whether it's Business Solutions segment, our
Mobility segment, our Entertainment Group segment, consolidated, I mean it was a clean sweep in terms of taking
margins up. And we weren't taking them up 5 basis points or 10 basis points. The margins really moved up
considerably. And so we feel really good about the path we're on and the momentum we have on the cost side of taking
cost out of the business.
On the capital spending side, look, this is a unique opportunity. We're at a place where a lot of things are converging in
terms of maturity that's going to create some incredible opportunities as we go forward. These ubiquitous high-speed
mobile networks, I mean, they are here and they are ubiquitous, they're low latency, combine that with cloud, combine
that with data analytics capabilities that are available to the masses, right, I mean the world of Big Data is here, and it's
available to everybody. And then sensors, the sensor technology, the ability to actually put in service sensors at
virtually no – I mean the cost is nominal to put these sensors in place. Millions upon millions of these sensors, all of
this, these four elements coming together at one time is a massive opportunity. And people not thinking about how to
take advantage of ubiquitous mobility, high-speed low-latency networks with cloud, with data analytics, with the sensor
technology are going to miss it. And we think we're at a place right now where we have a unique position on bringing
all this together and creating growth. We're going to invest through this cycle.
We're going to invest in video and making sure we can deliver video to our customers. We think that's going to be a
huge opportunity and expanding our footprint into Mexico. I mean all of these are converging we think to give us a
growth platform for the next four years or five years that is unique. So, yes, we're trying to be prudent, our downward
bias on an incremental basis of capital as we continue to emphasize that. We're being more and more efficient with our
capital spend. John pointed out the implications of spectrum. Don't miss this. As you deploy these 2x10 megahertz
blocks of spectrum, the efficiencies it brings to building and operating mobile networks is significant. And we think
we're in a very unique position in that regard too.
So I said in my opening comments and I'll say it again, our intention is to deliver over these networks the most traffic at
the lowest cost per bit to deliver. That's our objective and that's the path we're headed down. So we feel good about
being able to achieve that.
Randall L. Stephenson
So, Tim, thanks for the question. And I also thank everybody for your participation on the call. We're off and running
with the DIRECTV acquisition in Mexico. Those are going well. And we feel good about where we are as a business
and looking forward to 2016. So thank you for your interest.
